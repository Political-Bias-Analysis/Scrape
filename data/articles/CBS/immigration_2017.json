            "article_content": "NEW YORK -- New White House chief of staff John Kelly, in one of his first acts in his new post, called Attorney General Jeff Sessions to reassure him that his position was safe despite the recent onslaught of criticism he has taken from President Trump.  Kelly called Sessions on Saturday to stress that the White House was supportive of his work and wanted him to continue his job, CBS News and AP can report. The people demanded anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about a private conversation. CBS News has confirmed the call occurred.  Kelly, who was appointed to the post the day before, described the president as still miffed at Sessions but did not plan to fire him or hope he would resign.  Mr. Trump has seethed at Sessions, his one-time close ally, since the attorney general recused himself from the probe into Russia's meddling into the 2016 election. The president viewed that decision as disloyal - the most grievous sin in Trump's orbit.  \tThat simmering anger burst to the surface last week. In an unprecedented display of a president publicly criticizing a sitting member of his own Cabinet, \u00a0Mr. Trump unleashed repeated attacks via Twitter.  He called Sessions \"beleaguered\" and \"very weak\" and belittled his decision not to investigate Hillary Clinton. He said he was \"disappointed\" in Sessions and suggested that, had he known he would recuse himself, he never would had offered him the attorney general post. And he dismissed the value in Sessions' early endorsement -- he was the first senator to back Mr. Trump -- while privately musing to aides about firing the attorney general.  \t\"We will see what happens,\" Mr. Trump said of Sessions' future when asked at a news conference last week. \"Time will well. Time will tell.\"  \tMr. Trump is known for openly considering staffing changes without following through. Likewise, Sessions' newfound job security could also be viewed as temporary and subject to the president's whims.  \tThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the conversation. The Department of Justice also did not immediately respond.  \tWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday that \"the president has 100 percent confidence in all members of his Cabinet\" and dismissed talk that Sessions or other Cabinet members could be moved.  Kelly, a retired general, was brought in from the Department of Homeland Secretary to restore some discipline and stability to a chaotic White House. The outreach to Sessions appears to have been a top priority in that effort.  \tDespite Mr. Trump's continuing anger, his allies quickly recognized the danger in attacking Sessions. The longtime Alabama senator was the forefather of many of Mr. Trump's hardline immigration policies and remains very popular among the president's conservative base.  \tSessions and Kelly have also been allies and traveled together to the Mexican border in April to highlight immigration plans when the chief of staff was in his former post as head of homeland security.  \tMoreover, many Republican senators and influential members of the conservative media rushed to the attorney general's defense when Mr. Trump went on the attack last week. They suggested that Sessions has been the most effective member of Mr. Trump's Cabinet delivering on campaign promises, while some White House aides feared that firing Sessions could spark a significant political backlash.  \tInstead, the White House has recently embraced some of Sessions' directives. On Friday, Mr. Trump traveled to Long Island, New York, to tout his administration's efforts to combat the MS-13 gang at the same time Sessions was in El Salvador for events concerning the same violent cartel. Though Mr. Trump did not mention Sessions by name, the attorney general told The Associated Press that he hoped to remain in the post and would serve as long as Mr. Trump wanted him.  \tAnd on Wednesday, senior White House aide Stephen Miller -- a former Sessions staffer who has written most of Mr. Trump's speeches on immigration -- delivered a full-throated case for slashing legal immigration. The proposal is unlikely to become law since it is opposed by several Republican senators, yet it is popular among much of the president's base. ",

            "article_content": "For all things Paris, President Trump's go-to guy is Jim. The way Mr. Trump tells it \u2014 Jim is a friend who loves Paris\u00a0and used to visit every year. Yet when Mr. Trump travels to the city Thursday for his first time as president, it's unlikely that Jim will tag along. Jim doesn't go to Paris anymore. Mr. Trump says that's because the city has been infiltrated by foreign extremists. Whether Jim exists is unclear. Mr. Trump has never given his last name. The White House has not responded to a request for comment about who Jim is or whether he will be on the trip. Mr. Trump repeatedly talked about the enigmatic Jim while on the campaign trail, but his friend didn't receive widespread attention until Trump became president. For Mr. Trump, Jim's story serves as a cautionary tale - a warning that even a place as lovely as Paris can be ruined if leaders are complacent about terrorism. Jim's biggest moment in the spotlight was during a high-profile Trump speech in February at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland. Trump explained that Jim \"loves the City of Lights, he loves Paris. For years, every year during the summer, he would go to Paris. It was automatic, with his wife and his family.\" Mr. Trump one day asked Jim: \"How's Paris doing?\" \"'Paris?\" Jim replied, as relayed by Mr. Trump. \"'I don't go there anymore. Paris is no longer Paris.'\" The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, responded by tweeting a photo of herself with Mickey and Minnie Mouse inviting Mr. Trump \"and his friend Jim\" to France to \"celebrate the dynamism and the spirit of openness of #Paris.\" France's then-Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault also took to Twitter, noting that 3.5 million American tourists had visited France last year. The Jim story highlights differences on immigration between Mr. Trump and major European leaders, including Mr. Trump's host in Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron. Mr. Trump has put immigration at the core of his anti-terrorism strategy. He proposed a Muslim ban\u00a0during the campaign and is fighting in the courts to temporarily bar travelers from six Muslim-majority nations as well as refugees. Macron is an outspoken critic of discriminatory policies against France's Muslim population. He favors strong external European Union borders and he's also called for a united European policy on immigration so that countries like Greece are not disproportionately affected by the influx of refugees. Mr. Trump believes European policies fall short of any credible efforts to protect the public. He has vowed to push forward with a plan to build a wall along America's southern border with Mexico and he advocates for \"extreme vetting\" to \"keep terrorists out.\" Mr. Trump never endorsed Macron's election opponent, far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, but in an interview with The Associated Press, he noted that terrorist attacks in France would \"probably help\" her win since \"she's the strongest on borders and she's the strongest on what's been going on in France.\" Mr. Trump has criticized several European leaders, accusing them of lax counterterrorism policies. He lashed out at London Mayor Sadiq Khan after an attack on London Bridge last month. In a February speech, Mr. Trump denounced Sweden's policies and talked about \"what's happening last night in Sweden.\" Swedish officials sought clarification because there were no known attacks in their country that night. Mr. Trump took to Twitter to explain: \"My statement as to what's happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden.\"",

            "article_content": "Nineteen years ago, Lupita Arreola left Mexico and came to Arizona to live with her sisters and brothers. Fleeing her violent husband, Arreola brought her five children with her. She sold tamales door-to-door so her daughter, Erika, could graduate from Arizona State University, and she has no criminal record.\u00a0  One month ago, she faced deportation back to Mexico.  \"She just got a letter \u2026 asking her to show up to ICE,\" says Arreola's daughter, Erika Andiola. \"And it states that the reason for her to show up is for removal for deportation.\" To avoid deportation, Arreola might have to take refuge in a church. This week on 60 Minutes, correspondent Scott Pelley reports on these types of sanctuaries, as some religious institutions help drive a national protest movement against ICE policies. More than 800 places of worship have volunteered to shelter illegal immigrants who face deportation and their families \u2014 double the number since the 2016 election. They join the more than 600 cities and counties that have declared themselves sanctuaries \u2014 ordering their police not to detain people solely because of their immigration status. Arreola found herself considering sanctuary because of a change in immigration policy. Every year since 2013, ICE gave her an \"order of supervision,\" requiring her to check in annually and, until this point, deferring her deportation. But things have changed with the Trump administration.  Though President Trump says he's prioritizing violent criminal immigrants when it comes to deportation, ICE has begun detaining undocumented people with no criminal records. According to ICE, 11,000 people without criminal records have been detained so far \u2014 twice as many as last year. This isn't Arreola's first brush with deportation. In 2013, immigration officials raided her home and detained her and one of her sons. Her daughter, Erika Andiola, witnessed her being handcuffed and taken from the house, and she immediately uploaded a video to YouTube to explain what happened. In less than 24 hours, Andiola generated a community campaign that ultimately pressured ICE to allow her mother and brother to stay in the country. This time, Arreola is requesting political asylum because it was violence that drove her out of Mexico 19 years ago. The government decided she will have a hearing, but if that fails, refuge in a church is her only option. Andiola, an activist who served as a Latino Outreach Strategist for Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, is also an undocumented immigrant, but she's benefited from Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which offers temporary deportation relief and work authorization to young adults who came to the United States as children. She says the decision to move her mother into a sanctuary church won't be easy. \"They're telling you you have to turn yourself in because that's the law,\" Andiola says. \"And you're basically saying, 'No, I'm not going to do that because it's not just \u2014 because I haven't done anything wrong.\" The video above was edited by Jorge Garcia and Will Croxton.",

            "article_content": "\u00a0Former presidential strategist Steve Bannon doubled down on his criticism of the GOP establishment at a Tuesday night fundraiser for a challenger to Arizona's incumbent Sen. Jeff Flake. Bannon heaped disdain on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other incumbent Republicans, saying they failed President Donald Trump by not backing his agenda and are openly critical of their own president. \"If you saw how they try to rip him apart every day, how they are trying to destroy him every day,\" Bannon said. \"And yes, I'm talking about Mitch McConnell and the Senate Republicans.\" Senate candidate Kelli Ward held a campaign kickoff in Scottsdale, Arizona, headlined by Bannon and talk show host Laura Ingraham. Bannon is promoting a field of primary challengers to take on incumbent Republicans in Congress, especially the Senate. He has said he plans to recruit challengers for every GOP senator standing for re-election next year except Ted Cruz of Texas. \"These people hold you in contempt,\" he said of Washington insiders. Bannon wasn't following the game plan Trump seemed to advocate on Monday, when he said during an appearance with McConnell that he would try to discourage Bannon from going after all Republican senators. \"Some of the people that he may be looking at, I'm going to see if we talk him out of that, because frankly, they're great people,\" Trump said during a joint news conference with McConnell. Arizona's Flake, seeking a second term, has been among the Senate Republicans' most outspoken Trump critics and is being targeted by Ward and the Bannon-backed Great America PAC, which announced Monday it would back her over Flake. Flake isn't letting on that he's overly worried about his re-election chances. \"I've had tough primaries almost every time I've run, mostly because of the position I've taken on immigration,\" he told The Associated Press in an interview after his own Scottsdale fundraiser last week. \"People will say, 'Well I can get to the right of Jeff on immigration.' But we came out all right.\" Flake has another fundraiser set for Thursday hosted by major Arizona donors, including auto dealership magnate Jim Click and Phoenix Suns owner Robert Sarver. The event featuring former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice comes after Sen. Marco Rubio came to back him last week. \"I believe Jeff Flake is as principled a conservative as there is,\" Rubio said in an interview. \"He believes in free enterprise, limited government, a strong America, he believes in the Constitution.\" At least one Republican senator who has been critical of Trump was dismissive of Bannon and his actions. \"He's not on my radar. It's not relevant to what I'm doing,\" said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., who has announced he won't seek re-election. The Bannon-backed group also announced Monday it was supporting retired Marine Kevin Nicholson in Wisconsin over state Sen. Leah Vukmir in the GOP primary to challenge Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat seeking her second term. Nicholson, a former Democrat, is among a list of outsiders Bannon is backing, including Mississippi state Sen. Chris McDaniel, who lost his challenge to Sen. Thad Cochran in 2014. The group backed Roy Moore in his Alabama runoff with Sen. Luther Strange, the preferred candidate of McConnell. Moore defeated Strange. Bannon pointed to that race and to Corker's decision not to seek re-election in his speech before about 500 Ward supporters Tuesday. \"The last couple of days Mitch has been saying, hey you gotta win. Winners make policy, losers go home,\" Bannon said. \"Note to self, Mitch: Big Luther Strange and little Bobby Corker are both going home. The people of Alabama and the people of Tennessee have spoken.\" A key goal of Bannon's is to see McConnell dumped as Senate GOP leader, while also getting the president's agenda, including the dismantling of the 2010 Affordable Care Act and major tax cuts, enacted. A spokesman echoed Nicholson's support for Senate term limits \"including leadership.\" But he declined to say whether the candidate had pledged to Bannon that he would oppose McConnell as majority leader, should he win the primary and beat Baldwin.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- Former President George W. Bush said Monday \u201cwe all need answers\u201d on the extent of contact between President Donald Trump\u2019s team and the Russian government, and didn\u2019t rule out the idea that a special prosecutor could be necessary to lead an investigation. The Republican also defended the media\u2019s role in keeping world leaders in check, noting that \u201cpower can be addictive,\u201d and warned against immigration policies that could alienate Muslims. \u201cI am for an immigration policy that\u2019s welcoming and upholds the law,\u201d Bush told NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show. Bush\u2019s comments came after a prominent Republican in Congress, Rep. Darrell Issa of California, called for a special prosecutor to investigate whether Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election and was in touch with Trump\u2019s top advisers during the campaign. Bush said he would trust Senate Intelligence panel Chairman Richard Burr to decide if a special prosecutor is necessary. But, Bush added, \u201cI think we all need answers ... I\u2019m not sure the right avenue to take. I am sure, though, that that question needs to be answered.\u201d The former president, who is promoting a book of his paintings of wounded veterans, also took issue with Trump\u2019s characterization of the media as an \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d Bush said the U.S. won\u2019t be able to convince authoritarian governments, including Russia, to open up their governments to media scrutiny if U.S. leaders try to discredit their own press. \u201cWe need an independent media to hold people like me to account,\u201d Bush said. \u201cPower can be very addictive, and it can be corrosive. And it\u2019s important for the media to call to account people who abuse their power, whether it be here or elsewhere.\u201d On the issue of immigration and Trump\u2019s recent attempt to ban travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations, Bush warned that if the U.S. freezes out other countries and turns inward, that would only make it more difficult to fight the Islamic State group and other foreign extremists. \u201cI think it\u2019s very hard to fight the war on terrorism if we\u2019re in retreat,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "BEIRUT -- French far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen on Monday called Syrian President Bashar Assad \u201cthe most reassuring solution for France,\u201d a major divergence with her nation\u2019s official policy. Le Pen, head of the anti-immigration National Front, spoke after meetings with Lebanese President Michel Aoun and Prime Minister Saad Hariri. They were among numerous officials, including the Christian Maronite patriarch, that Le Pen was meeting on her two-day visit to Lebanon, a former French protectorate. The trip represented the first major foray into foreign policy for Le Pen, a leading candidate in France\u2019s April 23 and May 7 election. She said she told Hariri that there is \u201cno viable and workable solution\u201d to the Syrian civil war beyond choosing between Assad and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). \u201cI clearly explained that in the political picture the least bad option is the politically realistic. It appears that Bashar al Assad is evidently today the most reassuring solution for France.\u201d Le Pen has made known her preference for Assad in the past - a position that runs counter to the French government\u2019s strong anti-Assad approach - but it carries extra weight being stated while on a foreign visit with a Syrian neighbor, and during unusual meetings with the nation\u2019s top officials. The trip is Le Pen\u2019s first real public foray into foreign policy. Before meeting with the prime minister, Le Pen had a visit with Aoun, the leader of a Christian party allied with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia fighting on the side of Assad. Le Pen said she and Hariri, who has longstanding ties to France, agreed on \u201cthe absolute necessity\u201d for nations wanting to fight the Islamic State group tearing Syria and Iraq apart to come \u201cto the table,\u201d an apparent reference to formal talks. She noted the threat to France of the Islamic State group which has claimed deadly attacks in Paris, Nice and elsewhere, and has lured hundreds of French youths to the war zones in Syria and Iraq. Le Pen said during her meeting with the Lebanese president that the two countries should be \u201cpillars\u201d in organizing the fight against Islamic fundamentalism. Le Pen said earlier that she also discussed the costs of housing refugees with the president. Two top themes of Le Pen\u2019s platform are drastically reducing immigration, and the refugee population, and fighting Islamic extremism. Her National Front party claims Muslim immigration to France boosts terror risks, costs jobs, drains the nation\u2019s treasury and poses a threat to French civilization. Lebanon is home to some 1.2 million Syrian refugees, equivalent to one fourth of its own population. Le Pen was also clearly using her two-day visit to the former French protectorate - and her unusual encounter with a foreign president - to appeal to the thousands of French voters in Lebanon. She was also holding meetings with Foreign Minister Gibran Bassil and Christian Maronite Patriarch Bechara al-Rai and Christian Lebanese politician Samir Geagea. Lebanon\u2019s Christians have long looked to France for security against the Middle East\u2019s turmoil, and President Aoun spent years in exile in France. Le Pen is not the first presidential candidate to travel to Lebanon. She was preceded in January by Emmanuel Macron, a centrist who has moved alongside Le Pen to the top of the polls after conservative candidate Francois Fillon took a dive due to a corruption scandal.",

            "article_content": "There\u2019s a good reason why Super Bowl Sunday is the biggest day of the year for advertisers: It\u2019s the only annual TV event where more than 100 million viewers are eager to watch the commercials.\u00a0 The scrutiny that Super Bowl commercials get raises the stakes for advertisers, which in 2017 are each shelling out an average of $5 million to secure air time during the game. Marketers spend millions more on production, hiring top-notch directors and celebrities, and running promotions leading up to the game, which will air Sunday at 6:30 p.m. ET on Fox.\u00a0 Despite advertisers\u2019 hard work to on their marketing messages -- which typically boil down to \u201cbuy our product\u201d -- this year\u2019s batch of ads may get viewed through an unintentional lens: politics.\u00a0 Super Bowl ads that carry a political message aren\u2019t unheard of, such as 2016\u2019s Bud Light ad with Amy Schumer and Seth Rogen as mock-political candidates. Yet this year\u2019s crop may not be able to sidestep the filter of partisan politics even when their companies are aiming for a lighter, humorous message. That\u2019s because of the Trump administration\u2019s policies on everything from trade to immigration, which affect the businesses of many top Super Bowl marketers.\u00a0 Take Avocados From Mexico, a third-time Super Bowl advertiser, whose message about the health value of avocados appears to be politics-free. Yet given negative rhetoric from President Donald Trump about Mexican trade, including his threat of placing a hefty tariff on Mexican imports, the commercial\u2019s very existence is likely to raise questions from American viewers. \u201cWill they get more attention given that everything that\u2019s happened in the last week, and with some senators commenting on the price of guacamole?\u201d said Carl Marci, chief neuroscientist at Nielsen Consumer Neuroscience. \u201cDoes that create an extra focus on an ad for avocados?\u201d As Marci suggests, the attention may turn into a positive for Avocados From Mexico, although the company noted that its reason for securing time in the game isn\u2019t related to current political debate over Mexican imports.\u00a0 \u201cThose millions and millions of viewers will be watching the game with beer, chips and with guacamole. It\u2019s a perfect day to show our message,\u201d said Avocados From Mexico President Alvaro Luque. He added that the commercial has been in the works for about six months, or well before Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in the November elections. The goal, he said, is \u201cto focus on positiveness and not get distracted by the politics.\u201d It\u2019s unlikely that the commercials that will air on Sunday were designed with a political message in mind, of course. Typically, companies spend months tailoring their game-day messages, which sometimes represent the continuation of a long-running marketing campaign.\u00a0 Hulu will air its first ad for an original series during the Super Bowl with a spot that some may see as politically suggestive, given the Trump administration\u2019s vows to cut contraceptive benefits for women and overturn Roe v. Wade. The spot will advertise \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d a series based on the 1985 Margaret Atwood novel about a dystopian future where women have no rights under an American fundamentalist theocracy.\u00a0 Budweiser (BUD) is another advertiser whose ad may spark a political discussion, given its spot focuses on the challenges and benefits of immigration. Mr. Trump has clamped down on immigration from seven majority Muslim countries, and his administration has created a draft order that would review the country\u2019s H-1B visa program for highly skilled non-U.S. workers.\u00a0 The Budweiser spot functions as a mini-movie about the travails and opportunities of a German immigrant during the 19th century. After a harrowing trip across the ocean, he lands in a crowded U.S. city only to hear cries of \u201cGo back home!\u201d\u00a0 Eventually he finds a kindred spirit in St. Louis, and over a beer, they strike up a friendship and a plan to brew a new type of beer. The immigrant is revealed to be Anheuser-Busch founder Adolphus Busch.\u00a0 Ahead of the commercial\u2019s airing on Sunday, some Trump supporters have already created a boycott in response to the ad with the hashtag #boycottbudweiser. \u201cBudweiser needs to bring the Clydesdales back & keep their politics to themselves!\u201d one user wrote on Twitter.

Research is also indicating that humor helps prod viewers to tweet or talk about ads, which boosts a commercial\u2019s reach far beyond the game-night airing.\u00a0 \u201cAdvertising is trying to engage people so you lay down a memory that influences future behavior,\u201d said Nielsen\u2019s Marci, who is applying neuroscience to consumer receptiveness toward commercial messages. \u201cPeople smiled more at the ads that were tweeted more, and that makes a lot of sense.\u201d Said Marci: \u201cFacial expressions create a social signal, and if an ad generates a smile, that\u2019s something you want to share.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Trump has described \u201cthe media\u201d as the opposition party, repeating the words of Steve Bannon, his chief strategist who managed his November election victory. The White House says Bannon will sit on the National Security Council -- a place usually insulated from politics. It\u2019s a breathtaking rise for someone whose previous job was CEO of a highly controversial, ultra-conservative website.  Soon after\u00a0firing Acting Attorney General Sally Yates last night, President Trump removed the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The White House made it clear Yates was fired for ordering Justice Department lawyers not to defend the president\u2019s controversial temporary travel ban, but no explanation was given for the sudden replacement of ICE\u2019s Daniel Ragsdale. In his first week in office, President Trump signed three executive orders addressing a range of immigration issues, including border security, law enforcement, national security and refugees. All of them related to promises Mr. Trump made repeatedly during his presidential campaign. We look at the actions, what they do, and their impact so far. American diplomats in four majority-Muslim nations have sent cables this week to the State Department warning that U.S. allies fear jihadists will use President Trump\u2019s temporary travel ban on people from seven nations, and all refugees, as a propaganda tool, and that Western installations in the Middle East could face retaliation. President Trump plans to announce his nominee for the Supreme Court tonight at the White House. Sources have confirmed to CBS News that Mr. Trump\u2019s pick has come down to a choice between two judges with very different backgrounds. Both men, however, have one crucial thing in common. We\u2019re learning more about the French-Canadian university student accused of killing and wounding worshipers inside a Quebec City mosque. Six people were killed in the gunman\u2019s attack. Law enforcement sources tell CBS News they believe the man is a right-wing extremist.

            "article_content": "White House chief of staff Reince Priebus defended President Donald Trump\u2019s controversial executive order banning immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, saying it\u2019s intended to protect the country -- and even suggested more countries could be added to the list going forward. \u201cThis is not a Muslim ban,\u201d Priebus told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cAll this is is identifying the seven countries -- and the reason we chose those seven countries is those were the seven countries that both the Congress and the Obama administration identified as being the seven countries that were most identifiable with dangerous terrorism taking place in their country.\u201d Since Mr. Trump signed the executive order on Friday, he\u2019s come under heavy criticism from foreign leaders and U.S. elected officials alike. As visa holders from the affected countries landed at U.S. airports and were detained this weekend, thousands of people protested outside airports like New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy Airport and Dulles Airport in the Washington, D.C. area.  Currently, Mr. Trump\u2019s order applies to citizens of seven countries: Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. However, Priebus said Sunday that the list of countries could grow. \u201cYou can point to other countries that have similar problems like Pakistan and others -- perhaps we need to take it further,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for now, immediate steps, pulling the Band-Aid off, is to do further vetting for people traveling in and out of those countries.\u201d Priebus reiterated that Mr. Trump is merely following through on his campaign promises, and that he\u2019s \u201cnot willing to be wrong\u201d on the issue of immigration. \u201cThis was a promise that President Trump had made and it\u2019s a promise that he\u2019s going to keep,\u201d \u201cAnd he\u2019s not willing to be wrong on this subject -- we need to do our best to be vigilant and protect Americans.\u201d He defended the fact that the order has meant valid green card holders, not just regular visa holders, have been detained as well, saying Customs and Border Patrol has always had \u201cwide discretion\u201d in asking questions of people entering the country. \u201cThe point is, though, valid visas are great but it doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t be subjected to further questioning,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\u201d Asked repeatedly whether the Trump administration consulted with or notified the U.S.\u2019 Arab allies before signing the order, Priebus wouldn\u2019t answer -- but said that notifying too many people beforehand would have tipped off potential terrorists and allowed them to get into the country before the deadline. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to advertise to the world that we\u2019re going to put a stop or at least further vetting on travel in and out of our country from these seven places,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people have suggested ... that maybe we should have given everyone a three-day warning -- well, that would just mean that a terrorist would move up their travel by three days.\u201d Priebus said Mr. Trump\u2019s hour-long phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday was a \u201cpositive call,\u201d but declined to say whether the two men discussed Russian interference in the 2016 election. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into the contents line by line,\u201d he said. \u201c...It was an initial call, it was more of a congratulatory call \u2026 in the end, people should be encouraged by the fact that we\u2019re starting off on a decent footing with leaders around the world, including President Putin.\u201d As for the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, which Mr. Trump authorized in another executive order last week, Priebus said there is \u201cno final conclusion\u201d about how the wall will be paid for. \u201cIt can either be through a tax on goods coming across the border, it could be through tax reform and a formula on import and export taxes and credits, it could be on drug cartels and it could be on people that are coming here illegally and paying fines,\u201d he said. \u201cOr it could be, you know, all of the above. There e is a buffet of options that we have in order to pay for this wall.\u201d Emily Schultheis is a reporter/editor for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "An interview with the president and Fox News\u2019 Bill O\u2019Reilly will air ahead of Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl game.\u00a0 President Trump has chosen Vice President Mike Pence to head up\u00a0a commission investigating unsubstantiated claims of mass voter fraud\u00a0in the 2016 election. The president made the announcement in an interview with Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly that aired Sunday, televised just hours before the Super Bowl sporting event. \u201cI\u2019m going to set up a commission to headed by Vice President Mike Pence and we\u2019re going to look at it very, very carefully,\u201d the president told O\u2019Reilly. Vice President Mike Pence, meanwhile, attended the game in Houston as the guest of Houston Texans owner Robert McNair, but he left before the end of the game. His motorcade arrived at the airport just as James White scored the winning touchdown for the Patriots in overtime, CBS News\u2019 Josh Gross reported from the pool covering Pence. Mr. Trump tweeted today, after the Ninth Circuit rejected his appeal to immediately reinstate the travel ban. Complaining that the judge had \u201cput our country in such peril,\u201d the president tweeted, \u201cIf something \u201chappens blame him and the court system. People pouring in. Bad!\u201d Just cannot  believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad! The president is in Mar-a-Lago for the weekend, the Florida property where he continues to hold weekend meetings. Vice President Mike Pence said Sunday on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that President Donald Trump wasn\u2019t questioning the legitimacy of a federal judge who\u00a0halted his immigration executive order\u00a0when he lambasted the judge on Twitter this weekend -- he was \u201csimply expressing a frustration.\u201d Visa holders from seven majority-Muslim countries who were turned away from the United States due to President Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban are rushing to try again, hoping to make it through a narrow window opened by legal challenges. The federal appeals court in San Francisco denied Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to immediately reinstate the ban early Sunday. For now, it remains blocked by a judge\u2019s temporary restraining order, and federal officials have told their staffs to comply. The\u00a0annual white-tie Red Cross Ball\u00a0was held at Mr. Trump\u2019s Palm Beach estate on Saturday. Mr. Trump and first lady Melania Trump attended the 60th annual Red Cross gala. About 3,000 demonstrators marched near President Donald Trump\u2019s Florida estate to protest his now-blocked executive order temporarily limiting immigration.\u00a0 The Saturday protest began with a rally outside Trump Plaza in West Palm Beach. The march headed two miles to Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort The president weighed in on a\u00a0U.S. judge who imposed a nationwide hold\u00a0on Mr. Trump\u2019s ban on travelers and immigrants from seven countries.\u00a0 In a series of tweets early Saturday, Mr. Trump said the ruling of the \u201cso-called judge\u201d in the case is \u201cridiculous and will be overturned.\u201d He added that some Middle Eastern countries \u201cagree with the ban,\u201d though there is no evidence that any nations support the immigration order. In a phone call with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, President Trump pledged Saturday that the U.S. would work to \u201crestore peace\u201d along the country\u2019s eastern border, where fighting has escalated sharply in recent days between government troops and Russian-backed rebels. The White House released a statement Saturday afternoon saying Mr. Trump had a \u201cvery good call\u201d with Poroshenko earlier in the day.\u00a0 The two addressed \u201ca variety of topics,\u201d according to the readout of the call, including a discussion on what the White House termed \u201cUkraine\u2019s long-running conflict\u00a0with Russia.\u201d\u00a0",

            "article_content": "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Anti-Islam lawmaker Geert Wilders clashed in the Dutch Parliament Tuesday with the foreign minister over U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban for people from seven Muslim nations. Wilders -- seen by many as a Dutch equivalent of Mr. Trump -- paid tribute to the new U.S. leader, saying, \u201cFinally America has a president, finally a country in the West has a president, who not only lives up to his promises but who says \u2018the freedom of my citizens is more important than anything.\u2019\u201d Foreign Minister Bert Koenders hit back. \u201cIf you want to fight terror, then the worst thing you can do is trample human rights,\u201d he said. The heated debate foreshadows what is likely to be a highly charged campaign ahead of national elections on March 15. Wilders\u2019 Party for Freedom, which currently holds 12 seats in Parliament\u2019s lower house, is polling strongly ahead of the vote. Wilders\u2019 party has long advocated banning migration to the Netherlands from Muslim nations and even called on Mr. Trump in a tweet over the weekend to extend his ban to Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 \u201cPresident Trump has, in two weeks, pursued an immigration policy that is more effective than your entire Cabinet for as long as you have existed,\u201d Wilders told Koenders. The Dutch government, meanwhile, has been pushing back at some of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies since he took office. On Tuesday, Koenders also said he was suspending talks with the U.S. about placing American border checks at Amsterdam\u2019s Schiphol Airport. Dutch authorities also updated their official travel advisory for the U.S. to warn of the effects of Mr. Trump\u2019s new policy on Dutch citizens who have dual nationality with one of the seven nations affected. In another move, the government announced on Saturday it is putting 10 million euros ($10.7 million) into an international fund it has launched to finance access to birth control, abortion and sex education for women in developing nations after Mr. Trump cut U.S. funding for such services.",

            "article_content": "BOSTON \u2013 On Tuesday, Massachusetts joined the ACLU lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration. Attorney General Maura Healey calls it \u201charmful, discriminatory and unconstitutional.\u201d Many families have been torn apart, including the family of a boy who was badly burned at a refugee camp, CBS Boston reports. \u201cDilbreen, at the age of about a year and a half, was severely burned,\u201d said Carrie Schuchardt from House of Peace in Ipswich. After a heater exploded in the Iraqi refugee camp where he was sleeping, an aid group got two travel visas and rushed the boy to Shriner\u2019s Hospital in Boston along with his father. After preliminary surgery, his dad returned to their war-ravaged country to be with his wife as she gave birth to Dilbreen\u2019s little brother. It was November 8, an hour before Donald Trump won the election. They named the baby \u201cTrump.\u201d Dilbreen was set for a second surgery this month. His family was set to stay at the Peace House in Ipswich. Then they got the news their visas were suddenly revoked. \u201cSo they are stranded in Iraq,\u201d Schuchardt said. \u201cThe child is here. The need for surgery is pressing.\u201d This comes as Massachusetts\u2019 top state prosecutor\u00a0files a lawsuit\u00a0challenging the president\u2019s executive order temporary halting travel from Iraq and six other majority-Muslim countries. \u201cIt threatens the vitality, the livelihood, the lifeblood that drives so much of Massachusetts,\u201d Attorney General Maura Healey said Tuesday. While Healey\u2019s suit would protect immigrants and visa holders already in the United States, it\u2019s unclear if it would help Dilbreen, his parents, or little brother named after Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic, possibly humorous, but it\u2019s also in a way very meaningful because perhaps that child can redeem that name Trump,\u201d Schuchardt said. Dilbreen is staying with a family in Michigan. He has surgery scheduled for Feb. 5 and attorneys are trying to get his family special waivers.",

            "article_content": "President Trump released a long list of items on the campaign trail that he promised to \u201cpursue\u201d on his first day in office, but it\u2019s been four days since his inauguration and he hasn\u2019t accomplished much of what\u2019s on that list yet.  As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump vowed that on day one he would begin work on a physical wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, seek term limits on members of Congress, look to institute lobbying bans on former lawmakers, their staffs and former executive branch officials -- and begin suspending immigration from terror-prone regions, among many other priorities. None of these measures have yet been announced by Mr. Trump, and on some, there is little indication that his administration has pursued them in a tangible way.\u00a0 There has been progress on some promises, though. Within hours of being sworn in last Friday, Mr. Trump issued his first executive order, directing government agencies to phase out as many components of Obamacare as possible as lawmakers work on the initial process of dismantling former President Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law.  During the election, Mr. Trump said he would ask Congress to immediately deliver a full repeal of Obamacare on his first day in office\u00a0during a special session. No special session was held, and lawmakers have only just begun the process to develop that legislation, which would only produce a partial repeal of the program. On Saturday, his first full day in office, Mr. Trump didn\u2019t appear to act on any of his campaign promises and instead attended a prayer service at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. and visited CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia. The president, however, continued to take executive actions on Monday by signing presidential memoranda that withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiated under President Obama and imposing a hiring freeze on federal civilian employees, excluding military personnel -- thus completing two of his promises. \u00a0 On Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump signed executive orders to advance the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which was rejected by the Obama administration, \u00a0and the Dakota Access oil pipeline. The Army Corps of Engineers announced late last year that the Dakota pipeline would have to be rerouted, after the Standing Rock Sioux tribe said the pipeline interfered with their drinking water, leading to massive protests.\u00a0 At the first official White House press briefing on Monday, press secretary Sean Spicer faced a barrage of questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s promises and the timelines to expect action on some.\u00a0 Spicer said to expect further announcements on trade throughout the week. Mr. Trump promised to announce his intention to renegotiate NAFTA on day one. Many of Mr. Trump\u2019s day one promises were announced in a speech in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania last October as part of his \u201ccontract with the American voter,\u201d which outlined his plans during his first 100 days in office. The only three accomplished so far -- none of which were signed on his first day -- are highlighted below. Two other promises he committed to fulfilling on day one included canceling federal funding to sanctuary cities and\u00a0deporting what he says amounts to more than two million criminal illegal immigrants from the U.S.\u00a0There\u2019s no indication yet that he has taken those actions.\u00a0 The president had also pledged to reverse \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s two illegal executive amnesties,\u201d one of which seemed to allude to the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which has deferred deportations for people who came to the U.S. as children illegally. Asked if Mr. Trump was now ruling out the termination of DACA, Spicer told reporters Monday that the priority is \u201cto focus on those who are in this country illegally and have a record -- a criminal record -- or pose a threat to the American people.\u201d \u201cFor now...the focus is going to be on people who have done harm to our country,\u201d Spicer said.  On the question of when the Trump administration plans to begin building the border wall, Spicer said Monday, \u201cI think that the president has noted that this was a serious priority of his throughout the campaign. He has already started to work with Congress on the appropriations avenue of that. And so he is doing everything he can to direct agencies and Congress to commence with that work as soon as possible.\u201d On Wednesday, the president is expected to sign immigration executive actions that include provisions for the wall. Some of the other promises Mr. Trump has not taken action on yet include directing the Treasury Secretary to label China a currency manipulator (his nominee, Steven Mnuchin, has not yet been confirmed by the Senate); canceling billions in U.S. payments to United Nations climate change programs; suspending immigration from terror-prone regions to the U.S. and instituting an \u201cextreme vetting\u201d process for those entering the country.  As part of his \u201ccontract,\u201d Mr. Trump said he would on day one start to \u201ccancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum, and order issued by President Obama.\u201d Four days into his term, he has yet to undo any such orders.\u00a0 Mr. Trump also said on day one, he would begin the process of selecting a replacement for the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. On Tuesday, he said he would announce his nominee next week.\u00a0 Mr. Trump had also promised to convene his generals and inform them that they have 30 days to submit a plan on defeating the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Spicer was asked about progress on that front at his briefing Tuesday, and he said some senior staff is part of that process already.\u00a0 However, Spicer said some of the people who should be involved, like the secretary of state and ambassador to the U.N., haven\u2019t been confirmed yet by the Senate.

Moore has been accused of sexual misconduct with teenage girls when he was in his 30s.\u00a0  The president has since insisted the country can't afford to have a Democrat in the Senate. \"We need Roy voting for us,\" Mr. Trump says in the robocall. \"I'm stopping illegal immigration and crime, rebuilding a stronger military and protecting the Second Amendment and our pro-life values.\"  \"If Alabama elects liberal Democrat Doug Jones, all of our progress will be stopped cold,\" Mr. Trump says in the recording.  The president goes on, slamming Jones as a \"puppet of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer,\" saying Jones \"will vote with the Washington liberals every single time.\"  \"Democrat Jones is soft on crime, weak on immigration, supports abortion, he's bad for our military and bad for our vets. We don't want him. And he also, by the way, wants higher taxes,\" he adds. The president says Moore is a \"conservative who will help me steer this country back on track after eight years of the Obama disaster.\"  On Saturday, White House spokesman Raj Shah confirmed to CBS News that the president had recorded the robocall for Moore's Senate campaign, which was first reported by Politico. Mr. Trump used some of his \"Make America Great Again\" rally in Pensacola, Florida, Friday night to push support for Moore, and criticize Jones ahead of Tuesday's highly anticipated election. \"This country, the future of this country cannot afford to lose a seat in the very, very close United States Senate -- we can't afford it, folks,\"\u00a0Mr. Trump said Friday night.

            "article_content": "President Trump's leaked January call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull reveals a brand-new president preoccupied with his image, angry over his predecessor's deal to take in refugees and impatient with a foreign ally.\u00a0 The Washington Post obtained a transcript of a January 28 call Mr. Trump shared with Turnbull, only days after taking office, in which Mr. Trump feared he would look \"foolish\" and \"terrible\" for sticking with an agreement Turnbull and former President Barack Obama made to vet and take in hundreds of refugees Australia had rejected. The call came the same day Mr. Trump's administration issued the first ban on travel from heavily Muslim countries, and Mr. Trump -- fresh off a campaign that pledged to be tough on immigration -- feared taking in the refugees Australia had been kept in detention centers in Pacific islands would be a bad way to start out his presidency.\u00a0 \"Malcom [sic], why is this so important?\" Mr. Trump asked his Australian counterpart. \"I do not understand. This is going to kill me. I am the world's greatest person that does not want to let people into the country. And now I am agreeing to take 2,000 people and I agree I can vet them, but that puts me in a bad position. It makes me look so bad and I have only been here a week.\" Turnbull explained that the refugees from the Middle East, Africa and Asia came to Australia by boat without going through the immigration process, meaning they were rejected and placed on Manus Island and Nauru. Obama had struck a deal with Australia to take up to about 1,300 of them.\u00a0 \"Look, I do not know how you got them to sign a deal like this, but that is how they lost the election. They said I had no way to 270 and I got 306,\" Mr. Trump said, referencing his electoral college win. \"That is why they lost the election, because of stupid deals like this. You have brokered many a stupid deal in business and I respect you, but I guarantee that you broke many a stupid deal. This is a stupid deal. This deal will make me look terrible.\" The president also complained that the U.S. is treated like a \"dumping ground\" for the rest of the world.\u00a0 \"Give them to the United States,\" Mr. Trump said later. \"We are like a dumping ground for the rest of the world. I have been here for a period of time, I just want this to stop. I look so foolish doing this. It [sic] know it is good for you but it is bad for me. It is horrible for me. This is what I am trying to stop. I do not want to have more San Bernardino's or World Trade Centers. I could name 30 others, but I do not have enough time.\" Mr. Trump continued that he did not want to take the \"bad\" refugees.\u00a0 \"I hate taking these people,\" Mr. Trump continued. \"I guarantee you they are bad. That is why they are in prison right now. They are not going to be wonderful people who go on to work for the local milk people.\" Throughout the call, Mr. Turnbull assured Mr. Trump the U.S. would have full leverage to vet the \"economic refugees,\" and could allow as few of them into the U.S. as desired. But Mr. Trump wasn't satisfied.\u00a0 \"I am going to get killed on this thing,\" he told Turnbull.\u00a0 Turnbull said he wouldn't.\u00a0 \"Yes, I will be seen as a weak and ineffective leader in my first week by these people,\" Mr. Trump continued. \"This is a killer.\" Mr. Trump agreed to stick to the deal, but made it clear he wasn't happy about it. Mr. Trump said his calls with other foreign leaders -- including Russian President Vladimir Putin -- were more pleasant.\u00a0 \"I have had it,\" Mr. Trump told Turnbull shortly before ending the call. \"I have been making these calls all day and this is the most unpleasant call all day. Putin was a pleasant call. This is ridiculous.\" Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "In an afternoon briefing Friday, Sean Spicer defended the White House over a CNN report that Reince Priebus had inappropriately pressured the FBI to dispute a New York Times story that alleged multiple contacts between Trump campaign associates and Russian intelligence officials during the presidential campaign. At issue were communications between FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus about the accuracy of the story published by the Times. \u00a0 On Thursday, CNN suggested that Priebus\u2019 contact with the FBI may have been inappropriate, given that there is a pending investigation into the alleged Russian contacts.\u00a0 President Trump returned to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) Friday after skipping the event last year in order to campaign in Kansas during the presidential primary season. For the first half of the speech, Mr. Trump bashed what he called \u201cthe dishonest press\u201d and said that \u201cfake news\u201d is \u201cthe enemy of the people.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThey have no sources, they just make it up,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding that he\u2019s \u201cnot against\u201d the media or the press and that he doesn\u2019t mind bad stories about him. He then went on to discuss his election victory last November and outlined all of the policy promises he intends to keep as president. He discussed his plan to dismantle Obamacare, lower taxes for the middle class, rebuild the military, build a border wall and deport \u201cbad dudes\u201d from the U.S. \u201cBy stopping the flow of illegal immigration, we will save countless tax dollars,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re not coming back in, folks.\u201d President Trump on Friday signed an executive order that calls on all executive agencies to evaluate federal regulations and identify any that are unnecessary, according to the White House pool report. \u201cExcessive regulations are killing jobs, driving companies out of our country like never before,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Trump said with a dozen or more CEOs standing behind him in the Oval Office. \u201cToday, this executive order directs each agency to establish a regulatory reform task force. It will ensure that every agency has a team of dedicated people to research all regulations that are unnecessary, burdensome and harmful to the economy, and harmful to the creation of jobs and business.\u2019\u2019 President Trump on Friday\u00a0blasted the FBI for failing to track down people who are leaking information\u00a0to journalists about the new administration. Mr. Trump went on say that classified information is being relayed to the press, which he said could have a \u201cdevastating effect\u201d on the U.S. He demanded that the leakers be found immediately. --\u00a0Rebecca Shabad Hispanic people in the U.S. are divided about what Donald Trump\u2019s presidency means for them, according to a new survey from the Pew Research Center. The poll found that 54 percent of Hispanics said that they\u2019re confident about their place in America after Mr. Trump\u2019s election and 41 percent said they have serious concerns. Among undocumented immigrants, 55 percent said that they have serious concerns about their place in the U.S. The same was said by 38 percent of U.S.-born Hispanic and 34 percent of Hispanic immigrants to the U.S. Forty-nine percent of Hispanic lawful permanent residents said they have serious concerns, too. Next week\u2019s must-watch political television is the\u00a0president\u2019s joint address to Congress\u00a0Tuesday. How will the president command the podium in the august House chamber? What will it feel like in the room? \u00a0\u00a0 Though Mr. Trump claims his White House has run like\u00a0a \u201cfine-tuned machine,\u201d\u00a0there have been a few stalls and false starts. For instance, a key executive order, the travel ban, has been stayed by the courts, forcing him to write a new one. Mr. Trump and his top aides are at war with the media -- he declared several TV networks the \u201cenemy of the people last week.\u201d A new CBS News poll this week shows the\u00a0president\u2019s approval ratings are low -- 39 percent\u00a0-- similar to other recent polls over the last couple of weeks.\u00a0 Just over a month after his inauguration, it seems likely that Mr. Trump could use this speech to turn his attention from the solo executive actions and cabinet appointments toward the agenda that will require working with Congress. How will all of this be manifest in the president\u2019s Tuesday address? Correspondent Margaret Brennan, who covers the White House and foreign affairs for CBS News, joined Major Garrett for this week\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Takeout\u201d podcast. President Trump addresses the Conservative Political Action Conference, 10:20 a.m.\u00a0 Caitlyn Jenner is taking President Trump to task for his administration\u2019s\u00a0reversal of a directive on transgender access to public school bathrooms. Jenner addresses Mr. Trump in a video posted Thursday night on Twitter. She says, \u201cFrom one Republican to another, this is a disaster.\u201d The Trump White House has ended a directive issued during Obama\u2019s presidency that told public schools to let transgender students use bathrooms and locker rooms of their chosen gender. Mr. Trump meets with Ohio Gov. John Kasich. The National Governors and the Republican governors are in Washington this weekend for their annual meeting. Mike Pence will host the GOP governors for lunch, 12:30 p.m. Later, Pence will travel to Las Vegas to address the Republican Jewish Coalition, 10:30 p.m. The CBS News poll released this morning\u00a0also shows that six in 10 Americans say the economy is in good shape, the highest that figure has been in a decade.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The CBS News poll released this morning\u00a0also shows that six in 10 Americans say the economy is in good shape, the highest that figure has been in a decade.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Just over a month after taking office, President Trump\u2019s overall job approval rating is 39 percent -- similar to what it was earlier this month. Fifty-one percent of Americans disapprove, and 10 percent don\u2019t have an opinion. \u00a0 \u00a0 There continues to be some concern about Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to handle an international crisis.Sixty-two percent are uneasy about his approach, and only 35 percent say they\u2019re confident about his ability to deal with an international crisis. However, among Republicans, 75 percent are confident, and 22 percent are not.\u00a0 The opposite is true for Democrats -- 92 percent are uneasy with his approach, and only six percent are comfortable. Sixty-four percent of independents are also uneasy about the president\u2019s approach to international crises.\u00a0 Secretary of State\u00a0Rex Tillerson and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly will spend Wednesday night and Thursday in Mexico City, meeting with government officials including Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. As the first visit of US officials to the neighboring country since\u00a0President Trump\u2019s inauguration, which has strained U.S.-Mexico relations, it will be a stark reminder of the complexities that shape the relationship between the two countries. Before leaving for the trip, Tillerson met with President Trump at the White House. --Kylie Atwood Meanwhile, back in Washington, Mr. Trump said in an interview with Reuters that he wants to expand and update the\u00a0U.S. nuclear arsenal. He said in the interview Thursday that he wants U.S. nuclear capability to be at the \u201ctop of the pack,\u201d but that the country has \u201cfallen behind on nuclear weapon capacity.\u201d In Mexico City, Homeland Security Secretary\u00a0John Kelly promised there will not be any mass deportations of illegal immigrants. Kelly also said that there will not be any military force used in immigration enforcement. \u201cThere will be no use of military forces in immigration,\u201d Kelly declared in a statement at the Mexican Foreign Ministry. \u201cThere will be no -- repeat -- no, mass deportations.\u201d Drug policy and advocacy groups, alarmed by a New York Times report that the Office of Management and Budget has placed the White House\u2019s Office of National Drug Control and Policy (ONDCP) on the chopping block, have banded together in the midst of\u00a0a national opioid crisis\u00a0to author a letter forcefully opposing the move. \u00a0--Jacqueline Alemany And amid talk of plans to cut the office, New Jersey Gov.\u00a0Chris Christie and former New Hampshire Rep. Frank Guinta are being considered for roles\u00a0in the war on drugs. Vice President Pence (7:30 p.m.), top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos (12:50 p.m.), Trump Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon (1 p.m.) address the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), in Oxon Hill, Maryland.\u00a0 During\u00a0a panel discussion\u00a0Thursday afternoon, Bannon said the relationship between Mr. Trump and the media will get worse, not better. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to get better -- it\u2019s going to get worse every day,\u201d he predicted in a joint interview with Priebus. He went on to say of the \u201ccorporatist, globalist media\u201d that it\u2019s \u201cadamantly opposed to a economic nationalist agenda like Donald Trump has.\u201d The secretary of State meets with Mexican Foreign Secretary Videgaray (joint statement, 12:10 p.m. ET), Secretary of Government Osorio, and Secretary of Finance Meade. He\u2019ll then have a closed meeting with President Pena Nieto. Striking the right note in this conversation will be key, CBS News\u2019\u00a0Margaret Brennan notes. Mexico\u2019s president abruptly cancelled his previously scheduled trip to Washington in the wake of the Trump administration\u2019s executive order to construct a border wall, which Mr. Trump has described as being paid for by Mexico. President Trump hosts a listening session with manufacturing CEOs about removing barriers to job creation. Vice President Pence is expected to meet with the group before the president, 10:30 a.m., at the White House. \u00a0Mr. Trump hosts a closed legislative affairs strategy session at 2:30 p.m. President Trump dines with the Business Council at 7:50 p.m.",

            "article_content": "When President Trump was deciding to order his first known covert raid against al Qaeda in Yemen --\u00a0an operation that later resulted in nearly 30 deaths, including suspected terror leaders and the first U.S. military casualty under Mr. Trump -- he had several trusted advisers by his side. Among them: his son-in-law and top adviser Jared Kushner. \u00a0 At the National Prayer Breakfast Thursday, President Trump boasted of his television ratings during his time hosting \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d reality show and urged attendees to \u201cpray\u201d for his successor, former California governor and Hollywood macho man Arnold Schwarzenegger. \u201cThey hired a big, big movie star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, to take my place,\u201d said Mr. Trump, who still has an executive producer credit on the \u201cCelebrity Apprentice.\u201d \u201cAnd we know how that turned out. The ratings went right down the tubes.\u201d Lawmakers respond to reports of Trump\u2019s call with Australian PM Some members of Congress are trying to defend Australia and the importance of its alliance with the U.S. after President Trump reportedly had\u00a0a tense phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull\u00a0last weekend. \u00a0 The Trump administration appeared to loosen U.S. sanctions Thursday that the Obama administration had imposed against Russia in response to its cyberattacks in the 2016 presidential election. The Treasury Department\u00a0published a license\u00a0that authorizes certain transactions between U.S. companies and the FSB, Russia\u2019s security service and for the importation, distribution or use of \u201ccertain information technology products in the Russian Federation.\u201d Such transactions had been prohibited under Obama administration sanctions imposed on Russia in late December. At the time, the U.S. sanctioned nine entities and individuals including the FSB and GRU. The Obama administration said that the FSB had assisted and provided material support to the GRU in its efforts to interfere with the U.S. election. The Office Inspector General (OIG) for the Homeland Security Department (DHS) announced late Wednesday that it will be reviewing DHS\u2019 rollout of President Trump\u2019s immigration ban executive order, signed by Mr. Trump on Friday. After days of confusion over how President Trump\u2019s controversial immigration order would be applied to legal permanent residents of the United States, the White House says it has\u00a0issued a new guidance that exempts green card holders from the travel ban. \u201cThey no longer need a waiver because if they are a legal permanent resident, they won\u2019t need it anymore,\u201d White House press secretary Sean Spicer said at a news briefing Wednesday.\u00a0 The president meets with Sen. Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch and top Democrat Ron Wyden, also with House Ways and Means Chair Kevin Brady and ranking member Richard Neal, 11:15 a.m. He also met with Harley-Davidson executives for lunch. The nominations of two of President Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks -- Scott Pruitt for the Environmental Protection Agency and Mick Mulvaney for the Office of Management and Budget -- will advance to a vote by the full Senate after committee votes held Thursday. A day after delaying its vote because of Senate Democrats\u2019 boycott, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee voted -- still with no Democrats present -- to send Pruitt\u2019s nomination to the full Senate. Pruitt\u2019s nomination advanced with 11 votes (all Republicans) to zero after GOP members of the committee changed the rules to allow for a vote without Democrats present And Mulvaney\u2019s nomination will also go to the full Senate, though the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee voted 8-7, along party lines, to send the nomination without a recommendation. Nominee Neil Gorsuch is expected to meet with more senators on Capitol Hill today. Commmentary: Schumer has no good options on Neil Gorsuch Trump\u2019s SCOTUS nominee will be confirmed -- but can the Democratic leader ever make that loss acceptable to the base?\u00a0 Now that President Trump has announced the\u00a0nomination of Colorado Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, the confirmation fight begins. Gorsuch starts meeting with the senators who will vote on his nomination today -- Vice President Pence took him to meet Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell this morning. McConnell said he thought the president had made \u201can outstanding appointment\u201d with Gorsuch and said he looked forward to getting the confirmation process started. He ignored a shouted question about Democratic opposition to the nomination.\u00a0 Former Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who was also at the meeting with McConnell, Pence and Gorsuch, will also be shepherding Gorsuch around the hill to meet senators, especially those on the Judiciary Committee.\u00a0 If you missed it, this was the\u00a0live blog and video of Gorsuch\u2019s nomination announcement. Australia\u2019s prime minister said his country\u2019s relationship with the United States remained \u201cvery strong\u201d but refused to comment on a newspaper report on Thursday that an angry President Donald Trump cut short their first telephone call as national leaders. At the heart of the weekend conversation between Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was\u00a0a deal struck with the Obama administration that would allow mostly Muslim refugees rejected by Australia\u00a0to be resettled in the United States. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn told reporters at the White House briefing today that the Trump administration \u201ccondemns such actions by Iran that undermine security, prosperity and stability throughout and beyond the Middle East that puts American lives at risk.\u201d His comments came after Iran conducted a ballistic missile test and Iran-backed Houthi rebels attacked a Saudi frigate. Flynn said, \u201cIran is now feeling emboldened,\u201d and he criticized the Obama administration for failing \u201cto respond adequately.\u201d The president was asked by a pool reporter if he\u2019d want\u00a0Mitch McConnell to invoke the \u201cnuclear option\u201d\u00a0if confirmation of his Supreme Court nominee proves difficult President Trump says if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is unable to muster the 60 votes necessary to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, he should change the Senate rules and allow Gorsuch to be confirmed with a simple majority of senators -- a parliamentary procedure known as the \u201cnuclear option.\u201d Asked during a meeting with business leaders what he\u2019d say to Democrats who will try to block Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation, Mr. Trump said \u201cI think there\u2019s a certain dishonesty if they go against their vote from not very long ago,\u201d alluding to the fact that Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation to the federal court was supported by a number of Democratic senators. \u201cIf we end up with the same gridlock,\u201d Mr. Trump said, \u201cI would say, \u2018If you can, Mitch, go nuclear.\u201d It would be \u201ca shame,\u201d the president added. \u201cIt\u2019s up to Mitch, but I would say, \u2018Go for it.\u2019\u201d The full Senate votes on Rex Tillerson\u2019s nomination to be secretary of state, 2 p.m. Democrats boycotted EPA nominee Scott Pruitt\u2019s vote\u00a0in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Wednesday morning, causing his committee vote to be delayed. Democrats have complained that Pruitt, who is the Oklahoma attorney general, has not sufficiently answered their questions.\u00a0 Sen.

            "article_content": "FRESNO, Calif. - Days after Donald Trump won the White House vowing to deport millions of people in the country illegally and fortify the Mexican border, California farmer Kevin Herman ordered nearly $600,000 in new equipment, cutting the number of workers he\u2019ll need starting with the next harvest. Herman, who grows figs, persimmons and almonds in the nation\u2019s most productive farming state, said Trump\u2019s comments pushed him to make the purchase, larger than he would have otherwise. \u201cNo doubt about it,\u201d Herman said. \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t have spent as much or bought as much machinery as I did.\u201d Others in California\u2019s farming industry say Trump\u2019s tough campaign talk targeting immigrants in the country illegally -- including a vast number of farmworkers -- spurred them into action, too. They\u2019re calling on congressional representatives to educate the incoming president on the workforce it takes to feed the country, and they\u2019re assuring workers they\u2019ll protect them. San Joaquin Valley farmer Joe Del Bosque recently gathered about 20 year-round employees at a Los Banos steakhouse for their annual holiday lunch. The festivities began in a serious tone. The topic of immigration took a bigger part of the conversation this year because of Trump, he said. Del Bosque told his crew he\u2019ll make sure the new administration knows their vital role in the farming industry. It\u2019s a message Del Bosque wants his managers to spread to another 300 seasonal workers needed at the harvest\u2019s peak. Leticia Alfaro, a food-safety supervisor at the farm, said in an interview that many of her friends who work in the fields don\u2019t have proper documentation like her, and they take Trump\u2019s threats seriously. \u201cThey\u2019re terrified by his comments,\u201d Alfaro, 53, said in Spanish. They fear being deported and torn from their children who were born here, she said. After Trump takes office, they wonder if it will be safe to make a simple trip to the grocery store, fearing checkpoints where they\u2019ll be pulled over and have to show their documentation. Trump\u2019s remarks were felt sharply in California, which produces nearly half the country\u2019s fruits, vegetables and nuts valued of $47 billion annually. Experts say his words resonate nationwide. Texas, Florida and Georgia are examples of states with large migrant communities dominating home construction, health care, food service industries, said David Zonderman, a labor historian at North Carolina State University. \u201cCalifornia might be ground zero,\u201d he said of immigrant families living in the shadows. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a unique California issue.\u201d The fear stems from Trump\u2019s campaign rallies, where he received a rousing response each time he vowed to deport people who are in the country illegally -- up to 11 million. That position softened after Trump won the election, when he said he\u2019d start with 3 million with criminal records. Some farmers point to Trump\u2019s postelection shift as a sign his campaign bluster won\u2019t become reality. He is, after all, a businessman like them, they say. But others believe this shift underscores the president-elect\u2019s unpredictable nature. \u201cOur workers are scared,\u201d said Joe Garcia, a farm labor contractor who hires up to 4,000 people each year to pick grapes from Napa to Bakersfield and along the Central Coast. \u201cIf they\u2019re concerned, we\u2019re concerned.\u201d Since Election Day, Garcia\u2019s crews throughout the state have been asking what will happen to them when Trump takes office. Farmers also are calling to see if they\u2019ll need to pay more to attract people to prune the vines, he said. Garcia tells farmers not to panic. They\u2019ll learn how many return from Mexico after the holidays. \u201cWe\u2019ll plan around what we have,\u201d he tells them. \u201cThat\u2019s all we can do.\u201d Roughly 325,000 workers in California do the back-breaking jobs that farmers say nobody else will do, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Manuel Cunha Jr., president of the Nisei Farmers League farming association, estimates 85 percent of California farmworkers live in the U.S. illegally. Farmers for years have scrambled under a shrinking labor pool. Mexico\u2019s improving economy has slowed the flow of migrant workers. The dangerous border, controlled by drug cartels and human traffickers, keeps away others. Herman, the farmer who bought three new almond sweepers, said Trump influenced him on top of California\u2019s rising minimum wage and a new law giving farm laborers overtime rights that are equal to workers in other industries. Plus, Herman said, he\u2019s heard too many workers question whether they\u2019ll return from their holiday trips to Mexico. \u201cIt\u2019s stories like that that have motivated me to become efficient and upgrade my equipment,\u201d Herman said. Tom Nassif, a Trump adviser and president of the powerful trade association Western Growers, said farmers shouldn\u2019t fear the president-elect. Trump isn\u2019t interested in deporting their workers, he said. Nassif said he isn\u2019t privy to the details of Trump\u2019s immigration policy. He has recommended that Trump allow farmworkers to stay by putting immigrants in the country illegally who are otherwise law-abiding residents on a period of probation under conditions that they pay taxes, learn English and obey all laws. \u201cI think he\u2019s looking at people who have committed more serious crimes and start with them first -- and rightly so,\u201d said Nassif, picked by Trump\u2019s campaign team to serve on an agriculture advisory committee. \u201cI think there\u2019s less reason to worry than most people believe there is.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Arizona jurors who will decide a malicious-prosecution trial against former Sheriff Joe Arpaio were told Tuesday that one of Sen. Jeff Flake's sons suffered from depression as a result of a now-dismissed animal cruelty case that the lawman brought against him. The jury was told on the opening day of the civil trial that Austin Flake and his ex-wife Logan Brown still suffer emotional distress from the charges they faced when 21 dogs at a kennel operated by the younger Flake's in-laws died from heat exhaustion. The Flakes were watching the dogs while the in-laws were in Florida. The lawsuit filed by the couple alleges Arpaio pursued charges against them to do political damage to the Republican senator from Arizona and gain publicity for himself. While jurors were told about Arpaio's efforts to publicize the case, the elder Flake was barely mentioned during opening Tuesday's opening statements. Stephen Montoya, an attorney representing the younger Flake and his ex-wife, said there was no evidence showing his clients intended to hurt the dogs. \"It wasn't Austin's fault. It wasn't Logan's fault,\" Montoya said, adding that the criminal case contributed to the demise of the couple's marriage. Jeffrey Leonard, an attorney representing Maricopa County and the former sheriff, said the charges against the couple were the result of a competent investigation. \"There were no predetermined results,\" Leonard said. \"Conclusions were drawn in good faith by the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office.\" Leonard also told jurors that the prosecutor who filed the charges was not pressured by Arpaio's office to prosecute the couple. Arpaio, who lost his re-election bid last year after serving as sheriff of greater Phoenix for 24 years, is expected to testify Tuesday. The case against the Flakes was dismissed at the request of prosecutors, and the owners of the kennel pleaded guilty to animal cruelty charges after an expert determined the facility's air conditioner failed because the operators didn't properly maintain it. The federal judge presiding over the trial has determined previously that investigators didn't have probable cause to charge the couple. The lawsuit alleges that Arpaio tried to link the senator to the dog deaths by conducting surveillance on the senator's home and examining phone records to see if the younger Flake called his father when the younger Flake was watching the dogs. Lawyers for Austin Flake and his then-wife have said previously that the senator drew Arpaio's ire by disagreeing with the sheriff over immigration and criticizing the movement that questioned the authenticity of then-President Barack Obama's birth certificate. Arpaio was known for carrying out dozens of large-scale immigration crackdowns and conducting a five-year investigation of Obama's birth record. There was no mention during opening statements of any personal or political tension between the senator and Arpaio. The allegations from the younger Flake came after Maricopa County paid $8.7 million to settle lawsuits from officials and judges who claimed Arpaio had launched criminal investigations against them on trumped-up allegations in disputes over budget cuts, a plan to build a new court complex and other issues. The settlements included $1.2 million that was given to a judge who was charged in a now-discredited bribery case brought by Arpaio. It isn't the first time Arpaio has been accused of trumping up charges in an animal cruelty case. He launched an investigation against a police officer from the Phoenix suburb of Chandler over a 2007 death of a police dog that was left in a hot vehicle for 12 hours in blistering summer heat. The officer was charged with animal abuse but eventually acquitted. He filed a lawsuit alleging Arpaio brought the criminal case so the sheriff could exploit the publicity. Taxpayers paid $775,000 to the officer to settle the case. The lawsuit by Austin Flake and his ex-wife doesn't specify how much money they are seeking. But they previously sought $4 million in a notice of claim, a precursor to a lawsuit.",

            "article_content": "President Trump signaled Tuesday that the government could very well shut down next month if Democrats don't agree to his demands on military spending, his administration's plan to reduce crime and his border wall.  Mr. Trump spoke to cameras at the White House at a table with Republicans leaders Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, and Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin. Democratic leaders Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-California, decided earlier in the day to pull out of the meeting.  \"I'm not really that surprised,\" the president said about Democrats' decision not to attend. \"We have a lot of differences. They're weak on crime; they're weak on illegal immigration. They want the illegal folks to come pouring into our border and a lot of problems are being caused.\" The president accused Democrats of being \"all talk\" and \"no action.\"  Both Ryan and McConnell ridiculed Democrats for skipping the meeting, arguing that the White House must be part of the ultimate negotiation over government spending. Congress must pass a new spending bill by Dec. 8 or the government will shut down. But even before an omnibus appropriations package can be hashed out, Republicans and Democrats are divided over how to lift spending limits that were set by a 2011 law. The president and congressional Republicans want to boost military spending caps while Democrats want equal increases between both the military and domestic programs, which covers the Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security and Department of Veterans Affairs.  \"We are very far apart because our views on crime and our views on immigration and the military -- so many are different,\" Mr. Trump said about Democrats. \"We want our military funded and we want it funded now.\"  Asked if Democrats would be to blame if the Democrat shuts down, Mr. Trump said, \"If that happens, I would absolutely blame Democrats if that happens.\"  The president said a shutdown would be over \"illegals pouring into the country, crime pouring into the country, no border wall, which everybody wants. I got elected partially because of the border wall.\"  Government spending measures, however, require 60 votes to advance in the Senate and Republicans only have 52 members in the upper chamber. That means Republicans need Democratic votes in order to fund the government.  Congress last passed a government spending package earlier this year, which excluded funding for the border wall. The White House backed off of that demand after realizing Democrats wouldn't agree to it.  Mr. Trump appears adamant, however, that he get the financing for wall construction, which makes the chances of a shutdown that much higher. The government last shut down for 16 days in October 2013 after Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, led the unsuccessful charge to defund Obamacare. The shutdown wasn't viewed as detrimental to Republicans because they won control of both chambers in the 2014 midterm elections. The dynamic is slightly different this time around now that Republicans control the White House and Congress.\u00a0 Rebecca Shabad is a video reporter for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON --\u00a0Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday strongly defended President Donald Trump's firing of James Comey, linking the FBI director's abrupt dismissal to his handling of the Hillary Clinton email server investigation. But he refused to discuss any private conversations he had with the president leading up to Comey's firing and would not say if he had discussed with the president an FBI investigation into potential coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign.  Sessions, appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, said it was \"the first time I'm aware of\" in which an FBI director had performed the traditional role of Justice Department prosecutors by announcing on his own the conclusion of a federal investigation -- that no charges would be brought against Clinton.  He said he was further galled when Comey, one week before his firing, insisted to Congress that he would have taken the same actions again.  Sessions' insistence that Comey's firing was motivated by displeasure over the Clinton email case is consistent with the initial White House explanation. But Trump himself has at times appeared to undercut that explanation, saying he would have fired Comey even without the recommendation of the Justice Department and that he was thinking of \"this Russia thing\" when he dismissed him on May 9.  Trump has accused Comey of having prematurely exonerated Clinton, even though the Justice Department's own explanation for the firing cited his decision to effectively reopen the probe days before the November election.  The FBI's investigation is now being run by the Justice Department's special counsel, Robert Mueller. After initially balking at the question, Sessions said that he had not been questioned by Mueller's team of investigators. CBS News' Paula Reid confirmed with the Justice Department that Sessions has not yet been interviewed by the special counsel. He has been seen as a possible witness in the case given his involvement in the firing of Comey.  Sessions stressed at the outset that he would not discuss any private conversations with the president and he largely abided by that principle, deflecting questions not only about the Russia investigation but also about the president's pardon of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, among other topics.  The Russia probe has shadowed much of Sessions' tenure as attorney general, even though he recused himself in March because of his role as a stanch Trump campaign ally. It was a central focus the oversight hearing, too, as lawmakers repeatedly pressed Sessions about his contacts with the former Russian ambassador to the U.S., his discussions with Trump about the investigation and his involvement in the firing of Comey.  Though he refused to say whether he discussed with Trump Comey's involvement in the Russia investigation, or his private conversations with Trump, Sessions did say that the president had asked him and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for their recommendations about what to do with Comey.  \"He did ask for our written opinion and we submitted that to him,\" Sessions said under questioning from Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the committee's top Democrat. \"It did not represent any change in either one of ours opinions.\"  The routine oversight hearing is Sessions' first before the committee since his January confirmation, and it comes as has worked quickly to reshape the department with an intense focus on immigration, drugs, gangs and violent crime.  He also faced questions from lawmakers about his swift undoing of Obama-era protections for gay and transgender people and his rollback of criminal justice policies that aimed to reduce the federal prison population, among other changes he has made in nine months since taking office.  Sessions has tried to pressure so-called sanctuary cities into cooperating with federal immigration authorities by threatening to withhold grant money, and he was the public face of the Trump administration's decision to end a program benefiting hundreds of thousands of young people who entered the U.S. illegally as children. Congress is seeking a legislative solution to extend the protections before recipients' work permits expire.  It is standard policy for attorneys general to appear each year before the Justice Department's congressional overseers on the House and Senate judiciary committees. Yet, in a reflection of the extent to which the Russia investigation and his own role as a Trump campaign ally have dominated public attention, Sessions made his first appearance on Capitol Hill as attorney general before the Senate Intelligence Committee.  Democratic senators have already made clear they want Sessions to detail his private conversations with Trump, particularly in the run-up to the Comey's firing, or announce that Trump is invoking executive privilege to protect those communications. Sessions repeatedly refused to discuss his talks with Trump during his three-hour appearance before the Senate intelligence panel.  He did not say he was using executive privilege, but rather adhering to longstanding tradition of Justice Department leaders to refrain from revealing the contents of private conversations with the president. That explanation left many Democrats unsatisfied and is unlikely to put to an end demands for detailed accounts of those conversations.  Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, repeatedly asked Sessions if the special counsel has requested an interview with him and said he would get back to him within the next few hours after the hearing.  \"I don't recall that I've ever been asked for an interview,\" Sessions said at one point.  Sessions won't say whether he spoke with state officials who had threatened to sue the Trump administration if it did not end a program protecting young immigrants who were brought into the country as children and now living in the U.S. illegally.  Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., asked Sessions whether he discussed the threatened lawsuit with the Texas attorney general before President Donald Trump ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.  Sessions says such conversations would be \"work product\" that should not be revealed. It was yet another line of questioning Sessions refused to answer. Lawmakers are asking about his role in ending the Obama-era program that protected hundreds of thousands of young people.  He also won't discuss his private conversations with Trump, citing longstanding Justice Department tradition.  Sen. John Kennedy, R-Louisiana, asked if Sessions wants the special counsel to succeed.   \"I want him to complete his investigation, professionally, yes,\" Sessions said, adding that he would cooperate with him and would meet with him if asked.\u00a0  Sen. Patricky Leahy, D-Vermont, asked Sessions if Mueller has interviewed Sessions regarding Comey's firing as FBI director, the Russia investigation or his contact with Russian officials.\u00a0  At first, Sessions said he wasn't sure if he should answer the question without clearing it with the special counsel and then asked Leahy what he thinks.\u00a0  \"No,\" Sessions said after a few seconds.  Leahy asked again if he's been interviewed by Mueller in any capacity.  \"The answer is no,\" Sessions said. Sen. Orrin Hatch, Republican from Utah, said that the report claimed that legislation that he and other lawmakers championed gutted the Drug Enforcement Agency's enforcement authority and that they snuck the bill through Congress even though no one knew anything about it. \"These allegations are complete baloney,\" Hatch said. Sessions would neither confirm nor deny a conversation he's had with the president regarding why he decided to fire Comey. He said that it hasn't been \"fully understood\" the \"error\" that Comey made on the matter involving Hillary Clinton and the investigation into her use of private email servers as secretary of state.  Sessions told senators he won't discuss \"confidential\" conversations he had with President Donald Trump.  Sessions told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee during an opening statement of his oversight hearing Wednesday that the president is entitled to have private conversations with Cabinet secretaries.  Members of the committee have told Sessions that they intend to press him on his conversations with Trump, particularly about the firing in May of FBI Director James Comey.  At a separate hearing in June, Sessions told the Senate Intelligence Committee that he would not disclose his communications with Trump. ",

James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, told CBSN anchor Elaine Quijano that he may be open to the possibility of regulating \"bump stocks,\" which are devices that allow semi-automatic weapons to mimic the firing rate of automatic weapons.\u00a0 A number of the rifles found in the possession of Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock were modified with a bump stocks, leading to greater scrutiny of the firearm attachments. A bill introduced Wednesday by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, would ban bump stocks. Sen. John Thune, R-South Dakota, said Tuesday that bump stocks are an issue that the Senate will \"take a look at.\" \"We've got to find out the facts and the details first,\" Lankford said when asked if he was open to the possibility of regulation. In the interview, Lankford also discussed his role within the Senate Intelligence Committee's ongoing investigation into potential Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  \"There's a lot that has happened so far as we've worked quietly behind the scenes,\" he said, explaining that the committee has yet to set a deadline for its inquiry as the participating senators feel \"an obligation to be extremely thorough\" in their work.  Lankford explained that the committee has identified several areas of Russian meddling, including its targeted use of social media political advertising, use of bots to \"bump up the volume\" in online conversations about divisive topics, and attempts to exploit\u00a0state electoral system vulnerabilities.  \"It's okay for us to argue about it, it's not okay for a foreign government to step in and to try to encourage that,\" Lankford said of Russian bots. Lankford also discussed his proposed bill, the SUCCEED Act (Solution for Undocumented Children through Careers Employment Education and Defending our nation), which is the most recent immigration reform effort from Lankford, Sens. Thom Tillis, R-North Carolina, and Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.  \"It takes up so much beyond just the individuals that are in the DACA program,\" Lankford said.  Under the proposed bill, eligibility for protected status includes having arrived in the U.S. before the age of 16 years, holding a high school diploma or equivalent, passing an extensive criminal background check, submitting biometric data to the Department of Homeland Security and being able to pay off any existing federal tax liabilities.  He explained that he hopes the bill will show \"some compassion in the process\" while it still \"honors the law.\" \u00a0 \"There's not going to be a mass deportation of 12 million people. That's not going to happen,\" Lankford said. Blair Guild is a politics reporter and video producer for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "PHOENIX\u00a0-- Fresh off his presidential pardon, an emboldened Joe Arpaio on Monday lashed out at his critics and the judge who found him guilty of a crime as his attorneys went to court to throw the court decision that was the basis for his conviction. The former Arizona sheriff struck a defiant tone in insisting he \"didn't do anything wrong\" and questioning whether his judge was fair. His comments came as President Donald Trump took a similar posture in defending his Friday pardon of the former lawman, blaming the Obama administration for Arpaio's troubles and calling him a \"patriot\" who fought against illegal immigration. \"I thought he was treated unbelievably unfairly,\" Trump said. Arpaio called U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton biased and questioned the growing number of critics across the United States who denounced his pardon as a political reward for having been an early supporter of Trump's campaign. \"Why are they speaking out right now? I've been sheriff for 24 years. Are they coming out against me because of a biased judge?\" Arpaio told The Associated Press in a phone interview. Arpaio, who was voted out of office last year, declined to explain how he believes the judge acted unfairly toward him, saying only that \"it's all documented - the bias and everything else.\" Not only will the pardon erase his contempt of court conviction, it also gave new life to a politician who left office battered after years of scandals over a racial profiling verdict, hundreds of sex-crimes complaints that weren't properly investigated and racking up $141 million taxpayer-funded costs for defending him in lawsuits. He was soundly defeated in the November election by a Democrat in heavily Republican Maricopa county. Now, he's talking about getting back into politics and taking shots at his critics. Arpaio was found guilty four weeks ago of the misdemeanor contempt charge for defying a 2011 order that he stop carrying out immigration patrols. He prolonged the patrols for 17 months, prompting Bolton to find him guilty in a 14-page ruling issued on July 31. Bolton cited TV interviews and news releases in which the sheriff made comments made about keeping up the patrols, even though he knew they were no longer allowed. \"Not only did defendant abdicate responsibility, he announced to the world and to his subordinates that he was going to continue business as usual no matter who said otherwise,\" Bolton wrote. Like Trump, Arpaio has a history of sparring with judges. He was accused of investigating the judge who presided over the profiling case. He also made a now-discredited bribery case against a county judge who had ruled against him in 2009. Arpaio's lawyers asked Bolton on Monday to throw out the ruling that detailed the conviction against him. Arpaio lawyer Jack Wilenchik said the filing is aimed at clearing his name and barring its use in future court cases as an example of a prior bad act. Jeffrey Crouch, a professor of politics at American University who has written a book on presidential pardons, said Arpaio's latest request is unusual. \"The pardon itself is usually the last word in a case,\" Crouch said. Cecillia Wang, a lawyer who helped win the racial profiling verdict against Arpaio, said the lawman's request was outrageous. \"Trump may be taking Arpaio off the hook for jail time, but he can't change history or erase the measure of justice that the court's findings represent,\" Wang said. No such legal requests were filed into the court record after last presidential pardon of an Arizona politician, former Gov. Fife Symington, who was granted clemency by President Bill Clinton in 2001. Arpaio said he had sworn off politics after his crushing defeat last year against Democrat Paul Penzone. Since Friday's pardon, Arpaio said he will return to politics after a large number of supporters have asked him to run again. He said he hasn't yet decided whether his future political involvement will consist of running for office again or becoming a regular on the GOP speaking circuit. \"I haven't decided,\" Arpaio said. \"But I haven't gone away.\"",

            "article_content": "President Trump promised he'd crackdown on illegal immigrants, and in his first 100 days, has moved quickly to do just that. Since the president took office, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency -- ICE --says it's arrested \u00a0 21,000 undocumented immigrants, more than 5,000 of whom have no criminal record. That's more than twice as many as the year before. The president's supporters argue his tough new policy has led to a dramatic drop in the number of people trying to cross into the U.S. this year, but it's also had a profound effect on communities throughout the country.\u00a0 For the past few weeks, we've followed how the new policy has played out in one community in Indiana, where people were surprised to learn that one of those deported was a friend and neighbor, the owner of a popular local restaurant. He'd lived in this country for nearly 20 years, had no criminal record, and his wife and children are all U.S. citizens. Eddie's Steak Shed in Granger, Indiana, is a local institution \u2013 it's a family-run restaurant, where generations of Hoosiers have come for conversation and cholesterol.\u00a0 Anderson Cooper: It seems like this is, like, your local \"Cheers\"? Group: It is. It is.  But as we spoke with these regulars a few weeks ago, the man they said was the heart of the business, its longtime cook and new owner Roberto Beristain, was behind bars, awaiting deportation. Beristain entered the U.S. illegally from Mexico in 1998, but in recent years he'd been issued a temporary work permit, a social security number, and a driver's license.\u00a0 Kimberly Glowacki: \u00a0It just feels wrong.  Michelle Craig: The community is better for having someone like him.  Matt Leliaert: I mean, he showed up here with just the shirt on his back and he's a restaurant owner 20 years later. I mean, that's-- and he worked his butt off to get there, I've seen it. They're all strong supporters of Roberto Beristain, though four out of six of them voted for President Trump. During the primaries, the president said this about illegal immigrants: Trump in debate: They will go out. They will come back-- some. Some will come back, the best, through a process and it may not be a very quick process\u2026 And later, during the general election, he said this: Trump: But we have some bad hombres here and we're gonna get'em out. Dave Keck: \u00a0I voted for him because he said he was going to get rid of the bad hombres. Roberto is a good hombre.  Roberto Beristain's wife, Helen, who also works at the restaurant, was born in Greece and became a U.S. citizen 16 years ago. \u00a0She met Roberto in 1998, at another restaurant in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Helen Beristain: He was a busser, and I was a server. He started talking to me a lot, and I tried to ignore him. He kept on talking to me\u2014 Anderson Cooper: And you tried to ignore him? Helen Beristain: Smiling and smiling and smiling. He always smiles, very positive person. They got married, had three kids, and settled into a comfortable suburban life. Anderson Cooper:\u00a0 Has he ever been in trouble with the law? Helen Beristain: Never-- never. Anderson Cooper: Never committed a crime, D.U.I. Helen Beristain: Definitely not, no. Anderson Cooper: \u00a0He's not a criminal. Helen Beristain: He's not a criminal. The only bad thing he's done is stayed in the United States because he loves this country. That's his only crime.  According to most estimates, there are about 11 million people living within the U.S. illegally; about three percent of them have felony convictions. Obama speech: \"We prioritize criminals, we prioritize gang-bangers.\" For most of his presidency, Barack Obama ordered ICE to focus on deporting people convicted of felonies and serious misdemeanors. ICE agents were often asked to explain their decision to remove anyone else, particularly those whose family members were U.S. citizens. But on his fifth day in office, President Trump signed a new executive order that made it easier to deport people who have no criminal record, including anyone who has what's called \"a final order of removal\" against them. It's that wording that changed the Beristain's lives. \u00a0 That's because 17 years ago, Roberto and Helen, who was pregnant with their first child, took a trip to Niagara Falls. She says they made a wrong turn, and ended up near the Canadian border. Roberto was detained for not having any papers. He was released only after he agreed to this immigration court order requiring his \"voluntary departure\" from the United States within 60 days. When he didn't leave, he automatically became the subject of a \"final order of removal\" which mandated he be deported.\u00a0 Anderson Cooper: Your husband did break the law. Didn't-- didn't leave the country when he had told a judge that he would. Why should he get special treatment when other people who've been waiting in line are trying to do it the right way?\u00a0 Helen Beristain: My husband, first of all, broke the law because at the time when I was pregnant, I was very ill. And it was-- a high risk, either losing the baby or losing my life so the decision he had to make was between me and the baby or him going back to Mexico. He chose us. But any other man, what would they do in his shoes? Helen says over the years they've spent more than $45,000 hiring attorneys to try to legalize Roberto's status. \u00a0But it wasn't until three years ago, that things started looking up for the Beristains. \u00a0Roberto obtained a temporary deferral of that deportation order, which meant he could get a work permit, a social security number, and a driver's license. All he had to do was check in with the government once a year and prove he'd been in no trouble with the law. Helen Beristain: He was excited. He says, \"I'm all legal now. I'm so good to go.\" Anderson Cooper: But it was still just a temporary status. He still had to check in with ICE every year. Helen Beristain: Right, exactly. On February 6th \u2013 shortly after President Trump signed his new executive order \u2013 Roberto Beristain came here to an immigration office in Indianapolis for his annual check-in. Helen was in the parking lot waiting, when an ICE officer came to let her know: her husband would not be coming home. Helen Beristain: He said, \"Your husband is being detained because he is a fugitive.\" I said, \"My husband is a fugitive? My husband is not running from you. You didn't not come knock on my door to look for my husband. He came to you. Why this year he is a fugitive? What happened?\" Michelle Craig: Roberto was doing everything he was supposed to do, so he was an easy target.  Anderson Cooper: He wasn't hiding, he wasn't living in the shadows\u2026 Michelle Craig: He wasn't hiding, right. And so they grabbed somebody who was following the rules. Anderson Cooper: Most of you voted for Donald Trump. He said he was gonna do this, he's done this. Why are you surprised?\" Michelle Craig: Because this is not the person he said he would deport. Dave Keck: And why would you deport somebody like that when you got so many other bad people out there? It just doesn't make sense to me. ICE declined to give us an interview, but in a statement the agency said Beristain was detained because of that final order of removal \"in accordance with federal immigration law.\" James Carafano, a policy expert at the Heritage Foundation and a member of Mr. Trump's transition team, told us the president's new policy is designed to serve as a deterrent. James Carafano:\u00a0 It's not that they're going out and they're looking for people who have done nothing. But that we have an obligation to enforce the law. And if somebody comes across our path who's broken the law, then you know what, they're probably going to go, 'cause the message is, \"There's a new sheriff in town. And the law's going to be enforced.\" Anderson Cooper: You're saying that deporting somebody like Roberto Beristain, it does send a message to others who may be thinking about coming here illegally? James Carafano: I think that's absolutely true.  The number of people caught trying to cross the Southern border has dropped 60 percent in the first three months of President Trump's administration. Apprehensions are now at a 17-year low. Analysts we spoke to believe the president's tough new policies have discouraged border crossers, but so have other factors, including an improving job outlook in Mexico.\u00a0 The average cost of deporting someone like Roberto Beristain is about $11,000. His odyssey through the immigration detention system gives you some sense why: over the course of two months, he was moved from Indianapolis to Brazil Indiana, Kenosha, Wisconsin, Kankakee, Illinois, New Orleans, Louisiana, Chaparral, New Mexico, and Sierra Blanca and El Paso, Texas.\u00a0 His family often didn't know where he was going, or why he was being moved there. Helen on phone with Roberto: Tell me something, did they tell you when they are going to deport you?\u00a0 We were at the house one evening when Roberto called\u2026. Helen on the phone with Roberto: So wait a minute, they said-- no Roberto-- they said they were going to take you to Mexico City\u2026So now they are changing again? \u2026OK, I love you. Be careful. Bye.\u00a0 Helen Beristain: He sounded scared. So scared, like what's gonna happen to me\u2026 The irony of what's happened is not lost on Roberto's wife. \u00a0Like a lot of her friends and relatives, Helen Beristain also voted for President Trump. Anderson Cooper: You voted for him. Helen Beristain: I voted for him. Because he said, \"We're going to make our economy better,\" I did like that idea. And I said to Roberto, I said, \"You know what? You know, you're getting a small business. And that's gonna help you with your taxes,\" but he said, \"OK, well you don't think he's gonna deport us, all people?\" And I said\u2026 Anderson Cooper: Roberto actually raised that idea? Helen Beristain: Yeah, he did. And I said, \"Roberto, come on now. You've got your documents. You obey the law. You haven't done anything bad. You-- you're not a criminal.\" Anderson Cooper: Are there times when you feel that you made a terrible mistake?\u00a0 Helen Beristain: Like they say, \"You should read the fine print first before you make a selection.\" I should have listened closely to those debates. That was a mistake I made. I didn't listen.\u00a0 The Beristains'children \u2013 8-year-old Demetri, 14-year-old Jasmine, and 16-year-old Maria -- have a difficult time understanding what's happened to their father. Anderson Cooper: Maria, did you know he wasn't a U.S. citizen? Maria Beristain: No. I didn't know. Jasmine Beristain: He makes this home a home. And he makes a family a family 'cause he's, you know, the father. And when he's gone, when you take that away from a family, it's like it's all going down. Like, for my mom it's very hard. And for us it's hard too.\u00a0 Anderson Cooper: What did you he say to you when you were talking on the phone?  Jasmine Beristain: The first thing he said was, \"You got A's?\"  Anderson Cooper: He was asking you about your school?\u00a0 Jasmine Beristain: Yeah. I'm like, \"Yeah.\" And he's like, \"OK, good. 'Cause I want you to become a lawyer.\" I was like, \"Yeah, I'll-- I'm gonna become a lawyer.\" I'll-- an attorney. I'm gonna be an immigration attorney.\u00a0 Since Roberto Beristain's detention has been in the news, the restaurant has received threatening calls and angry letters directed at Helen: \"Pack your bags and go to Mexico,\" said one. \u00a0\"When you voted for Trump you were voting for every bigot\u2026who is coming after you,\" said another. Helen Beristain: You got people hating people left and right. This is not America. This is not the American dream. And this is how, this is not how we're making America great again. On April 4th at 10 p.m., Roberto Beristain was taken to this border crossing and deported to Juarez, Mexico. \u00a0He spent the night at a shelter run by the Catholic Church. We found him there the next morning. \u00a0He told us he was praying to be reunited with his family, and was still, somehow, optimistic: Roberto Beristain: Wherever I go, they are going to be with me. Everything is going to be OK. Either way or other way, we are going to be together.\u00a0 Michelle Craig: If I was told that peaceful immigrants that are trying, are in the process of becoming an American citizen would be deported, I would not have voted for Trump. Anderson Cooper: Some people say, \"Look, illegal immigrants are coming here and they're taking jobs\".  Kimberly Glowacki: That's not even the case with Roberto. He employs, what, 20 people--he's not taking jobs, he's creating jobs. Anderson Cooper: Is it a good use of resources to deport someone like Roberto Beristain? James Carafano: That is part of the overall public good of demonstrating not just to Americans but to people around the world that American immigration laws are going to be enforced. That's an important message. Anderson Cooper: So there's no room for discretion? James Carafano: I mean, I-- look, I don't enforce the law. I don't say where there is room for discretion. I'm saying, I don't necessarily think that just because somebody was, you know, nice in the 20 years they live here that they have a right to live here. Roberto Beristain's lawyers are challenging the validity of that old \"order of removal\" that led to his deportation to Mexico.\u00a0 They may also apply for a special waiver for him to re-enter the U.S. but that can take two to three years. \u00a0If he's denied, he'll be banned from returning for a decade. \u00a0 Produced by Andy Court and Sarah Fitzpatrick.

            "article_content": "President Trump made assailing the Washington, D.C., media a central theme of his roughly one-hour speech Saturday night at a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, marking the end of his first 100 days in office.  \"As you may know, there's another big gathering taking place tonight in Washington, D.C., did you hear about it?\" Mr. Trump said, as the crowd supported his statement with boos directed at the media. \"A large group of Hollywood actors and Washington media are consoling each other in a hotel ballroom in our nation's capital right now.\" \"They are gathered together for the White House Correspondents Dinner without the president,\" Mr. Trump continued. \"And I could not possibly be more thrilled than to be more than 100 miles away from Washington's swamp, spending my evening with all of you and with a much, much larger crowd and much better people, right?\" Mr. Trump said the media are a \"disgrace,\" and deserve a big \"failing\" grade for their performance covering his administration thus far. The president said the press has portrayed his presidency in almost an entirely negative light.  Specifically, Mr. Trump disparaged MSNBC and CNN as \"fake news,\" before attacking the \"failing\" New York Times. Mr. Trump called the newspaper's staffers \"incompetent, dishonest people.\" Mr. Trump made comments about the media through his speech, saying his first 100 days has \"exhausted\" the Washington press corps.  But Mr. Trump didn't only have criticism for the media, also assailing Democrats in Congress and even seemingly threatening Republicans. The president emphasized that would be very \"mad\" at members of Congress if they didn't repeal and replace Obamacare, and soon. Pennsylvania was a key win for Mr. Trump, helping propel him to victory with its 20 electoral college votes. Mr. Trump held a victory rally in the state after his Election Night win.  The president's speech was marked by a couple bizarre moments, such as when Mr. Trump stopped in the middle of his remarks to point out someone apparently holding a \"Blacks For Trump\" sign.  \"Thank you for that sign \u2014 Blacks for Trump \u2014 I love that guy,\" the president said. \"Thank you, man. That's really great. I really appreciate it.\" Eventually, Mr. Trump began addressing his purported accomplishments throughout the first few months of his administration, such as an increased focus on the safety of law enforcement and border security. Mr. Trump reiterated that the border wall will be built, amid skepticism and the fight in Congress for funding the border wall.  \"Go home, go to sleep, rest assured,\" Mr. Trump said.  Mr. Trump reiterated themes of being tough on immigration, crime and \"radical Islamic terrorists,\" he said to cheers. \"We are going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country,\" he said.  \"Together, we will make America strong again,\" Mr. Trump concluded his speech. \"We will make America wealthy again. We will make America prosper again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again.\" Mr. Trump has decried the 100-day standard as \"ridiculous\" even as the White House created a site trumpeting his purported successes in that amount of time. Host of CBS News' \"Face The Nation\" John Dickerson spoke\u00a0Mr. Trump\u00a0earlier Saturday at the White House for an exclusive interview that will appear Sunday on \"Face The Nation\" and Monday on \"CBS This Morning.\" Follow our blog from earlier below. 8:48 p.m. Trump ends his speech after roughly one hour on stage. 8:43 p.m. Mr. Trump said he would be very \"mad\" at members of Congress, including a couple of the members present in the audience, if they didn't pass Obamacare repeal and replacement quickly. 8:33 p.m. \"We are going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country,\" Mr. Trump said 8:29 p.m.\u00a0Mr. Trump decried the spread of \"transnational gangs\" into \"all 50 states,\" honing in on MS-13. \"My administration will not rest until we have dismantled these violent gangs, and we're doing it rapidly,\" and sending them back to their countries, he said. 8:26 p.m. Mr. Trump touted a new office for victims of immigration-related crime. \"We need safety, We need cameras,\" Mr. Trump said, adding, \"We need the wall.\" Mr. Trump reiterated that the border wall will be built, amid skepticism and the fight for border wall funding in Congress. \"Go home, go to sleep, rest assured,\" he said. 8:23 p.m. Mr. Trump said the U.S. is imposing immigration control like you've \"never seen before.\" 8:21 p.m. The president says a lot of people on his staff aren't happy about post-White House lobbying restrictions, but says that's \"OK.\" \"It is time to drain the swamp,\" Mr. Trump said. 8:15 p.m. Mr. Trump said that if he can't get a good deal for workers on NAFTA, he will terminate it. 8:11: Mr. Trump stopped his speech to point to a man apparently holding a \"Blacks for Trump\" sign, saying he appreciates the support. \"Thank you for that sign. 'Blacks for Trump.' I love that guy,\" Trump says. \"Thank you man. That's really great. I really appreciate it.\" 8:10 p.m. Mr. Trump, pointing to the media said \"those people\" are \"exhausted\" from the business of his first 100 days. \"We are eradicating the criminals and cartels that have infiltrated our country,\" Mr. Trump said, listing some of his work so far.\u00a0 8:07 p.m. Mr. Trump acknowledges that China has manipulated its currency, but that the country may help with the situation in North Korea. \"I believe he wants to get that situation taken care of,\" he said of Chinese president Xi Jinping. Again, Mr. Trump criticized the media for pointing out that Mr. Trump reversed course on calling China a currency manipulator. \"You understand,\" he told the audience, about the reason for his seeming course reversal on China. 8:06 p.m. \"We are not going to let other countries take advantage of us anymore,\" Mr. Trump said, saying from now on, the policy will be \"America first. 8 p.m. Trump goes off on a rant about the \"failing\" New York Times, discussing the company's real estate history. He decries the NYT's \"nasty\" op-eds telling him how to run the country. Mr. Trump called NYT staffers, \"incompetent, dishonest people.\" Mr. Trump said the media deserves a big fat \"failing\" grade. 7:54 p.m. Mr. Trump called the media a \"disgrace,\" supported by loud boos from the audience. \"As you may know, there's another big gathering taking place tonight in Washington, D.C., did you hear about it?\" Mr. Trump said. \"A large group of Hollywood actors and Washington media are consoling each other in a hotel ballroom in our nation's capital right now. They are gathered together for the White House Correspondents Dinner without the president. And I could not possibly be more thrilled than to be more than 100 miles away from Washington's swamp, spending my evening with all of you and with a much, much larger crowd and much better people, right?\" 7:49 p.m. Mr. Trump walks on stage, amid cheers and people clamoring to capture the moment on their phones. 7:48 p.m. \"He's putting Iran on notice,\" Pence said of the president, adding that he's standing strong in regards to North Korea. \"Thanks to president Donald Trump, ISIS is on the run\" in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, Pence said. 7:45 p.m. Chants of \"build the wall, build the wall\" break out after Pence says the president is keeping his commitment to tough immigration policies. 7:42 p.m. Chants of \"U.S.A., U.S.A\" break out after Pence announces Mr. Trump's latest executive order on trade, signed in Pennsylvania Saturday night. Pence says Mr. Trump will not relent until Obamacare is repealed and replaced. He adds that more than \"500,000 jobs\" have been created since the beginning of the year in America. 7:39 p.m. Vice President Mike Pence takes the stage, saying, \"Hello, Pennsylvania!\" CBSN Originals recently\u00a0returned to Erie, Pennsylvania to reconnect with locals who hoped a fresh approach in Washington would bring about change in their struggling home town. Airing on May 21 at 8 p.m. EST, \"America | Redefining Hope\" looks at how that hope has evolved. Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0-- The start of a new administration is never a clean slate, even when parties flip. Day One is just another day for military operations, a budget that is still in place from the old crowd and a vast array of economic, social and law enforcement initiatives left over from the last president. You would not know this from President Donald Trump. He loudly and proudly takes credit for any positive development that has bloomed since he took office Jan. 20, even when the roots and buds of it were from President Barack Obama\u2019s time. In his speech to Congress and other remarks in recent days, Trump has claimed credit for: -Big savings in an F-35 fighter jet contract that were in motion well before he became president. -Corporate job announcements that also had been months or longer in the making. -An infusion of money from NATO partners that has not materialized at all, but reflects a long-standing intent by some members to increase their military capabilities. -A tough-on-criminals approach to immigration enforcement that was planned and put into place during Obama\u2019s presidency. -A $12 billion drop in the U.S. debt, a routine blip traced to the regular timing of tax payments and other fiscal factors unconnected to any president. -His plan to restore military supremacy, though he inherited military capabilities that are already second to none. Trump does, though, seek to shift some responsibility to the last administration for an operation he authorized that did not go smoothly - the covert mission in Yemen in which a Navy SEAL and civilians were killed. That mission \u201cwas started before I got here,\u201d Trump said. It can take months for a new president to pile up achievements or failures that are truly his own. A look at a selection of his statements from the past week: TRUMP: Speaking of the NATO alliance, \u201cOur partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice. Very nice.\u201d THE FACTS: No new money has come pouring in from NATO allies. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made a strong case when he met with allied defense ministers at a NATO gathering last month, pressing them to meet their 2014 commitment to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024. Mattis and other leaders said the allies understood the message and there was some discussion about working out plans to meet the goal. Only five of the 28 member countries currently meet the 2 percent level, and no new commitments have been made since the NATO meeting. Others in the alliance have routinely said they will work toward the increase. In any event, the commitment is for these nations to spend more on their own military capabilities, which would strengthen the alliance, not to hand over money. TRUMP: \u201cAccording to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America\u2019s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.\u201d THE FACTS: That\u2019s not exactly what that report says. It says immigrants \u201ccontribute to government finances by paying taxes and add expenditures by consuming public services.\u201d The report found that while first-generation immigrants are more expensive to governments than their native-born counterparts, primarily at the state and local level, immigrants\u2019 children \u201care among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population.\u201d This second generation contributed more in taxes on a per capita basis, for example, than did the rest of the population in the period studied, 1994-2013. The report found that the \u201clong-run fiscal impact\u201d of immigrants and their children would probably be seen as more positive \u201cif their role in sustaining labor force growth and contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial activity were taken into account.\u201d TRUMP: \u201cWe\u2019ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price\u201d of the F-35 jet fighter. THE FACTS: The cost savings he persists in bragging about were secured in full or in large part before he became president. The head of the Air Force program announced significant price reductions in the contract for the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet Dec. 19 - after Trump had tweeted about the cost but weeks before Trump met the company\u2019s CEO about it. Pentagon managers took action even before the election to save money on the contract. Todd Harrison, a defense analyst and aerospace specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, \u201cI don\u2019t see any evidence to suggest that President Trump had anything to do with this.\u201d TRUMP: \u201cSince my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Wal-Mart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.\u201d THE FACTS: Trump is taking credit for corporate jobs decisions that largely predate his election. In the case of Intel, construction of the factory in Chandler, Arizona, that Trump referred to actually began during Obama\u2019s presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel\u2019s high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Some of the job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their numbers of workers. More important, even as some companies create jobs, others are laying off workers. The best measure of whether more jobs are actually being created is the monthly employment report issued by the Labor Department, which nets out those gains and losses. The department will issue its report for February, the first full month of Trump\u2019s term, on March 10. TRUMP: His budget plan will offer \u201cone of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.\u201d THE FACTS: Three times in recent years, Congress raised defense budgets by larger percentages than the $54 billion, or 10 percent, increase that Trump proposes. The base defense budget grew by $41 billion, or 14.3 percent, in 2002; by $37 billion, or 11.3 percent, in 2003, and by $47 billion, or 10.9 percent, in 2008, according to Defense Department figures. And going back farther, his increase doesn\u2019t come close to ones in the defense budget seen in the early 1980s, when they hit 20 percent or more, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. TRUMP: \u201cNinety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.\u201d THE FACTS: That\u2019s true, but for the vast majority of them, it\u2019s because they choose to be. That 94 million figure includes everyone age 16 and older who doesn\u2019t have a job and isn\u2019t looking for one. It also includes retirees, parents who are staying home to raise children, and high school and college students who are studying rather than working. They are unlikely to work regardless of the state of the economy. With the huge baby boomer generation reaching retirement age and many of them retiring, the population of those out of the labor force is increasing and will continue to do so, economists forecast. It\u2019s true that some of those out of the workforce are of working age and have given up looking for work. But that number is probably a small fraction of the 94 million Trump cited. The nation\u2019s unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent, near the lowest in a decade. TRUMP: \u201cOur Navy is now the smallest it\u2019s been since, believe or not, World War I. Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s going to soon be the largest it\u2019s been.\u201d THE FACTS: No, the fleet is not growing to the largest it\u2019s been, or anything close. The fleet indeed shrank to its smallest size since the decade after World War I - bottoming out at 271 in 2015 before rising to 274 this year, compared with 139 in 1930. But that number alone is not that meaningful. The nature of warfare has changed since the naval battles of the world wars; the rise of air power is just one significant factor. As well, for the past few decades the Navy has dramatically increased the warfighting effectiveness of its ships, meaning it can do more with far fewer vessels than it could during the Cold War, for example. The fleet stood at a record high of 6,768 fighting ships during World War II, declined gradually in the 1950s and 1960s and dropped significantly after the Vietnam War. During the 1990s the number fell from the high 500s to the mid-300s as the Navy decommissioned many older ships and the U.S. reaped a \u201cpeace dividend\u201d from the end of the Cold War. The count includes aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, amphibious assault ships and other large combat ships. The fleet may grow more than planned if Trump\u2019s military expansion is approved by Congress. But no one is talking about matching - much less exceeding - the enormous armada of another age. The number of Navy personnel has fallen over time, too, from more than 725,000 in 1954 to about 323,000 now. It\u2019s unlikely to grow anywhere near that higher level. TRUMP: \u201cAccording to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home - from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.\u201d THE FACTS: It\u2019s unclear what Justice Department data he\u2019s citing, but the most recent government information doesn\u2019t back up his claim. Just over half the people Trump talks about were born in the United States, according to Homeland Security Department research. That report said of 82 people the government determined were inspired by a foreign terrorist group to attempt or carry out an attack in the U.S., just over half were native-born citizens. Even the attacks Trump singled out weren\u2019t entirely the work of foreigners. Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his Pakistani wife killed 14 people in the 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, was born in Chicago. It\u2019s true that in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, the FBI\u2019s primary concern was with terrorists from overseas feared to be plotting attacks in the United States. But that\u2019s no longer the case. The FBI and the Justice Department have been preoccupied with violent extremists from inside the U.S. who are inspired by the calls to violence and mayhem of the Islamic State group. The Justice Department has prosecuted scores of IS-related cases since 2014, and many of the defendants are U.S. citizens. TRUMP on military capability: \u201cWe are going to have very soon the finest equipment in the world.\u201d THE FACTS: Pentagon leaders have said for years that the U.S. already has the world\u2019s best weaponry and military equipment. They sometimes claim the U.S. is in danger of losing its advantage unless the Congress continues to spend heavily to develop and build new generations of weapons. The Navy\u2019s top officer, Adm. John Richardson, has said repeatedly that the Navy is the world\u2019s finest. He also has said the Navy must adapt to a world of changing security threats. Richardson\u2019s main focus has been on sharpening and changing the way sailors think about the nature of war, rather than relying on bigger budgets. \u201cWe will not be able to \u2018buy\u2019 our way out of the challenges that we face,\u201d he wrote in a January 2016 plan for maintaining U.S. naval superiority.",

We look at why CoreCivic expects to gain from the White House\u2019s immigration policy. Dimmed prospects Five days after President Trump signed his travel ban, a young Iraqi named Layth Baheej wiped away tears as he took the oath of citizenship and listened to a U.S. immigration official in Baltimore welcoming him to be a full participant in American democracy. Four of his siblings were killed in the war, and Baheej hopes he\u2019ll be able to bring his surviving siblings and his parents to join him here, but Mr. Trump\u2019s ban has cast a shadow over those hopes. Haley\u2019s stand The new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, has already made it crystal clear \u00a0she seeks a reset at the world body -- dampening its longstanding anti-Israel bias. Tight bond Wednesday\u2019s meeting between President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu underscored the critical -- if complex -- relationship between the two countries. We look at how the U.S. and Israel are intertwined on the economic front, from military aid to tech linkages. Endangered reform? President Trump derides the financial reform law known as Dodd-Frank as a \u201cdisaster,\u201d while Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen this week said the 2010 rules have made U.S. banks safer. At least the two might agree on this: Dodd-Frank is making an impact on Americans\u2019 lives. We explore where the law has succeeded and where it has fallen short of its stated goals.

Date stamps such as \u201cbest by,\u201d \u201csell by,\u201d \u201cuse by\u201d and \u201cbest before\u201d can be confusing for shoppers. Trade groups are moving to reduce those \u201cexpiration\u201d labels to just two: \u00a0\u201cuse by\u201d and \u201cbest if used by.\u201d They say that would not only reduce consumer confusion, but also keep people from wasting perfectly good food.

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump mounted an aggressive defense of his young presidency Thursday, lambasting reports that his campaign advisers had inappropriate contact with Russian officials and vowing to crack down on the leaking of classified information. Nearly a month into his presidency, Trump insisted in a free-wheeling White House news conference that his new administration had made \u201csignificant progress\u201d and took credit for an optimistic business climate and a rising stock market. The president denounced media reports of a chaotic start to his administration marked by his contentious executive order - rejected by a federal appeals court - to place a ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations. Trump said he would announce a \u201cnew and very comprehensive order to protect our people\u201d next week. \u201cThis administration is running like a fine-tuned machine,\u201d Trump declared in a lengthy news conference that saw the new commander in chief repeatedly interrupting reporters\u2019 questions and airing his grievances. Throughout the encounter the new president delivered recurring criticism of the news media, accusing it of being \u201cout of control\u201d and promising to take his message \u201cstraight to the people.\u201d He dismissed recent reports in The New York Times and on CNN that Trump campaign aides had been in contact with Russian officials before his election. Trump called Paul Manafort, his former campaign manager who has ties to Ukraine and Russia, a \u201crespected man.\u201d Pressed repeatedly, Trump said that \u201cnobody that I know of\u201d on his campaign staff had contacted Russian officials. He called such reports a \u201cruse\u201d and said he had \u201cnothing to do with Russia.\u201d Trump added, \u201cRussia is fake news. This is fake news put out by the media.\u201d Amid reports of widespread leaks within his administration, Trump also warned that he would clamp down on the dissemination of sensitive information, saying he had asked the Justice Department to investigate. \u201cThose are criminal leaks,\u201d adding, \u201cThe leaks are real. The news is fake.\u201d He blamed any problems on the outgoing Obama administration. \u201cI inherited a mess at home and abroad - a mess,\u201d Trump said. Democrats said Trump\u2019s refusal to say for sure that his campaign staff wasn\u2019t in contact in the Kremlin underscored the need for an independent investigation through a special congressional select committee, a commission styled after the review of the 9/11 attacks or an independent counsel from the Justice Department. \u201cHis silence speaks volumes,\u201d said Adrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee. The president announced that Alexander Acosta, the dean of the Florida International University law school, would be his nominee for Labor secretary. That came a day after fast-food executive Andrew Puzder withdrew his nomination for Labor after losing support among Republican senators. Trump, a reality television star and real estate mogul who was elected as an outsider intent on change, said his ousted national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was \u201cjust doing his job\u201d in talking with Russian officials before the inauguration. But he said he was \u201cnot happy\u201d with how Flynn described his phone call with a Russian diplomat to Vice President Mike Pence. Trump knew for weeks that Flynn had misled Pence but did not inform the vice president, according to a timeline of events supplied by the White House. Trump said he had identified a strong replacement for Flynn, which made the decision to let him go easier. Trump is said to favor Vice Admiral Robert Harward, a former Navy SEAL, as his next national security adviser, according to a White House official. Harward met with top White House officials last week and has the backing of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. He was meeting with officials later Thursday. Addressing immigration, one of the biggest issues of the past campaign, Trump said it was difficult dealing with the policy known as DACA, which allows young adults to get work permits and Social Security numbers and protects them from deportation. Referring to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals rule, he said he would \u201cdeal with DACA with heart.\u201d While Trump has promised to halt illegal immigration as a cornerstone of his administration, he has also promised to focus on people who have committed crimes. He said he had the \u201cbest lawyers\u201d working on the policy now and the \u201cnew executive order is being tailored to the decision we got from the court.\u201d Earlier in the day, Trump had a breakfast meeting with some of his staunchest House supporters. The White House has said Trump asked for Flynn\u2019s resignation because he had misled Vice President Mike Pence over his dealings with Russia and whether he had discussed sanctions with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. before Trump\u2019s Jan. 20 inauguration. Flynn previously had denied those conversations to Pence and other top officials. On Thursday, he warned in a pair of tweets that \u201clow-life leakers\u201d of classified information will be caught. As journalists were being escorted out of the breakfast meeting, Trump responded to a reporter\u2019s question on the subject by saying: \u201cWe\u2019re going to find the leakers\u201d and \u201cthey\u2019re going to pay a big price.\u201d",

            "article_content": "It\u2019s easy to see parallels between President Donald Trump and France\u2019s presidential candidate Marine Le Pen. They\u2019re both populist politicians who have railed against free trade, talk tough on immigration, have questioned the role of NATO, and advocate closer ties to Russia.  But Anderson Cooper, who interviewed Le Pen for this week\u2019s 60 Minutes, says not so fast. \u201cIt\u2019s too easy to just say Marine Le Pen is France\u2019s Donald Trump,\u201d Cooper tells 60 Minutes Overtime\u2019s Ann Silvio in the video posted above. \u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d \u00a0 For starters, Trump was a political outsider, whereas Le Pen has been steeped in politics since childhood. Her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, ran for president five times and is notorious in France for remarks widely seen as racist and anti-Semitic. \u201cHer father is a reviled figure in France,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cMarine Le Pen said that when she was a kid, her teachers used to take their hatred of her father out on her. And so she had to develop this toughness early on-- and you do feel that.\u201d Cooper, who has spent time interviewing both Mr. Trump and Le Pen, sees a marked difference between their personalities and campaign styles. \u201cIn a personal way, they really could not be any more different,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cDonald Trump is a charismatic figure. Charming when he wants to be.\u201d Also, his ability to speak extemporaneously in interviews and speeches is a big part of his appeal to his supporters.\u00a0 \u201cShe is much more practiced,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cEverything about her presentation is very practiced. She\u2019s a politician. She\u2019s a professional politician.\u201d After spending time with her for this week\u2019s 60 Minutes story, Cooper says he couldn\u2019t get a strong sense of Le Pen as a person. Still, Cooper feels Le Pen and her presidential campaign in France are worth watching \u2014 and worthy of a 60 Minutes profile. \u201cShe\u2019s a fascinating character,\u201d Cooper says. A character, he learned, who sees herself as part of a growing tide of nationalism that is skeptical of free trade and open borders sweeping the West, after Britain\u2019s vote to leave the E.U. and the victory of Donald Trump in the U.S.\u00a0 Le Pen sees the modern political fault lines not as left vs. right, but rather, she says, between those who support what she calls \u201cwild, savage globalization\u201d and those who don\u2019t. Le Pen says this \u201csavage globalization\u201d has ravaged France\u2019s economy, stripped France of its sovereignty and led to an influx of immigrants that she believes are changing the national character of the country. And while she isn\u2019t talking of building a wall, she advocates much tougher immigration laws, and a radical shift in France\u2019s foreign policy, including renegotiating its place in the European Union, or else holding a referendum to leave altogether. French journalist Thierry Arnaud says if Le Pen wins the presidency, the impact could soon be felt across Europe. \u201cThe potential result of Marine Le Pen winning this presidential election is the end of the European Union as we know it,\u201d Arnaud tells Cooper in the clip above. \u201cThe end of 27 countries being closely united in a number of areas. And the end of the single currency, the euro.\u201d Arnaud says that, like Trump, Le Pen is succeeding by painting a dark vision, a vision that appeals to people who feel that their way of life, their culture, is disappearing. \u201cAnd what Marine Le Pen is telling those people is, \u2018I\u2019m the one who can bring it back.\u2019\u201d But as Cooper and the 60 Minutes crew discovered, the French are decidedly mixed in their opinion of Le Pen. While filming an interview with Le Pen outside the building she grew up in, a crowd gathered, stunned to see her in person. After Le Pen left, a woman walking her dog approached Cooper to tell him, as he recalls, that Le Pen \u201cwill never be president of France. We hate her\u201d \u201cNow, that\u2019s just one person,\u201d Cooper says, \u201cbut it\u2019s just interesting the kind of frenzy and the furor and, in many cases, fear that follow her wherever she goes.\u201d The video above was produced by Ann Silvio and Lisa Orlando, and edited by Lisa Orlando.

            "article_content": "President Trump and White House officials have claimed in recent days that his administration has accomplished a lot in the first month, but their remarks exaggerate what has been done so far.  \u201cI hear your demands, I hear your voices and I promise you I will deliver. I promise that. And by the way, you\u2019ve seen what we\u2019ve accomplished in a very short period of time. The White House is running so smoothly. So smoothly,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a rally that was more campaign-like in Melbourne, Florida this month.  The White House, however, has in the first month of the Trump administration seen the resignation of the president\u2019s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, earlier this month, after officials discovered he had misled Vice President Mike Pence, and his executive order banning citizens from seven countries from traveling to the U.S. has been stayed by courts while the legality of the ban is settled. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare, but Congress has still not coalesced around a tangible plan. He has also not yet submitted a budget blueprint to Congress either, though Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney says it will be released on March 16. There has been no movement yet on a tax reform package or an infrastructure package, and Congress has yet to take action related to Mr. Trump\u2019s border wall plan. Mr. Trump is set to deliver an address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night where he\u2019s expected to outline his plans for the rest of the year and he might tout his accomplishments so far. Here\u2019s what he has done: Promised Mar. 20, 2016: \u201cI\u2019m going to get a list of anywhere from five to 10 judges, and those are going to be the judges that I\u2019m going to put in, it will be one of those judges, and I will guarantee it personally, like we do in the world of business, which we don\u2019t like to do too often,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut I will guarantee it that those are going to be the first judges that I put up for nomination if I win.\u201d In late January, the president nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch to be the next Supreme Court justice, to fill the seat left vacant by Justice Antonin Scalia who suddenly died in February 2016.  \u201cI am a man of my word, I will do as I say, something that the American people have been asking for from Washington for a very, very long time,\u201d Mr. Trump said during announcement. \u201cToday I am keeping another promise to the American people by nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch ... to be of the United States Supreme Court.\u201d The Senate Judiciary Committee will kick off the confirmation hearing for Gorsuch on March 20.  Promised June 28, 2016: \u201cI am going to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which has not yet been ratified,\u201d Mr. Trump promised in a trade speech in Pennsylvania. \u00a0 Within his first few days in office, Mr. Trump signed a presidential memoranda that withdrew the U.S. from the giant trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was negotiated by President Obama. He had also announced his intentions to renegotiate NAFTA, as he had promised to do during the election. From Trump \u201cContract with the American Voter:\u201d \u201cbegin removing the more than two million criminal illegal immigrants from the country and cancel visas to foreign countries that won\u2019t take them back.\u201d\u00a0 Last week, the Department of Homeland Security issued two memos that will likely expand the number of immigrants detained or deported as part the administration\u2019s crackdown on undocumented immigrants in the U.S. The memos were intended to implement President Trump\u2019s immigration actions from January and enforce existing immigration law. One of the provisions suggested that individuals apprehended in the U.S. and deemed inadmissible would need to prove that they have been in the U.S. continuously for two years. Otherwise, they could be subject to expedited removal with no court proceeding.  A DHS official dismissed the idea that these actions would lead to mass deportations. While the official said immigration officers would prioritize undocumented immigrants who are criminals, the official said that it doesn\u2019t mean that everyone else is exempt from potential enforcement. The president made no promises about the Mexico City policy, but he did say during his campaign that he favored anti-abortion policies. Mr. Trump issued a memorandum that reinstated the Mexico City policy, introduced in 1984 by President Ronald Reagan, which bans the granting of U.S. funding to health providers internationally that discuss abortion as a family planning option. Since the Reagan administration, Democrats have rescinded the policy and Republicans have reinstated it. The memorandum directed the secretary of state to ensure that \u201cU.S. taxpayer dollars do not fund organizations or programs that support or participate in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.\u201d Democrats have called the policy a \u201cglobal gag rule\u201d and have blasted the president for taking this action. Mr. Trump promised in October that he would \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d and institute a lobbying ban.\u00a0 Mr. Trump signed an executive order that bans administration officials from ever lobbying the U.S. on behalf of a foreign government again and imposes a five-year ban on people lobbying the agency they previously worked for. Another part of the order said that for two years, appointees must avoid working on issues involving their former clients or employees. From Trump \u201cContract with the American Voter:\u201d Promises \u201ca hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce the federal workforce through attrition\u201d (exempting military, public safety, and public health) Mr. Trump imposed a freeze on all federal civilian employees \u201cacross the board\u201d in the executive branch. Starting last month, no vacant positions were allowed to be filled and no new positions could be created \u201cexcept in limited circumstances.\u201d The memorandum does not apply to military personnel, and it instructed the director of the Office of Management and Budget to develop a long-term plan \u201cto reduce the size of the federal government\u2019s workforce through attrition.\u201d From Trump \u201cContract with the American Voter:\u201d Lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward.\u201d The president signed memoranda that attempt to renew the process for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which was halted by Mr. Obama, and the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline. For the Keystone pipeline, the action invites TransCanada to \u201cre-submit\u201d an application for a presidential permit for the construction and operation of the pipeline that would carry petroleum from Canada into the U.S. The memorandum on the Dakota Access pipeline called it a \u201csubstantial, multi-billion-dollar private investment in our nation\u2019s energy infrastructure\u201d and would carry about 500,000 barrels of crude oil from different areas in North Dakota to oil markets in the U.S. The Army Corps of Engineers announced in December that it would explore an alternate route for the pipeline after the Standing Rock Sioux tribe said the pipeline interfered with their drinking water, which led to massive protests.

            "article_content": "The fashion world got political Thursday, when former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton used a stamp dedication ceremony honoring Oscar de la Renta to highlight the contributions of immigrants to America. At a U.S. Postal Service ceremony meant to reveal a line of 11 stamps to the Dominican fashion designer, Clinton noted de la Renta\u2019s immigrant roots.  \u201cOscar de la Renta was an immigrant \u2026 And aren\u2019t we proud and grateful that he was?\u201d she said during her speech, held at Grand Central Station\u2019s Vanderbilt Hall in New York. She noted that the stamps also say \u201cUSA Forever.\u201d \u201cLet there be many, many more immigrants with the love of America that Oscar de la Renta exemplified every single day,\u201d the former first lady said.  De la Renta, who had designed clothes for every first lady from Jacqueline Kennedy to Michelle Obama, died in 2014 at the age of 82. At the dedication ceremony, Clinton wore a signature de la Renta cashmere wool coat.  While she did not explicitly mention President Trump\u2019s court-challenged travel ban\u00a0nor the recent immigration crackdowns nationwide, Clinton, a former secretary of state, seemed to take swipes at her former rival\u2019s policies.  De la Renta, she said at one point, was \u201ca fitting person to be chosen by our Postal Service \u2014 mentioned, by the way, in the Constitution, something we should all read and reread in today\u2019s times.\u201d Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who himself pondered a third-party run in the 2016 presidential election, made a much more explicitly political statement Thursday at the ceremony.  \u201cOur country is great because we welcome people from around the world. They come here to work hard and build a better future for their families, no matter where they come from,\u201d he said. Bloomberg noted that de la Renta was able to speak out \u201cin support of fixing our broken immigration system so that more people would have a chance to make it in America just the way he did.\u201d Meanwhile, immigrants across the country stayed home from work and school Thursday to demonstrate how important they are to America\u2019s economy and its way of life, and many businesses closed in solidarity, in a \u201cDay Without Immigrants\u201d protest.",

            "article_content": "President Trump\u00a0threatened to cancel a meeting with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto that was supposed to be next week, following the foreign leader\u2019s statements Wednesday night that he was reconsidering his visit to the United States. But then Pe\u00f1a Nieto beat him to the punch.\u00a0 Congressional leaders are considering legislation to fund President Trump\u2019s proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border -- House Speaker Paul Ryan told MSNBC\u2019s Greta Van Susteren Congress would front the money. \u201cFirst off, we\u2019re going to pay for it and front the money up,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cBut I do think that there are various ways -- as you know, I know your follow-up question is, is Mexico going to pay for the wall? There are a lot of different ways of getting Mexico to contribute to doing this. And there are different ways of defining how, exactly they pay for it.\u201d \u00a0 White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Thursday President Trump is proposing a 20 percent tax on imports, particularly on products and services from Mexico, so that revenues could be used to pay for the construction of Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed wall along the U.S. southern border. Later in the afternoon, however, Spicer and White House chief of staff Reince Priebus told reporters that the proposal was in fact just one of several options the White House was considering, including a border tax in the range of 5 - 20 percent. \u201cIt is part of a buffet of options,\u201d White House chief of staff Reince Priebus told reporters, according to CBS News\u2019 Margaret Brennan. In an\u00a0interview with The New York Times\u00a0published Thursday, Stephen Bannon said that the media is the \u201copposition party\u201d of the new administration and \u201cshould be embarrassed and humiliated\u201d by the unanticipated election result. The article cites Bannon as referring to himself at one point as \u201cDarth Vader.\u201d Mr. Trump headed up to Philadelphia to visit the Republican House and Senate retreat. He began by ribbing Republican leaders about their pre-Trump electoral losses and then touched on a number of topics, including his executive actions. He assured the American people that they \u201cwill not pay for the wall.\u201d And he said he\u2019s working on a tax reform bill that would include making Mexico foot the bill for the wall \u201cif we decide to go that route.\u201d Mr. Trump also commented on the executive order he signed on immigration Wednesday, saying that it means the \u201cimmediate removal of criminal aliens\u201d and \u201ccracking down on sanctuary cities.\u201d President Trump blasted Chelsea Manning in an early morning tweet Thursday, calling the convicted Army leaker an \u201cungrateful TRAITOR\u201d who he said should \u201cnever have been released from prison.\u201d The president also charged that Manning had called former President Obama a \u201cweak leader,\u201d though the transgender soldier -- whose prison commutation was one of\u00a0Mr. Obama\u2019s last acts in the Oval Office\u00a0-- didn\u2019t exactly say that.\u00a0 The president will be signing an executive action today at 4:30 p.m. (canceled) Mr. Trump was initially expected to roll out an executive action on voter fraud today, but that has now been postponed and the timing for its release is unclear. \u201cIt will be a follow up on the announcement yesterday of his commitment to better understand voter fraud, faulty registration, etcetera,\u201d Spicer told reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday, CBS News Steven Portnoy reports. A day after Mr. Trump signed an immigration executive action targeting sanctuary cities, the Miami-Dade mayor dropped his city\u2019s status as a sanctuary city.\u00a0 President Trump said in an\u00a0interview airing Wednesday\u00a0that he has asked intelligence officials about the use of enhanced interrogation techniques on terror suspects. The answer he\u2019s received: Torture \u201cworks.\u201d Mr. Trump\u00a0said he was told by intelligence officials that torture \u201cworks,\u201d though he\u2019ll defer to the recommendations of his defense secretary, James Mattis and CIA director, Mike Pompeo. The math doesn\u2019t add up for Mr. Trump\u2019s claims of pipeline jobs. As he signed executive actions Tuesday advancing the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, he remarked it would mean 28,000 jobs \u2013 \u201cgreat construction jobs.\u201d President Trump\u00a0signed two executive orders during a visit to the Department of Homeland Security. The first executive order calls for the construction of a \u201clarge physical barrier on the southern border,\u201d while the second reinstates the Secure Communities Program, which Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) uses to \u201ctarget illegal immigrants for removal.\u201d It also directs the State Department to withhold visas or take other measures to ensure countries take back deported undocumented immigrants and also strips federal grant money from sanctuary cities that harbor undocumented immigrants. Mr. Trump told ABC News that\u00a0construction of the wall\u00a0will begin in \u201cmonths.\u201d \u201cAs soon as we can, as soon as we can physically do it,\u201d he told ABC News in an interview. \u201cI would say in months, yeah. I would say in months -- certainly planning is starting immediately.\u201d Sanctuary cities were also targeted in that executive order -- it said it would withhold federal grant money from sanctuary cities. \u00a0What is a sanctuary city and how might those cities be affected by the order?\u00a0 Rather than backing away from roundly debunked claims of widespread voter fraud, Mr. Trump on Wendesday\u00a0tweeted a promise to launch an investigation\u00a0into the massive voter fraud he belives robbed him of the popular vote. Republicans and Democrats have been unusually aligned on dismissing the premise of the fraud Mr. Trump alleges took place. In a tweet, Mr. Trump stated that he would\u00a0unveil his Supreme Court nominee\u00a0to fill the seat left vacant by Antonin Scalia pick next Thursday.",

            "article_content": "Stocks slid Monday after President Donald Trump restricted immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations, a move that underscored the administration\u2019s proposals to erect barriers to foreign trade. The retreat pulled the Dow Jones industrial average below 20,000, a milestone it had hit only last Wednesday amid the market rally that has greeted Mr. Trump\u2019s ascension to the presidency. At Monday\u2019s market close, the Dow was down 0.6 percent, to 19,922. The S&P 500 index also was off 0.6 percent and the Nasdaq composite index percent descended 0.8 percent. European markets also closed markedly lower. Britain\u2019s\u00a0FTSE 100 slid 0.9 percent, Germany\u2019s DAX drooped 1.1 percent and France\u2019s CAC 40 stumbled 1.1%. The president\u2019s quick action, while in keeping with his campaign rhetoric, nevertheless took many investors by surprise and deepened unease and uncertainty about the U.S.\u2019s economic landscape in the Trump era. The shock value of Mr. Trump\u2019s sudden action unsettled the markets, said Andy Kapyrin, director of research at RegentAtlantic Capital in Morristown, N.J. \u201cHe shoots from the hip and investors realized that the checks and balance\u201d in Washington are not restraining him, Kapyrin said. In a week or so, he said, \u201ccooler heads\u201d in Washington should prevail and the markets will adjust. \u00a0 While the travel ban is not directly linked to economic matters, it highlighted in investors\u2019 minds that the White House is serious about trade protection, noted Kevin Nicholson, chief market strategist at RiverFront Investment Group in Richmond, Va.\u00a0 In Mr. Trump\u2019s first week in office, he and his team spoke of slapping a 20 percent tariff on Mexican goods and, amid the rancor, \u00a0a meeting between the president and Mexico\u2019s leader was scratched. There also was talk of punitive measures against China, and even preventing Chinese access to the naval bases it is building in the South China Sea. Although the Trump decision unnerved some investors, Nicholas Atkeson, managing director at US Capital Wealth Management in San Francisco, said he views the market pullback as a corrective action after a strong rally. \u201cSome 80 percent of the stocks we follow are overbought,\u201d he said. Atkeson pointed out that expectations for corporate earnings, now being reported, are good -- which should help stocks up ahead. \u00a0 Three sectors that had benefited a lot in the post-election rally endured the biggest falls on Monday. For the S&P 500, they were financials (down 0.8 percent), energy (off 1.8 percent) and materials, like steel and cement (negative 1 percent). \u201cThis is a healthy pullback,\u201d said Eric Marshall, a portfolio manager for the Hodges Funds.\u201dWe\u2019ve been 150 days without a 5 percent correction, the second longest in a decade.\u201d Air carriers on Monday saw their shares fall sharply on the news of the travel ban. American Airlines (AAL) was down 4.4 percent, Delta Air Lines (DAL) dropped 4.1 percent and United Continental Holdings (UAL) dipped 3.6 percent.\u00a0 Another factor, of course, was Sunday\u2019s crippling computer outage at Delta that forced the cancellation of at least 150 flights.Delta flights resumed Monday. The Sunday incident \u00a0followed a similar problem at United a week ago, which grounded much of its domestic fleet, and another in October. On the Dow, the stock with the largest weighting, Goldman Sachs (GS), dropped 1.4 percent, while the biggest loser was chemical maker du Pont (DD), which was down 2.2 percent.

            "article_content": "LONDON -- Anger and dismay, along with congratulations from Europe\u2019s far-right, rippled across the world Sunday as politicians, community leaders and even a sports star reacted to the entry ban President Donald Trump imposed on refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations. As the realization sank in that people with dual-citizenship who live outside the targeted Mideast and African countries would be affected, condemnation mixed with concern about families with traveling members who could be prevented from returning to the United States they call home. Olympic long-distance running champion Mo Farah - born in Somalia, citizen and knight of Britain, U.S. resident and currently training in Ethiopia - wondered how he would tell his children that \u201cdaddy might not be able to come home.\u201d The ban, Farah said in a statement on his Facebook page, \u201ccomes from a place of ignorance and prejudice\u201d and \u201cseems to have made me an alien.\u201d On 1st January this year, Her Majesty The Queen made me a Knight of the Realm. On 27th January, President Donald Trump... Etihad Airways, the United Arab Emirates\u2019 national airline, said some of its passengers were affected by the new policies and like other major airlines, was working closely with American officials on the matter. Leaders of Britain and Germany joined other American allies in criticizing Trump\u2019s entry ban, even as some far-right politicians expressed hope the move would inspire similar measures in Europe. British Prime Minister Theresa May does \u201cnot agree\u201d with Trump\u2019s order and will challenge the U.S. government if it has an adverse effect on British nationals, a spokesman said. The official comment came after May said during a meeting Saturday with Turkish leaders the decision was a matter solely for the U.S. Her main political rival, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, called for Trump to be banned from visiting Britain until the temporary travel restrictions are rescinded. A petition on the British Parliament\u2019s website attracted hundreds of thousands of signatures backing its call for Trump, who has been invited to meet Queen Elizabeth II, to be barred on the basis of misogyny and vulgarity.  The petition had more than half a million signatures by Sunday afternoon. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has drawn fire for her government\u2019s welcoming refugee policies, also regretted the ban. Merkel raised the issue during a phone call with Trump Saturday, citing the 1951 Geneva Refugee Convention that calls on signatories to take in people fleeing war, spokesman Steffen Seibert said. \u201cShe is convinced that even the necessary, resolute fight against terrorism doesn\u2019t justify putting people of a particular origin or particular faith under general suspicion,\u201d Seibert said. He said Germany\u2019s government \u201cwill now examine what consequences the U.S. government\u2019s measures have for German citizens with dual citizenship and, if necessary, represent their interests toward our American partners.\u201d The order Trump issued Friday includes a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen, and a 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program. Influential Iraqi cleric Muqtada al-Sadr reacted by suggesting all Americans should be forced out of Iraq in retaliation, according to a statement from his office. The European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, also was sharp in her criticism of Trump\u2019s move. \u201cAll men are first and foremost human beings, with their inalienable rights,\u201d Mogherini wrote in a blog post. She added: \u201cIt feels so strange that we need to restate this, just days after Holocaust Remembrance Day.\u201d In contrast, nationalist and far-right groups in Europe applauded the restrictions and said they should be used a model for the continent. The Dutch anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders said in a tweet: \u201cWell done POTUS it\u2019s the only way to stay safe + free. I would do the same. Hope you\u2019ll add more Islamic countries like Saudi Arabia soon.\u201d The far-right National Democratic Party in Germany celebrated \u201cthe massive restriction on the entry of pseudo-refugees and Muslims to the USA.\u201d In Italy, the leader of the anti-immigrant Northern League party also expressed admiration. \u201cWhat Trump\u2019s doing on the other side of the ocean, I\u2019d like it done also here,\u201d Matteo Salvini told reporters. Referring to the hundreds of thousands of asylum-seekers and economic migrants rescued while crossing the Mediterranean and brought to Italy in recent years, Salvini said there is \u201can invasion underway which needs to be blocked.\u201d He is pressing for early elections and courting other far-right leaders for a possible campaign coalition. Italy\u2019s Interior Minister Marco Minniti, who had held top security roles in recent governments, warned against \u201cequating immigration and terrorism.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s be careful,\u201d he said in a speech Sunday to officials from the main government coalition party, the Democrats. \u201cDissatisfaction and marginalization becomes the culture terrain of terrorism.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Consumers, fired up by the #DeleteUber campaign on social media, are eager to show their anger toward President Donald Trump by switching allegiance to rival Lyft. But doing so may benefit prominent Trump supporters Peter Thiel and Carl Icahn, billionaires who have invested in the second-largest ride-hailing company. Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal (PYPL), was an early backer of the president and spoke on his behalf at the Republican National Convention. Now an adviser to Mr. Trump, Thiel has been mentioned as a potential Supreme Court nominee. He invested in Lyft through Founders Fund, his venture capital firm.\u00a0 The 80-year-old Icahn is one of Wall Street\u2019s best-known activist investors and in 2015 bought a $100 million stake in Lyft. Icahn Capital\u2019s John Christodoro represents his interest on the Lyft board. Icahn is an unpaid advisor to the Trump administration on overhauling government regulations. \u00a0 Lyft has tried to put some distance between itself and its investors. \u201cWe don\u2019t always agree with our investors and aren\u2019t afraid to say so,\u201d the company told CNBC. \u201cWe do respect their right, and that of every American, to freedom of expression.\u201d\u00a0 Uber came under fire last Saturday when it quit offering surge pricing after members of the Taxi Worker\u2019s Alliance joined protests at New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport over Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order restricting immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries. Complaints soon flooded Twitter (TWTR), accusing the San Francisco-based company of profiting off protesting cab drivers by cutting prices, a charge that Uber denied. Critics, however, weren\u2019t impressed. Some Twitter users posted pictures of themselves deleting the Uber app and installing Lyft. To make matters worse, some users couldn\u2019t immediately shed the Uber app: the company was inundated with so many account deletions that it had to figure out how\u00a0to automate the process. Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick had already angered opponents of Mr. Trump because of his involvement with the administration through his work on a government advisory council. However, Kalanick spoke out against the administration\u2019s immigration restrictions in a\u00a0Facebook post, calling them \u201cunjust.\u201d He vowed to compensate workers for their lost earnings. He also created a $3 million dollar legal defense fund for affected drivers.\u00a0 Kalanick has never met Mr. Trump in person, an Uber spokesperson noted. The controversy is affecting the ride-hailing companies though its long-term impact isn\u2019t clear. Uber is much larger than Lyft, with a valuation topping $60 billion, while the market estimates its rival\u2019s value at less than $10 billion. According to App Annie, Lyft ranked 15th Wednesday  in its rankings of U.S. iPhone apps, an increase from 37th place on Jan. 27. That was the day before the \u201cdelete Uber\u201d campaign began. During that same time, Uber fell to 20th place from 11th. \u00a0Lyft may have topped Uber in downloads on Sunday for the first time, according to The Verge. Since Mr. Trump\u2019s election, many Fortune 500 companies have run afoul of his supporters and critics alike. Starbucks (SBUX), for instance, is in hot water with Mr. Trump\u2019s fans over CEO Howard Schultz\u2019s plan to hire 10,000 refugees globally over the next five years. Critics have questioned why the Seattle-based coffee chain was hiring foreigners at a time when many homeless veterans are struggling, apparently unaware of company\u2019s work with members of the military, their families, and veterans groups. Opponents of Mr. Trump have started\u00a0#GrabYourWallet, which encourages consumers to avoid doing business with companies that have supported the president or have business ties to him. The campaign includes more than two dozen companies so far. Jonathan Berr is an award-winning journalist and podcaster based in New Jersey whose main focus is on business and economic issues.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is set to meet with congressional leaders from both parties to discuss his agenda, as he enters his first official week in the White House and works to begin delivering on his ambitious campaign promises. Trump has said that he considers Monday to be his first real day in office. And he\u2019s packing it with meetings that suggest he\u2019s keeping an open ear. \u201cBusy week planned with a heavy focus on jobs and national security,\u201d Trump tweeted early Monday. \u201cTop executives coming in at 9:00 A.M. to talk manufacturing in America.\u201d There\u2019s a breakfast and what the White House calls a listening session with business leaders in the morning; another listening session with union leaders and workers in the afternoon; and a reception later on with the members of Congress he\u2019ll need on board to overhaul the nation\u2019s health care system, among other goals. He\u2019ll also hold his first meeting as president with the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. The outreach effort comes after a tumultuous first weekend in the White House that included lambasting news organizations for correctly reporting on the size of the crowds at his inauguration and mass protests against his presidency on the following day. Trump delivered a more unifying message Sunday and sought to reassure Americans he was up to the daunting task ahead. Speaking in the White House East Room during a swearing-in ceremony for top aides, the president warned his staff of the challenges ahead but declared he believed they were ready. \u201cBut with the faith in each other and the faith in God, we will get the job done,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will prove worthy of this moment in history. And I think it may very well be a great moment in history.\u201d Trump said his staff was in the White House not to \u201chelp ourselves\u201d but to \u201cdevote ourselves to the national good.\u201d \u201cThis is not about party, this is not about ideology. This is about country, our country. It\u2019s about serving the American people,\u201d he said. Earlier Sunday, Trump offered a scattershot response to the sweeping post-inauguration protests, first sarcastically denigrating the public opposition and then defending the right to demonstrate a short time later. \u201cWatched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election! Why didn\u2019t these people vote? Celebs hurt cause badly,\u201d Trump tweeted early Sunday morning. Ninety-five minutes later, he struck a more conciliatory tone. \u201cPeaceful protests are a hallmark of our democracy. Even if I don\u2019t always agree, I recognize the rights of people to express their views,\u201d the president tweeted, still using his personal account. Trump also spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who accepted an invitation to visit the White House in early February. The prime minister said he is hoping to forge a \u201ccommon vision\u201d with the newly inaugurated U.S. president that could include expanded settlement construction and a tougher policy toward Iran. Trump also announced that he\u2019s set up meetings with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start some negotiations having to do with NAFTA,\u201d he said of his meeting with Pena Nieto. Mexico is part of the free trade agreement with the U.S. and Canada. Trump said he also will discuss immigration and security at the border. He has promised to build a wall along the length of the southern border and insisted that Mexico will pay for it. His chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d the president would spend his first full week in office undoing some of former President Barack Obama\u2019s agenda and planned to sign executive orders on immigration and trade. Trump planned to sign some executive orders on Monday, but it was unclear which. Trump has pledged to scuttle trade deals such as a pending Asia-Pacific agreement and overturn Obama\u2019s executive order deferring deportations for 700,000 people who were brought into the country illegally as minors. Later in the week, he\u2019ll address congressional Republicans at their retreat in Philadelphia and meet with British Prime Minister Theresa May.",

            "article_content": "Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is warning that information the Obama administration collected on so-called \u201cDREAMers\u201d should be protected and not be used for deportation purposes.  Johnson made the argument in a letter released Tuesday in response to a letter more than 110 lawmakers sent to him in early December. He explained that since the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program was announced in 2012, the administration has made clear that the information collected by applicants would only be used to adjudicate requests for the program and would be safeguarded for other immigration-related purposes.  \u201cMore specifically, the U.S. government represented to applicants that the personal information they provided will not later be used for immigration enforcement purposes except where it is independently determined that a case involves a national security or public safety threat, criminal activity, fraud or limited other circumstances where issuance of a notice to appear is required by law,\u201d he wrote in the letter dated Dec. 30. \u201cWe believe these representations made by the U.S. government, upon which DACA applicants most assuredly relied, must continue to be honored,\u201d he said.  Johnson noted that there are 750,000 young people enrolled in DACA and that thousands of them have been able to enroll in colleges and universities through the program and eventually contribute to the U.S. economy. While he didn\u2019t name President-elect Donald Trump or his policy positions announced on the campaign trail, Johnson\u2019s warning was clearly made to Mr. Trump who discussed deporting undocumented immigrants during the election.  Several Democrats are not satisfied, however, with Johnson\u2019s response to their original request, which called on President Obama to issue an executive order to protect the personal information of DACA recipients.  \u201cSecretary Johnson\u2019s commitment to protecting Dreamers from deportation is admirable, as is the work done by DHS and this administration to protect and support immigrants,\u201d Rep. Judy Chu, D-California said. \u201cHowever, this letter unfortunately falls short on necessary assurances for the future.\u201d Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-California, said she and other Democrats still urge Mr. Obama to take immediate action before he leaves office.  \u201cGiven the statements of the incoming Trump Administration, DACA enrollees are currently living in fear of an uncertain future,\u201d she said. \u201cThey fear being ripped from their home, their family, and the only country they know.\u201d Rebecca Shabad is a video reporter for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "What does the American experience look like? These days, it\u2019s not the same for everyone -- as the 2016 election showed, there are parts of the country and demographic groups whose experiences are wildly different. To take a look at those experiences, CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d spoke with authors who have written about their experiences growing up in America -- and what they might mean for others. For J.D. Vance, the author of \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d a memoir about growing up in the Rust Belt, the American Dream was complicated: even after moving away and getting what he\u2019d hoped for, there was always a pull toward home. \u201cYou don\u2019t just all of a sudden get maybe money or a nice credential and all of a sudden everything that you learned, every habit you acquired, every familiar relationship that you had just sort of goes away,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause both the people that upward mobility brings you in contact with, whether it\u2019s professors or new social circle -- circles, but also the people who you moved away from in some ways, they continue to pull and push in different ways.\u201d Diane Guerrero, the author of the memoir \u201cIn the Country We Love,\u201d saw the American dream as something simple: remaining together with her family. Guerrero is the child of undocumented immigrants who were deported when she was a teenager.  \u201cA path for citizenship. Immigration reform. I always hoped that my parents could find that so that we could stay together,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I always hoped that we wouldn\u2019t be separated.\u201d Asked if that was her definition of the American Dream, Guerrero replied: \u201c It was just staying together. Sometimes it\u2019s as basic as that.\u201d Amani Al-Khatahtbeh, the author of \u201cMuslim Girl\u201d and the website MuslimGirl.com, said her family left the United States because of Islamophobia after 9/11 but returned several years later. It was the differences she saw when she returned, after living in Jordan, that gave her the idea for her project. \u201cThat experience really opened my eyes to the stark contrast between reality in the Middle East, how things were on the ground, as compared to how they are being misrepresented in Western media,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd upon my return, that was kind of my personal goal. Was, \u2018Oh my god. I have to open people\u2019s eyes to this.\u2019\u201d Isabel Wilkerson, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and the author of \u201cThe Warmth of Other Suns,\u201d has written extensively about the great migration of African Americans from the rural South to the industrial North in the 20th century. Those people, she said, were in many ways immigrants themselves -- despite moving within their own country. \u201cThis is the only group of Americans that had to act like immigrants in order to be recognized as citizens,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd their dreams and their goals and-- and what they were leaving for and what they were hoping for is the same thing that any American that\u2019s ever lived on this soil has wanted.\u201d Wilkerson said the country today needs to recognize its \u201cshared humanity.\u201d \u201cI think we\u2019re very aware of the things that make us different,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we realize enough what makes us the same and what makes us-- our hearts beat the same and the things that we want are so similar.\u201d Emily Schultheis is a reporter/editor for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "With President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration just 11 days away, a spate of his top Cabinet nominees\u00a0are about to undergo their confirmation hearings in the Senate this week.  Congress can\u2019t officially confirm Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees until after he\u2019s sworn in, but they can hold hearings to help expedite the process and get nominations ready for Inauguration Day -- which is why this coming week has such a packed schedule of hearings. Each nominee will first have a hearing with the Senate committee that has oversight responsibilities for his or her department. Once the committee holds a vote and approves the nominee, that candidate will be voted on by the full Senate.  Mr. Trump\u2019s team has been criticized for the fact that five hearings are scheduled for Wednesday, the same day Mr. Trump is slated to hold his first news conference since his election. However, transition officials and congressional GOP leaders have said the packed schedule is the only way Mr. Trump will have Cabinet secretaries ready to go on day one of his administration. The hearings will also begin amid concerns from Democrats that several of Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees have not been fully vetted or have not completed their requisite paperwork. On Friday, the Office of Government Ethics expressed concern about the confirmation timeline in a letter to Democratic senators, saying that several of Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees still have not been fully vetted. Democrats have called for more disclosure from the nominees, including tax returns. Senate GOP leaders say the hearings will proceed as planned, and that all the nominees will receive the appropriate vetting in time for their hearings. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, for example, told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d Sunday that Republicans\u2019 goal is to have at least seven Cabinet picks confirmed on\u00a0 the day Mr. Trump is sworn in -- the same number that President Obama had in 2009.  Here\u2019s a cheat sheet from CBS News for when these confirmation hearings will take place and what to expect: JEFF SESSIONS (Attorney General) Sessions, a senator from Alabama, is the first of Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees to get a hearing. He\u2019ll go before the Senate Judiciary Committee at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday morning. As the potential top law enforcement official in the country, he will be responsible for helping implement Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policy. Sessions is an immigration hard-liner, who subscribes to the same sort of \u201cbuild a wall\u201d philosophy that Mr. Trump does. Sessions\u2019 selection is not without controversy: when he was nominated for a federal judgeship in 1986, the GOP-controlled Senate rejected him amid allegations that he had made racist comments while serving as a U.S. attorney. A black assistant U.S. attorney accused Sessions of having addressed him as \u201cboy,\u201d and that he condemned the NAACP as \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201ccommunist-inspired.\u201d At the time, the late Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Massachusetts) said of Sessions: It is inconceivable to me that a person of this attitude is qualified to be a U.S. attorney, let alone a U.S. federal judge.\u201d RET. GEN. JOHN KELLY (Secretary of Homeland Security)  Kelly, a 46-year veteran of the U.S. Marines, is the second Cabinet pick who will get a hearing on Tuesday -- part of the Trump transition team\u2019s stated goal of getting his core national security team in place by Inauguration Day. Until earlier this year, Kelly served as the commander of U.S. Southern Command, which oversees American military operations in South America and Central America. He has commanded U.S. forces in Iraq as well as served as an aide to defense secretaries Leon Panetta and Robert Gates. Kelly, who will go before the Senate Armed Services Committee, will likely get questions about his planned approach to combating ISIS and preventing terror attacks both at home and abroad. REX TILLERSON (Secretary of State) On Wednesday, Tillerson will face questions from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which must approve his nomination before he receives a vote in the full Senate. Tillerson, the CEO of ExxonMobil, has been Mr. Trump\u2019s most controversial nominee thus far: his close dealings with Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin have Democrats and Republicans alike asking whether he has any conflicts of interest in becoming the nation\u2019s top diplomat. Tillerson and Putin met in the 1990s when Tillerson worked for Exxon in Russia; at Putin\u2019s behest, the Kremlin conferred on Tillerson Russia\u2019s Order of Friendship in 2013. Two prominent Republican members of the Foreign Relations Committee -- Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida) and Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) -- have indicated that they find Tillerson\u2019s ties to Russia concerning, though it\u2019s unclear whether either would actually vote against Tillerson.  Democrats on the committee, too, are raising the Russia issue this week: Cory Booker (D-New Jersey) told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday that he wants to ensure Tillerson is able to truly represent the best interests of the U.S. in its dealings with Russia. \u201cThis is an adversary that we want to know that he\u2019s going to be able to represent the United States of America and our interests and not be compromised by his relationship,\u201d Booker said.  MIKE POMPEO (CIA Director) Pompeo, first elected to the House in 2010, will appear in the front of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on Wednesday.  After graduating first in his class from West Point, Pompeo served in the U.S. Army for five years, studied at Harvard Law School and founded an aerospace company.  Pompeo does not have experience in espionage, but serves on the House Intelligence Committee and was also a member of the Select Committee on Benghazi. He was a harsh critic of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s during the hearings on the deadly 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya.  BETSY DEVOS (Secretary of Education) Betsy DeVos, a prominent charter school advocate from Michigan, will appear before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee on Wednesday. DeVos, currently the chairwoman of the American Federation for Children, a school choice advocacy group. Her critics have said her stated positions pose a threat to the country\u2019s public school system.  She and her husband also head up the Dick and Betsy DeVos Family Foundation, which has supported projects like the West Michigan Aviation Academy, a public charter school in Grand Rapids and the Compass Film Academy, a Christian film school in Michigan. The billionaire DeVos family also owns the NBA team, the Orlando Magic. Dick DeVos\u2019 father founded Amway. ELAINE CHAO (Secretary of Transportation) Chao, who served as labor secretary under President George W. Bush, will answer questions from members of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation on Wednesday. She is both the first Asian-American woman to ever hold a Cabinet-level position and the only member of Bush\u2019s Cabinet to serve through his entire eight years in the White House (2001-09). Before serving as labor secretary, Chao ran the United Way of America, was director of the Peace Corps and served as deputy treasury secretary under President George H.W. Bush. And she is also married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky). ANDY PUZDER (Secretary of Labor) Puzder is the CEO of CKE Restaurants, which owns fast food restaurants Carl\u2019s Jr. and Hardee\u2019s.  He\u2019ll answer questions from members of the Senate HELP Committee Thursday. Among the topics likely to come up during his hearing is the question of the minimum wage: Puzder, who opposes dramatically raising the minimum wage, has argued that a higher minimum wage cuts profitability and forces businesses to shed jobs.  In addition, Puzder has publicly opposed several Labor Department regulations including the overtime rule, which requires employers to pay overtime for employees making less than a certain annual income. GEN. JAMES MATTIS (Secretary of Defense) James \u201cMad Dog\u201d Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general and decorated war veteran, will appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday. A vocal critic of the Iran nuclear deal, Mattis\u2019s views are aligned with those of Mr. Trump, who has suggested on the campaign trail that he will tear up the Iran deal.  However, Mattis takes a harder line on Russia than the president he would serve, having said that he considers Russia a major threat to the U.S., and he has said Russia wants to \u201cbreak NATO apart.\u201d Mattis also opposes waterboarding, a practice Mr. Trump has said he wants to bring back under his administration. There\u2019s a potential legal obstacle to Mattis\u2019 confirmation: U.S. law prohibits members of the military from serving as defense secretary \u201cwithin seven years after relief from active duty as a commissioned officer of a regular component of an armed force.\u201d Mattis, who retired in 2013, is three years short -- so the Trump administration must seek a congressional waiver in order to get him confirmed. WILBUR ROSS (Secretary of Commerce) Ross, 79, is the billionaire chairman of WL Ross & Co., an investment firm that specializes in corporate restructurings. He was supportive of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and often appeared on business news shows to explain Mr. Trump\u2019s positions. Worth an estimated $2.9 billion, Ross built his fortune by buying and restructuring distressed industrial businesses, such as steelmaker LTV. Ross might be best known to voters as the owner of Sago Mine, a West Virginia coal mine where a dozen miners lost their lives in a 2006 explosion.  Ross will certainly get questions about his position on trade deals, since the Trump transition team has indicated that Mr. Trump will put Ross in charge of trade policy. Like Mr. Trump (and unlike most of the Republican Party), Ross favors withdrawing from or renegotiating free trade agreements.  BEN CARSON (Secretary of Housing and Urban Development) Carson, who has never held elected office, is a former 2016 hopeful who dropped out of the race last March and endorsed Mr. Trump shortly thereafter. He\u2019ll appear at a hearing in front of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. The 65-year-old neurosurgeon, who has no previous policy experience in the field of urban development, speculated to Fox News before Thanksgiving that his upbringing was the reason Mr. Trump was interested in nominating him to the position. \u201cI grew up in the inner city and have spent a lot of time there, and have dealt with a lot of patients from that area and recognize that we cannot have a strong nation if we have weak inner cities,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0-- President-elect Donald Trump on Friday tweeted that Mexico will reimburse American taxpayers for a new border wall and that U.S. money spent will be for the \u201csake of speed.\u201d His tweet came as congressional Republicans and his top aides consider a plan to ask Congress to ensure money is available in U.S. coffers for the wall without passing any new legislation. Instead, they would rely on existing law that already authorizes fencing and other technology along the southern border. The potential approach was disclosed Thursday by two congressional officials and a senior transition official with knowledge of the discussions; all spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Mr. Trump tweeted early Friday that Mexico would still pay the U.S. back.\u00a0 The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later! During his campaign, Trump repeatedly told voters if elected he would build a \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d along the U.S. southern border and make Mexico pay for it.\u00a0 Kellyanne Conway was asked on \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d Friday if Mr. Trump is going back on his word. \u201cCongress is taking it on themselves to explore different options to pay for the wall. But from our perspective nothing has changed. Obviously we respect federalism. And if Congress is trying to find different ways to fund this project that is a top priority to President Trump then they should do that,\u201d she said.\u00a0 But Trump never settled on a mechanism for how Mexico would pay. He floated various options, including compelling the country to cover the cost through higher visa and border crossing fees and threatening to target billions of dollars in remittances sent home by immigrants living in the U.S. Trump transition spokesman Sean Spicer said putting U.S. money up-front \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s broken his promise.\u201d In an interview Friday on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d Spicer said: \u201cI think he\u2019s going to continue to talk to them (the Mexican government) about that.\u201d The approach could also stave off a legislative fight that Trump might lose if he tried to get Congress to pass a measure authorizing the kind of border wall he promised during the campaign. It\u2019s not clear how much could be done along the 2,000-mile border without additional actions by Congress. Lawmakers passed the Secure Fence Act of 2006, but most of those 700 miles have already been built. Some areas are in much better shape than others, though, and long stretches are made up of fencing that stops vehicles but not pedestrians. But whatever steps might be taken without Congress\u2019 approval would be likely to fall short of the extravagant new wall on the border that Trump repeatedly said Mexico would pay for during his campaign for the White House. And despite Congress\u2019 involvement in approving any spending, such an approach might also open Trump to charges of circumventing the House and the Senate to take unilateral actions, something he repeatedly criticized President Barack Obama for doing. A spending bill including money for border construction could also provoke a legislative showdown given potential opposition from Senate Democrats. Still, several lawmakers and congressional officials said the administration could have significant flexibility in taking additional steps without Congress\u2019 approval. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things that can be done within current law,\u201d said Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., a longtime proponent of comprehensive immigration reform, though he emphasized that a lasting solution on immigration would take action by Congress. \u201cYou cannot minimize the potential impact of the administration doing what they can do under the law,\u201d he said. However, some immigration hard-liners have already expressed the desire to see Congress take a vote, given how prominent the wall was during Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, and their desire to act on the issue. Trump\u2019s vow to build an impenetrable, concrete wall along the southern border was his signature campaign proposal. \u201cBuild the wall!\u201d supporters would chant at his rallies. \u201cWho\u2019s going to pay for it?\u201d Trump would ask them. \u201cMexico!\u201d Trump often promised the wall would be built of hardened concrete, rebar and steel as tall as his venues\u2019 ceilings, and would feature a \u201cbig, beautiful door\u201d to allow legal immigrants to enter. Most experts viewed such promises as unrealistic and impractical, and Trump himself sometimes allowed that the wall would not need to span the entire length of the border, thanks to natural barriers like rivers. After winning the election, he said he\u2019d be open to stretches of fencing.",

            "article_content": "LONDON -- Embattled British Prime Minister Theresa May appointed ministers to her shaky government Sunday, as some Conservative colleagues rallied to support her -- and others said her days were numbered after last week's disastrous election.\u00a0 May is seeking a deal with a Northern Irish party to prop up the Conservative minority administration, and lawmakers said the rebuff from voters meant the government will have to abandon planned policies and re-think its strategy for European Union exit talks.  A stream of senior lawmakers entered May's 10 Downing St. office Sunday afternoon, to learn what roles they had been given in government.  May's weakened position in the party ruled out big changes. All the most senior ministers -- including Treasury chief Philip Hammond, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, Defense Secretary Michael Fallon and Home Secretary Amber Rudd -- kept their jobs and there were few changes in the Cabinet lineup.\u00a0 Damian Green, a lawmaker in the pro-EU wing of the party, was promoted to first secretary of state -- effectively deputy prime minister.  May also reappointed an old adversary -- Michael Gove, a former rival for the Conservative leadership whom May fired from the Cabinet when she took office last year. The pro-Brexit Gove was appointed Environment Secretary.  May shrugged off suggestions her days in Downing St. were numbered.  Asked if she is now just a caretaker leader, May noted that \"I said during the election campaign that if elected I would intend to serve a full term.\"  But rumors swirled of plots to oust May. Johnson -- a former Tory leadership contender -- denied he was planning a leadership challenge. He tweeted that an article in the Mail on Sunday newspaper headlined \"Boris set to launch bid to be PM as May clings on\" was \"tripe.\"\u00a0 \"I am backing Theresa may. Let's get on with the job,\" he tweeted. Mail on Sunday tripe - I am backing Theresa may. Let's get on with the job In a WhatsApp message to Conservative lawmakers, Johnson said: \"Folks we need to calm down and get behind the prime minister.\"  In Thursday's election the Conservatives won 318 of the 650 House of Commons seats, 12 fewer than the party had before the snap election, and eight short of the 326 needed for an outright majority. Labour surpassed expectations by winning 262.  Former Treasury chief George Osborne -- who was fired by May last year -- called May a \"dead woman walking,\" and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was ready to contest another election at any time.\u00a0 On Friday morning, she appeared looking shaken, chastened and beaten -- odd for somebody whose party won more seats than any other, perhaps, but as CBS News' Mark Phillips reports, her party's narrow victory amounted to an effective defeat: She lost her majority in Parliament. \u00a0 Pressure has mounted on her to resign, and two of her top aides have stepped down, CBS News foreign correspondent Jonathan Vigliotti reports.\u00a0 Many senior Conservatives say May should stay, for now, to provide stability. But few believe she can hang on for more than a few months.  \"I think her position is, in the long term, untenable,\" Conservative lawmaker Anna Soubry told Sky News.  But Graham Brady, who chairs the influential 1922 Committee of backbench Conservative lawmakers, said a \"self-indulgent\" party leadership campaign would only cause more uncertainty.  He acknowledged that the government would now be unable to get many of the measures promised in its election platform through Parliament.  May called the election called in a bid to strengthen her mandate ahead of EU exit talks. Instead, she has left Britain's position in disarray, days before the divorce negotiations are due to start on June 19.\u00a0 Voters failed to give a ringing endorsement to May's plan for Brexit, which involves leaving the EU's single market and imposing restrictions on immigration while trying to negotiate free trade deal with the bloc.  Some say her failure means the government must now take a more flexible approach to the divorce, potentially softening the exit terms.  Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who took the party from one Scottish seat to 13, said there would now have to be \"consensus within the country about what it means and what we seek to achieve as we leave.\"  To stay in power, the Conservatives are seeking support from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  The two sides are looking to form a \"confidence and supply\" arrangement. That means the DUP would back the government on confidence motions and budget votes, but it's not a coalition government or a broader pact.  DUP leader Arlene Foster said \"we have made good progress but the discussions continue.\"  The alliance makes some modernizing Conservatives uneasy. The DUP is a socially conservative group that opposes abortion and same-sex marriage and had links to Protestant paramilitary groups during Ireland's sectarian \"Troubles.\"  Conservative lawmaker Nicky Morgan told ITV that she could support a confidence and supply arrangement with the DUP, but any closer deal would be \"a step too far.\"  A deal between the government and the DUP could also unsettle the precarious balance between Northern Ireland's British loyalist and Irish nationalist parties, whose power-sharing administration in Belfast collapsed earlier this year.\u00a0 Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny tweeted Sunday that he had spoken with May \"and indicated my concern that nothing should happen to put (the Good Friday Agreement) at risk.\"  The 1998 Good Friday agreement set up power sharing in Northern Ireland, largely ending years of sectarian violence.  The British government doesn't have long to ink a deal. It is due to present its platform for the next session in the Queen's Speech at the State Opening of Parliament on June 19. The speech will be followed by several days of debate and a vote. By tradition, defeat on a Queen's Speech vote topples the government.  Corbyn said Labour would try to amend the Queen's Speech to include its own commitments to end austerity and boost public spending. Without the amendments, he said Labour would try to vote down the speech.  \"I don't think Theresa May and this government have any credibility,\" Corbyn told the Sunday Mirror, predicting that there could be another election within months.  \"I can still be prime minister,\" Corbyn said. \"This is still on.\"",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON --\u00a0Facebook says ads that ran on the company's social media platform and have been linked to a Russian internet agency were seen by an estimated 10 million people before and after the 2016 election. The company turned 3,000 ads over to three congressional committees Monday as part of their investigations into Russian influence in the 2016 election. In a new company blog post, Facebook's Elliot Schrage said the ads appeared to focus on divisive social and political messages, including LGBT issues, immigration and gun rights. In many cases, the ads encouraged people to follow pages on those issues. Fewer than half of the ads -- which ran between 2015 and 2017 -- were seen before the election, with 56 percent of them seen after the election. Some of the ads were paid for in Russian currency. Congressional investigators have recently focused on the spread of false news stories and propaganda on social media and have pressured Facebook, along with Twitter and Google, to release any Russia-linked ads. Facebook's ads were turned over to the House and Senate intelligence committees and the Senate Judiciary Committee. The company already has given similar material to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into the Russian meddling. Facebook said last month that the ads appear to have come from accounts associated with a Russian entity called the Internet Research Agency. The company said it found 450 accounts and about $100,000 was spent on the ads. Schrage, Facebook vice president for policy and communications, said in the blog post that the ads included \"political messages across the ideological spectrum.\" He said for 99 percent of the ads, less than $1,000 was spent. The company said some of the ads were paid for in Russian currency, but that isn't always a way of identifying suspicious activity. Schrage defended the site's ability to target certain demographic groups, but said \"ads containing certain types of targeting will now require additional human review and approval.\" The company is also making clear that it takes the right to free speech seriously and will never be able to remove all objectionable content. \"Even when we have taken all steps to control abuse, there will be political and social content that will appear on our platform that people will find objectionable, and that we will find objectionable,\" Schrage writes. Another Facebook official, Joel Kaplan, the company's vice president of global policy, said in a blog post Monday morning that the company is planning to hire more than 1,000 people to staff teams that review advertisements globally. Facebook will also update its policies to require better documentation from advertisers who want to run ads related to the U.S. election, including a requirement that the advertisers will have to confirm the business or organization they represent. Kaplan said the company's policies already prohibit \"shocking\" content, direct threats and the promotion of the sale or use of weapons, but said \"going forward, we are expanding these policies to prevent ads that use even more subtle expressions of violence.\" Twitter has said it found postings linked to the same Facebook accounts, and the House and Senate intelligence panels have asked both companies, along with Google, to testify publicly in the coming weeks. None of the companies has yet said whether it will accept the invitations. It is unclear whether the Facebook ads turned over to Congress will eventually be released publicly. Several lawmakers -- including Virginia Sen. Mark Warner and California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrats on the Senate and House intelligence panels - -have said they believe the American public should see them. Schiff said he hopes to release a sampling of the ads at a public hearing with the firms. He said he is committed to making all of these ads public \"as soon as possible,\" while working with Facebook on privacy considerations. \"We will continue to work with Facebook and other tech companies to determine the full extent of Russia's use of online platforms, including paid advertising, since what we now know may only scratch the surface,\" Schiff said. Twitter said last week that it had suspended 22 accounts corresponding to the 450 Facebook accounts that were likely operated out of Russia. Warner criticized Twitter for not sharing more information with Congress, saying the company's findings were merely \"derivative\" of Facebook's work. The company's presentations to staff last week \"showed an enormous lack of understanding from the Twitter team of how serious this issue is, the threat it poses to democratic institutions,\" he said.",

            "article_content": "Silicon Valley has been able to escape the heavy wave of federal regulations that other industries have faced, but that now could change as lawmakers question tech companies' practices in the 2016 election and their recent efforts to silence certain groups.  Facebook has revealed that it sold $100,000 in ad spending between June 2015 and May of this year that was connected to \"inauthentic\" accounts that analysts concluded were operated out of Russia. This revelation could spur some change -- or at least a debate -- about how Washington oversees social media companies, especially in light of the role they now play in politics.  \"I think this is a debate,\" said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is conducting its own investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. \"This has been [the] Wild Wild West. I'm disappointed that Facebook didn't come forward with this information about the Russians pushing people to anti-immigration rallies.\" Warner wondered how social media companies \"can, in effect, 'hide' their content.\" And then, referring to the Supreme Court decision that enabled unlimited corporate contributions to outside political groups, he continued, \"As much as I dislike Citizens United, at least someone can go down and look at the TV ads and know it's for or against somebody. Why don't those rules apply to social media companies?\" As a result of Facebook's disclosure, the intelligence panel might ask representatives for Facebook and Twitter to testify in public about foreign interference in U.S. elections.  Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, told CBS News that so far, digital giants like Amazon, Facebook and Google have used their political clout to ensure they aren't subject to government or public oversight.  \"These are unregulated,\" he said. \"We've given Google and Facebook a free ride to do whatever it really wants to do with our information and its business practices and only now are we considering the consequences.\" Facebook is already taking action to try to prevent a repeat of the Russian political ad buying in the future. Carolyn Everson, vice president of global marketing solutions, rolled out a series of new guidelines the company will follow to ensure there's a tougher process to determine who can advertise on its network.  \"We know we have to stay vigilant to keep ahead of people who try to misuse our platform. We believe in protecting the integrity of civic discourse, and require advertisers on our platform to follow both our policies and all applicable laws,\" said Facebook's chief security officer, Alex Stamos.  Rep. Ro Khanna, D-California, whose district is in the heart of Silicon Valley, told CBS News that legislation that would require disclosure and intelligence-sharing could help improve transparency.  \"I do think there has to be some legislation on disclosure requirements. If disclosure is not required, it's hard for tech companies to do what the U.S. law and election law is requiring. I think this is a loophole in our election system,\" Khanna said. \"Congress should also take legislative action in helping create platforms of intelligence-sharing where our intelligence agencies are working with tech leaders to help identify foreign bank accounts and to identify and trace spending.\" Still, Khanna may be one of the few lawmakers thinking about these issues.  \"It is likely that there will be pressure from Congress for companies like Google and Facebook to be much more transparent and accountable regarding their ad platform and advertising and marketing used in elections,\" Chester said. \"Whether or not there's going to be actual legislation requiring the companies to disclose, I think that's doubtful in the short-term.\"\u00a0 The tech industry, he predicted, will try to blunt most of the pressure by adopting self-regulatory approaches, as Facebook is already attempting.  Last week, ProPublica reported that Facebook had enabled advertisers to target \"Jew haters\"\u00a0through self-targeting fields in user profiles. Facebook described how this had occurred in a post a day after the report.\u00a0 \"As people fill in their education or employer on their profile, we have found a small percentage of people who have entered offensive responses, in violation of our policies,\" the post read, \"ProPublica surfaced that these offensive education and employer fields were showing up in our ads interface as targetable audiences for campaigns.\" Facebook removed them immediately and assured users that \"the number of people in these segments was incredibly low,\" and \"an extremely small number of people were targeted in these campaigns.\" The the social media platform in the same post announced updates to its ad targeting. \"Keeping our community safe is critical to our mission,\" the post said. \"And to help ensure that targeting is not used for discriminatory purposes, we are removing these self-reported targeting fields until we have the right processes in place to help prevent this issue.\" While Democrats are scrutinizing these tech companies, so are people on the other end of the political spectrum. After the events in Charlottesville, many firms shut down service to right-wing websites and accounts. Some conservatives, including white nationalist Richard Spencer, don't like the idea that the companies are censoring free speech. Conservatives also expressed outrage when Google fired an engineer last month who had written an internal memo about gender differences in the tech industry.  Other countries, especially in Europe, are much more stringent about their policies regarding social media. Germany, for example, passed a law earlier this year in which social media companies could face fines of nearly $60 million if they don't remove content that's considered hate speech. The United Kingdom is investigating the role Google and Facebook played in the Brexit campaign.  Steve Bannon, toward the end of his tenure as the White House chief strategist, reportedly discussed the idea of having companies like Google and Facebook regulated like utilities because they've basically become monopolies, The Intercept reported in July.  \"You can't regulate speech in the same way you would regulate a power company,\" Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-California, another lawmaker whose district is based in Silicon Valley, told CBS News. \"How would you do that, consistent with the First Amendment? You couldn't.\"  It's more likely that lawmakers will give additional rights to consumers to \"correct some overstepping,\" rather than create a big regulatory network, Lofgren said.  \"The idea that you'd have like a public utilities commission is stupid. But I think you can do some things that would give greater companies to monitor their networks but also give greater power in the hands of the consumers,\" she said. The debate over tougher rules on the tech industry only seems to be in the initial stages. No major legislative proposals related to these issues have been introduced.  Plus, Washington may be wary of alienating the companies that could work with the federal government in a variety of areas, including counterterrorism efforts to weed out terrorist recruitment and propaganda online as well as efforts to rebuild the nation's infrastructure system.

            "article_content": "Sen. Jeff Flake's decision to bow out of a re-election fight could spur a rush of other Republican candidates who hope to take on his only announced challenger in the 2018 Arizona primary. The freshman senator's decision came after months of statements where he said he expected a tough primary and general election race but believed he could win. Behind the scenes, though, a drumbeat of polling showed him badly damaged by comments he made about President Donald Trump in a book he released over the summer and an ongoing battle with his party's leader that began before last year's election. Flake was facing a challenge from former state Sen. Kelli Ward, who failed in her effort to take out Sen. John McCain last year but has gained traction this year. Last week, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon attended a fundraiser for her. Ward embraced the anti-establishment, anti-incumbent wing of the party driven by Trump with an assist from Bannon. But mainstream Republicans in Arizona believe Ward cannot beat Rep. Krysten Sinema, a moderate who is running in her primary as the only well-known Democratic candidate. They have been searching instead for another candidate who can draw support from Trump populists to take on Flake, and his decision to step aside opens the door for those efforts. In the background, the White House has also been seeking another candidate. His departure has raised the stakes even more for what is sure to be a bitter and expensive election battle next year in Arizona as the GOP fights to hold onto a seat and the Democrats seek an opening to pick one up. For months, the names of other potential GOP challengers have been floated, but none has entered the race. They include current state university regent Jay Heiler; former state GOP chairman Robert Graham; state Treasurer and 2016 Trump campaign chief financial officer Jeff DeWit; and Reps. Paul Gosar and Trent Franks. The other three GOP members of Arizona's House delegation could be wild cards \u2014 David Schweikert, Andy Biggs and Martha McSally. A spokesman for GOP Gov. Doug Ducey said he was \"absolutely not\" considering running for Senate. Republican political consultants in Arizona are split on whether there will truly be a rush of candidates. \"Somehow they all seem unlikely to me,\" Constantin Querard, a top campaign consultant, said of those already in the mix. \"Because if you were not going to run against a mortally wounded candidate with the support of the president and millions of dollars of outside spending, why would you suddenly be interested in the race without all of those things?\" But Chuck Coughlin, another longtime Republican campaign consultant who did polling that showed Flake in bad trouble, isn't so sure. He said a candidate who can draw support from the pillars of the Republican political establishment in Arizona \u2014 Flake, Sen. John McCain, Gov. Doug Ducey and former Gov. Jan Brewer \u2014 would be the one to take on Ward in a primary. \"The question is, who can mostly closely thread the needle there between Trump, McCain, Flake, Brewer, the current governor,\" Coughlin said. \"Who is that?\" \"One thing I'd guarantee you is Kelli Ward will face a primary opponent, there's no doubt in my mind on that,\" he added. Another potential problem for Arizona Republicans is the health of McCain, who was diagnosed this summer with an aggressive form of brain cancer and acknowledges his prognosis is poor. A vacancy in McCain's seat before April means a second Senate race would be on the 2018 ballot. As recently as early this month, Flake told The Associated Press he was in it to win in 2018 and discounted both Ward and Sinema. \"John McCain at this position was down by double digits to Kelli Ward, down by double digits to any generic Democrat,\" he said in an Oct. 9 interview. \"He ended up winning by double digits in both the primary and the general because he ran a good campaign, and we're going to try to do the same thing.\" By Tuesday, things were different for Flake. \"If I could run the kind of race I'd like to run and believe I could win a Republican primary, I might go forward,\" he told reporters at the U.S. Capitol after his announcement. \"These days, it seems that unless you're on every policy the president has, then somehow you're not a conservative.\" Flake is a throwback Arizona conservative, with strong small government credentials but a Libertarian streak along the lines of the late Sen. Barry Goldwater. He sparred with the president over free trade, which he supports, immigration reform and opening relations with Cuba. But those positions put him in the crosshairs of Trump and the grassroots populists he courts.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 Democratic Sen.-elect Doug Jones says he doesn't think President Donald Trump should resign over allegations of sexual misconduct, echoing the White House's position that voters have already spoken on the issue. \"I don't think the president ought to resign at this point. We'll see how things go, but certainly those allegations are not new, and he was elected with those allegations at front center,\" said Jones, whose upset win in last week's Alabama special election was due in large part to allegations that his Republican opponent, 70-year-old Roy Moore, had engaged in sexual misconduct with teenage girls as a deputy district attorney in his 30s. During the 2016 campaign, Trump himself faced multiple accusations of sexual harassment from women he branded as liars. In recent weeks, however, Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, has said the women deserve to be heard, and a group of Democratic senators including Kirsten Gillibrand of New York have called on Trump to resign. But on Sunday, Jones noted that the accusations against Trump had surfaced before the 2016 presidential election. \"I think we need to move on and not get distracted by those issues,\" said Jones, a 63-year-old former prosecutor who became the first Democrat elected to represent Alabama in the Senate in a quarter-century. \"Let's get on with the real issues that are facing people of this country right now.\" Making his first Sunday talk show appearances since his win, Jones said he looked forward to meeting with Trump. Jones said he believed his own mandate was to avoid rigid partisan positions in favor of compromise and \"getting things done,\" even if it meant coming across as \"pure pie-in-the-sky\" and sometimes disappointing some of his core constituents. He insisted that he'll leave \"all the options on the table\" when it comes to his votes next year in a politically divided Washington on issues from immigration to infrastructure. \"I'm going to consider anything,\" said Jones, explaining that he doesn't plan on labeling himself a progressive or a conservative Democrat but rather as a \"Doug Jones Democrat.\" Jones also made clear he's ready to move forward even though Moore has yet to concede the race. \"Alabama has spoken,\" Jones said. \"I will be ready to go regardless of whether he concedes or not.\" Moore, who has denied the sexual misconduct allegations, has been discussing a possible recount even though he appears to have lost by 20,000 votes, or 1.5 percent. Trump, who supported Moore during the race, has also urged him to concede. Jones' election will cut the Republicans' Senate majority to 51-49, when he takes office in early January. He is filling the seat left vacant by Republican Jeff Sessions' nomination as U.S. attorney general. White House legislative director Marc Short said the administration was eager to see whether Jones will \"actually work to represent the people of Alabama\" in a bipartisan way or side with liberal Democrats. \"We hope that frankly Doug Jones will help us change the climate here in Washington,\" Short said. During the campaign, Trump chastised Jones as a liberal who would be \"terrible\" on crime and border security, and a \"puppet\" for Senate congressional leaders. Jones said the president called to congratulate him after Tuesday's election. He described the call as \"very gracious.\" On Sunday, Jones downplayed Trump's earlier criticism of him as statements made \"in the heat of a campaign.\" Pledging to always consider both sides, Jones sided on Sunday with congressional Democrats in expressing a need for safeguards for immigrants brought to the country illegally as children, but without funding for a border wall. The Obama administration program that provided those protections, the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals program, is set to expire in March. \"I have said before that I opposed the building of a wall. I think that's an expense that the taxpayers just don't have to incur because I do think you can increase border security without having to go to the incredible expense of building that wall,\" Jones said. But he also pointed to fixing roads and bridges, a priority of Trump's, as a bipartisan issue that could benefit Alabama. Jones appeared on \"Fox News Sunday\" and CNN's \"State of the Union.\" Short was on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"",

            "article_content": "After news broke of Facebook turning over information\u00a0about Russian ad buys to special counsel Robert Mueller, a new report tries to illustrate what it says the Silicon Valley giant is thinking -- while the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election intensifies. Axios' Mike Allen spoke with unnamed tech executives to offer insight into Facebook's perspective as the company faces scrutiny and feels the heat amid fears the platform \"emboldens terrorists, Russia and China\" -- among other concerns. Allen's report says the company \"will argue that both tech companies and governments are in uncharted territory, and will work with lawmakers in the U.S. and around the world,\" but \"will resist most regulation.\" Facebook acknowledged this month that phony accounts appearing to have originated in Russia bought $100,000 in advertising during the\u00a02016 presidential election\u00a0cycle. The detailed information obtained by Mueller's Russia investigation includes copies of the ads and details of the purchases, The Wall Street Journal\u00a0reports. \"Facebook will continue to say it can play a positive role in elections,\" Allen writes, \"helping people communicate directly with candidates, register to vote, learn the issues, and hold governments and elected officials accountable.\" \"Facebook will contend that just as crime is never fully eradicated, social networks have to focus on staying ahead of people who misuse their platforms. But bad things will continue to unfold on all social networks,\" he writes. Meanwhile, CBS News' Jeff Pegues reported that the extent of Russia's Facebook activity\u00a0was more than one false notice of an anti-immigration rally in Idaho, and a source familiar with the investigation said there are likely more \"Facebook fronts\" of Russians urging Americans to take action. \"I think what we've seen so far from Facebook is only the tip of the iceberg,\" said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, the ranking member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. \"I think there's much more than 350-odd accounts that were involved in this process,\" Warner said, referring to Facebook ads linked to Russia. \"I think it was much more than the simply one internet troll farm they found in St. Petersburg.\" He added, \"And frankly, Facebook, who prides itself on knowing more about you and me than frankly the United States government knows, I got to believe they know more about this or could find more out about it if they put adequate resources behind it.\"",

            "article_content": "A wealthy former Goldman Sachs executive and Republican Gov. Chris Christie's top deputy immediately took aim at each other after winning primaries Tuesday in the race to replace the unpopular governor, continuing campaign attacks that have marked the first statewide primary election since President Donald Trump took office. Democrat Phil Murphy and Republican Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno will face off Nov. 7 in one of only two governor's races this year, along with Virginia, with Democrats hopeful their promised anti-Trump agenda and voter registration advantage will propel them to victory and jump-start a 2018 congressional comeback. The election comes as Trump administration developments swamp headlines, spurring Murphy to lash out at the Republican president and wedging Guadagno between an unpopular White House and a governor of whom most voters disapprove. \"Four more years of Christie-style politics won't make New Jersey the state where we draw the line against Donald Trump, but we will,\" Murphy said. \"We are better than Donald Trump, and we are better than Chris Christie.\" Murphy, a former Obama administration ambassador to Germany who poured more than $20 million into the contest, tied Guadagno to Christie during his victory speech in Newark and reiterated a promise to oppose Trump. Guadagno, twice elected on the ticket with Christie, has gone to great lengths to try to highlight their differences. In her victory speech Tuesday, she contrasted herself with the term-limited governor without mentioning his name and slammed Murphy's Goldman Sachs career, as his primary opponents had done. \"I'm running for governor based on my values, based on my record, based on my principles,\" she said. \"My principles are Main Street principles.\" Democrats are favored in the general election, in part because of an 800,000-voter registration advantage and because of political headwinds stemming from Christie's and Trump's unpopularity. Christie remained neutral during the campaign but said he voted for Guadagno, his top deputy since they were elected in 2009. He has said he would campaign if asked, but it's unclear whether his assistance would help or hurt, since about three-quarters of voters disapprove of his job performance. He congratulated Guadagno on her win and said the state \"can't afford a return to the days of having Wall Street run\" it. The race to take the New Jersey governor's office back from a Republican comes as Democrats nationally weigh whether distancing themselves from Wall Street will help them counter Trump and his populist Republican allies. Murphy contributed to the state's powerful county political machines, drawing harsh attacks from his opponents that he was trying to buy their support, while giving him the lead position on ballots across the state's 21 counties. His opponents repeatedly brought up his time at Goldman Sachs. They compared him to members of Trump's administration who also worked there and to former Democratic Gov. Jon Corzine, another Goldman Sachs alumnus who, like Murphy, donated to local Democratic parties. Sharyn Kingston, 25, of Freehold, said she was wary of Murphy's \"Goldman Sachs connections\" but voted for him because he's best suited for the job and can win the election. \"I'm not an Occupy Wall Street type, but I am afraid of big money in politics, and he made it look like he was trying to buy the nomination,\" the legal secretary said. John Parilla, 75, an immigration lawyer from Alpine, voted for Guadagno and said he likes the range of experience she brings to the job. He said he doesn't see her as a Christie clone but does see similarities between Murphy and Corzine. Guadagno defeated Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, Nutley Commissioner Steve Rogers, Ocean County landscape business owner and actor Joseph \"Rudy\" Rullo and Atlantic County engineer Hirsh Singh. Murphy faced challenges from former Teaneck firefighter Bill Brennan, one-time Clinton administration Treasury official Jim Johnson, state Sen. Ray Lesniak, Assemblyman John Wisniewski and Tenafly Councilman Mark Zinna. In Virginia, the only other state electing a governor this year, most of the attention has focused on the close Democratic primary between Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam and former congressman Tom Perriello. Former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie is favored to win the GOP primary next week over Trump's former state campaign chairman.",

            "article_content": "California has an exit strategy. In the wake of the election of President Donald Trump, the Golden State\u2019s bid for secession has picked up steam\u2014albeit just enough to fog up an unlikely escape window.\u00a0 Leaders behind the campaign committee Yes California say they have deployed eight thousand volunteers across 40 state-wide chapters. Their mission? To collect a whopping 585,407 autographs. That\u2019s the number of signatures required to put secession on a March 2019 special election ballot in America\u2019s second bluest state.\u00a0 Cal-exit joins the ranks of American history\u2019s unlikely, peaceful calls for dissolution, along with \u201cTexit\u201d and the battle for a Second Vermont Republic, among others. A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted last month shows one in three Californians support the economic powerhouse\u2019s peaceful withdrawal from the union following Mr. Trump\u2019s election. Louis Marinelli, the president of Yes California, ultimately aspires to liberate the state by pressuring Congress to reverse its 1850 law declaring California a state of the union. Alternatively, he poses calling for a convention of states that might rule in 2/3 favor of the state\u2019s secession. The group claims the right to self-determination as protected under the U.N. Charter and has already lifted concerns to the international stage by opening an \u201cembassy\u201d in Moscow last December.\u00a0 Yet for now, periscope-streamed press conferences and email blasts to 150,000 state residents power the fringe movement\u2019s dreams for a ballot initiative. \u201cIf each one of those people downloaded the petition and got four of their friends to sign,\u201d Marinelli notes, \u201cwe\u2019d be done in a week.\u201d In a moment of self-awareness, the political activist concedes not everyone devotes time to religiously read emails, himself included.\u00a0 \u201cI still have literally 17,898 unanswered emails since November,\u201d he groans, calculating the hours it will take to sort through the cluttered inbox. And while many messages from across the country volunteer assistance or a heartfelt \u201ckeep it up,\u201d others are not so nice. \u201cWe do get a lot of hate mail from people in Tennessee,\u201d Marinelli chuckles. The native New Yorker counts contempt like that among California\u2019s causes to leave the country.\u00a0 \u201cPeople are begging California to leave,\u201d he attests. \u201cThey want us to be gone, to fall into the ocean.\u201d Comments on Yes California\u2019s social media pages contain equal parts enthusiasm and skepticism. For every affirmation, there is at least one post reading\u00a0\u201care you kidding me?\u201d Equally as bombarded is Yes California\u2019s designated P.O. box in Fresno. Marinelli says his vice president and life-partner Marcus Ruiz Evans opened up new mailboxes this past week in Sacramento, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego to accommodate the influx of soon-to-be tallied signatures.\u00a0 \u201cWe don\u2019t have to live under the same dysfunctional household anymore, agitating each other and blocking each other,\u201d Marinelli explains of his go-to secessionist analogy. \u201cIt\u2019s very similar to a married couple who have fallen out of love and who are living together. And there\u2019s a lot of complications, maybe with property and children.\u201d\u00a0 That\u2019s over 38 million children and 100 million acres of property, to be precise. In addition to the $452.8 billion in federal income taxes Californians contribute to Washington, the home of Hollywood and Silicon Valley boasts the highest gross state product and grows more food than any other state. It is home to roughly 1-in-8 Americans.\u00a0 Newly-minted California Attorney General Xavier Becerra told the NY Times that while he is grateful the constitution presents built-in obstacles to secession, \u201cif California were to secede, there could instantly be up to 280 million new people having to knock on the door and seek visas from the sixth largest economy and newest nation in the world!\u201d\u00a0 In the run-up to the 2016 election, California Assembly member Evan Low tweeted, \u201cIn the disastrous case that @realDonaldTrump is elected, I will explore intro of a bill to have CA secede from the union\u201d along with the hashtag #kiddingnotkidding. According to the group, Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher told Yes California\u00a0that while he does not support a secession, he\u2019d be open to a ballot box initiative.\u00a0 Cautioning that the secession talk is still in its \u201cvery early stages,\u201d Speaker of the California State Assembly Anthony Rendon told CBS News that it\u2019s \u201cjust another expression of angst that people feel in this state about Trump.\u201d \u00a0 Yet while many California politicians have little to say about Cal-Exit, few have been silent when it comes to the new administration and the policies of Mr. Trump, who has already deemed the state \u201cout of control.\u201d\u00a0 Governor Jerry Brown quipped in March of 2016, \u201cIf Trump were ever elected, we\u2019d have to build a wall around California to defend ourselves from the rest of this country.\u201d Yet the veteran politician made no jokes in his 2017 state of the state address. \u201cWe have seen the bald assertion of \u2018alternative facts,\u2019\u201d the 78-year old governor stated knocking on-camera remarks made by Presidential Counselor Kellyanne Conway. \u201cWe must prepare for uncertain times and reaffirm the basic principles that have made California the Great Exception that it is.\u201d\u00a0 In her first speech as California Senator, Kamala Harris confronted President-Elect Trump head on, addressing supporters in a bustling LA nightclub: \u201cWhen we have been attacked and when our ideals and fundamental ideals are being attacked, do we retreat or do we fight? I say we fight!\u201d Harris is not the only California lawmaker with fighting words. In December, Speaker Rendon shut down calls for national reconciliation in his address to the California Assembly, \u201cCalifornians do not need healing,\u201d he stated. \u201cWe need to fight.\u201d Moments after his appointment by Gov. Jerry Brown, Attorney General Xavier Becerra threatened, \u201cIf you want to take on a forward-leaning state that is prepared to defend its rights and interests, then come at us.\u201d Following the San Francisco based Ninth Circuit court\u2019s decision to uphold a federal court\u2019s hold on President Trump\u2019s travel ban, Becerra noted he would \u201ctake every measure possible\u201d to suspend President Trump\u2019s \u201cun-American and unconstitutional order.\u201d\u00a0 California, however, is also institution a travel ban of its own. With just weeks before March Madness, the state is preventing sports teams from competing in Kansas, Mississippi, North Carolina and Tennessee. These states are deemed discriminatory, particularly toward LGBT communities, by the attorney general\u2019s office under California\u2019s law, AB 1887.\u00a0 Speaker Rendon says he\u2019ll look to the Becerra to guide the state through whatever court battles lie ahead. \u201cHe\u2019s going to lead the way on the legal front,\u201d Rendon states. \u201cI can envision us working with states like Washington and others, but also Mr. Becerra acting alone in some instances and doing what he feels is best.\u201d\u00a0 In addition to Attorney General Becerra\u2019s guidance, California has hired former United States Attorney General Eric Holder as legal representation, and is actively preparing for war on issues of health care, immigration, and the environment. \u00a0 With 1 in 3 Californians enrolled in Obamacare\u2019s enthusiastic participant \u201cMedi-Cal,\u201d 11 million foreign-born residents, and a greater number of electricity-generating solar plants than the rest of the country combined, there is plenty of fight to be found. Yet boasting the greatest pension obligations in the country, $47.5 billion in federal contracts and ambitious infrastructure plans like high-speed rail, America\u2019s \u201cgreat experiment\u201d may have to pick and choose its battles against a White House it desperately needs. As the first weeks of President Trump\u2019s administration come to a close, leaving the battlefield entirely is exactly what Yes California is pitching. \u201cThings are getting worse,\u201d Louis Marinelli implores supporters. \u201cWe now have people being elected to the highest office of the land by the likes of Donald Trump. Who\u2019s next?\u201d\u00a0",

            "article_content": "President Trump woke up at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Saturday morning firing off a tweetstorm claiming that President Obama essentially wiretapped, or bugged, Trump Tower offices before the election. CBS News has been unable to confirm any of this new information. But the president is clearly irritated. Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my \"wires tapped\" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! PALM BEACH, Fla. --\u00a0Before most Americans awoke on Saturday, President Trump was on Twitter, posting\u00a0explosive wiretapping accusations\u00a0against President Obama.\u00a0Mr. Trump claims\u00a0he recently learned Mr. Obama ordered what Mr. Trump describes as a \u201cWatergate-style\u201d wiretap on Trump Tower in New York. He says it happened just before the election. Mr. Trump offered no evidence and a\u00a0spokesman for Mr. Obama issued a quick denial. It comes amid growing controversy over the Trump administration\u2019s possible Russian ties, and the president is spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach. President Obama\u2019s team is shooting down President Trump\u2019s suggestion that he\u00a0ordered wiretapping on Trump Tower\u00a0during the 2016 election, with an Obama spokesman calling the claim \u201csimply false.\u201d \u201cA cardinal rule of the Obama administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice,\u201d Kevin Lewis, an Obama spokesman, said in a Saturday afternoon statement. \u201cAs part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen.\u201d \u201cAny suggestion otherwise is simply false,\u201d he added. President Trump\u2019s string of tweets Saturday morning\u00a0accusing President Obama of wiretapping\u00a0Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign came seemingly out of nowhere: It wasn\u2019t something the president had been discussing recently, nor had it appeared in major mainstream news outlets. But Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets weren\u2019t the first time this allegation has been made: Several conservative media outlets have been pushing wiretapping claims in recent days. Democrats are pushing back on President Trump\u2019s\u00a0Saturday morning claims\u00a0that President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower offices before the election. While at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida for the weekend, Mr. Trump fired off a series of early morning tweets accusing President Obama, without citing evidence, of wiretapping Trump Tower. He described this as \u201cNixon/Watergate,\u201d calling Mr. Obama a \u201cbad (or sick) guy.\u201d Ben Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser under Mr. Obama, denied Mr. Trump\u2019s accusations and responded by saying presidents can\u2019t order wiretaps. Vice President\u00a0Mike Pence\u00a0criticized the Associated Press for publishing the personal email address of his wife, Karen Pence, in a story on Friday about his efforts to block the release of his emails during his tenure as Indiana governor. On Saturday, Pence said the AP was \u201cviolating her privacy and our security\u201d by publishing the second lady\u2019s AOL email address. He tweeted a letter sent by his counsel, Mark Paoletta, addressed to Gary Pruitt, the president and CEO of the AP, saying Pruitt \u201cshould be ashamed of your reprehensible conduct.\u201d The president is in Mar-a-Lago for the weekend. CBS News\u2019 Mark Knoller notes that by the end of the weekend, Mr. Trump will have spent all or part of 14 days at Mar-a-Lago, amounting to 31 percent of his days in office, so far. \u201cFlorida to me is a very very special state,\u201d said Mr. Trump Friday. \u201cI have had a lot of success in Florida. I love it. It is my second home.\u201d Other states he\u2019s been to: Delaware -1; Pennsylvania - 1; South Carolina - 1; Virginia - 2 (Not counting visits to Pentagon and Andrews AFB). Vice President Pence attends the closed Gridiron dinner. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has been under fire from Republican Sen. Marco Rubio \u2013 along with human rights groups - for not honoring the long tradition of\u00a0personally unveiling the State Department\u2019s annual Human Rights Report, which is expected Friday.\u00a0 For 1st time in a long time @StateDept #humanrights report will not be presented by Secretary of State. I hope they reconsider. White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway is opening up about the pressures of working in the male-dominated world of politics. CBS News\u2019 Norah O\u2019Donnell spoke with her and her family in their New Jersey home. \u00a0 Asked\u00a0whether she had ever considered making a political run of her own, Conway told O\u2019Donnell she would not run for office.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s not just the fire in your belly anymore. You have to have the bile in your throat. And this is why I think many women do not run for office,\u201d Conway told O\u2019Donnell. \u201cMany good men and women who would \u2014\u201d \u201cBile in your throat?\u201d O\u2019Donnell asked. After a week of noticeably less Twitter activity,\u00a0President Trump is lashing out against Democrats\u00a0over their treatment of Attorney General Jeff Sessions because of his contacts with Russian Envoy Sergey Kislyak.\u00a0 Mr. Trump tweeted a demand for an investigation of Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer over a photo of him with Russian President Vladimir Putin from 2003, and over House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi over a photo showing her seated at a table with Kislyak, whom she denied having met. The last two nights of U.S.\u00a0airstrikes in Yemen\u00a0were not based on intelligence collected during\u00a0the commando raid last month, Pentagon spokesman Jeff Davis said Friday. Over the last two days, the U.S. has conducted more than 30 airstrikes, but has not been involved in any of the reported firefights. \u00a0 The latest airstrikes are part of a stepped up campaign against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula that was developed near the end of the Obama administration, and which began with the Jan. 28 raid that resulted in the death of Navy SEAL William \u201cRyan\u201d Owens and several civilians. President Trump and his staff have repeatedly pronounced the raid a success, and the Pentagon also stated that a lot of intelligence came out of the raid.\u00a0 President Trump on Friday\u00a0reiterated his call for a merit-based immigration system, citing the systems used by Australia and Canada as potential models to pursue. The president posted a single tweet about his vision on Twitter, naming the book \u201cGreen Card Warrior\u201d as a must-read. Nick Adams new book, Green Card Warrior, is a must read. The merit-based system is the way to go. Canada, Australia! @foxandfriends Health insurance tax credits, mandates, taxation of employer coverage, essential benefits. Mind-numbing health care jargon is flying around again\u00a0as Republicans move to repeal and replace the Obama-era Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s time to start paying attention. The GOP plan emerging in the House would mean less government, and many fear that will translate to less coverage and a step backward as a nation. Still, there would be new options for middle-class people who buy their own policies but don\u2019t now qualify for help under the ACA. Some popular provisions such as allowing young adults to stay on a parental plan remain untouched. In an effort to\u00a0highlight his push for school vouchers, President Trump will visit St. Andrew Catholic School in Orlando on Friday to participate in what the White House is calling a \u201clistening session.\u201d The visit follows up on the president\u2019s nod to education reform in\u00a0his address to Congress Tuesday, when he labeled education \u201cthe civil rights issue of our time.\u201d\u00a0 His visit and tour are scheduled for 1:30 p.m. President Donald Trump\u00a0painted an overly bleak picture of the condition of the armed forces\u00a0as he made his case for military expansion. A look at some of his statements from the Gerald R. Ford, a $12.9 billion aircraft carrier being built in Newport News, Virginia: TRUMP: \u201cWe are going to have very soon the finest equipment in the world.\u201d THE FACTS: Pentagon leaders have said for years that the U.S. already has the world\u2019s best weaponry and military equipment. They sometimes claim the U.S. is in danger of losing its advantage unless the Congress continues to spend heavily to develop and build new generations of weapons.",

            "article_content": "PARIS -- French far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen has nothing but praise for U.S. President Donald Trump, saying on Thursday that she thinks his actions so far are good for France.  Le Pen, who is leading in the latest opinion polls ahead of the spring election, told The Associated Press that \u201cmy only framework is what is in the interest of France.\u201d\u00a0 She credited Trump with a series of accomplishments, including \u201cthe promotion of a form of intelligent protectionism, of economic patriotism,\u201d as well as his plan to change or scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, and his \u201crupture with total free trade imposed on the world.\u201d\u00a0 So far, \u201cThere is no (untoward) international fallout\u201d and \u201cI only have reason to rejoice\u201d in Trump\u2019s actions, she said.  Le Pen made the remarks after laying out her foreign policy approach were she to win the April 23 and May 7 election to replace unpopular Socialist President Francois Hollande, not seeking a second mandate.  She described a stark vision based on a multipolar world but with France going it alone, first laid out in a conference this month when her platform was made public.  Dozens of foreign diplomats were in attendance. The Saudi Arabian ambassador was among them as well as a U.S. embassy official, according to Bertrand Dutheil de la Rochere of Le Pen\u2019s National Front party.\u00a0 The start of her speech was briefly interrupted by a bare-chested protester from the FEMEN group that has crashed at least two previous Le Pen events in recent years. The single protester screaming \u201cMarine fictive feminist\u201d -- the words written on her chest -- was carried off screaming by bodyguards.\u00a0 Le Pen, unperturbable, continued, decrying past actions by the United States as \u201cstrategic adventurism (that) has harmed what we consider to be our interests.\u201d She attributed actions in Iraq, Syria and Libya to the United States, as well as the fallout, from the surge in migrants to destabilization in the Mediterranean and \u201cdangerous games with Islamic militias.\u201d  \u201cWe are hoping that with the election of President Donald Trump there will be a major shift, nearly a complete  makeover, which would be positive not only for the world but also for the United States,\u201d Le Pen said.  Le Pen, leader of the anti-immigration National Front, wants to pull France out of the European Union, do away with the euro currency and crack down on what she calls \u201cmassive immigration.\u201d She also insists that France must be its own defender, leaving NATO and defending itself.  \u201cTo assure France\u2019s independence and the freedom of the French people, there is no price too high, there is no combat too frightening to be taken on,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cno ally, no treaty, no alliance will decide French policies.\u201d  Polls have consistently put Le Pen among the top two ranked candidates for the first round of voting, and recent polls put her first. However, the soundings never see her in the final round.  Her current top opponent, centrist Emmanuel Macron, joined forces on Wednesday with a long-time centrist politician Francois Bayrou, who ensured Macron his backing, a move the candidate called \u201ca real turning point.\u201d  Conservative candidate Francois Fillon, a former prime minister, has lost momentum over a corruption scandal concerning potential fake parliamentary aide jobs for his wife and two of his children. Le Pen, too, is caught up in corruption scandals involving parliamentary aids at the European parliament. One aide was charged on Wednesday with breach of trust. Her bodyguard, also questioned, was back on the job Thursday.  Speaking to AP, Le Pen forcefully rejected compliments from white supremacist David Duke, who referred to her in a tweet as a \u201cstrong and intelligent woman\u201d after praising her father, National Front party founder Jean-Marie Le Pen as a \u201cgreat patriot.\u201d  Marine Le Pen called Duke a \u201cprovocateur,\u201d saying she has no ties to him and adding, \u201cI don\u2019t want his support. He can keep it for himself.\u201d\u00a0",

            "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump is less than three weeks away from being sworn in as the country\u2019s 45th president -- at which point he\u2019ll be able to begin implementing his agenda. Unless he encounters substantial opposition, that is. Mr. Trump may have both houses of Congress under GOP control, but it\u2019s a narrow 52-to-48 majority in the Senate -- meaning even just a few rogue GOPers could keep Trump-led legislation from passing. And given his differences with traditional GOP orthodoxy on a number of issues, from trade deals to Russia, there\u2019s likely to be a point at which some congressional Republicans break with Mr. Trump. Here are some of the people in the Republican Party who could throw a wrench in Mr. Trump\u2019s plans: Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona) McCain initially endorsed Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign when he became the Republican nominee, but was one of the GOP lawmakers who withdrew his endorsement after the October release of a 2005 Access Hollywood tape of Mr. Trump\u2019s lewd comments about women. Since the campaign ended he\u2019s continued his criticism of Mr. Trump, especially when it comes to Mr. Trump\u2019s statements and actions on foreign policy issues. In November, he went after Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on torture, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn what the president of the United States wants to do. We will not waterboard.\u201d He\u2019s also broken with Mr. Trump on the issue of Russian election interference, calling for a select committee in Congress to investigate the effects of Russian hacking as Mr. Trump praises Russian President Vladimir Putin. McCain, one of the foremost hawks in the GOP, also of Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of state, ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, that his ties to Russia are a \u201cmatter of concern.\u201d  Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) Like McCain, Paul supported Mr. Trump once he won the GOP nomination, as he had pledged to do while he was a 2016 hopeful. However, he\u2019s always been a bit of an outlier in the Republican Senate -- and has also not shied away from speaking his mind, even if he\u2019s sometimes at odds with members of his party.\u00a0 Paul, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was critical of several of Mr. Trump\u2019s prospects for secretary of state -- including Tillerson, Mr. Trump\u2019s ultimate pick for the job. On Tillerson, Paul said he would keep an \u201copen mind,\u201d but did not say he would support his nomination. As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Paul will vote on Tillerson\u2019s nomination before it reaches the full Senate. Paul also has a noteworthy libertarian streak, which could easily put him at odds with Mr. Trump on everything from new trade restrictions to immigration and law enforcement.\u00a0 House Speaker Paul Ryan Since the election, Ryan has made nice with Mr. Trump -- the pair have met several times to discuss policy priorities, and Ryan has made it clear he is willing to work with Mr. Trump.  But Mr. Trump\u2019s political ideology is in many ways at odds with GOP orthodoxy -- and with the policy vision that Ryan and other congressional Republicans have put forth as their agenda heading into the new session. It may only be a matter of time until Ryan\u2019s priorities and Trump\u2019s clash. And on entitlement reform, in particular, the two may be heading for a showdown: Ryan has long argued for substantial alterations to be made to Medicare, a program Mr. Trump has repeatedly vowed to protect.\u00a0 When that happens, Ryan has the potential to cause real trouble for Mr. Trump and his agenda.  Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) Graham, a former 2016 rival of Mr. Trump\u2019s, has been critical of him from the start: even during the general election, Graham warned that Mr. Trump would be unable to handle the challenges facing the next president and destroy the Republican Party in the process. Before that, Graham was one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most outspoken critics during the GOP primary, with the eventual party nominee once going so far as to publicly reveal the senator\u2019s cell phone number.\u00a0 Like McCain, his harshest criticism of Mr. Trump comes on foreign policy issues. That contrast was at its starkest last week, when Graham called for the Obama administration to sanction Putin personally. But\u00a0when Mr. Trump was asked both about the White House\u2019s prepared actions against Russia and about Graham\u2019s proposal, he said people \u201cought to get on with our lives.\u201d  Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Nebraska) Sasse was among the strongest anti-Trump voices in the GOP during the campaign, publicly calling for a third-party candidate to challenge him last spring. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t America draft an honest leader who will focus on 70-percent solutions for the next four years?\u201d the freshman GOP senator asked. \u201cYou know...an adult?\u201d\u00a0 When it comes to Tillerson\u2019s nomination, Sasse is another member of the Senate who has expressed skepticism about how appropriate Tillerson\u2019s Russia ties are for the job. His spokesman tweeted, \u201cMr. Tillerson is a man of tremendous accomplishment, but U.S. policy toward Russia\u2019s Soviet-style aggression demands rigorous oversight.\u201d Like Paul, Sasse also has major ideological differences with Mr. Trump on a wide range of issues. Should the new president try to push through policies that deviate from GOP orthodoxy, Sasse will likely help lead the Republican resistance to the White House.\u00a0 Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida) Unlike the previous two senators, Rubio actually endorsed Mr. Trump during the campaign -- once the primaries were over, Rubio threw his support behind his former 2016 rival. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump was an enthusiastic backer of Rubio\u2019s successful re-election bid.\u00a0 But Rubio has still been critical of Mr. Trump over foreign policy issues, namely his rhetoric toward Russia. When Mr. Trump floated Tillerson as his secretary of state pick, Rubio was one of the first to express skepticism: \u201cBeing a \u2018friend of Vladimir\u2019 is not an attribute I am hoping for from a #SecretaryOfState,\u201d he tweeted, referring to an award Tillerson received from Russia\u2019s government.  Rubio is another member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, meaning he too gets to vote on Tillerson\u2019s nomination before it advances to the full Senate. Should he decide Tillerson is too close to Russia, he could make things difficult. Ohio Gov. John Kasich Kasich didn\u2019t turn up to the Republican convention to support Mr. Trump\u2019s nomination despite being the governor of the state in which it was held: that\u2019s how much the Ohio governor disapproved of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. Things haven\u2019t really thawed much since then, with Mr. Trump trashing Kasich on the campaign trail and Kasich continuing to criticize Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign through Election Day. Kasich\u2019s top strategist, John Weaver, is also one of the most consistently anti-Trump Republican\u00a0politicos on Twitter. There\u2019s less Kasich can do to directly thwart Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda than some of the others on this list, since he\u2019s a governor and not a U.S. Senator. But he could continue to be a thorn in his side from afar. The conservative media It\u2019s no secret that much of the traditional conservative media, including the Weekly Standard and the National Review, were no fans of Mr. Trump during and after the campaign. Outgoing Weekly Standard editor-in-chief Bill Kristol even tried drafting an independent candidate to run against Mr. Trump. But most Republican candidates have been able to count on at least relatively consistent support from the conservative media writ large -- something Mr. Trump will likely have to do without. That\u2019s not to say he doesn\u2019t have his corners within conservative media: outlets like Breitbart and the Drudge Report were enthusiastic boosters of Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy and remain so now that he\u2019s the president-elect. Still, even at Breitbart, Mr. Trump could see some trouble if he doesn\u2019t keep his campaign promises. After Mr. Trump said he did not intend to pursue criminal charges against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Breitbart ran a story on the issue calling it a \u201cbroken promise\u201d from Mr Trump. The website has also been critical of some of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet nominations, such as his pick to be secretary of labor, Andy Puzder, whom Breitbart accused of wanting to \u201cimport foreign workers to fill U.S. jobs.\u201d\u00a0 Should Mr. Trump renege on some high-profile campaign promises -- a real possibility, particularly with regard to the U.S.-Mexico border wall or a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act -- he could face pushback from the friendly news outlets who speak directly to his base.\u00a0 Emily Schultheis is a reporter/editor for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The International Monetary Fund on Monday raised its forecast for the U.S. economy over the next two years, saying President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s policies would boost economic growth. But officials warned that if Trump\u2019s protectionist trade proposals set off a trade war, that could be \u201cquite destructive\u201d for the global economy. The IMF also increased 2017 growth projections for a number of other countries including China, Germany, Japan and Britain, but warned that the global economy faced a number of downside risks from rising protectionism to a jump in interest rates. The forecast, which is part of the 189-nation lending agency\u2019s\u00a0Global Economic Outlook Update, noted that Trump\u2019s election has already given a significant boost to U.S. stock prices, interest rates and the dollar.\u00a0 The new outlook puts U.S. economic growth at 2.3 percent this year and 2.5 percent in 2018. That would be an improvement from lackluster U.S. growth around 1.6 percent in 2016, according to IMF estimates. The new forecast represents a boost of 0.1 percentage point this year and an increase of 0.4 percentage point for 2018, when Trump\u2019s stimulus plans would be expected to take effect. That is a half-point higher growth than the IMF was forecasting in October, before Trump\u2019s election. During the campaign, Trump said his economic policies of tax cuts, regulatory reform and boosts in infrastructure spending would lift U.S. growth to annual rates of 4 percent. However, the World Bank last week left its U.S. forecast unchanged at 2.2 percent growth in 2017 and 2.1 percent for 2018, arguing that there was too much uncertainty over the fate of Trump\u2019s proposals to incorporate them in a forecast. IMF Chief Economist Maurice Obstfeld told reporters at a briefing Monday that the IMF\u2019s upgrade for the United States was a moderate increase that took into account the U.S. election results. \u201cWe now have the presidency and the legislative branch in the same hands. It seems very clear to us that some of the promises will be delivered on,\u201d Obstfeld said. \u201cWe know the direction of policies. We don\u2019t know the specifics.\u201d He said that the IMF had chosen not to incorporate Trump\u2019s threats of imposing higher tariffs on countries such as China and Mexico if their trade policies do not change because he believed \u201cthat at the end of the day, countries will realize these are not in their best interests given the threat of retaliation. ... The outbreak of a trade war would be quite destructive.\u201d For the overall global economy, the IMF left its projections unchanged growth of 3.4 percent for this year and 3.6 percent for 2018, both up from 3.1 percent growth in 2016, a year when global growth slowed to its weakest performance since the 2008-2009 financial crisis. But the IMF saw better prospects in a number of countries including Germany, Japan, Spain and Britain, thanks in part to a rebound in growth in many parts of the world in the second half of last year that gave momentum going into 2017. Still, Obstfeld said there was a wider than usual range of upside and downside risks, in part because of the uncertainty over how much of Trump\u2019s program will win congressional approval and what the spillover effects will be for the rest of the world. While Trump\u2019s election victory boosted economic prospects in the United States, the impact has been uneven for the rest of the world. Some countries could see stronger growth from the increase in activity in the United States, the world\u2019s largest economy, but some emerging market countries may face challenges as global interest rates rise. The new outlook boosted the growth forecast for China, the world\u2019s second largest economy, by 0.3 percentage point to 6.5 percent this year. The IMF expects the Chinese government to providing further stimulus to the economy. The outlook also boosted 2017 growth projections for Germany, Japan, Spain and Britain to reflect stronger-than-expected performance in the second half of last year. At the same time, the IMF lowered its forecasts for Italy, South Korea, India and Brazil, reflecting disappointing performances in the last half of 2016. The IMF said that growth prospects in Latin America were being hurt by rising uncertainty about the outlook in Mexico, given Trump\u2019s statements overhauling trade relations between the United States and Mexico. about The IMF slashed its growth projections for Mexico by 0.6 percentage point in both 2017 and 2018 to 1.7 percent this year and 2 percent next year. Obstfeld said that among the risks facing the global economy at the moment were \u201chigher popular antipathy toward trade, immigration and multilateral engagement\u201d among voters in the U.S. and Europe.",

            "article_content": "Facebook, Twitter and Google\u00a0acknowledged to U.S. lawmakers\u00a0on Tuesday that Russian-linked accounts began exploiting their services in 2015 to sway last year's presidential election. Lawyers for the companies were grilled about why they didn't notice how their platforms were misused earlier, and about what they have done \u2014 and will do \u2014 to prevent such abuse from happening again. Here are five things the companies need to tell Congress: WHY SO LATE? The election was nearly a year ago. Why did it take so long for Facebook, Google and Twitter to see how their platforms were used by foreign actors to influence the election? Congress would really like to know. As Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., put it: \"People are buying ads on your platform with rubles. They are political ads. You put billions of data points together all the time, that's what I hear that these platforms do. They are the most sophisticated things invented by man, ever. Google has all knowledge that man has ever developed. You can't put together rubles with a political ad and go like, 'Hmmm, those data points spell out something pretty bad.'\" In hindsight, Facebook general counsel Colin Stretch acknowledged, the company should have had a \"broader lens.\" He also noted that the company\u00a0published research in April\u00a0disclosing that governments and other malicious non-state actors were using its social network to influence elections \u2014 though the company didn't directly name Russia at the time. WAS IT JUST RUSSIA? It's already illegal for Russians and other foreigners to pay for U.S. political ads. But some lawmakers suggested there was no way for tech companies to know if entities from other countries \u2014 like China, North Korea, or, in one memorable exchange, Turkmenistan \u2014 had also misused their platforms. After all, they didn't know about Russia's efforts for a long time, either. With 5 million advertisers every month, Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy asked of Facebook, \"How can you be aware?\" Especially, he said, when companies and others can hide behind shell companies to mask their true identities. Stretch stopped short of saying with certainty that other countries didn't purchase misleading or false ads on Facebook. PUBLISHERS OR PLATFORMS? Kennedy also asked Richard Salgado, Google's director of law enforcement and information security, whether the company is a \"newspaper\" or a neutral tech platform. Salgado replied that Google is a tech company, to which Kennedy quipped, \"that's what I thought you'd say.\" The other two companies also consider themselves technology platforms that merely allow newspapers and other media companies to share information. But at a time when millions of Americans count Facebook, Twitter and Google their primary news sources, the companies will likely have to try harder to convince lawmakers and the public that they are not in the media business. The distinction is important when it comes to regulation. Tech platforms are generally not responsible for the content on their sites. Media companies are. IS THERE MORE? Facebook has already disclosed that content generated by a Russian internet agency potentially reached as many as 126 million users. Twitter told the same subcommittee that it has uncovered and shut down 2,752 accounts linked to Russia's Internet Research Agency, which is known for promoting pro-Russian government positions. And Google said it found evidence of \"limited\" misuse of its services by the Russian group, as well as some YouTube channels that were likely backed by Russian agents. But was this all? The companies are not done with their investigations into Russian interference \u2014 and Congress may just be getting warmed up. CAN THEY FIX THE PROBLEMS WITHOUT REGULATION? Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar pressed representatives of Facebook, Google and Twitter to declare whether they will support the \"Honest Ads\" bill she has introduced with Sen. Mark Warner, which would bring political ad rules from TV, radio and print to the internet. Each of the tech giants offered only qualified support rather than a straight \"yes.\" Klobuchar noted that none of the companies included \"issue ads\" in their updated advertising policies \u2014 even though that's what the majority of the Russia-linked ads were. Rather than outright supporting a political candidate, these ads deal with hot-button issues like race and immigration and are designed to sow discord among the public. \"Obviously it would be easier if everyone had the same rules,\" she said.",

            "article_content": "Democrat Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in Virginia on Tuesday, keeping the governorship in the hands of the Democratic Party for another four years.  Among those who voted, Gillespie did a good job appealing to his conservative base, getting the solid support of older, more conservative white voters. But liberals and moderates tacked strongly towards Northam, helped by the strong support of women, African Americans, younger voters, and those who disapprove of President Trump. While Gillespie made a strong showing in central and western mountain regions of the state, Northam did far better in the rest of the state \u2013 the D.C. suburbs, the Hampton Roads or Tidewater region, and the area around Richmond. Despite pre-election polling that indicated Gillespie might be making inroads on Northam's lead in the polls, exit poll results show a strong shift towards Northam in the last days of the race. Of voters who made up their minds within the last week, six in ten voted for Northam.  Gillespie pointedly championed certain touchstone cultural issues in his campaign, though it did not bring about a victory in Virginia. While most voters agreed with Gillespie that monuments to Confederate leaders on government property should remain in place \u2013 a fourth who did so nevertheless voted for Northam. And while voters who chose immigration as their most important issue voted for Gillespie, they made up just 12 percent of voters. Instead, the most important issue to voters was health care, and these voters chose Northam over Gillespie by a margin of 55 percentage points.\u00a0  Both candidates sewed up the support of their own partisans -- each getting more than nine in ten votes from members of their own parties \u2013 and Gillespie held a slim three-point advantage among independents. But Democrats made up 41 percent of the Virginia electorate \u2013 a four-point increase from 2013 and ten points more than the Republican share of the vote \u2013 which more than offset Gillespie's slight edge among independents. Overall, six in 10 Virginia voters said they had an unfavorable view of the Republican Party, while just over half said they viewed the Democratic Party favorably. Negative views of the Republican Party nearly matched the job approval of President Trump: nearly six in ten Virginia voters said they disapproved of the job Donald Trump was doing as President. And while half said that Mr. Trump made no difference in their vote, among the rest, twice as many cast their vote to express opposition to the president as did so to show support.  The Democratic Party's rise in the share of the vote accompanied an overall left-leaning shift in the electorate from four years ago.\u00a0 Twenty-seven percent of voters in Virginia described themselves a liberal \u2013 a seven-point increase from 2013 \u2013 while the percentage of conservatives dipped five points, from 36 percent in 2013 to 31 percent this year. Moderates \u2013 who made up the largest slice ideologically at 42 percent of the vote \u2013 chose Northam by nearly two to one. Men were divided between the two candidates, but the Democratic vote share among women rose ten points \u2013 from 51 percent in 2013 to 61 percent today. The relative turnout among younger voters remained constant, but they embraced the Democratic candidate in far greater percentages than they did four years ago. Mr. Northam enjoyed a 39-point lead among voters under 30; a surge of 34 points from the slim five-point lead Democrat Terry McAuliffe enjoyed in 2013.\u00a0  African American turnout \u2013 critical for any Democratic win in the South \u2013 remained strong as well. Black voters made up a fifth of the electorate, and nearly nine in ten African Americans voted Democratic, continuing a pattern that has held for the last three statewide elections. \u00a0",

            "article_content": "The vice president and his chief strategist, Steve Bannon, campaigned for opposing Alabama Senate candidates Monday night, the eve of the state's\u00a0runoff election\u00a0to fill Attorney General Jeff Sessions' vacant Senate seat. \"Tomorrow is going to decide who has sovereignty in the United State of America,\" Bannon declared in Fairhope, Alabama, at a rally for the insurgent challenger, former state Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore. \"Is it the elites in Washington, D.C. with their money, or is it the people in Alabama with their muscle?\" Although President Trump backs Moore's opponent, incumbent Sen. Luther Strange, Bannon made it clear that he thinks it's actually Moore who best represents the president's interests. \"A vote for Judge Roy Moore is a vote for Donald J. Trump. And a vote for Donald J. Trump is a vote to make America great again,\" Bannon concluded. Mr. Trump has been vocal in his endorsement of Strange, tweeting his support of the candidate on many occasions, and on Friday he rallied in Huntsville, Alabama, to campaign his behalf. It was great being with Luther Strange last night in Alabama. What great people, what a crowd! Vote Luther on Tuesday. Will be in Alabama tonight. Luther Strange has gained mightily since my endorsement, but will be very close. He loves Alabama, and so do I! While Mr. Trump's support of Strange has not wavered, he admitted he may not have picked the winning candidate, and he assured GOP Alabama voters that he'll throw his support behind the winner of the runoff. \"I told Luther, and I have to say this, if his opponent wins, I'm going to be here campaigning like hell for him,\" Trump said in Huntsville Friday.\u00a0 Pence lent his support on election eve at a campaign rally in Birmingham, Alabama, Monday night. \"I stand with Luther, I stand with President Donald Trump and I will always stand for our national anthem,\" Pence said at Strange's rally, referencing the ongoing debate between Mr. Trump and NFL players who refuse to stand for \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" out of protest. Strange was appointed in February to temporarily fill Sessions' Senate seat by former\u00a0Gov. Robert Bentley, who resigned shortly after the appointment.  \"I know with Senator Strange's strong support, we'll repeal and replace Obamacare,\" Pence said, adding that a vote against the Graham-Cassidy health care bill is a \"vote to save Obamacare.\" Pence also reminded voters that Mr. Trump and Strange are united in their views on immigration policy.  \"President Trump and Big Luther are going to build that wall,\" Pence said, using Strange's nickname. The crowd responded with cheers and chants of \"build that wall!\"  In addition to winning the support of the Trump administration, Alabama's other senator, Republican Sen. Richard Shelby, has announced his support for Strange. He has also won the endorsement\u00a0of the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC closely tied to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, as well as conservative groups like the National Rifle Association and the National Right to Life Committee. \"With President Trump in the White House and Luther Strange in the Senate, we will make America safe again, we will make America prosperous again and, to borrow a phrase, we will make America great again,\" Pence concluded, also asking the people of Alabama to \"send this good man back to the United States Senate.\" Moore is running a shake-up, anti-establishment campaign, winning him the backing of Bannon's right-wing website, Breitbart News. In 2003, Moore refused a federal court order to remove a statue of  the Ten Commandments from court grounds, which got him kicked off the  bench. He was later reinstated in 2012, but he was kicked off again  in 2016 for not abiding by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to allow  gay marriage in 2016. \"This populist, nationalist, conservative movement is on the rise. And Judge Roy Moore represents your values. He represents the state of Alabama's values,\" Bannon told Alabama voters.  Senate Republicans worry that Moore's unorthodox political nature may disrupt GOP Senate goals, or that it might even give Democrat Doug Jones an advantage. Toward the end of the rally, Moore used a memorable approach to answer one charge that's been leveled against him, saying, \"And I don't believe in the Second Amendment? I believe in the Second Amendment!\" He then pulled a handgun out of his pocket to show the crowd. Blair Guild is a politics reporter and video producer for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "Facebook (FB) said Wednesday that phony accounts that appear to have originated in Russia bought $100,000 worth of advertisements during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign and in the months following the election.\u00a0 Most of the ads didn't specifically mention the election or express support for a particular candidate. But they did appear to \"focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum -- touching on topics from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights,\" said Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos in a\u00a0post on the social networking site. Between June 2015 and May of this year, roughly 3,000 ads connected with 470 \"inauthentic accounts\" ran on Facebook, according to the company. \"Our analysis suggests these accounts and pages were affiliated with one another and likely operated out of Russia,\" it said. A Facebook official confirmed to CBS News that some of the accounts are linked to a troll farm called the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg. \u00a0 \"Around this particular event, it looks like [the accounts] were using U.S. IP addresses to make it look like they were legitimate Americans, but using Russian as a preferred language,\" said Dimitri Sirota, CEO of the privacy management company BigID. Also, some accounts were most active during time windows corresponding to a Russian location, he noted. Facebook said it shut down the fake accounts that were still active, but did not specify the number. The Washington Post, which first reported the news, said the ad operation sought to target U.S. voters. A small number of the ads mentioned either then-candidate Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton by name.\u00a0 Facebook has been struggling with the issue of fake accounts, including organizations seeking to promote posts and generate traffic using bots.\u00a0 Earlier this year, it purged tens of thousands of accounts that had shown up as \"likes\" and followers on pages belonging to media outlets. It deleted 30,000 accounts in the run-up to the French national election in May, an event that allegedly also involved fake accounts linked to Russia.",

            "article_content": "PHOENIX\u00a0\u2014 Donald Trump was just a few weeks into his candidacy in 2015 when he came to Phoenix for a speech that ended up being a bigger moment in his campaign than most people realized at the time. Trump savaged his critics and the media, vowed to fine Mexico $100,000 for each immigrant entering the country illegally, talked tough on trade, promised to return America to its winning ways and borrowed a line from Richard Nixon in declaring, \"The silent majority is back.\" The packed crowd ate it up \u2014 the raucous enthusiasm an early sign of the overwhelming support among Trump's base that would help carry him to the presidency. As Trump returns to Arizona on Tuesday in need of another big moment, he will find a place where his agenda and unconventional leadership style have consumed the political landscape and elevated the state's status in the national fight for control of power in Washington in 2018. The president is scheduled to hold a \"Make America Great Again\" rally in Phoenix Tuesday night after a stop in Yuma where he'll tour U.S. Customs and Border Protection border equipment and hold a meet and greet with Marines. This comes a day after he unveiled what he described as a \"dramatically\" new strategy for Afghanistan and South Asia in a primetime address to the nation, but offered few details. It was Arizona senator John McCain who cast the vote that derailed Trump's effort to repeal the health care law. The other Arizona senator, Jeff Flake, has become the poster child for Republicans who buck the president and feel his wrath on Twitter. Mr. Trump is almost certain to back a GOP challenger to Flake in 2018, complicating Republican efforts to maintain control of the Senate.\u00a0 Trump has also revived the immigration debate and infuriated Latinos here with his talk of pardoning former Sheriff Joe Arpaio over his recent conviction for breaking the law with his signature immigration patrols. The controversy over Civil War monuments has even spilled into Arizona, where the governor has faced repeated calls to take down a handful of Confederate memorials in the state. And an overlooked item in Trump's agenda, school choice, has made education a hot campaign issue in Arizona. With the strong support of Education Secretary Besty DeVos, Arizona passed the nation's most ambitious expansion of vouchers this year, and public school advocates recently submitted more than 100,000 signatures in a petition drive to get the law wiped out on the 2018 ballot. If that isn't enough fuel for a political bonfire, Trump's visit to Arizona will be his first political event since the race-driven violence in Virginia and his divisive comments in the aftermath of the protests. That created a dilemma for Republicans like Gov. Doug Ducey on whether to take the stage at the Trump rally while running for re-election. Doing so would subject him to attacks from moderates and the left by appearing with the president so soon after Charlottesville and possibly at the same time as the president pardons Arpaio and throws his endorsement behind Flake's challenger. But avoiding the stage could hurt him with the base. Ducey's plan is to greet the president on the airport tarmac and skip the rally, saying he wants to oversee the law enforcement response to protests. The governor supported Trump and appeared on stage at one of his rallies last year in Arizona. Trump would be hard-pressed to find a state where his Republican base is as faithful and vocal as in Arizona, which is a big reason why he came to the state seven times during his campaign and refers to the \"special place\" it holds for him. The fierce, non-conformist political spirit evident at Trump rallies here traces its roots to the frontier days and allows hard-fisted politicians like him and Arpaio to thrive. \"The Republican primary base in Arizona is highly partisan, semi-libertarian in the sense that it's against the swamp,\" said longtime Republican political strategist Chuck Coughlin. \"We're the 48th state to join. We're still acting like a juvenile. We still act like we're the last one invited to the party which is sort of what Donald Trump is.\" The biggest consequence of Trump's unorthodox governing style may be seen in Flake's re-election effort. Flake has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump, taking him to task in pointed jabs in a recent book. Trump has been sending out Tweets signaling his support for far-right former state Sen. Kelli Ward, who is running against Flake in the primary. Other Republicans with less baggage than Ward could also enter the race and complicate things further, making it harder for Republicans to keep the seat in the general election. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema is considered the top threat on the Democratic side. \"If the president himself is supporting a challenger to Jeff, it's a serious problem,\" said Coughlin, who has been polling voters about the intra-party turmoil that has unsettled the race. Voters like Julie Brown are indicative of the GOP struggle in the Trump administration between the base and establishment. She attended a Trump rally last year and remains steadfast in her support of the president, even after Charlottesville. \"He's not totally polished and everyone tears apart his words, but you'll never have to guess what he's thinking and I like that much better than a politician who just gets up there and buoyantly lies and is bought by lobbyists,\" Brown said. \"He's just straightforward, and like I said, it rocks the boat but we need it.\"",

            "article_content": "Three GOP candidates hoping to replace former Rep. Jason Chaffetz in Congress face off in a primary election Tuesday after weeks trying to burnish their conservative credentials and fend off attack ads from deep-pocketed outside groups. Chaffetz abruptly stepped down from his seat in June after making a name for himself as the Republican who relentlessly investigated Hillary Clinton and her emails while he was chairman of the House Oversight Committee. His departure opened up a congressional seat in a district where Republicans outnumber Democrats five-to-one, offering voters and donors a choice between three candidates emblematic of the divisions roiling the GOP under President Donald Trump. Out-of-state organizations and political action committees have spent about $900,000 in Utah's race \u2014 on top of about $600,000 in campaign contributions collected by the three Republicans running for Utah's 3rd Congressional District. Outside spending of that magnitude is generally only seen in deep-red Utah when Democrats and Republicans face off occasional close races. Moderate Utah Republicans have backed a popular mayor, John Curtis, who was once a Democrat and said he had strong moral concerns that kept him from voting for Trump. Those further to the right have split their support behind Chris Herrod, a former state lawmaker known for strict immigration positions, and Tanner Ainge, a business consultant, first-time candidate and son of Boston Celtics president Danny Ainge. Herrod, 51, and Ainge, 33, both voted for Trump, but all three candidates say they support the president's agenda \u2014 including plans to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border, revamp the tax code and repeal the Affordable Care Act. Curtis, the target of most of the out-of-state attack ads, has faced suspicion and criticism from some Republicans for his 2000 run as a Democrat for the state Legislature and his time leading a county Democratic party. The 57-year-old identifies today as a conservative Republican and points out that Ronald Reagan, Trump and Chaffetz were all Democrats at one point. For Ada Wilson, a 59-year-old Republican homemaker from Orem, Curtis' stint across the aisle is one of the reasons she's voting for him. Wilson said it shows Curtis can work in a bipartisan way to get things done. \"I think he acknowledges that being Republican with an 'R' by your name does not automatically make you a keeper of all the answers,\" she said. David Nelson, a pharmaceutical representative from Salem, Utah, said he thinks Curtis' Democratic past shows he's not a conservative. Nelson said it's OK that Ainge hasn't held public office, and he's voting for the younger candidate because of his \"business-minded\" outlook. \"I think that you don't have to have all the experience in the world to go to Washington and work for the people,\" he said. \"You just have to be in tune with the pulse of the people.\" Martin Wilkins, a 39-year-old UPS worker from Orem, said Ainge seems like a nice guy but is too young and inexperienced. \"In the political world, he's just a kid and no one is going to listen to him,\" Wilkins said. \"If you go into college and a kindergarten student starts trying to order people around, no one is going to listen.\" Wilkins said he voted for Herrod because seems like the kind of person who tells it straight, whether it's popular or not. The winner coming out of Tuesday's race will face a well-funded Democratic opponent who initially jumped in to challenge Chaffetz earlier this year. Kathryn Allen socked away more than half a million dollars after she called out Chaffetz early this year for his comments suggesting people should spend money on health care instead of iPhones. Chaffetz made a surprise announcement that he was resigning at the end of June, citing a desire to spend more time with family after eight years in Congress. He's since taken a role as a Fox News commentator and announced he will be one of six visiting fellows at Harvard University this fall. Several third-party candidates are also running, including Jim Bennett, the son of the late former U.S. Sen. Bob Bennett, a longtime Republican who lost re-election in 2010, the first of several GOP candidates ousted in tea-party fueled wave. Jim Bennett is running as the first candidate of a new centrist party, the United Utah Party.",

            "article_content": "Mike Pence, despite his recent protestations to the contrary, is clearly considering the possibility of running for president in 2020.  And why wouldn't he?  Given Donald Trump's anemic approval ratings, and the metastasizing Russia scandal, it would be political malpractice for Pence not to be preparing for the possibility. It would also be a disservice to the GOP, which may come to count on him to keep the White House in Republican hands. And like every politician of his stature, Pence clearly wants to be president, and a Trump implosion is likely his best shot of ever getting the chance.  This is not to say that Trump is now doomed, or that he's invariably heading towards impeachment. In all likelihood, he'll be the Republican nominee in 2020, and will enjoy the profound electoral advantages given to any presidential incumbent. Despite all the baggage he has and continues to accumulate, he's still, at this very early stage, more likely to be reelected than not.  For more on that point, look at the internal dysfunction of the Democratic Party, which shows no signs of abating in the near future. \"Resistance has given the Democrats the illusion of unity, but the reality is deeply conflicted,\" Franklin Foer wrote in a piece published this week by The Atlantic. \"Two of the party's largest concerns\u2014race and class\u2014reside in an increasing state of tension, a tension that will grow as the party turns toward the next presidential election.\" A preview of this looming intraparty battle came when Kamala Harris, California's newly elected Democratic senator, was floated as a potential standard bearer for the Party's establishment. Almost instantly, leftists took aim at Harris and other candidates touted by the moderates, in particular former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and Cory Booker, a New Jersey senator.  Astounding how quickly the Bernie Sanders crew has mobilized against Kamala Harris. pic.twitter.com/ERUuhfFSvw Given the Democrats'\u00a0preoccupation with racial issues, it's worth noting that Harris, Patrick, and Booker are black. The African-American vote is essential to Democrats' success at the national level, a fact that's been obscured somewhat with their newfound fixation on the white working class. Hillary Clinton prevailed against Bernie Sanders in large part due to her support among black voters in the 2016 primary, providing a useful roadmap for establishmentarian Democrats looking to stave off a left-wing takeover of their party. And given the fall-off in minority turnout last cycle, there's an argument to be made that the Party shouldn't risk running a white nominee in the near future. If establishment Democrats successfully rally around someone like Harris, it would also open up her left-wing detractors to accusations of racism and sexism, however unfounded. Accusing opponents of bigotry can be a bit of a reflex with some liberals; an undercurrent of Foer's article is the tendency of modern Democrats to not only view Republicans as hopelessly racist, but many of their own voters as well. Neera Tanden, a longtime Clinton ally and president of the Center for American Progress, has already begun to insinuate that race has something to do with leftist objections to Harris and Booker.  So odd, no, that these folks have if in for Kamala Harris and Cory Booker.... hhhhmmm. Needless to say, a Democratic primary openly fought along the lines of race and class is likely to get astoundingly ugly. And given the likelihood that more than a dozen Democrats could easily wind up running in 2020, each attempting to break out via naked appeals to various subsections of the base, it's not hard to imagine the Party hobbling into the general election after a contentious, bruising primary battle that leaves them weaker and less unified than they are today.  The cultural dynamics of the Democratic Party may also preclude a concerted effort to win back the white working class that was largely responsible for Trump's crucial victories in Pennsylvania and the Midwest. Regardless of faction, nearly every Democratic-leaning intellectual and pundit agrees that the Party must adopt a more populist message. The question, which is sure to bedevil all Democratic aspirants for the presidency in 2020, is what the populism will look like, and which demographics it should prioritize.\u00a0 Does populism mean some combination single payer, a minimum wage hike, and a massive expansion in the welfare state? Leftists say yes, though all of that would necessitate trillions of dollars in new taxes, which could scare away the moderate professionals Democrats have been cultivating for years.  Does populism mean a continued focus on identity politics, increased immigration, and charges of institutional discrimination? Well, these are the cultural fault lines that in large part scared away white working class voters in the first place, and doubling down will probably alienate them further. The obvious compromise for Democrats is to combine both ways of thinking, which would mark the Party's transformation into an aggressively left-wing coalition in the mold of Labour under Jeremy Corbyn. In this scenario, the Democrats would not pick between class war and culture war, instead choosing to fight the Republicans on both fronts. Perhaps there's a hidden pining among the broad electorate for this kind of unabashed leftism, but chances are there isn't, and that such a pivot would result in moderates fleeing the party en masse.  A profound leftward shift could pave the way for an independent centrist candidate to pick off Democratic votes, which might allow Trump to win reelection despite subterranean approval ratings. This would be similar to the dynamic that's emerged in Maine in recent years, where the flamboyantly right-wing Republican Paul LePage is now in his second term as governor.  Democrats are likely to have a lot going for them in 2020. Regardless of whether the GOP is led by Trump or Pence, it's difficult to imagine either being held in high esteem by voters. But what the Republicans do have is an opposition on the verge of war with itself, and that alone could ensure their continued political dominance into the next decade. \u00a0\u00a0 Will Rahn is a political correspondent and managing director, politics, for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "Former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson was at the center of the Obama administration's response to Russian election interference in 2016. On Sunday, \"Face the Nation\" sat down with Johnson to discuss the presidential election, cybersecurity -- and more. A transcript of the interview with Johnson follows. JOHN DICKERSON: And welcome back to \"Face the Nation.\" We turn now to President Obama's Homeland Security Secretary, Jeh Johnson. Welcome, thanks for being here.\u00a0 JEH JOHNSON: John, thanks for having me on the show.  JOHN DICKERSON: Let's start, President Trump is in need of a new Homeland Security Secretary. What should he be looking for in the new person?  JEH JOHNSON: Well, I won't recommend anyone in particular, but three things come to mind. First, DHS is the third-largest cabinet-level department of our government, but it is the most decentralized, ranging from aviation security, immigration, maritime security, Secret Service, FEMA, and counterterrorism, of course. We need to continue the management reforms that I and others initiated in the last term.  I know John was very dedicated to that. I hope the next secretary is dedicated to that. Also, we need a national champion and a national spokesperson when it comes to cybersecurity. DHS is charged with the cybersecurity mission and cybersecurity has become, in my judgment, the other cornerstone of the department's missions, along with counterterrorism. So we need someone to champion and drive cybersecurity policy for the government, and we need to continue to focus on countering violent extremism here in the United States. And that was something I spent a lot of time on, and I know John Kelly was very dedicated to it as well.  JOHN DICKERSON: So, John Kelly, you talked to him. You know him. How do you think he'll do as chief of staff?  JEH JOHNSON: Well, judging by the first five business days, so far so good. John is - John is a Marine. And he is dedicated to his commander in chief's mission, whatever that mission may be. I don't believe John is a political animal, he, he - he accepts the mission and he follows it and will do it energetically.  JOHN DICKERSON: Let me look back at - at the Russia question. And at the - you put out a statement in October of 2016 --  JEH JOHNSON: Yes.  JOHN DICKERSON: -- letting the country know of declassified information. Were you surprised at the reaction to that information, that it wasn't stronger?  JEH JOHNSON: Good question. Here's what I was surprised at: Jim Clapper and I issued that statement on October 7th. Friday, October 7th, 2016. A lot of things happened on Friday, October 7th, 2016, including the release of that Access Hollywood video, the very same day. So when we were drafting that statement, we thought, \"This is unprecedented that the United States Government is accusing a superpower of interfering in our elections.\" But it was literally below-the-fold news that day because of the release of the Access Hollywood video, so it did not at the time get the attention that I and others thought it would and should.  JOHN DICKERSON: But there were other days after that between then and the election.  JEH JOHNSON: Very clearly, yes.  JOHN DICKERSON: Had people gotten complacent about Russia at that point in?  JEH JOHNSON: No. I don't think \"complacency\" is the right word. I think that in the heat of the campaign, there were a lot of things going on, a lot of charges back and forth. We thought it was critical that the American voter and the American people know that there was a superpower attempting to put his thumb on the scale of our American elections before the elections occurred, so that the American people could know what was behind a lot of the activity that we were seeing. There's still, however, a threat out there to our election infrastructure that this administration needs to address.  JOHN DICKERSON: Do you wish you'd done more in retrospect?  JEH JOHNSON: A lot of people like to ask those questions like that. Anytime you take on a tough issue, people say, \"Should you have done more? Should you have done it sooner? Should you- Why did you do it at all?\" And I know that in the summer/fall run-up to the election, this was a front-burner item for me, for the president, for our intelligence community. We took actions in the fall and in the last few days of the administration. Now, it's on the next administration to carry forward a lot of the things that we did.  JOHN DICKERSON: And the FBI was monitoring on election day. Were you a part of that process? Monitoring for fake news on election day.  JEH JOHNSON:The Department of Homeland Security very much was on alert on election day and in the days leading up to it, along with the FBI. And we were very concerned. Fortunately, 33 states in some 36 cities and counties came to us before the election to seek our cybersecurity assistance. And we identified a number of vulnerabilities in election infrastructure which were addressed. But that process needs to continue. I'm concerned that we are almost as vulnerable perhaps now as we were six, nine months ago.  JOHN DICKERSON: When you see these attacks on the national security advisor, H.R. McMaster, the flood of Twitter traffic. Suddenly all these stories are bouncing around. Do you look at that and say, \"That looks like what we saw before the election\"?  JEH JOHNSON: I'm certainly suspicious of a concerted effort directed at this one individual. You know, I tell audiences, and I told Congress in June, the cyber threat is going to get worse before it gets better in this country. Bad cyber actors are becoming more aggressive, more ingenious, and more tenacious. And that's why we need a national campaign from the president, from the next secretary of Homeland Security to really address this problem. Nothing would surprise me at this point in terms of their capabilities.  JOHN DICKERSON: You said elections are still vulnerable. Why is it- We had hanging chads and a long history of election issues. Why is it so hard to fix the election system?  JEH JOHNSON: Well, part of it, frankly, in my judgement, is our politics. When I engaged state election officials last summer about helping them with their cybersecurity, we got a lot of pushback from local officials who said, \"This is our-this is our domain, this is our responsibility, we don't want a federal takeover.\" And so I had to repeatedly say to them, \"This is not a federal takeover, we're here to provide assistance if you ask.\" And I'm glad that a lot of them did, but there is that dynamic that makes it particularly challenging.  JOHN DICKERSON: Final question -- when you were at the Department of Defense, you were the top lawyer there. You dealt with leaks a lot --  JEH JOHNSON: Yes.  JOHN DICKERSON: -- at the Department of Defense. Give me your assessment of what Attorney General Sessions has said about going after leaks. Is he drawing the line in the right place? And what does he need to balance?  JEH JOHNSON: The leaks right now are really bad. I've never seen it this bad. There should be a concerted effort to identify and go after leakers. The one note of caution I'd give the attorney general is what I tell younger lawyers: bad facts make bad law. So before you decide to take on journalists, reporters, and perhaps subpoena their sources, be aware that the courts are going to get involved, and that has the potential for making bad law in this area.  JOHN DICKERSON: All right, Secretary Johnson, thanks so much.  JEH JOHNSON: Thank you very much.",

            "article_content": "WARSAW -- Speaking only about 700 miles from Moscow and just a day before his first encounter with Vladimir Putin, President Trump on Thursday criticized what he called Russia's \"destabilizing behavior,\" and said the U.S. remained committed to deterring conflict in Europe. In the strongest terms he has used to date, Mr. Trump called on Russia to halt its destabilizing activities in Ukraine and elsewhere. He also called on Moscow to drop its support for \"hostile regimes\" in Syria and Iran. Mr. Trump then extended an invite to Russia to join the community of responsible nations to defend against terrorism -- a line which may resonate with Putin, who has long suggested interest in partnering with the U.S. to fight extremism in places like Syria. \u00a0 But as CBS News chief White House correspondent Major Garret reports, Mr. Trump also refused to blame Moscow -- as top U.S. intelligence agencies have done -- for alone carrying out cyber meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Ahead of his first face-to-face meeting with the Russian president, to come on Friday at a G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, Mr. Trump injected doubt into U.S. intelligence assessments that Putin himself directed Russia's unprecedented cyber meddling in the election. \"I think it was Russia, but I think it was probably other people and or countries and I see nothing wrong with that statement. Nobody really knows,\" Mr. Trump said.  One issue the U.S. will raise with Russia, says Garrett, is next steps in Syria. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson -- echoing Obama-administration policy -- said Wednesday that the U.S. goal is to cooperate with Russia on Syria's political future after ISIS is defeated. \"We have begun an effort to rebuild confidence between ourselves and Russia, at the military-to-military level, but also the diplomatic level,\" Tillerson said. \"But we're at the very beginning and I would say at this point it's difficult to say what Russia's intentions are in this relationship.\" Speaking soon after Mr. Trump gave his remarks in Warsaw, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia disagreed with the U.S. view of Moscow as a \"destabilizing\" force. \"We disagree with such an approach,\" Peskov said on a conference call with reporters, adding that the Kremlin also lamented the lack of mutual understanding at present between Washington and Moscow. \"This is exactly why we are waiting for the first meeting of the two presidents,\" Peskov said. In his address to the Polish people later Thursday, President Trump praised Poland as an example of courage in the face of oppression, and how best to defend Western civilization. \"Our citizens are confronted by yet another danger, one firmly in our control,\" Mr. Trump said. \"This danger is invisible to some, but familiar to the Poles: the steady creep of government bureaucracy that drains the vitality and wealth of the people.\" \u00a0\u00a0 The Polish government's tough approach on immigration, and recent crackdowns on press freedom and the courts, leave it out of step with many of the European leaders Mr. Trump will soon meet at the G-20 summit. Following North Korea's July 4 test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), Mr. Trump offered no specific roadmap or timetable for any next steps in dealing with the rogue nation. \"What happens over the next weeks and months with respect to North Korea\u2026 it's a shame that they are behaving this way, but they are behaving in a very, very dangerous manner, and something will have to be done about it,\" he said, after noting that his administration was considering some \"pretty severe things\" in response. President Trump's vague remarks left uncertain how the U.S. might bolster its efforts to deter North Korea's pursuit of ballistic missile technology to enable a theoretical nuclear strike against the U.S. Current administration options include pressuring China and other nations to limit North Korea's access to capital and labor. Before leaving for Europe, Mr. Trump asked the Pentagon for fresh military options to deal with North Korea.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "The political fortunes of President Donald Trump and the stock market are inextricably linked. And, clearly, both are currently experiencing setbacks as the catalyst for the post-election rally to record highs -- a market-friendly legislative agenda including tax cuts, deregulation and infrastructure spending -- come under threat. Stocks were hit with their largest decline since last September as the Trump administration battles a deepening crisis involving alleged ties between his campaign and Russia and Mr. Trump's decision to fire FBI director James Comey. The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday named former FBI chief Robert Mueller to\u00a0look into the matter.  Reuters reports that the Trump's campaign had at least 18 undisclosed contacts with Russia. As the president's woes deepen, so too does the threat to Wall Street, with bank stocks in particular looking vulnerable.  There is some irony in all this. Before November, the conventional wisdom up and down the Street was that a Trump victory would be a negative for financial markets because of his anti-establishment views, vows to crack down on immigration and protectionist leanings on trade.\u00a0 After the Election Day upset, and a short-lived decline in the futures market, investors only wanted to see the positives. As a result, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained more than 19 percent, hitting a new high in early March. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite did even better, shooting up nearly 23 percent into a high set earlier this month.  The optimism fueling this rise, however, was not justified, as the latest economic and corporate data is showing.\u00a0 The \"hard\" activity-based economic data has been weak for months, but now even survey based \"soft\" data is rolling over, absolutely crushing the Citigroup Economic Surprise Index shown in the chart above. The bond market also has been warning of trouble, with the U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield declining from a mid-March high of 2.62 percent to a low of 2.18 percent in the middle of April.  Technical measures suggested frothy sentiment was responsible. On a cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, the only time when stocks have been more expensive was heading into the 1929 and 2000 market bubble peaks. Breadth -- or the number of stocks participating to the upside -- has been narrowing as bullish investors focus on fewer and fewer issues (mainly, banks and big-tech stocks) to push the major averages higher. Meanwhile, both Wall Street's weakness and Trump's political headaches look like they are just getting started. The percentage of S&P 500 stocks in uptrends broke below its six-month range, dropping to 69 percent versus a high of 80 percent in March. Yet the S&P 500, at least for now, remains within the confines of a four-month trading range.  By this measure, stocks should return to levels last seen in December. That would take the Dow back below the 20,000 level, a loss of more than four percent. While a pullback of that magnitude doesn't sound so bad -- call it a pause that refreshes -- the pain will likely be more acute for specific areas of the market that surged on Trump's election win.  Big banks look vulnerable as the Financial Select SPDR (XLF) gained nearly a third\u00a0from its November low into its March high in anticipation of higher profit margins from \"Trump-flation\" -- that is, higher inflation, higher economic growth and higher long-term interest rates -- as well as hopes of a tailwind from deregulation given the White House's desire to roll back\u00a0Dodd-Frank reforms.\u00a0 Anthony Mirhaydari is founder of the Edge\r\n, an investment advisory newsletter, and Edge Pro, options newsletter.

As far as wiretapping goes, he said, \u201cAt least we have something in common, perhaps,\u201d as he motioned at Merkel.

All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was responsible for saying that on television. I didn\u2019t make an opinion on it. That was a statement made by a very talented lawyer -- on Fox -- and so, you shouldn\u2019t be talking to me.

Here\u2019s the live blog of the news conference. 2:37 p.m. The press conference is over. 2:31 p.m. The president was asked about his claim that President Obama ordered that phones at Trump Tower be tapped during the election.\u00a0 As far as wiretapping goes, he said, \u201cAt least we have something in common, perhaps,\u201d as he motioned at Merkel.

Germany has done very well in its trade deals with the United States.\u201d\u00a0 The president slammed NAFTA and said it\u2019s been a \u201cdisaster\u201d for the U.S.\u00a0 2:23 p.m. Merkel was asked about the isolationist policy Mr. Trump is pursuing and Mr. Trump was asked about fake news.\u00a0 \u201cNice, friendly reporter,\u201d he said sarcastically. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in isolationist policy.\u201d He said that \u201cour free trade\u201d has led to bad things happening and that he is not an isolationist by any stretch of the imagination.\u00a0 Merkel said they haven\u2019t had time to talk at length about economic issues. She said freedom of movement within the European Union is very important. She said migration and immigration have to be worked on and giving refugees opportunities to shape their own lives where they are.\u00a0 2:19 p.m. Mark Halperin asked Mr. Trump about healthcare and asked Merkel about Mr. Trump\u2019s style. The president repeated that he met with a group of lawmakers who were against the GOP healthcare bill Friday morning, and now, he claims, are in favor of it.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s all coming together. We\u2019re going to have great healthcare. It\u2019s going to be passed, I believe, and substantially, pretty quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cThe press has covered it pretty inaccurately.\u201d\u00a0 Merkel said that people are \u201cdifferent\u201d and have different ways of finding their way into politics.\u00a0 2:14 p.m.\u00a0Merkel said that they talked about \u201cthe international situation\u201d and apprentice programs. She spoke about their shared interests and said Germany owes a lot to the U.S. because of its economic rise, thanks to the Marshall Plan, and standing by it during the Cold War. She said she was gratified to hear the president underline the importance of NATO and said Germany is trying to work on spending more on defense. Merkel said that Germany is going to \u201cstep up\u201d its work in Afghanistan and in Syria.\u00a0 2:10 p.m. ET Mr. Trump kicked off the press conference saying that their two nations have a lot in common in terms of their desire for security and peace. He started speaking about rebuilding the American industrial base, and wanting to include and focus on women in that effort. The president said he mentioned to Merkel the need for NATO members to contribute more money to the alliance because he says they owe more than they\u2019re paying.\u00a0 \u201cI want to thank the chancellor for supporting NATO and its efforts in Afghanistan,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI also appreciate Chancellor Merkel\u2019s leadership along with the french president the conflict in Ukraine where we ideally seek a peaceful solution.\u201d He reiterated the need to defeat \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d and the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). He said over lunch, they will discuss fair and reciprocal trade policies.\u00a0 \u201cTogether, we can shape a future where all of our citizens have a path to financial security,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Rebecca Shabad is a video reporter for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "Wall Street has gone quiet. Two weeks after the Dow Jones industrials index pushed over the 20,000 level for the first time to great fanfare, volatility has collapsed, trading has been listless and everyone\u2019s interest seems to lie elsewhere. Like: Did Lady Gaga\u2019s Super Bowl performance have any hidden meaning? The ennui is real. And that\u2019s a letdown after the historic post-election uptrend fueled by euphoria over the surprise election of President Donald Trump. Initial excitement over positives like possible tax reform and pro-growth deregulation has given way to political acrimony in Congress, a divisive immigration clampdown and fears of an outright trade war.  With the holidays over and fourth-quarter earnings season largely a snore, it raises the question: Is the Trump rally over? If so, what comes next?  To be sure, the current situation is far from normal. Consider that large-cap stocks have gone 36 days without a 1 percent intraday move -- the longest such streak in history -- and 81 days without a 1 percent decline. January featured the narrowest trading range ever for the start of a year -- a far cry from last January\u2019s worst-ever start to a year.  No surprise then that sentiment and investor positioning measures are extremely bullish.  Gluskin Sheff\u2019s David Rosenberg highlights the latest Investors Intelligence survey, which shows that the bull camp has grown to a 19-month high of 61.8 percent of respondents, while the bear share is down to 17.6 percent. The spread between the two spiked to 44.2 from 40.7 the prior week, which \u201cis in the danger-complacency zone,\u201d according to Rosenberg.  Yet outside of equities, the recent tranquility has already been broken.  Bond yields are declining again. Gold is firming up. The dollar is back in rally mode. High-yield bond spreads, a measure of risk appetites, are widening. And on Tuesday, crude oil closed below its 50-day moving average (a measure of medium-term trend) for the first time since December amid bearish inventory data and lagging measures of demand.  Even inside the stock market, you can find evidence of weakness if you know where to look.  Consider that on Tuesday, according to Jason Goepfert at SentimenTrader, the total volume for positive securities was 1.1 billion shares, while declining issues had a whopping 2.2 billion. Still, large-caps overall posted a modest 0.2 percent gain on the day.  Goepfert checked his database for this rare occurrence of narrow buying interest -- which is exceedingly rare with stocks so near a record high. Looking back at the six such prior instances that have occurred since 2009, every one was followed by a market decline over the two months afterward, with an average loss of 3.4 percent. The last two instances were in July 2015 and were followed by losses of more than 6 percent.  Adding to the bad news is the historically poor performance stocks have demonstrated in February, especially in a post-election year. According to LPL Financial, since 1950 the S&P 500 index has gained a February average of just 0.03 percent and rose just 55 percent of the time. During post-election years, the average return drops to a loss of 1.8 percent, for the single worst month of the year.  Still, any volatility and weakness could prove ultimately to be a buying opportunity for stock investors, depending on the tone and tempo of Mr. Trump\u2019s policy implementation, the pace of rate hikes from the Federal Reserve and the quickness with which Congress acts on proposed tax cuts.  But for now, at least, investors should resist the urge to let things ride and consider taking some risk off the table. \u00a0 Anthony Mirhaydari is founder of the Edge\r\n, an investment advisory newsletter, and Edge Pro, options newsletter.

            "article_content": "With Donald Trump taking office Friday, asylum seekers and refugees to the U.S. -- long portrayed as sinister bogeyman while the\u00a0president-elect was on the campaign trail\u00a0-- are anxiously awaiting clarity on their future. \u201cWe always know that these things, we should not take them for granted,\u201d Ali Tehrani, a political activist and refugee from Iran, told CBS News. Tehrani was granted asylum in the U.S. a few years ago after he publicly contested the results of Iran\u2019s 2009 presidential election as rigged. \u201cUnfortunately, Trump\u2019s campaign made a political weapon\u201d out of refugees, he said. \u00a0\u201cAnd now we\u2019ve been to a very dangerous path and we\u2019re not very clear what will be the next step.\u201d Maikel Nabil Sanad, a 31-year-old writer and activist who moved to the U.S. in 2014 seeking asylum after he suffered political persecution in his native Egypt, also counts himself among those wary of what the future will bring for refugees.  \u201cI\u2019m a person who was tortured in my home country,\u201d Nabil told CBS, relaying the time he spent jailed after he participated in the Egyptian revolution. \u201cThe idea of being sent back to Egypt is a scary idea...and the lack of knowledge about my future for a long time is totally uncomfortable. I think everyone who\u2019s fleeing conflict, everyone who\u2019s fleeing war, everyone who\u2019s fleeing torture and oppression, feels fear as long as their asylum is hanging.\u201d These were prevalent thoughts for the refugees that gathered at Washington, D.C.\u2019s Sixth & I synagogue Tuesday, where a so-called Refugee Ball was staged earlier this week. The \u201cball\u201d -- organized by the attorneys at Dzubow & Pilcher, a low-bono firm that specializes in refugee and asylum cases -- was a boisterous party where refugees were the featured musical performers, artists, and food vendors. An Iranian rapper took the stage that night, along with Sudanese percussionists and a local immigration lawyer who moonlighted as a jazz singer. The dinner spread was a smorgasbord of Ethiopian injera, South Asian momos, and Middle Eastern ma\u2019amoul cookies for dessert.  But the outwardly festive ball had tense undercurrents, fueled by Mr. Trump\u2019s past statements about refugees and his inauguration to the presidency Friday. \u201cA lot of our clients are from the Middle East and I think a lot of people were feeling worried,\u201d said Sameen Ahmadnia, a Dzubow & Pilcher attorney who first pitched the idea of throwing an alternative ball to coincide with Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration week. \u201cThey had heard things concerning Muslim registries and [asked] what does this mean for my family who is not yet with me? I\u2019m applying for asylum but my family is still in Afghanistan?\u201d  Unlike some of the campaign promises that have been scaled back since his election win, Mr. Trump hasn\u2019t not modified his stance on the refugee crisis. During the campaign, he repeatedly warned that Syrian refugees could be \u201cTrojan horses\u201d for terrorists intent on harming the U.S. Mr. Trump hammered away at the issue after the Paris slaughter in November 2015, when it was revealed that one attacker held a Syrian passport.  And the president-elect\u2019s latest statements have done little to reassure asylum seekers.  To the Times of London earlier this month, Mr. Trump blasted Mideast refugees as \u201call of these illegals.\u201d He further attributed Britain\u2019s recent split from the European Union to the continent\u2019s embrace of refugees.  Because refugees had been \u201csomewhat denigrated during the election,\u201d Jason Dzubow, a partner at Dzubow & Pilcher, had pushed the Refugee Ball as a positive way to \u201ccelebrate the humanitarian system in the United States\u201d that takes in refugees.  But the president-elect has left others wondering what he\u2019ll do in the White House.  Advocates can offer few assurances. For those already in the country asking for asylum protections, thought, Dzubow has some optimism.\u00a0 Even if their case is pending, they have \u201cdue process protection,\u201d Dzubow says. \u201cYou can\u2019t just be removed from the country without an involved procedure where you can present your asylum case\u2026 that\u2019s not a possibility under the law.\u201d ",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump spent five days in Asia largely keeping the Alabama Senate scandal at bay. He won't be so lucky on U.S. soil. The president returned to Washington on Tuesday night and walked straight into a party panic over the sexual misconduct accusations dogging GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore. Having pushed publicly and privately for Moore to get out of the race, Republicans believe their last best shot is Trump, who they hope can persuade his fellow political rebel to fall in line. \"Obviously, I have made a few people mad. I am the only one who can unite Democrats and Republicans because I seem to be opposed by both,\" Moore said at an event Tuesday night in Alabama. \"They've spent over $30 million dollars trying to take me out. They've done everything they could and now they are together to try and keep me from going to Washington and why?\" Trump has given little indication of whether he's interested in playing the role of party heavy. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has echoed other Republican leaders, saying last Friday that Moore should step aside if the allegations are true. But as other Republicans began to call for Moore to quit the race, Trump was notably silent in public. On Tuesday, he didn't address the issue when he spoke with reporters aboard Air Force One as he flew back to Washington, nor did he respond to shouted questions about Moore as he entered the White House that night. For Trump and Republicans, there are no good options. If Moore wins, they can either spend an already harrowing midterm election cycle defending their new colleague, or overturn the will of Alabama voters by casting him out of the Senate. If Moore loses and the seat flips to Democratic control, the party loses a critical vote in its razor-thin Senate majority, with issues like tax reform and immigration set to be considered in the coming months. \"I have to get back into the country to see what's happening,\" Trump told reporters over the weekend as he flew from Danang, Vietnam to Hanoi during his five-nation tour of Asia. But behind the scenes, he was vexed by the issue. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Trump had been involved in dealing with the Moore situation \"in great detail\" during the trip. McConnell said he and Trump discussed the question on Friday, with chief of staff John Kelly and Vice President Mike Pence weighing in on subsequent days. Trump's 12-day trip, the longest of his presidency, was quickly overshadowed at home by the shocking accusations of sexual assault on minors by Moore, who was embraced publicly by the White House last month after winning the state's GOP primary. The revelations dominated cable news for days, as Moore denied the allegations and pledged to stay in the race. Even Chinese President Xi Jinping was drawn in. \"Who is Roy Moore?\" Xi asked Trump privately after they delivered joint statements to reporters, in a moment described by two White House officials not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations. GOP officials cautioned that the actions of Washington Republicans, including the president, were unlikely to affect Moore's decision-making \u2014 and that any moves against him could backfire in an anti-establishment political environment. The president backed Moore's unsuccessful rival, Sen. Luther Strange, in the Republican primary. Moore has the backing of Trump's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon. And Bannon's conservative news site, Breitbart, has led the charge in trying to discredit the allegations against Moore. Bannon is revisiting his support for Moore, the candidate he has championed for the Alabama U.S. Senate seat, CBS News confirmed Tuesday, citing a source close to Bannon. One person familiar with the president's thinking said Trump has been slow to call for Moore to exit the race in part because he risked embarrassment if, as expected, Moore defied him. On Tuesday, the Republican National Committee halted its efforts on Moore's behalf, following similar action by the National Republican Senatorial Committee on Friday. Three Republicans familiar with the RNC's decision, but not authorized to discuss it publicly, said Trump signed off on the move to cut Moore loose Fox News' Sean Hannity, who endorsed Moore in September, is now questioning Moore's explanations. On \"Hannity\" Tuesday, Hannity questioned inconsistencies in Moore's answers to his accusers. \"He denied knowing this fifth accuser, but this accuser has brought forth a yearbook that Moore appeared to sign, 'To a sweeter, more beautiful girl, I could not say Merry Christmas. Love, Roy Moore, DA.'\"\u00a0 And then, Hannity delivered an ultimatum to Roy Moore: \"Here's where I am tonight, between this interview that I did and the inconsistent answers, between him saying I never knew this girl and then that yearbook comes out,\" he said. \"For me, the judge has 24 hours. You must immediately and fully come up with a satisfactory explanation for your inconsistencies that I just showed. You must remove any doubt. If you can't do this, then Judge Moore needs to get out of this race.\" Moore was already a pariah among national Republicans even before the recent allegations of inappropriate contact with minors. A twice-removed state judge, Moore's anti-gay and anti-Muslim rhetoric have long repelled the GOP mainstream. McConnell has openly floated the possibility of having Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whose move from the Senate to the Cabinet necessitated the special election, run for his old seat as a write-in candidate. A source close to Sessions says he has told friends he is not interested in returning to the Senate. CBS News' Alan He and Musadiq Bidar contributed to this report.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "By Fred Backus and Jennifer De Pinto Most voters in Virginia and New Jersey made up their minds long before today in the nation's only two gubernatorial election contests Tuesday, according to early exit poll results coming out of those two states.\u00a0 In fact, most voters in both states said they made up their minds before October as to who they would vote for. \u00a0 In Virginia, Democratic Lieutenant Governor Ralph Northam is facing Republican Ed Gillespie, the former head of the Republican National Committee who came just shy of winning a U.S. senate seat in Virginia in 2014.\u00a0 In New Jersey, Democrat Phil Murphy \u00a0- a former U.S. ambassador and Goldman Sachs financier\u00a0 - is running against Republican Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno.\u00a0  There is no incumbent running in either state, and voters in New Jersey and Virginia have differing views of their outgoing governors.\u00a0 Although New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was reelected in a landslide in 2013, just one in five voters now approve of the job he's doing. \u00a0 Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe fares better among voters in his state:\u00a0 53 percent approve of his job performance while 43 percent disapprove. The two states differ on what issues they prioritize as being important to their vote.\u00a0 In Virginia, health care is the top choice, ahead of gun policy, taxes, immigration, and abortion. \u00a0 In New Jersey, health care takes a back seat to corruption in government and property taxes.\u00a0  When it comes to the economy, voters in Virginia are more optimistic than those in New Jersey.\u00a0 Twice as many Virginia voters say their state economy is getting better (30 percent) than say it is getting worse (20 percent). \u00a0In New Jersey far more voters think their state's economy is getting worse (38 percent) rather than getting better (16 percent).\u00a0  In Virginia, the removal of confederate statues has become a campaign issue, with Mr. Gillespie advocating letting confederate statues in Virginia remain standing on government property and Mr. Northam saying that it should be up to the local jurisdictions to decide.\u00a0 Six in 10 Virginia voters want the statues to be left in place, though whites and blacks feel differently on this issue:\u00a0 seven out of 10 white voters want the monuments to stay while most black voters want them removed. Similarly, President Trump is unpopular in both states, but far more so in New Jersey.\u00a0 Still, most voters in New Jersey and a plurality of voters in Virginia say that Donald Trump was not a factor in their vote. \u00a0",

            "article_content": "NEW YORK --\u00a0Prevention of future terror attacks in the wake of a deadly incident just a day earlier was the dominant subjects at the final New York City mayoral debate Wednesday night, CBS New York reports.\u00a0 Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio, Republican Nicole Malliotakis, and Independent Bo Dietl\u00a0made their case to voters. CBS New York's\u00a0Maurice DuBois\u00a0moderated the event at the CUNY Graduate Center studio. New Yorkers will\u00a0cast their votes in the general election\u00a0on Tuesday, Nov. 7, 2017. \u00a0 The topics and questions reflected concerns raised by New York voters through social media and at\u00a0a series of town hall events\u00a0across the five boroughs. The debate came one day after\u00a0a terror attack on the West Side bike path\u00a0in lower Manhattan left eight people dead and a dozen injured when an assailant plowed into cyclists and pedestrians with a pickup truck. DuBois noted that suspect\u00a0Sayfullo Saipov, 29, reportedly had attended a New Jersey mosque that had once been under surveillance by the NYPD under a program that Mayor de Blasio discontinued. Under the program, plainclothes officers infiltrated Muslim student groups, put informants in mosques, monitored sermons and cataloged Muslims in New York who adopted new, Americanized surnames. DuBois asked if the city could fight future threats while not infringing on civil rights. De Blasio said his administration is working to do just that. \"Yes, we can prevent terror by intelligence gathering. We can prevent terror by building close relationships with communities all over the city,\" he said. He said the NYPD surveillance program that focused on mosques and Muslim communities alienated police officers from the people it needed information from, and also violated rights. Malliotakis \u2014 who currently serves in the New York State Assembly \u2014 did not endorse or denounce the discontinued surveillance program. But she countered that the solution is to give police officers \"the tools that we need to do their job,\" and said there should be \"no limits to their ability when they get their lead.\" She said no group or religion should be targeted, but if the lead is credible, police should be given \"the resources needed to do their job.\" But Dietl said \"yes\" to surveillance when it comes to terror prevention. \"What we have to have is effective community relations, but as far as this profiling thing, worrying about it \u2013 well, look at it. Just look at this terrorist; what he looks like?\" He said the city \"can't have political correctness all the time.\" DuBois also noted that the truck attack on Tuesday was similar in its execution to attacks in Nice, France; Berlin; London and other cities worldwide. He asked de Blasio why the city has not taken proactive measures such as putting up bollards ahead of time at sensitive locations. De Blasio responded that first under Commissioner Bill Bratton and now under Commissioner James O'Neill, the NYPD has resolved to increase the number of officers focused on anti-terror activities. He noted that 2,000 more officers have been added to patrols over the last few years, and a focus on terrorism has been increased based on events overseas. He also noted that through traffic is no longer allowed during parades and blocker trucks full of sand have been set up to prevent the routes. Bollards have also been placed in some sensitive locations, de Blasio said. He noted in particular that extra bollards were set up in Times Square after\u00a0a driver mowed down several people there in May\u00a0\u2014 killing one and injuring 22 more. \"We change constantly with the times,\" de Blasio said. But Dietl said the security measures in place are not sufficient, taking a swipe at de Blasio and saying he is \"a person that actually takes the subway, not for photo opportunities.\" Dietl said the crowds in the subway can also be vulnerable. For her part, Malliotakis said she would have an administration that will be \"proactive, not reactive.\" \"We will have bollards where necessary,\" she said, adding that talon nets should also be set up to shred a dangerous driver's tires before anyone is struck. The debate grew heated when it came the issue of crime and prevention. DuBois noted that Malliotakis has repeatedly said felony sexual crimes are up 25 percent in the past three years, while official statistics only show the numbers up 4 percent. Malliotakis said the 4 percent number is only with regard to rapes, and said her numbers come from COMPSTAT statistics. De Blasio defended the police force and said crime is down across the board. He also said he had never been able to find the statistic about felony sex crimes that Malliotakis was talking about. \"I have asked the NYPD continuously, and here's what we know. Crime has gone down for four straight years,\" de Blasio said. He added that \"the NYPD takes crime against women very seriously.\" But Dietl then accused de Blasio of \"fudging the numbers\" when it comes to crime \u2013 focusing specifically on crime in schools. Dietl said Gregory Floyd, president of Teamsters Local 237 representing school safety officers, had reported that the officers he represents have been told they will lose vacation days if they make complaints with police. He said Floyd should be put under oath before the City Council on the matter. De Blasio protested: \"We should not be listening to statistics made up by union leaders. We should be listening to the NYPD,\" since police are in charge of school safety. The mayor said crime and violence are down in schools over five years. He noted the tragedy in which\u00a0Matthew McCree, 15, was stabbed to death at his Bronx school in September, but also noted that it was the first time in 25 years that a child suffered a violence death in the classroom. But Malliotakis said schools are not safe, and said most teachers report they do not feel safe in their classrooms. She also accused de Blasio of removing authority from teachers and principals to control their classrooms thanks to changes in discipline reporting methods, and said students are now comfortable bringing weapons and drugs to schools, bullying other students, and disrespecting teahcers. De Blasio was later asked about recent testimony by onetime donor Jona Rechnitz. In testimony at the bribery trial of former correction officers' union head Norman Seabrook, Rechnitz has repeatedly\u00a0accused de Blasioof taking part in pay-to-play politics. De Blasio has dismissed Rechnitz as a liar repeatedly, and in the debate, he did it again. \"What we now know about him, we didn't know then. He is a liar. He is a felon. Don't believe anything he says,\" de Blasio said. De Blasio said Rechnitz was a donor who provided resources at one point, but they did not have a personal relationship, though Rechnitz has talked in testimony his weekly contact with de Blasio, through email, texts, phone calls and communication through the mayor's Campaign Finance Director Ross Offinger. DuBois asked if de Blasio would release his phone records. De Blasio responded: \"This matter has been fully investigated by the federal authorities. They took no further action.\" In firing back, Dietl accused de Blasio of corruption and suggested that the mayor should face prosecution. \"When I saw [Rechnitz] testify, I wanted to take a shower. This guy [Rechnitz] is a creep. He's disgusting,\" Dietl said. He went on to say the mayor had received $200,000 from Rechnitz, but said the mayor yet claimed not to know the former donor. \"You want the people of New York to think we're that stupid that you don't know this guy?\" he said. Dietl said the governor should bring in a special prosecutor \"against you,\" directing his comments at the mayor. He also said the Attorney General should bring in the Department of Justice. \"This city is corrupt like heck,\" Dietl said. Malliotakis said the Rechnitz issue was not the only suggestion of pay-to-play in the de Blasio administration. \"I think the question for the public is if they want a mayor who looks for that little loophole; a way to skirt the law and get an intended outcome for him and his friends,\" Malliotakis said. The debate was sponsored by CBS2 and TV 10/55, 1010 WINS, WCBS 880, the New York Daily News, Common Cause New York, the New York Immigration Coalition, and CUNY.",

Meanwhile, Lankford and his Senate colleagues are set to hear from Facebook, Twitter and Google\u00a0executives in their second day of testimony on Capitol Hill about their knowledge of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\u00a0 He said social media companies are starting to \"do more\" to prevent further meddling in future elections like hiring more staff and shutting down nefarious accounts and ads, but he warned \"that job is not finished yet, we think it can be and something they need to do.\" \"We should not have to step in and oversee a free speech platform,\" said Lankford, adding that social media sites should be able to monitor themselves without the help of Congressional investigators.\u00a0 Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

Jerry Brown gave his stamp of approval Wednesday to a measure jumping California's primary up to the beginning of March, three months earlier than its contest in 2016, when Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump had already captured the major parties' nominations. \"The Golden State will no longer be relegated to last place in the presidential nominating process,\" Democratic Secretary of State Alex Padilla said. \"Candidates will not be able to ignore the largest, most diverse state in the nation as they seek our country's highest office. Bumping the primary up is designed to give the nation's most populous state more sway in choosing the Republican and Democratic nominees. And it could seriously shake up the nominating contest. California, home to 11 media markets, is an expensive state to campaign in, potentially giving well-funded candidates an edge. Democratic leaders said the bill gives California the spotlight it deserves given its record of pushing the national conversation around immigration and other issues. \"With all due respect to our brothers and sisters in Iowa and New Hampshire, California is the beating heart of the national resistance to Trump,\" Eric Bauman, chairman of the California Democratic Party, said in a statement. \"When it comes to deciding the Democratic nominee, our voices need to be heard early in the process.\" Iowa and New Hampshire will still have their early say. The measure puts the state's primary on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in March, often known as \"Super Tuesday,\" when as many as a dozen states hold nominating contests. It will still fall after the earliest caucuses and primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. In 2016, California held its primary in June when Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump were already the major party nominees. California typically awards the most delegates. The state moved its presidential primary to February in 2008, but the shift did not exert influence on the Democratic side. Clinton won the state's primary, but Barack Obama went on to capture the party's nomination. The change also pushes California's primary for state offices to March. The Democratic and Republican national committees have not set rules for the 2020 contest yet. The parties set a calendar as well as how many delegates each state is awarded. California received extra delegates for holding a late primary in 2016 and likewise could be punished in 2020 for moving up the election.",

            "article_content": "Facebook has turned over materials about Russian ad buys to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team, CBS News has confirmed.\u00a0 Last week,\u00a0Facebook acknowledged that phony accounts\u00a0appearing to have originated in Russia bought $100,000 in advertising on its platform during the 2016 presidential election cycle and in the months after. Between June 2015 and May of this year, about 3,000 ads connected with 470 \"inauthentic accounts\" were posted on Facebook, according to the social media giant.\u00a0 The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, first reported Friday that Facebook gave detailed information about the ad buys that far exceeded the information it gave to Congress. That detailed information included copies of the actual ads, along with details about the purchases, the Journal reported. Facebook policy dictates that the company will only turn over \"stored contents\" of an account with a warrant, those sources told the Journal. CNN subsequently reported a warrant was used in obtaining the information. CBS News' Jeff Pegues reports the extent of Russia's activity on the social media platform was more than just one false notice of an anti-immigration rally in Idaho, and a source familiar with the investigation said there are likely more \"Facebook fronts\" of Russians urging Americans to take action. Congressional investigators believe that revelation is probably just \"the tip of the iceberg,\" and it's looking increasingly likely that Facebook executives will be asked to testify on Capitol Hill. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, the ranking member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CBS News earlier this week he doesn't believe the social media company has been as transparent as it needs to be. \"I think there's much more than 350-odd accounts that were involved in this process,\" Warner said, referring to ads linked to Russia that the company acknowledged last week. \"I think it was much more than the simply one internet troll farm they found in St. Petersburg. And frankly, Facebook, who prides itself on knowing more about you and me than frankly the United States government knows, I got to believe they know more about this or could find more out about it if they put adequate resources behind it.\" Mueller has convened a grand jury in the investigation of Russian election meddling and any ties to the Trump campaign, a sign that the investigation is ramping up, not winding down.\u00a0 The House and Senate Intelligence Committees are also looking into the matter.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee wants to know more about Facebook and Twitter ads apparently bought by phony Russian accounts during the 2016 presidential campaign. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, confirmed Thursday that Senate Intelligence Committee staff had seen a presentation from Facebook about the phony accounts that appear to have originated in Russia and bought $100,000 worth of advertisements during the presidential campaign. He also said that Facebook had shared the content of the ads with committee staff, and he called on Facebook to share the ads broadly. \"The American people deserve to know both the content and the source of information that is being used to try to affect their votes,\" Warner told reporters Thursday. \u00a0 Twitter, too, will be briefing committee staffers on similar material, Warner said. Facebook disclosed its findings about the ads on Wednesday. The Virginia senator also believes the revelations are just beginning. \"I think we may just be seeing the tip of the iceberg. They had a fairly narrow search,\" Warner said, adding that he has been raising the issue for months, and Facebook has been dismissing it for just as long. \"We've seen them take down certain pages. It's rather minor compared to the 50,000 accounts they took down before the French election.\" Warner says he still has several questions, for instance: \"How extensive was the Russian involvement of using Facebook, Twitter and other social media forums?\" He also wants to ensure that Americans have the tools to know -- when they're seeing something in a political context -- what the source of information is.\u00a0 The Facebook ads neither mentioned the election specifically nor did they advocate for either Mr. Trump or Hillary Clinton. They did however, appear to focus on divisive social and political messages on topics like LGBT, race and immigration issues. Facebook said it has shut down the fake accounts that were still active. Warner spoke with reporters on Capitol Hill Thursday, as the Senate Intelligence Committee staff interviewed Donald Trump Jr. behind closed doors, over his June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer who he believed had dirt on Hillary Clinton.",

Meanwhile, the impaneling of a grand jury suggested special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference is deepening. And Congress left town without passing a health care bill \u2013 and with a big to-do list waiting for them upon return.  This Sunday on Face the Nation, we'll bring you the latest on all that and more. We'll talk with Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, a member of the Intelligence and Armed Services Committees, about some of the national security issues facing the country. What would the immigration proposal he unveiled this week accomplish? What does he make of the turnover at the White House? And what's the status of the Intelligence Committee's probe of Russia and its possible ties to the Trump campaign?  We'll also talk with former Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson. He was at the center of the Obama administration's response to Russian election interference in 2016 \u2013 what did that experience teach him about election integrity and cybersecurity? How does he assess the current homeland security picture in the U.S.?  We'll hear from a pair of governors \u2013 Ohio Republican John Kasich and Colorado Democrat John Hickenlooper \u2013 about the health care debate and how their states have been affected. Despite the failure of the latest GOP repeal effort, some in Congress still want to scrap Obamacare entirely, while others want to fix what's broken. But what's the view from outside Washington? As always, we'll have an expert political panel to help break down the busy news week. This Sunday, we'll hear from USA Today's Washington Bureau Chief Susan Page, Reihan Salam of the National Review and Slate Magazine, Jennifer Jacobs of Bloomberg, and Slate Magazine's Jamelle Bouie, who's also a CBS News Political Analyst.

            "article_content": "MIDLOTHIAN, Va. -- Critics of Republican U.S. Rep. Dave Brat and the House health care bill he voted for packed a raucous town hall meeting in his Virginia district Tuesday night, booing and shouting down the congressman from start to finish.\u00a0 Brat is the latest in a series of lawmakers across the country who have gotten an earful from constituents at town hall meetings since last week's passage of the House health care bill that would repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\u00a0 GOP congressman: \"Nobody dies because they don't have access to health care\" \"That's America\": Town hall ride-along with Rep. Bradley Byrne Hundreds of people packed the suburban Richmond church for the meeting Brat co-hosted with a Republican state senator, and dozens of protesters lined up outside and chanted \"let history know we said no,\" CBS affiliate WTVR reports.\u00a0 Inside, opponents appeared to far outnumber supporters.\u00a0 The jeering and shouting began after the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance - while Brat was on stage but before he'd begun speaking - and it never let up.\u00a0 WTVR reports that Brat called out Democrats early in the meeting, asking \"how many people wanted Hillary to be president?\" The question was greeted by cheers. A former economics professor who defeated then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a historic 2014 upset, Brat briefly discussed the health care bill before seguing into dozens of audience questions. Most of them were about the measure.  Critics shouted him down as he talked, sometimes to the point where his answers became indistinguishable or got cut off.\u00a0 He frequently admonished the audience for the noise, and his co-host, Sen. Amanda Chase, at one point called for security to move toward the main doors. Some audience members turned to yell at one another.\u00a0 Afterward, Arthur Bailey, 48, said he thought Brat had been evasive and not answered several questions.\u00a0 Bailey was wearing a black T-shirt with the word \"Resist\" across it, which he said he'd made himself. He said he sees health care as \"the primary issue of our time,\" and hopes the enthusiasm on display Tuesday night will carry on through the 2018 congressional elections.  Craig DiSesa, 57, came out to support Brat, who he said did the best he could to deal with the constant disruptions.  \"Dave was trying to give them the facts. I'm not sure they were listening,\" he said.  Lawmakers across the country have faced angry constituents at town halls since Trump's election, and several other meetings have turned testy since last week's passage of the health care bill.  Over the weekend, Republican Rep. Tom Reed of New York was booed during a meeting. In Iowa, Rep. Rod Blum, stormed out of a TV interview when pressed about why he screens those who attend his public meetings. He then held a town hall, where he was booed and jeered by constituents.  And in Idaho, a Friday meeting erupted in boos after U.S. Rep. Raul Labrador said no one has died because they didn't have access to health care.  Brat held another town hall meeting in Blackstone in February, where he was loudly heckled when he defended President Donald Trump and his policies on health care and immigration.  Fellow GOP U.S. Rep. Tom Garrett was also hosting a town hall meeting Tuesday night in his district.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "France is one step closer to a new president. The nation voted for change in a big way yesterday, and for the first time in modern history, voters turned away from the political mainstream. Both the candidates who made it through to the runoff are mavericks in different ways, both bucking the powerful French establishment. In first place is centrist Emmanuel Macron, a former investment banker and economics minister, whose agenda borrowed ideas from the left and the right, without the backing of an official party. \u201cIn one year,\u201d he told delighted supporters, \u201cwe have changed the face of French politics.\u201d Macron has never run for office before, but he is used to breaking the mold. At 16 he fell in love with his high school drama teacher, more than 20 years his senior. And now, at 39 and 64 years old, they\u2019ve been married for a decade. In second place was the far-right wing candidate Marine Le Pen, who told cheering crowds it was an historic result. Le Pen\u2019s populist promises will sound familiar to Americans: Shutting down immigration, anti-globalization, and renegotiating trade agreements to protect jobs at home. She also wants to follow Britain\u2019s lead and take France out of the European Union. A crowded field of 11 candidates and a scandal-ridden campaign left voters like Anne Sophie Parachamp frustrated. \u201cThe campaign was a mess. I\u2019ve never seen that in France,\u201d she said. Palmer asked, \u201cWhat was unusual about it?\u201d \u201cHow little talking about economics,\u201d Parachamp replied. \u201cMore noises, personal affairs, and things like that.\u201d But millions of French citizens woke to find the traces of a turbulent campaign being scrubbed away and a clear choice facing them in two weeks\u2019 time.\u00a0 Protesters, unhappy with the first round results, scuffled with police in the streets overnight. More than two dozen people were arrested.\u00a0 Already analysts are saying Le Pen doesn\u2019t have any chance of winning, especially as some of the other candidates in the primaries have all thrown their support behind Macron specifically to block her. The European Union\u2019s head office has thrown its weight behind Macron in the French presidential runoff against Le Pen, arguing it is a choice between the defense of the EU or those seeking its destruction. In an exceptional stance during an ongoing campaign, the European Commission says that circumstances forced the hand of its president, Jean-Claude Juncker. EU spokesman Margaritis Schinas said that \u201cthe choice was a fundamental one.\u201d He said Macron represents the pro-European values while Le Pen \u201cseeks its destruction.\u201d Meanwhile, Spanish Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis says he hopes a victory in the French presidential election for Emmanuel Macron would mark a break in the rise of extremist populist parties in Europe.",

            "article_content": "PARIS -- The Champs-Elysees gunman who shot and killed a police officer just days before France\u2019s presidential election was detained in February for threatening police but then freed, officials said on Friday. He was also convicted in 2003 of attempted homicide in the shootings of two police officers, CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer reports. The French government pulled out all the stops to protect Sunday\u2019s vote as the attack deepened France\u2019s political divide. \u201cNothing must hamper this democratic moment, essential for our country,\u201d Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said after a high-level meeting Friday that reviewed the government\u2019s already heightened security plans for the two-round vote that begins Sunday. \u201cBarbarity and cowardice struck Paris last night,\u201d the prime minister said, appealing for national unity and for people \u201cnot to succumb to fear.\u201d Investigators believe at this stage that the gunman, 39-year-old Frenchman Karim Cheurfi, was alone in killing a police officer and wounding two others and a German tourist on Thursday night, less than 72 hours before the polls open, a French official who discussed details of the investigation with the Associated Press said on condition of anonymity. The official and another, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said Cheurfi was detained toward the end of February after speaking threateningly about police but was then released for lack of evidence. The Islamic State of Syria and Iraq (ISIS) group claimed responsibility for Thursday\u2019s attack unusually quickly in a statement that sowed confusion by apparently misidentifying the gunman. However, French media reported that a letter was found near the gunman\u2019s body which defended\u00a0ISIS, Palmer reports. Police shot and killed Cheurfi after he opened fire on a police van on Paris\u2019 most famous boulevard. Investigators found a pump-action shotgun and knives in his car. Cheurfi\u2019s identity was confirmed from his fingerprints. One of the key questions was how the attack might impact French voters. The risk for the main presidential candidates is misjudging the public mood by making an ill-perceived gesture or comment. With polling so close, and campaigning banned starting Friday at midnight, they would have no time to recover before voters cast ballots. The two top finishers Sunday advance to a winner-takes-all presidential runoff on May 7. Two of the main candidates, conservative Francois Fillon and centrist Emmanuel Macron, cancelled planned campaign stops Friday. The attack brought back the recurrent campaign theme of France\u2019s fight against Islamic extremism, one of the mainstays of the anti-immigration platform of far-right leader Marine Le Pen and also, to a lesser extent, of Fillon, a former prime minister. In the wake of the assault, they redoubled appeals for a firmer hand against Islamic extremism and promised get-tough measures if elected. Le Pen, speaking at her campaign headquarters, urged the outgoing Socialist government to immediately re-establish border controls. Cazeneuve, the Socialist prime minister, accused the National Front leader of seeking to make political hay from the assault. After Le Pen spoke scathingly Friday of the government\u2019s fight against extremism, Cazeneuve said Le Pen\u2019s party in 2014 voted against an anti-terrorism law and, in 2015, against a law that beefed up resources for French intelligence services. He said: \u201cShe seems to be deliberately forgetting everything that has been done over five years to make people forget that she opposed everything, without ever proposing anything serious or credible.\u201d Fillon separately pledged to maintain the state of emergency that has been in place since ISIS-claimed gun and bomb attacks killed 130 people in Paris in November 2015. \u201cThe fight for the French people\u2019s freedom and security will be mine. This must be the priority,\u201d he said. As Paris got back to business, municipal workers in white hygiene suits were out before dawn to wash down the sidewalk where the assault took place - a scene now depressingly familiar after multiple attacks that have killed more than 230 people in France over two years. Delivery trucks did their early morning rounds. Everything would have seemed normal if not for a row of TV trucks parked along the boulevard that is a must-visit for tourists. Another terrorist attack in Paris. The people of France will not take much more of this. Will have a big effect on presidential election! Asked if the assault would impact voting, the centrist Macron said: \u201cNo one knows.\u201d With some voters doubtful whether the 39-year-old former banker is experienced enough to be head of state, Macron appealed for cool heads. \u201cWhat our attackers want is death, symbolism, to sow panic (and) to disturb a democratic process, which is the presidential election,\u201d he said. Macron said he canceled campaign stops out of a sense of \u201cdecency\u201d and to allow police to concentrate their resources on the attack investigation. Said by polls to be running neck-and-neck with Le Pen, he tore into her claims that previous attacks wouldn\u2019t have happened under her watch.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cShe won\u2019t be able to protect our citizens,\u201d Macron said of Le Pen. The two police officers injured in the attack are out of danger, Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet said. National police spokesman Jerome Bonet, also speaking on BFM television, said there were thousands of people on Paris\u2019 iconic boulevard when the gunman opened fire and that the rapid response of officers who shot and killed him avoided possible \u201ccarnage.\u201d Voters also wondered how the latest attack might impact the election. Elena Worms, walking her dog near the Champs-Elysees, called the attack \u201cdestabilizing\u201d and said she fears it will \u201cpush people to the extremes.\u201d She said her plans to vote Fillon remained unchanged. \u201cHe wants to lead Muslims away from fundamentalism to security,\u201d she said. In a statement from its Amaq news agency, ISIS group gave a pseudonym for the shooter, Abu Yusuf al-Beljiki, indicating he was Belgian or had lived in Belgium. But Belgium\u2019s interior minister said the pseudonym did not belong to the attacker. Investigators searched a home early Friday in an eastern suburb of Paris believed linked to the attack and police detained for questioning three of the gunman\u2019s family members - routine in such cases. The attack appeared to fit a spreading pattern of European extremists targeting security forces and symbols of state to discredit, take vengeance or destabilize society. It recalled two recent attacks on soldiers providing security at prominent locations around Paris: one at the Louvre museum in February and one at Orly airport last month.",

            "article_content": "A federal judge in Hawaii has put\u00a0President Donald Trump\u2019s revised travel ban on hold.\u00a0 U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson granted a temporary restraining order against key parts of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration, CBS News\u2019 Paula Reid reports. He blocked enforcement of sections related to travel and refugees, and effectively gutted the order, which seeks to\u00a0impose a 90-day ban\u00a0on the issuance of new visas to people from six predominantly Muslim nations and suspend the U.S. refugee program for all countries for 120 days.\u00a0 The ruling applies across the U.S. and around the world, and prevents the order from going into effect Thursday. It was set to go into effect March 16 at 12:01 a.m. President Donald Trump says he doesn\u2019t know who\u00a0released part of his 2005 tax return\u00a0and described the disclosure as \u201cillegal.\u201d \u201cI have no idea where they got it but it\u2019s illegal and they\u2019re not supposed to have it and its not supposed to be leaked and it\u2019s certainly not an embarrassing tax return at all but it\u2019s an illegal thing they\u2019ve been doing it, they\u2019ve done it before and I think it\u2019s a disgrace,\u201d Mr. Trump told Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson in an interview airing Wednesday night.\u00a0 The House Intelligence Committee\u2019s top members, Chairman Devin Nunes and Ranking Member Adam Schiff, both of California, have so far not been presented by the Justice Department with any evidence backing up President Trump\u2019s tweeted allegation that former President Obama\u00a0tapped Donald Trump\u2019s phones\u00a0during the election. Nunes on Wednesday suggested the president could be wrong.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t think there was an actual tap of Trump Tower,\u201d he told reporters at the Capitol, and he said that if Mr. Trump\u2019s allegations are taken literally, then \u201cclearly the president was wrong.\u201d \u00a0 With less than a week until\u00a0Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch\u2019s\u00a0hearings, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee is calling for more information from the judge. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-California)\u00a0wrote in a letter\u00a0to Gorsuch Tuesday that he had not yet completed her request for a list of all \u201csignificant cases\u201d in which he helped make decisions or \u201cdeveloped case strategy.\u201d Even before Donald Trump was inaugurated, U.S. citizens who own land along the border reportedly began receiving letters from the Justice Department informing them that the federal government wants their land to build a fence (i.e. the president\u2019s border wall), that it intends to acquire their land, and the amount of compensation the government is offering. Yvette Salinas, a Texan whose ailing mother owns a small parcel of land with her siblings near the Rio Grande was informed by the \u201cDeclaration of Taking\u201d letter sent by DOJ that her 1.2 acres was worth $2,900, according to a\u00a0story in the Texas Observer. She told the Observer that the family\u2019s 16 acres has been in her family for five generations.

The White House confirmed details of the president\u2019s 2005 federal\u00a0tax return\u00a0after its first two pages were leaked Tuesday. Mr. Trump reported more than $150 million in income in 2005. He paid $38 million in federal income taxes. The Senate has confirmed President Donald Trump\u2019s choice for national intelligence director.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is taking off for Japan, South Korea and China this week for his maiden trip to the region. Amid\u00a0North Korean missile testing\u00a0and after a campaign in which President Trump criticized all three countries, the trip is designed to cement U.S. commitment to allies and initiate a conversation on how to best tackle the North\u2019s provocations. The four-day trip will immerse Tillerson in an intensive diplomatic crash course -- he\u2019ll meet each of the country\u2019s foreign ministers and travel with the State Department\u2019s top experts to the region. As Tillerson makes connections with his counterparts, there are concerns about how seriously he will be taken, given his quiet posture thus far. \u00a0 A reporter from a conservative-leaning website is the only media representative accompanying Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u00a0on his trip to Asia\u00a0this week. The website, the Independent Journal Review, said late Tuesday that IJR reporter Erin McPike is the lone journalist traveling with Tillerson on his tour to Japan, South Korea and China. The State Department confirmed the account. The trip is taking place amid escalating tensions with North Korea. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is in Tokyo, holds joint availability with Japanese Foreign Minister Kishida and they\u2019ll hold a joint media availability, which will be Tillerson\u2019s first press conference as secretary of state (time TBA).

Sen. Elizabeth Warren holds press conference outside Supreme Court to protest nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be an associate justice, 9:30 a.m.  In 2005, Donald Trump paid $38 million -- or about 25.3 percent -- in taxes on income of over $150 million, the White House\u00a0said in a statement Tuesday night. In 2005, the tax rate for top earners was 35 percent. Currently, the top rate is 39.6 percent. In addition, the White House said that Mr. Trump paid \u201ctens of millions of dollars in other taxes such as sales and excise taxes and employment taxes.\u201d Facing a Monday deadline, the Justice Department asked lawmakers for more time to provide evidence backing up President Donald\u00a0Trump\u2019s unproven assertion that his predecessor wiretapped his New York skyscraper\u00a0during the election. The request came as the White House appeared to soften Trump\u2019s explosive allegation.  The House intelligence committee said it would give the Justice Department until March 20 to comply with the evidence request. That\u2019s the date of the committee\u2019s first open hearing on the investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election and\u00a0possible contacts between Trump associates and Russia. Detractors and supporters alike agree that President Trump\u2019s presidency has already marked a departure from many of the norms of previous administrations. Here are\u00a0five unusual facets of Mr. Trump\u2019s White House\u00a0and his tenure so far as commander-in-chief.\u00a0  House Speaker Paul Ryan told Republican lawmakers that\u00a0he would not defend then-candidate Donald Trump\u00a0in October, according to audio published Tuesday by Breitbart News.  Ryan\u2019s comments came after\u00a0a leaked Access Hollywood video\u00a0appeared to show Mr. Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women. In the October 10 phone call that followed, media outlets including\u00a0CBS reported that the speaker said he wouldn\u2019t defend Mr. Trump\u00a0and encouraged Republican lawmakers to do what was right for them in their bids to win reelection.  House Speaker Paul Ryan said Monday that\u00a0the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s (CBO) estimate\u00a0that 24 million people would lose health insurance by 2026 under the GOP health bill is because the legislation would eliminate Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate.  In an interview on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSpecial Report\u201d with host Bret Baier, the Wisconsin Republican said CBO\u2019s report \u201cexceeded my expectations\u201d and he said that before Obamacare, 25 million were predicted to gain insurance, but now it\u2019s only half of that estimate.  The New York attorney general says that while\u00a0Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u00a0was CEO of Exxon Mobil he used an alias in emails to talk about climate change.  The attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, made the accusation in a letter to a New York court Monday. He is investigating whether the company deceived investors and the public by hiding for decades what it knew about the\u00a0link between fossil fuels and climate change.

            "article_content": "President Trump will roll out his first budget blueprint Thursday morning that would\u00a0increase defense spending by 10 percent, funding for Homeland Security programs by 6 percent\u00a0and dramatically slash funding to both the State Department and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\u00a0 The proposal, which will go public at 7:00 a.m. ET, will cover both the current fiscal year as well as fiscal 2018, which begins Oct. 1. It does not have the force of law, and is only used as a guideline for congressional appropriators who have the power of the purse. The leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee said on Thursday that they had seen \u201cno indications\u201d that Trump Tower was wiretapped by the United States government during the 2016 campaign as\u00a0claimed by President Trump. \u201cBased on the information available to us, we see no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance by any element of the United States government either before or after Election Day 2016,\u201d said Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., and ranking member Mark Warner, D-Va., in a short joint statement. House Republicans unveiled their\u00a0long-awaited plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act\u00a0earlier this month, and like any plan that would affect roughly one-sixth of the American economy, it contained a lot to digest. Adding to the complexity is the fact that the House bill will almost surely be significantly adjusted by the time it reaches President Trump\u2019s desk -- if it gets to his desk. Republican moderates and conservatives in the House are\u00a0already demanding major changes, some of which seem mutually exclusive, and that\u2019s before the bill even hits the Senate, where a number of key lawmakers have floated their own versions. A House committee investigating former national security adviser Michael Flynn revealed today that Flynn received tens of thousands of dollars in 2015 from RT, the state-run Russian television network. Meets with Prime Minister Enda Kenny, 10:30 a.m. Speaker Ryan hosts St. Patrick\u2019s Day luncheon for Mr. Trump, Kenny, members, 12 p.m.; photo op 1:14 p.m. Remarks at St. Patrick\u2019s Day reception, 6 p.m. House Budget Committee marks up American Health Care Act, 10 a.m. National Review Summit: Senior White House adviser Stephen Miller speaks A federal judge in Hawaii has put President Donald Trump\u2019s revised travel ban on hold.\u00a0 U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson granted a temporary restraining order against key parts of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration, CBS News\u2019 Paula Reid reports. He blocked enforcement of sections related to travel and refugees, and effectively gutted the order, which seeks to\u00a0impose a 90-day ban\u00a0on the issuance of new visas to people from six predominantly Muslim nations and suspend the U.S. refugee program for all countries for 120 days.\u00a0 The ruling applies across the U.S. and around the world, and prevents the order from going into effect Thursday. It was set to go into effect March 16 at 12:01 a.m. President Donald Trump says he doesn\u2019t know who\u00a0released part of his 2005 tax return\u00a0and described the disclosure as \u201cillegal.\u201d \u201cI have no idea where they got it but it\u2019s illegal and they\u2019re not supposed to have it and its not supposed to be leaked and it\u2019s certainly not an embarrassing tax return at all but it\u2019s an illegal thing they\u2019ve been doing it, they\u2019ve done it before and I think it\u2019s a disgrace,\u201d Mr. Trump told Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson in an interview airing Wednesday night.\u00a0 The House Intelligence Committee\u2019s top members, Chairman Devin Nunes and Ranking Member Adam Schiff, both of California, have so far not been presented by the Justice Department with any evidence backing up President Trump\u2019s tweeted allegation that former President Obama\u00a0tapped Donald Trump\u2019s phones\u00a0during the election. Nunes on Wednesday suggested the president could be wrong.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t think there was an actual tap of Trump Tower,\u201d he told reporters at the Capitol, and he said that if Mr. Trump\u2019s allegations are taken literally, then \u201cclearly the president was wrong.\u201d \u00a0 With less than a week until\u00a0Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch\u2019s\u00a0hearings, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee is calling for more information from the judge. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-California)\u00a0wrote in a letter\u00a0to Gorsuch Tuesday that he had not yet completed her request for a list of all \u201csignificant cases\u201d in which he helped make decisions or \u201cdeveloped case strategy.\u201d Even before Donald Trump was inaugurated, U.S. citizens who own land along the border reportedly began receiving letters from the Justice Department informing them that the federal government wants their land to build a fence (i.e. the president\u2019s border wall), that it intends to acquire their land, and the amount of compensation the government is offering. Yvette Salinas, a Texan whose ailing mother owns a small parcel of land with her siblings near the Rio Grande was informed by the \u201cDeclaration of Taking\u201d letter sent by DOJ that her 1.2 acres was worth $2,900, according to a\u00a0story in the Texas Observer. She told the Observer that the family\u2019s 16 acres has been in her family for five generations. The government\u2019s letter asks recipients to sign in order to receive compensation, acknowledge that they \u201cdo not have an interest\u201d in the case or do not intend to make a claim. It doesn\u2019t really say what landowners should do if, like Salinas, they don\u2019t want to sell their land. \u00a0 President Trump on Wednesday slammed the Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist who\u00a0revealed part of Mr. Trump\u2019s 2005 tax return a night earlier\u00a0on prime-time TV.

It will be at a ceremony for Vital Voices, a women\u2019s leadership group she founded.\u00a0 She\u2019s also slated to deliver this year\u2019s commencement address at her alma mater Wellesley College. Her public schedule is sending a signal, perhaps, that she plans to remain involved in the issues she holds dear, reports CBS News correspondent Jan Crawford.\u00a0 The former senator and secretary of state accepted an award Tuesday for her work advocating for women. \u201cI\u2019ve had my ups and my downs. In the last months, I\u2019ve done my share of sleeping. A little soul searching and reflecting,\u201d Clinton said. \u00a0 Longtime friend Mack McLarty said Clinton is working on a new book while pondering her next move.\u201cNo one ever said that Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t have resilience, grit,\u201d McLarty said. McLarty served as chief of staff for Clinton\u2019s husband. He said one of Clinton\u2019s top moments was also her toughest \u2013 her concession speech.\u00a0 \u201cThis is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for, and I\u2019m sorry that we did not win this election,\u201d Clinton had said. \u201cI think all of us, most Americans, and most people around the world, admire and recognize when someone is dealing with adversity with strength and courage and faith,\u201d McLarty said.\u00a0 Clinton has remained largely out of sight, though social media posts have captured her\u00a0hiking in the woods, going shopping, dining out and catching some\u00a0Broadway shows. Recent runners-up have handled their presidential defeats in different ways. John Kerry in 2004 and John McCain in 2008 continued their work as U.S. senators. After the 2012 race, Mitt Romney went back into business, re-emerging four years later as a contender for Mr. Trump\u2019s secretary of state. Al Gore reinvented himself after the 2000 campaign. His documentary, \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth,\u201d won an Oscar, and his environmental efforts earned him the Nobel Peace Prize. \u201cI think that that does speak to the fact that there are other chapters, there are other opportunities out there,\u201d Washington Post national political correspondent Karen Tumulty said.\u00a0 But she said the opportunity has likely passed for the Clintons to remain a dominant force in their party. \u201cIn some ways, people see them as a roadblock,\u201d Tumulty said. \u201cA lot of Democrats would like to see the Clintons move aside and give some oxygen for some new voices to emerge.\u201d That said, Chelsea Clinton has recently spoken out. Since the election, she\u2019s sent a number of feisty political tweets. This week she described the president\u2019s immigration policy as \u201cdisturbing\u201d and suggested the Republican health care plan is \u201cnot moral.\u201d",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- Confronting a cascade of controversies, President Donald Trump on Thursday angrily denounced the \u201ccriminal\u201d leaks that took down his top national security adviser after less than a month and revived questions about his own ties to Russia. But he offered only a lawyerly denial that his campaign aides had been in touch with Russian officials before last fall\u2019s election. \u201cNobody that I know\u201d he said in the first full-length press conference of his presidency. Rather than a wide-ranging question-and-answer session, the 77-minute event amounted to an extended airing of grievances, the new president attempting to find his footing after the rockiest launch in recent memory. Trump slammed a \u201cbad court\u201d of appeals judges for blocking his refugee and immigration executive order and denied that his White House was paralyzed by chaos and infighting among top advisers. \u201cThis administration is running like a fine-tuned machine,\u201d he boasted. With his signature hyperbole betrayed by reality, Trump said there has never been a president \u201cwho in this short period of time has done what we\u2019ve done.\u201d He blamed any problems on the outgoing Obama administration - \u201cI inherited a mess at home and abroad\u201d - and the news media. Standing in the stately, chandeliered East Room, Trump lambasted the \u201cout of control\u201d media - long his favorite foe. He appeared to delight in jousting with reporters, repeatedly interrupting their questions and singling out stories he disagreed with, well aware his attacks were sure to be cheered by loyal supporters who share his views. Despite Trump\u2019s declarations, his first month in office has been chaotic by any measure - a flurry of self-inflicted wounds and poorly executed policy. On Monday, Trump asked for the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn following revelations that the Flynn misled Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with Russia. The next day, The New York Times reported that multiple Trump advisers were in touch with Russian intelligence advisers during the election campaign. Trump panned the report as \u201cfake news\u201d and said he had \u201cnothing to do with Russia.\u201d \u201cTo the best of my knowledge no person that I deal with does,\u201d he added. That answer, couched with a caveat similar to one routinely used by witnesses on a trial stand, appeared to give him wiggle room. The president more clearly defended Flynn\u2019s calls with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. during the transition period after his November victory. He said that while he did not tell his adviser to discuss sanctions with the envoy, \u201cI would have directed him if he didn\u2019t do it.\u201d The president said that while Flynn was \u201cjust doing his job,\u201d he was \u201cnot happy\u201d that the adviser had misled the vice president. Trump knew that Flynn had given Pence an inaccurate accounting of his discussions with Russia, but the president did not tell his No. 2 for about two weeks, according to a timeline supplied by the White House. The president is expected to soon announce Flynn\u2019s replacement, with Vice Admiral Robert Harward topping his list. Harward was to meet with Trump aides at the White House Thursday afternoon. Trump repeatedly tried to steer questions away from his and his advisers\u2019 potential ties with Russia, saying attention should rather be focused on why a steady stream of classified information is making its way into news reports. He said the leaks are real but the news is fake, never explaining that. The president took questions from 17 reporters, far more than at most presidential news conferences. His answers were often unwieldy, almost stream of consciousness, and some of his responses were startlingly strange. He said the \u201cgreatest thing\u201d he could do was \u201cshoot\u201d a Russian spy ship lingering off the East Coast of the United States. He asked an African-American reporter whether she could help set up a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus. He wrongly stated that his Electoral College victory had been the largest of any president since Ronald Reagan, then dismissed the inaccuracy, saying he\u2019d been \u201cgiven that information.\u201d But, though he\u2019s now president, the former reality TV star often appeared to be in his element. He jousted with reporters, particularly those he knows by name from his constant consumption of television news. He jokingly told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta that he had checked whether he was related to Alexander Acosta, the dean of the Florida International University law school who is his new pick to lead the Labor Department. Acosta\u2019s nomination was ostensibly the purpose of the news conference, though Trump dispensed of the announcement in a few brief sentences. The president\u2019s original choice to head the agency, Andy Puzder, withdrew his nomination on Wednesday, another blow to the new administration. Trump vowed to move forward next week on his stalled plans to enact \u201cextreme vetting\u201d measures for people coming to the United States. He said he would sign a \u201cnew and very comprehensive order\u201d next week aimed at addressing legal issues in the initial directive, which temporarily halted the entire U.S. refugee program and all entries from seven Muslim-majority nations while the government worked on new vetting procedures. A federal appeals court rejected the measure earlier in the month, and Trump said during the news conference that his administration would be \u201cappealing\u201d that decision. Shortly after, the Justice Department announced that it did not want a larger appellate panel to review the ruling and would instead replace the ban.",

            "article_content": "It\u2019s been a quiet day at the White House for President Trump, though he did have a working lunch with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Florida Gov. Rick Scott \u201cto discuss how best to solve the problems of Obamacare, with a special emphasis on the states\u2019 role in healthcare,\u201d according to White House readout. President Trump claimed Saturday that the national debt decreased by $12 billion in his first month as commander in chief. Later in the day, the president of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Budget said that while the debt outstanding did decline by $12 billion in his first month,\u00a0it had nothing to do with new policies implemented by his administration. CPAC wraps up its conference. \u00a0EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt speaks (1:50 p.m.), and a straw poll will be taken (3:05 p.m.) \u00a0 An intelligence report compiled by DHS\u2019 Intelligence and Analysis Unit has concluded that citizens affected by\u00a0President Trump\u2019s travel ban\u00a0are \u201crarely implicated in U.S.-based terrorism.\u201d\u00a0 The report concluded that \u201ccountry of citizenship is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of potential terrorist activity,\u201d and it says that \u201crelatively few\u201d of the citizens of these countries maintain access to the U.S.\u201d The countries named in the president\u2019s original travel ban were Somalia, Libya, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Sudan and Yemen.\u00a0 President Donald\u00a0Trump said Friday that his predecessor\u2019s health care law covers \u201cvery few people\u201d\u00a0as he minimized the impact of replacing it. That\u2019s only true if you consider more than 20 million people to be very few. He took another mysterious poke at Sweden, too, and decried open U.S. borders that are not. Here\u2019s a look at his statements at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday: TRUMP: \u201cObamacare covers very few people.\u201d THE FACTS: More than 20 million people are covered by the two major components of former President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law: expanded Medicaid and subsidized private health insurance. In an afternoon briefing Friday, Sean Spicer defended the White House over a CNN report that Reince Priebus had inappropriately pressured the FBI to dispute a New York Times story that alleged multiple contacts between Trump campaign associates and Russian intelligence officials during the presidential campaign. At issue were communications between FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus about the accuracy of the story published by the Times. \u00a0 On Thursday, CNN suggested that Priebus\u2019 contact with the FBI may have been inappropriate, given that there is a pending investigation into the alleged Russian contacts.\u00a0 President Trump returned to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) Friday after skipping the event last year in order to campaign in Kansas during the presidential primary season. For the first half of the speech, Mr. Trump bashed what he called \u201cthe dishonest press\u201d and said that \u201cfake news\u201d is \u201cthe enemy of the people.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThey have no sources, they just make it up,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding that he\u2019s \u201cnot against\u201d the media or the press and that he doesn\u2019t mind bad stories about him. He then went on to discuss his election victory last November and outlined all of the policy promises he intends to keep as president. He discussed his plan to dismantle Obamacare, lower taxes for the middle class, rebuild the military, build a border wall and deport \u201cbad dudes\u201d from the U.S. \u201cBy stopping the flow of illegal immigration, we will save countless tax dollars,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re not coming back in, folks.\u201d President Trump on Friday signed an executive order that calls on all executive agencies\u00a0to evaluate federal regulations and identify any that are unnecessary, according to the White House pool report. \u201cExcessive regulations are killing jobs, driving companies out of our country like never before,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Trump said with a dozen or more CEOs standing behind him in the Oval Office. \u201cToday, this executive order directs each agency to establish a regulatory reform task force. It will ensure that every agency has a team of dedicated people to research all regulations that are unnecessary, burdensome and harmful to the economy, and harmful to the creation of jobs and business.\u2019\u2019 President Trump on Friday\u00a0blasted the FBI for failing to track down people who are leaking information\u00a0to journalists about the new administration. Mr. Trump went on say that classified information is being relayed to the press, which he said could have a \u201cdevastating effect\u201d on the U.S. He demanded that the leakers be found immediately. --\u00a0Rebecca Shabad Hispanic people in the U.S. are divided about what Donald Trump\u2019s presidency means\u00a0for them, according to a new survey from the Pew Research Center. The poll found that 54 percent of Hispanics said that they\u2019re confident about their place in America after Mr. Trump\u2019s election and 41 percent said they have serious concerns. Among undocumented immigrants, 55 percent said that they have serious concerns about their place in the U.S. The same was said by 38 percent of U.S.-born Hispanic and 34 percent of Hispanic immigrants to the U.S. Forty-nine percent of Hispanic lawful permanent residents said they have serious concerns, too. Next week\u2019s must-watch political television is the\u00a0president\u2019s joint address to Congress\u00a0Tuesday. How will the president command the podium in the august House chamber? What will it feel like in the room? \u00a0\u00a0 Though Mr. Trump claims his White House has run like\u00a0a \u201cfine-tuned machine,\u201d\u00a0there have been a few stalls and false starts. For instance, a key executive order, the travel ban, has been stayed by the courts, forcing him to write a new one. Mr. Trump and his top aides are at war with the media -- he declared several TV networks the \u201cenemy of the people last week.\u201d A new CBS News poll this week shows the\u00a0president\u2019s approval ratings are low -- 39 percent\u00a0-- similar to other recent polls over the last couple of weeks.\u00a0 Just over a month after his inauguration, it seems likely that Mr. Trump could use this speech to turn his attention from the solo executive actions and cabinet appointments toward the agenda that will require working with Congress. How will all of this be manifest in the president\u2019s Tuesday address? Correspondent Margaret Brennan, who covers the White House and foreign affairs for CBS News, joined Major Garrett for this week\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Takeout\u201d podcast. Caitlyn Jenner is taking President Trump to task\u00a0for his administration\u2019s\u00a0reversal of a directive on transgender access to public school bathrooms. Jenner addresses Mr. Trump in a video posted Thursday night on Twitter. She says, \u201cFrom one Republican to another, this is a disaster.\u201d The Trump White House has ended a directive issued during Obama\u2019s presidency that told public schools to let transgender students use bathrooms and locker rooms of their chosen gender. Mr. Trump meets with Ohio Gov. John Kasich. The National Governors and the Republican governors are in Washington this weekend for their annual meeting. Mike Pence will host the GOP governors for lunch, 12:30 p.m. Later, Pence will travel to Las Vegas to address the Republican Jewish Coalition, 10:30 p.m.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump doesn\u2019t invoke Ronald Reagan as much as many Republicans do. But with revamping the tax code a major priority of the Trump White House, it might help him to study how Reagan delivered the last major tax overhaul three decades ago. Reagan\u2019s success on tax reform in 1986 came despite many twists and turns, and more than a few times the entire enterprise appeared doomed. So it\u2019s instructive to compare this year\u2019s climate for a tax overhaul with the situation back then. \u00a0 Tax reform is a taller order to replicate in 2017. Today\u2019s political scene is much more divided, almost to the point of open partisan warfare. In his address to Congress Tuesday night, Mr. Trump tried to put the argumentative tone of his first month in power behind him and called for a bipartisan approach to passing legislation. That harks back to Reagan\u2019s sunnier view, but it remains to be seen whether Mr. Trump can continue down that optimistic and inclusive path. There are other differences. Mr. Trump seems less concerned about running red ink as a result of the tax revamp, whereas Reagan insisted that the outcome be \u201crevenue neutral,\u201d meaning it wouldn\u2019t add to the government deficit. That solidified Reagan\u2019s GOP base in Congress.\u00a0 And Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plan is linked to the fate of other matters, like what happens to Obamacare. Reagan turned to tax reform in the sixth year of his presidency, after he had enacted many of his policy goals, thus avoiding distractions. Mr. Trump\u2019s glut of plans, from cracking down on immigration to Obamacare repeal, provide plenty of distractions. One constant then and now, however, is the army of lobbyists who, armed with campaign contributions that smooth their access to Capitol Hill, ferociously fight to retain tax breaks favoring their clients.\u00a0 In \u201cShowdown at Gucci Gulch,\u201d a masterful study of the 1986 tax reform bill\u2019s passage, two Wall Street Journal reporters recounted how swarms of lobbyists sought to influence lawmakers. As authors Alan Murray (now chief content officer of Time Inc. and editor of Fortune magazine) and Jeffery Birnbaum (who these days works for a lobbying firm himself, BGR Group) wrote, the triumph of tax reform over these well-dressed -- and well-shod, hence the Gucci reference -- advocates was a minor miracle. The byword for Reagan and his allies in Congress was to simplify the code and eliminate many tax breaks. The number of tax brackets, for instance, was pruned back to two from 14. But over the years, like an untended shrub, the number of categories proliferated again (seven now), and a profusion of new tax breaks sprouted. Among Republicans, the touchstone for tax reform is the framework put together by House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin. During last year\u2019s election campaign, Mr. Trump issued his own version, which borrowed heavily from Ryan\u2019s. The administration lately has released broad outlines for its plan and is working on details.\u00a0 Thus far, they have a lot of common elements. Both want sweeping tax cuts for individuals and businesses, as well as to simplify the code by, among other things, reducing the number of brackets to three. In light of this, let\u2019s look at what happened under Reagan in 1986 and what Mr. Trump is dealing with: Reagan went bipartisan. Then as now, Republicans sought to lower taxes, but the well-off benefited the most, and the Democrats have decried this disparity. But Reagan was able to win over Democrats, who controlled the House of Representatives but not the Senate in 1986, by touting the appeal of other parts of the legislation, like expanding the standard deduction. Ending loopholes that favored the rich was another selling point to Democrats. Some of the more contentious original features were pared away, such as a proposal to end the deductibility of mortgage interest. While Reagan wasn\u2019t involved in many of the intricacies of the bill -- he, like Mr. Trump, was more of a big-picture guy -- his amiable relations with Capitol Hill helped smooth enactment. Reagan regularly got together for cocktails with House Speaker Thomas \u201cTip\u201d O\u2019Neill, a Democrat from Massachusetts. Republicans and Democrats in Congress had cordial relations that allowed them to negotiate more easily. In the Senate, a so-called \u201cGang of Seven\u201d Republicans and Democrats steered the bill. But the parties have grown much further apart ideologically over the past quarter century, according to political science studies. When Barack Obama was president, congressional Republicans made a point of torpedoing many of his initiatives. With Mr. Trump in office, the Democrats vow to be similarly obstructionist.\u00a0 Mr. Trump\u2019s combative style has provoked tensions with Democrats, certainly, but also among some of his fellow Republicans. Although Speaker Ryan is vital to winning enactment of Mr. Trump\u2019s program, the president in the past has called him a \u201closer\u201d and \u201cvery weak and ineffective.\u201d That, of course, was during the election, and the GOP leadership on the Hill now portrays itself as behind the president. Still, it remains to be seen how they\u2019ll work together in practice. \u201cThere\u2019s tremendous antipathy toward Trump,\u201d said economist Gary Shilling, who advised the Reagan administration in the 1980s. \u201cReagan was the antithesis of Trump.\u201d \u00a0 Reagan was mindful of the budget impact. \u00a0An avowed enemy of deficit financing, Reagan said he would veto the tax bill if it lowered or raised tax revenue. To that end, the 1986 measure reduced individual tax rates and hiked payments for corporations.\u00a0 The Reagan administration did manage to whittle down deficits. Reagan was a believer in supply-side economics, which contends that lower taxes will spur growth and yield a bumper crop of extra tax revenue. How that worked out during his tenure is open to debate: After an initial set of tax cuts in 1981 soon after taking office, Reagan\u2019s\u00a0deficits as a share of GDP\u00a0deepened to 5.7 percent in the beginning of his presidency, albeit due to a recession.\u00a0 But then the deficits shrank after the 1986 overhaul, from 4.8 percent in that year to 3.1 percent in 1987 to 2.9 percent in 1988. Indeed, other factors may have been at work in Reagan\u2019s last years in office, boosting the economy and generating more tax revenue, such as a squelching of rampant inflation by the Federal Reserve and an end to oil disruptions from the Middle East. Nonetheless, the general movement in his two terms was toward smaller deficits. Under the Trump plan, deficits, and the national debt they feed, likely would balloon even more, some budget experts predict. That\u2019s the verdict of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Thanks to entitlement programs, chiefly Social Security and Medicare, the result of an aging population, federal debt held by the public, now 77 percent of GDP, would climb to 106 percent by 2035, the group estimates. Mr. Trump has opposed making any changes to entitlements benefiting older Americans.The reason: He had promised over-65 voters he wouldn\u2019t -- a politically wise move, even if debatable from a long-term economic standpoint.\u00a0 So adding new spending to this already enormous pile of debt obviously would accelerate the process. And that would trigger opposition from Capitol Hill\u2019s Republican budget hawks. Speaker Ryan has a budget-hawk pedigree, so it remains to be seen whether this will develop into a flashpoint between him and the White House when it comes to the horsetrading of legislating. To keep his plan from busting the budget, Ryan is backing a border adjustment tax, which would impose levies on imports, while charging exports nothing. He figures this would offset any revenue lost from tax reform. Mr. Trump is dubious of this notion, and import-dependent industries side with the president, who believes lowering taxes will touch off an economic boom and pay for the tax stimulus and other plans. Reagan lasered in on taxes, with minimal distractions. By 1986, Reagan already had achieved his first round of tax reductions (in 1981), pared back regulations and bolstered the military. So he had a clear path to tax reform with few competing demands before Congress. As Bank of America Merrill Lynch recently indicated: \u201cCompared to current proposals, the \u201886 reform involved a relatively simple trade-off of lower tax rates for reduced loopholes.\u201d\u00a0 In 2017, tax reform is more complex than Rubik\u2019s Cube. So many other interconnected issues have a bearing on the tax question: repeal and replacement of Obamacare (which Mr. Trump says must happen before anything else), infrastructure build-outs, domestic spending cuts and military expansion. If the administration manages to limit Medicaid subsidies from Obamacare recipients, for instance, that could free money for use elsewhere. That\u2019s no sure thing, however. The Republican consensus in 2017 is to promote \u201cpro-growth\u201d provisions, such as pushing down corporate tax rates, in a bid to make U.S. companies more competitive with foreign rivals, which benefit from smaller tax bites. The president and the speaker both want to lower the top corporate rate from its current 35 percent to either 15 percent (Mr. Trump) or 20 percent (Ryan). But they\u2019re apparently parting company on the border tax, which has generated heated resistance from retailers and other industries that depend upon foreign-made goods. Ryan is in favor of the tax, while the president has called it \u201ctoo complicated.\u201d\u00a0 The debate on the border tax issue prompted UBS Financial Services to wonder in a recent research note, whether it was a \u201cbridge too far.\u201d The same could be said for the ambitious tax reform question as a whole. The challenge for Mr. Trump is to show that, despite all the impediments, he can bring tax reform home, just like Reagan did.\u00a0 Larry Light is a veteran financial editor and reporter who has worked for the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Business Week, Money, AdviceIQ and Newsday.",

Bannon, however, disagreed, saying \u201cevery day\u201d will be \u201ca fight\u201d with the media. \u201cIt\u2019s not only not going to get better, it gets worse every day,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re corporatist, globalist media that are adamantly opposed to an economic nationalist agenda like Donald Trump has.\u201d 2:03 p.m. ET What are the most consequential actions Mr. Trump has made in his first month in office? Priebus named the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, his executive order on deregulation and his actions on immigration. Bannon, responding to the same question, said the three big-picture areas where Mr. Trump has been acting are \u201cnational security and sovereignty,\u201d \u201ceconomic nationalism,\u201d and \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state.\u201d 2:00 p.m. ET Bannon continued his criticism of the media, saying they don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on in the administration and that Mr. Trump plans to keep all of his campaign promises. \u201cJust like they were dead wrong on the chaos of the campaign and just like they were dead wrong on the chaos of the transition they are absolutely dead wrong on what\u2019s going on today,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mainstream media better understand something: all of those promises are going to be implemented.\u201d 1:56 p.m. ET\u00a0The first question to Bannon and Priebus was about the biggest \u201cmisconceptions\u201d people have about the White House. Priebus replied: \u201cThe biggest misconception is everything that youre reading.\u201d He said he and Bannon get along and work closely together -- \u201cwe share an office suite together, we\u2019re basically together form 6:30 in the morning until 11 o\u2019clock at night,\u201d he said -- and that the 2016 election showed the Republican Party and the conservative movement can be united. \u201cIt was Donald Trump that was able to bring this party and this movement together,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Steve and I know that, and we live it every day, our job is to get the agenda of President Trump through the door and on pen and paper.\u201d Bannon repeatedly referred to the media as \u201cthe opposition party,\u201d saying everything the media reports is \u201calways wrong.\u201d He acknowledged that different people in the Trump coalition have different priorities but that they were able to \u201ccome together and win.\u201d \u201cLook, we\u2019re a coalition, a lot of people have strong beliefs about different things,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we understand that you can come together and win.\u201d 1:50 p.m. ET After program delays, Bannon and Priebus have just taken the stage. 1 p.m. ET With the first day of the Conservative Political Action Conference getting underway in National Harbor, Md., several top members of the Trump administration are slated to speak. Next up, shortly after 1 p.m., are President Trump\u2019s chief strategist Steve Bannon and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. The two men will participate in a \u201cconversation\u201d event with Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, which puts on the CPAC conference.

The right-wing news and opinion site, formerly run by senior Trump aide Steve Bannon, has been criticized as a platform for conspiracy theories and racism. Bannon himself called Breitbart \u201cthe platform of the \u2018alt-right,\u2019\u201d a\u00a0loose, online movement of people promoting the notion of \u201cwhite identity,\u201d including white supremacists and those advocating for a separate white homeland. Sleeping Giants decided to get companies to block their ads from appearing on the site. And in doing so it learned that because of the way online ads are sold, few advertisers know where their ads appear. So far about\u00a0820 companies\u00a0have blocked their ads on Breitbart, according to Sleeping Giants. They include big consumer brands like Kellogg\u2019s, BMW and Visa, as well as dozens of tech companies, including Autodesk, Lenovo, HP, Okta, Vimeo and T-Mobile\u2019s parent company Deutsche Telekom. Ride-hailing company Lyft also decided to block its ads on Breitbart. Uber, which has been called out by Sleeping Giants for its ads on the site, didn\u2019t respond to request for comment. \u201cOne of Lyft\u2019s core values is to uplift and support one another in all that we do,\u201d said Lyft\u2019s director of communications, Adrian Durbin. \u201cWe strive to ensure that our advertisements appear only on sites that share this value.\u201d Similarly, an HP spokesman said, \u201cOur vision is to create technology that makes life better for everyone, everywhere and we have no intention of advertising on sites that don\u2019t align with our values as a company.\u201d A Lenovo spokesman touched on a different point: \u201cFollowing a recent article regarding women in science, tech, education and math (STEM), Breitbart has been blocked from all current Lenovo media campaigns. By the way, at the same time,\u00a0we also tweeted: \u2018Our ads are now blocked on that site. Incidentally, we think women should study TONS of science and math.\u2019\u201d That\u2019s not to say everyone has joined in the Breitbart boycott.\u00a0Uber, Amazon and AT&T ads continue to show on the website. Like Uber, Amazon didn\u2019t return a request for comment. AT&T declined to comment for this story. Breitbart didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Once politically neutral, Silicon Valley executives have become outspoken on social issues. Two years ago, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff threatened to cancel all spending in Indiana after then-governor Mike Pence signed a bill that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against gay and transgender people. Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote a\u00a0now-famous op-ed in the Washington Post\u00a0against similar laws in other states. Earlier this week, the CEOs of Facebook, Google and Microsoft\u00a0criticized President Trump\u2019s executive order\u00a0temporarily blocking immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries to the US. Their stance is notable because the tech industry employs more than 6.7 million people and accounts for 7.1 percent of the country\u2019s GDP, according to the\u00a0Computing Technology Industry Association. Breitbart\u2019s popularity has surged since Trump announced his presidential bid in June 2015. In October 2014, Breitbart attracted about\u00a08 million monthly readers, according to ComScore. By October 2016, the site drew in\u00a019.2 million monthly visitors. While that\u2019s roughly 5 percent of the US internet market, Breitbart still doesn\u2019t top the 50 most visited sites. For comparison,\u00a0Google was No. 1\u00a0in October with 246 million monthly visitors, and Tribune Media was No. 50 with 60 million visitors. Some companies may not want to block their ads on Breitbart and lose the potential to reach that audience. Others might not even know they\u2019re serving ads on Breitbart. That\u2019s when Sleeping Giants steps in. Sleeping Giants was born shortly after Trump\u2019s win in November. Its organizers, who\u2019ve asked to remain anonymous, said in email interviews that they hadn\u2019t spent much time on Breitbart before the election and were curious to see what kinds of companies were placing ads on the site. The first company they came across was SoFi, a self-described alternative finance company that does things like help college graduates find better rates on student loans. They took a screenshot of the ad, started up the Sleeping Giants Twitter account and tweeted the screenshot to SoFi\u2019s CEO. \u201cWithin 30 minutes, he got back to us and was surprised the ads were on the site,\u201d said Sleeping Giants. \u201cThis set off alarm bells to us, as we assumed that advertisers knew where their ads were showing up.\u201d It turns out most companies have no idea where their online ads appear. Most online ad placement services use \u201cprogrammatic advertising,\u201d which targets people instead of websites. That\u2019s why when you\u2019re online shopping for something like shoes, you may see an ad for those shoes across various sites you visit. With programmatic advertising, those shoes seemingly walk in your footsteps around the internet. If a company doesn\u2019t want its ads to show up on a certain website, it has to actively block that domain, said Mark Irvine, senior data scientist for online advertising software company WordStream. \u201cIn the past, these programmatic companies have been able to block ads from appearing on pornography sites or next to violent content,\u201d Sleeping Giants writes in its\u00a0FAQ. \u201cBut what they all missed was the fact that ads could appear next to highly charged, inflammatory and often fake news.\u201d Sleeping Giants claims SoFi decided to block its ads on Breitbart after getting the heads-up. SoFi didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Sleeping Giants then alerted five more companies, which it says also decided to block their ads from the site. Then it alerted 10 more. But momentum for Sleeping Giants\u2019 campaign really picked up in December, after cereal maker Kellogg\u2019s said it was\u00a0removing ads from Breitbart\u00a0because the site doesn\u2019t align \u201cwith our values as a company.\u201d Breitbart reacted by\u00a0launching its #DumpKelloggs boycott\u00a0and told the\u00a0Los Angeles Times\u00a0that Kellogg\u2019s decision was equal to \u201ceconomic censorship of mainstream conservative political discourse\u201d and \u201cas un-American as it gets.\u201d Around the same time, dozens of other companies, including Warby Parker and Allstate, began to\u00a0block their ads\u00a0from the news site. \u201cThe number of ads from major advertisers are way down,\u201d Sleeping Giants claims after perusing Breitbart\u2019s advertisers, while acknowledging it doesn\u2019t have information on Breitbart\u2019s ad sales. It says a review of Breitbart.com shows that \u201cmost of the ads now are for more local and boutique companies.\u201d The boycott may not hurt Breitbart\u2019s bottom line. That\u2019s because of the way online ad sales work. Most online ads are sold through massive digital advertising platforms like Google\u2019s AdWords. One of these platforms, AppNexus, said in late November that it had blocked Breitbart from using its ad-serving tools because the site\u00a0violated its hate speech policy. Shortly after that announcement, two other ad platforms, TubeMogul and RocketFuel, did the same, according to\u00a0Wired. Others platforms, like AdWords and AdRoll, say they let their clients choose which sites to block. Sleeping Giants said it has begun to appeal to advertising platforms as part of its long-term efforts. Online advertising software company WordStream has taken a\u00a0deeper look\u00a0at the success of ads on Breitbart. It places ads for more than 3,000 companies. Of those clients, roughly 40 percent have requested to block Breitbart. Even so, WordStream\u2019s Mark Irvine said the boycott probably wouldn\u2019t affect Breitbart. \u201cAt best, we\u2019re talking about removing a small share of all the advertisers that could possibly serve Breitbart,\u201d Irvine said. To a certain extent, Breitbart gets paid as long as its ad spaces are being filled. Still, ad dollars also depend on how often ads are clicked. Having major advertisers pull out could affect revenue, but Breitbart likely wouldn\u2019t feel a squeeze until big ad platforms start blocking the site wholesale, said Irvine. \u201cOnce you get a large player in the game, such as Google, Facebook or an ad provider such as AdRoll, that\u2019s when domains such as Breitbart could begin to feel financial burden,\u201d Irvine said. \u201cWith one advertiser, it\u2019s one in several million. Whereas if you were to pull several million at once, then that penalty is passed on.\u201d Criticism of Breitbart prompted a\u00a0tweet\u00a0on Wednesday by Trump, who questioned whether UC Berkeley, known for its advocacy of free speech, should lose federal funds for protesting \u201cpeople with a different point of view.\u201dStudents had demonstrated against an appearance by Breitbart editor Milos Yiannopoulos, a self-proclaimed internet troll who was\u00a0banned from Twitter\u00a0last June after leading a harassment campaign against \u201cGhostbusters\u201d actress Leslie Jones. For now, advertisers like Visa and Lululemon continue to block their ads from Breitbart one by one. \u201cVisa works with its media buying agency to constantly optimize the ideal mix of sites where our digital ads may appear,\u201d a Visa spokesman said. \u201cPart of this process includes regular safeguards to avoid our ads appearing on sites with sensitive, risque or controversial content.\u201d This article was originally published on\u00a0CNET.com.",

            "article_content": "Hope, worry, excitement and fear. Those were some of the messages everyday Americans shared with CBS News about how they viewed the next four years. As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office, CBS News asked Americans to share their messages to Mr. Trump using the hashtag #DearPresidentTrump. Over the course of just a few days, more than 3,000 voicemails as well as a collection of videos and tweets came in from people across the country. Some were supporters of Mr. Trump others were not.\u00a0 Many of the messages differed, with some expressing concerns, optimism, and even advice for the 45th president of the United States. However, one common theme emerged: Most people wanted what was best for the country. Here\u2019s what some had to say: \u201cI\u2019m retired military. I did 22 years in the service. I served in Desert Storm. My husband also served in the war. My daughter\u2019s military as well. So we fought to serve for our country and we believe in what this country stands for. And all we\u2019re asking is that you would do a fair job and be equal toward everyone, and make our prison system equal in fair for all people. We look forward to working with you, and we\u2019re praying that you\u2019ll do the right thing this whole nation. Thank you.\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stop acting like a teenage schoolboy with your Twitter account. And all that attacking the media and everything else that you\u2019ve done that proves that you\u2019re not qualified to be president. Pretty sure that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d \u201cI want to thank you and Mike Pence for working so hard to win the election. I look forward to you and your team making America great for everyone. I pray everyday for your success, and I\u2019m a hundred percent behind you. Thank you.\u201d \u201cYou have been given an incredible opportunity. Stop self-defeating, stop the self-destructive ridiculous behavior, and start acting the way the children of this country need to have their leaders, their public leaders, behave.\u201d \u201cI have been very anxious since the election and I have yet to hear anything from President-elect Trump to help ease my fears. In fact, my fears are growing daily. I don\u2019t know how to answer my eight and nine-year-old students\u2019 questions about the future of the world. I hear them asking, \u2018Will there be war now?\u2019 These children remember Trump saying, and I quote, \u2018I like war.\u2019 President-elect Trump, be careful with our country. Be mindful, and show some self control.\u201d \u201cI would like to see you straighten up the immigration system and create a good process where people can come into the country through a good process. I would also like to see you appoint judges who are fair-minded and interpret the Constitution as it was written and then intended by our forefathers. I would like to see you regain a strong support for Israel and reestablish strength around the world that has been lost in the last eight years. I would like to see equitable trade with our countries and to set a climate where manufacturing is again welcomed here. I would like to see you clean up the government waste that has taken over Washington, and maybe even eliminate or reorganize some of the departments. I would like to see you bring your business sense to Washington and help the country. And lastly I would like to see you keep your strong resolve to make America great again. And I want to wish God\u2019s blessing on you as you go.\u201d \u201cI want to say congratulations, and I feel like he is more than willing to make the changes that our country needs, and we definitely need a change. And I totally agree with his ideas, and I wish him nothing but the best. I do have one concern and that is that he change -- not take the pre-existing condition clause -- out of Obamacare. My husband is very ill and needs a liver transplant... at no fault of his own he has an autoimmune disease. It\u2019s rare and our only hope of him getting this transplant is with the insurance we have now. No other company is going to want to take him and do a transplant if they get rid of the pre-existing condition stipulation. So please, that\u2019s the one thing I ask and it\u2019s not just for him, but a lot of other people I know that will need that. Please do not take that away.\u201d \u201cMy name is Dan and I\u2019m a highschool student from Indiana. I just want to say that I was never a supporter of you, and I don\u2019t -- I\u2019m not particularly fond of you or your viewpoints, but that I wish you the best in office, and I hope that you can prove me wrong, what I think of you. And I hope that by the end of your presidency, I will have thought that it was a great four or eight years. I care a lot about this earth and the environment and the people in it, and I just hope from the bottom of my heart that you can make me happy with the choices you make over your presidency. Thank you sir, and here\u2019s to a great four to eight years.\u201d \u00a0Do you have a message for Mr. Trump? Here\u2019s how you can share: CBS News\u2019 Jareen Imam, Kevin Prince, Rebecca Lee and Jean Song contributed to this report.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Congress again failed to approve long-term funds for a popular program that provides health insurance for nearly 9 million low-income children, leaving each party blaming the other for Christmas-season gridlock and states scrambling to decide how to parcel out dwindling money. Lawmakers scurrying to leave the Capitol for the holidays approved a short-term patch Thursday designed to keep state programs operating through March, though some Republicans said federal officials think the money would run out by early February. The money was part of a bill averting a weekend federal shutdown. Congress had approved a previous stopgap solution for the children's health program that was about to expire. Democrats and Republicans agree that finances for the Children's Health Insurance Program should be renewed for five years, but they've clashed over how to pay for it. And while few think Congress would blunder into letting the money completely lapse \u2014 which no lawmaker would care to defend with elections approaching \u2014 an effort to provide long-term money collapsed as leaders punted a bunch of unresolved issues until early next year. \"What GOP is obsessed with: Ramming through tax cuts for the rich and powerful,\" tweeted Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., referring to the $1.5 trillion tax bill Congress approved this week. \"What GOP completely ignores: Extending #CHIP - health care for our children.\" \"We would love to pass it. They won't let us,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in an interview, asserting that Democrats had blocked a multiyear extension. As the issue slipped into next year, the two top senators on the issue \u2014 Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and top committee Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon \u2014 issued a statement promising to seek a five-year extension soon. \"We will be vigilant to ensure this program isn't subject to repeated short-term fixes and constantly looming deadlines \u2014 families across the nation deserve better,\" they said. With no long-term funding agreement imminent, growing numbers of states have begun edging toward depleting their federal funds and commencing steps to cope with that. According to a survey the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation conducted in November and released this month, 14 states were planning to end or phase out coverage for children, including five by the end of January. A separate study by Georgetown University's Center for Children and Families estimated that without the money from Thursday's short-term extension, 25 states would run out of money by the end of January, with 1.9 million children potentially losing coverage. It remained uncertain how those states and others would react to the latest infusion of federal money. But Alabama recently warned it would stop registering new beneficiaries on Jan. 1 and halt the entire program a month later. Connecticut cautioned it would stop supporting families after Jan. 31, and Colorado has sent letters to recipients warning that their coverage may be canceled. \"We're just hoping Congress does the right thing and doesn't put politics in front of people's health, in front of children's health, in front of pregnant women's health,\" said Colorado Lt. Gov. Donna Lynne, a Democrat. Although Congress has stepped in and provided eleventh-hour money twice in recent months, the will-they-or-won't-they drama has put pressure on state officials about how to respond. They say they need lead time to keep recipients abreast of the status of their assistance and to adjust their programs if there's a chance state allotments might change. Kelly Haight, spokeswoman for North Carolina's health department, said the state's 220,000 children receiving assistance under the program \"will not experience any interruption in benefits at this time\" because the state had enough money for the beginning of 2018. She said officials were \"considering all our options\" for possibly losing federal funds. Federal taxpayers paid about $16 billion for the program last year, with states adding a smaller share, according to government figures. The program is aimed at children from families with incomes too high to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program. The House approved GOP legislation in November extending the health insurance program's federal money for five years. Most Democrats voted no, saying they opposed plans to finance the extension in part by cutting a public health program created under President Barack Obama's 2010 health care law. The Senate Finance Committee easily approved its own five-year measure in October, but that bill lacked offsetting savings to pay for the extra money. One Democratic aide said top lawmakers of both parties had subsequently quietly agreed to a package of savings. But as Congress rushed Thursday to pass short-term pending legislation preventing a weekend federal shutdown and leave town for the holidays, unsettled disputes over health care, immigration and other issues fell by the wayside for lawmakers to address next year. Instead, the short-term bill includes $2.9 billion for states to use for children's health plus authority for federal officials to continue distributing unspent program money to states running short.",

            "article_content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee, who became the city's first Asian-American mayor when he was named to serve out the remainder of Gavin Newsom's term in Jan. 2011, died suddenly early Tuesday morning, city officials said. He was 65. In accordance with the City Charter, Board of Supervisors President London Breed became Acting Mayor of San Francisco, effectively immediately, CBS San Francisco reports. In a short news release, officials said Lee passed away on Tuesday, December 12 at 1:11 a.m. at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. Family, friends and colleagues were at his side. Former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, a close personal friend of Lee's, said the mayor was shopping at Safeway when he collapsed last night and rushed to the hospital. \"Anita sent him to do his family chores,\" Brown said. \"He never moved away from being a husband and a father as a mayor.\" His death was announced by officials early Tuesday. \"It is with profound sadness and terrible grief that we confirm that Mayor Edwin M. Lee passed away,\" the statement read. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Anita, his two daughters, Brianna and Tania, and his family.\" Lee was appointed as mayor by the Board of Supervisors on January 11, 2011 after Newsom resigned to become Lieutenant Governor. He won election on Nov. 8, 2011 and was re-elected in 2015. Lee was among four candidates to replace Newsom, but initially said he was not interested in the job. At the urging of Brown, the late Chinatown power broker Rose Pak and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, he tossed his name into the selection process. \"Those of us who helped orchestrate his selection as interim mayor knew he was going to be an important figure,\" Brown told CBS San Francisco. \"Those of us who helped orchestrate his selection as interim mayor knew he was going to be an important figure,\" Brown said. \"He clearly was important in the symbolism of the mayorship. His being the first person of Asian descent in a major American city in this nation was in and of itself decisive.\" As he talked about Lee, who was head of purchasing and public works for the city when Brown was mayor, his voice cracked with emotion. \"I don't know San Francisco without Ed Lee,\" Brown said. \"He was a part of everything. He was the human rights director. He was head of purchasing during my administration. He was head of public works. He became the CAO (chief administrative officer) for the city\u2026 I just can't imagine the city without Ed Lee.\" Over the last year, Lee has been at loggerheads with President Donald Trump over immigration. San Francisco, under Lee, has been a leader among American cities in the Sanctuary City movement. Lee served was a director of San Francisco's Human Rights Commission from 1991 to 1996 and served Newsom as the City Administrator from 2005 to 2011. He grew up in public housing in Seattle and worked early in his career as a civil rights attorney often representing low-income tenants. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio reacted to Lee's death on Twitter. Deeply saddened to hear of the death of Mayor Ed Lee. He was a good friend and a tireless fighter for the people of San Francisco. Our thoughts are with his family.",

            "article_content": "Our country is divided between red states and blue states, a division that has intensified since the election of President Donald Trump. And some of the blue states are intensifying their resistance to the president. Most prominently, California, the country's bluest and most populous state, led by Governor Jerry Brown. Brown has been governor of California twice -- the first time, 40 years ago. He criticizes the president on taxes. California is suing the Trump administration over health care, immigration, and air quality, but nothing raises more righteous passion in Jerry Brown than the issue of climate change. He castigates the president for denying the science and aggravating a problem Governor Brown says is causing California to burn. This is the most destructive fire season on record in California. Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency this past week as raging wildfires, whipped by fierce Santa Ana winds and fueled by bone-dry brush, laid waste to tens-of-thousands of acres in Southern California. The smoke plume that shrouded the Los Angeles area could be seen from space. The fires that ravaged California's famed wine country in October were the deadliest the state has ever seen. Whole neighborhoods were incinerated. Dozens of people were killed. Governor Jerry Brown: The fire season used to be a few months in the summer, now it's almost year-long. These fires are unprecedented. We've never seen anything like it. Scientists are telling us, \"This is the kind of stuff that's gonna happen.\" And we gotta deal with it. It's going to happen, he says, based on science that predicts extreme swings in weather patterns. This year, Southern California experienced record heat in October and November, creating the perfect conditions for this. Governor Jerry Brown: Nature is not a political game. Nature is the ground on which we stand, it's the air which we breathe. The truth of the case is that there's too much carbon being emitted, that heat-trapping gases are building up, the planet is warming and all hell is breaking loose. Bill Whitaker: President Trump has famously called climate change -- a hoax. When he pulled out of the Paris Climate Accord he said this wasn't a good deal for the United States.\u00a0 Governor Jerry Brown: That's a preposterous idea not even a shred of truth in that statement. So I'd say to Mr. Trump, take a deeper look now is not the time to undo what every country in the world is committed to. Bill Whitaker: Are you fearful? Governor Jerry Brown: Oh yeah, you should, anyone who isn't is not looking at the facts. I don't think President Trump has a fear of the Lord, the fear of the wrath of God, which leads one to more humility. And this is such a reckless disregard for the truth and for the existential consequences that can be unleashed. If he sounds like a Jesuit seminarian, it's because he was one, years ago. Now, he's a climate missionary, traveling the world, preaching the gospel of renewable energy -- at the Vatican; in China, where President Xi Jinping discussed collaborating with California on cutting greenhouse gases. Brown went to the global climate summit in Bonn, Germany last month. He and former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg led a delegation of mayors and legislators representing 40% of the U.S. economy. While the official U.S. delegation, sent by the White House, showed up to promote coal; Brown went to tell the world President Trump doesn't speak for all Americans. Governor Jerry Brown: California is not waiting for Trump. We're not waiting for all the deniers.\u00a0 He's already weaning California off fossil fuels. To give us a glimpse of the future, Brown took us to a 62-acre solar farm near Sacramento on the site of a decommissioned nuclear power plant. Bill Whitaker: You wanna have 50% of California's electricity generated by renewable sources by-- Governor Jerry Brown: By 2030. Bill Whitaker: --2030. And you-- Governor Jerry Brown: And I think-- Bill Whitaker: --think you're gonna beat that? Governor Jerry Brown: Yes, no question about it. With the federal government standing down on climate action, California is blazing its own trail. \u00a0 \u00a0 Bill Whitaker: What can you, the governor of one state in the United States, do to fill in the void? Governor Jerry Brown: As governor of California we have a cap and trade system which is a very efficient way to reducing greenhouse gases. We have zero-emission vehicle mandate. We have efficiency standards for our buildings, for our appliances. So California is showing that dealing with climate is good for the economy, not bad. California is booming. Under Brown, it has grown from the 9th largest economy in the world to the 6th. It's now bigger than France with a budget surplus of more than $7 billion.\u00a0 Bill Whitaker: When you first came into office this time. California faced more than $50 billion in debt and deficits. There were headlines that California was going to be the first \"failed state.\"\u00a0 Governor Jerry Brown: The fact is we cut the budget, we raised taxes and the economy roared back.\u00a0 Bill Whitaker: You cut the budget. You raised taxes. These days that sounds like a prescription for political suicide? Governor Jerry Brown: You gotta pay some taxes. You have to invest. We need to invest in the technology of tomorrow or somebody else will. And that somebody is China, India and other countries. You're not gonna poor mouth yourself to the future and roads cost money, that's called taxes. R&D cost money, colleges cost money -- schools, childcare, all of that. We're a rich country and we can handle it.\u00a0 But California's economic success has come at a cost. Housing prices are through the roof. So are the ranks of the homeless. A quarter of the country's homeless live in California.\u00a0 Governor Jerry Brown: This is not paradise. We have a lot of problems. But California is the engine of America, and I like to remind my fellow citizens when you kinda look askance at this state, you're looking at one of the, not the only one, but a major contributor to the well-being of the whole country.\u00a0 California is vital to the national economy. That's why Brown is so angered by the new tax overhaul legislation being pushed by House and Senate Republicans. They call it a tax cut, but Brown says by eliminating deductions for state and local taxes it would actually increase the tax burden on high tax blue states like California. He and other blue state governors say the bill is retaliation against Trump's opponents. Brown called it evil and divisive.\u00a0 Bill Whitaker: Do you think the Republicans are intentionally trying to punish the blue states that didn't vote for President Trump? \u00a0 Governor Jerry Brown: I know this. The Republicans have this cult. Just like they believe there's no climate problem, they believe that cutting corporate taxes without any money to pay for it, they think it's magic, it'll make everything wonderful. Very irresponsible. Very dangerous. But California Republicans say Brown's tax hikes are irresponsible. In Trump's America, Jerry Brown's California seems far out on the frontier. California doesn't look like the rest of the country: Minorities now are the majority of the population. It doesn't act like the rest of the country: The state voted to legalize recreational marijuana starting in January; will soon offer a third gender choice on drivers' licenses. Hillary Clinton trounced President Trump here by more than 4 million votes. Bill Whitaker: It seems that California is way out of step with the rest of the country. Governor Jerry Brown: I'd say we're more in tune with the future than many parts of the rest of the country.\u00a0 Bill Whitaker: You think the country is going to look more like California in the future? Governor Jerry Brown: I think it will. I was asking myself, \"Why did Democrats in Ohio and Wisconsin and Michigan, Pennsylvania, why'd they vote for Trump?\" Not a lot of 'em did, but enough to give him those states' electoral votes.\u00a0 Bill Whitaker: And your answer? Governor Jerry Brown: There's more confidence here; there's less fear. People are looking to the future. They're not scared, they're not going inward, they're not scapegoating, they're not blaming Mexican immigrants. They're not blaming the stranger. Just the opposite. It's is a place that's alive. It's dynamic. It's a culture that's on the move, not pulling up the drawbridge out of fear and and economic insecurity.\u00a0 Jerry Brown is California's 39th and oldest governor. When he first held the office in 1975 he had a full head of hair. His father, Pat Brown had been governor eight years before.\u00a0 When you look at all the staid portraits of his predecessors in the capitol rotunda, it's obvious Jerry Brown is not like the others. Not many politicians spent four years in the seminary as Brown did in the 1950s. Or dated a rock star. He went out with Linda Rondstadt in the 70s. \u00a0\u00a0 Governor Jerry Brown: I've seen a lotta different things. I've worked with Mother Theresa. I've spent six months doing Zen meditation in Kamakura, Japan and I've run for President three times. I've done very incompatible things. Bill Whitaker: People who like you will say that that's evidence of intellectual flexibility. People who don't like you say that that's evidence of your being flighty. Governor Jerry Brown: Well, I'm not gonna -- that's that psycho babble. Whatever you call it, his far-out politics his first time in office earned him the moniker Governor Moonbeam. We found him to be down to earth. He's California casual at the office. His dog Colusa has the run of the place. Bill Whitaker: Are you better at being governor this time? Governor Jerry Brown: Yeah, it's a different experience. 79 is not 36. Different ball game in every way. So I would say I know more, I understand more.\u00a0 Bill Whitaker: What have you learned about yourself in those intervening years? Governor Jerry Brown: There's something you lose with age, your physical prowess -- but mental acuity and -- just life experience is very important. So, I enjoy the job a lot more. It's hard to see why. His liberal policies make him a punching bag for conservatives and he's not universally loved by liberals. He's a political maverick. He's rolling back state union pensions. He refuses to curb oil production until there's a viable alternative. A majority of Californians like what he's doing. But he's been doing this for almost 50 years and he says it's time to hang up his political spurs. When he leaves office in January 2019, he swears he's going to leave elective politics behind.\u00a0 Bill Whitaker: I think you're gonna miss this.\u00a0 Governor Jerry Brown: No I won't. \u00a0 Bill Whitaker: You don't think so? Governor Jerry Brown: Next year I'll be 80, okay? And what do I want to do with my life? That's my question. Bill Whitaker: What do you want to do? Governor Jerry Brown: Well, I want to spend time with my wife. A go it alone bachelor nearly all of his adult life, Jerry Brown now has a partner to share his life -- Anne Gust Brown, a former executive at The Gap. They married in 2005. \u00a0Their plan is to retire to a ranch, in a golden valley north of Sacramento. They're building their dream ranch house - with solar panels, of course. It's off the grid and way off the beaten path.\u00a0 The governor and Colusa, showed us around. \u00a0 Bill Whitaker: This is beautiful governor. This is pretty steep. Governor Jerry Brown: Oh you haven't seen nothing yet. \u00a0 He told us he's going out at his peak, stepping away from the fray on land his great-grandfather settled in the 1860s. He said he intends to be a modest rancher. He's going to unplug and unwind. \u00a0 Bill Whitaker: Do ya think this man sitting next to you is going to be content puttering around the ranch? Governor Jerry Brown: I wouldn't call it \"puttering.\" I don't \"putter.\" Anne Gust Brown: He sure doesn't putter. No-- Bill Whitaker: Running- - as he said, running a modest ranch. Anne Gust Brown: We both wonder about it. 'Cause we've been running a hundred miles an hour and now we're gonna be in a place that's almost the opposite of that and we'll see. Governor Jerry Brown: Yeah we're on the frontier, as it were. Bill Whitaker: And you're going to like that? Governor Jerry Brown: Well I like being on the frontier. That's for sure.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump gave embattled GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore a vigorous formal endorsement Monday, looking past allegations of sexual misconduct with Alabama teenagers as Republican leaders in Washington, once appalled by Moore's candidacy, began to come to grips with the ever-clearer possibility of his victory. Buoyed by the taste of his own success in Congress as the Republican tax bill inches closer to passage, Trump telephoned Moore to offer encouragement as well as support and also argued in a pair of tweets that Moore's vote was badly needed to push the president's policies forward. The Republican National Committee quickly followed suit, announcing they were returning the support they had pulled last month. In addition, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who was initially among several national Republicans to urge Moore to drop out of the race, said Sunday it was up to Alabama voters to decide whether the former state Supreme Court chief justice should be elected. Weeks ago, when accusations of sexual misconduct with teenagers first surfaced, Trump's spokesman had said the president believed Moore would \"do the right thing and step aside\" if the allegations were true. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell disputes projections that the Senate's tax bill would add to the nation's debt woes. McConnell says he thinks the tax overhaul will generate more than enough economic growth to plug the deficits forecast.\u00a0 Top Republicans vowed to expel him from the Senate if he won his Dec. 12 special election. And, publicly and privately, GOP leaders described the allegations against Moore as credible and insisted there were no circumstances under which he should serve in the Senate. Trump's tweets on Monday showed his thinking has evolved as Moore has rejected his party's appeals and doggedly remained in the race. In the phone call, Moore said, Trump offered \"his full support and said he needs a fighter to help him in the US Senate.\" Moore tweeted that the president told him: \"Go get 'em, Roy!\" Trump's move was somewhat symbolic: He had already all but endorsed Moore, repeatedly criticizing Democratic rival Doug Jones on Twitter and planning a campaign-style rally in Pensacola, Florida, on Friday, less than 20 miles from the Alabama border and just four days before voters head to the polls. Still, Trump's decision to do away with any pretense of distance made clear he is increasingly confident in Moore's chances of victory despite the continued unease of some other Republican leaders. And the RNC quickly followed his lead. An RNC official confirmed late Monday that the committee would once again be supporting Moore, after severing its fundraising ties to his campaign last month. It was not immediately clear what that support would entail. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to confirm the reversal, which was first reported by Breitbart News. A Moore victory would set up a potentially explosive clash with fellow Republicans in Congress, some of whom have resoundingly called on him to quit the race. While some have softened their rhetoric recently, others have said they still will try to expel him if he is elected. Moore's campaign was wounded by accusations this fall of sexual misconduct, decades ago, made by women who were then teenagers. One of the women alleges he initiated sexual contact when she was 14. Moore denies it all, saying \"I do not know any of these women. I did not date any of these women I did not engage in any sexual misconduct with anyone.\" Trump, who has repeatedly noted Moore's denials, took a more political stance on Monday. \"Democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive Tax Cuts is why we need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama,\" Trump tweeted. \"We need his vote on stopping crime, illegal immigration, Border Wall, Military, Pro Life, V.A., Judges 2nd Amendment and more.\" In that same vein, longtime Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby said Trump's endorsement didn't surprise him. He said of the president, \"I think he's interested, a lot of us are, in the numbers, being a Republican.\" And Sen. Orrin Hatch, who traveled with Trump on Monday to Hatch's home state of Utah, said he realistically didn't have any choice. Hatch said, of Moore, \"That's the only Republican you can possibly get down there at this time.\" Trump first appeared to back Moore after his first choice, Sen. Luther Strange, lost the GOP primary for the seat once held by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. But the president went silent after The Washington Post reported on the allegations of sexual misconduct with two teens, ages 14 and 16, and efforts to date several others while Moore was a local prosecutor in his 30s. By late last month, however, with pressure mounting from his former chief strategist Steve Bannon and other corners of his base, Trump was making clear that he preferred Moore, raising doubts about the candidate's accusers and criticizing Democrat Jones as the \"liberal puppet\" of Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. Meanwhile, Moore himself was strongly criticized by top Republicans, including Cory Gardner of Colorado, chairman of the Senate GOP campaign apparatus known as the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \"If he refuses to withdraw and wins, the Senate should vote to expel him, because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate,\" Gardner said three weeks ago. He said last week he stood by that statement. Jones, the Democrat, sidestepped questions about Trump's endorsement while suggesting the support of national Republicans like McConnell could do more harm than good in Alabama. \"Our campaign is going straight to the people of the Alabama because that's who my voters are. It's not the president, it's not Mitch McConnell,\" Jones told reporters outside a steel mill in suburban Birmingham. \"Obviously Mitch McConnell has very little credibility in this state anyway, so I'm not worried about him at all.\" Expelling a senator is no easy task. The Senate Ethics Committee would have to investigate, and a recommendation of expulsion could take years.",

            "article_content": "Democrat Phil Murphy will be the next Governor of New Jersey.  Murphy, a former U.S. Ambassador to Germany, easily defeated Republican Kim Guadagno, the state's lieutenant governor, on Tuesday.\u00a0 When Murphy is inaugurated in January, New Jersey Democrats will control the governorship and both houses of the state legislature. The Democratic-leaning state has been lead by Republican Gov. Chris Christie since 2010.  Initially quite popular, Christie's approval rating has never recovered from the \"Bridgegate\" scandal, and he now has an approval rating of just 19 percent, according to CBS News exit polls. Christie ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, only to drop out and endorse President Trump after the New Hampshire primary.  Christie has remained an outspoken defender of Mr. Trump, who is deeply unpopular in New Jersey. The president has only a 32 percent approval rating in the state, according to CBS News exit polls, and 29 percent of voters said they voted to oppose him. However, 57 percent of voters told CBS News that there vote was \"not about [Mr. Trump].\"  Christie's significant political baggage is thought to have hobbled Guadagno, who in recent weeks has focused her campaign on illegal immigration. Polls indicated that Murphy, a wealthy former investment banker who spent heavily on the race, had a significant lead over Guadagno heading in to the contest.  Murphy was appointed ambassador to Germany in 2009 and served through President Barack Obama's first term in office. He previously worked at Goldman Sachs.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "MIAMI --\u00a0No evidence has surfaced of links to foreign extremists in an alleged plot by a Honduran man to bomb a Florida mall despite his claimed allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), an FBI agent testified Thursday.\u00a0 Agent David Clancy said at a bail hearing that Vicente Adolfo Solano appears to have come up with the idea on his own before sharing the plan with an acquaintance who turned out to be an FBI informant. Under close surveillance, the two of them then began plotting to bomb the busy food court at the Miami-area Dolphin Mall.\u00a0 \"Mr. Solano indicated throughout the (FBI) recordings that the plans were his alone,\" Clancy testified. \"He was pretty much always on his own.\"\u00a0 Solano, 53, was arrested last Friday after accepting a fake bomb from undercover FBI operatives outside the mall. Clancy said Solano had already set a 40-minute timer he thought would give him enough time to plant the device and escape undetected.\u00a0 Investigators said previously that Solano initially wanted to detonate the device on Black Friday -- the day after Thanksgiving -- when hundreds of shoppers would be in the mall, CBS Miami reported. Later, Solano told the informant the timing didn't matter as long as the building was crowded. \"He wanted to kill as many people as he could at the food court on a crowded Friday night,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Karen Gilbert said. Solano was denied release on bail by U.S. Magistrate Judge Chris McAliley, who noted there is strong evidence against him, including numerous video and audio recordings and his own confession after arrest. He also faces a potential life prison sentence if convicted.\u00a0 \"The evidence is compelling that you intended to kill many people,\" the judge said.\u00a0 Solano, who is scheduled to enter a plea in early November, said nothing during the hearing. Immigration officials say he arrived from Honduras in the late 1990s and is in the U.S. legally under the temporary protected status program.\u00a0 His attorney, public defender Alex Arteaga-Gomez, said Solano has no violent criminal history and has generally kept to himself while in the U.S., working as a painter. He said Solano has not traveled overseas in at least a decade and owns no weapons.\u00a0 \"He's lived a working class life,\" Arteaga-Gomez said.\u00a0 According to the FBI, the first evidence that Solano had become sympathetic with ISIS was in March when he changed his Facebook profile name to \"Abad Solano\" and wrote, \"I am Abad, son of Allah. May our black flag live on and we continue our battle.\"\u00a0 However, Clancy said there is no indication that Solano ever converted to Islam and while under surveillance was never seen going to any house of worship.\u00a0 \"I'm not aware of any religious affiliation,\" the agent testified.\u00a0 Solano also made three anti-U.S., pro-ISIS videos, wearing a black mask and standing in front of the black flag associated with the group. Those videos were sent to the FBI confidential informant, and investigators found the flag during a search of Solano's apartment. Agents also found sketches of the mall food court and evidence that he had done research on the ISIS and its leaders.\u00a0 Clancy also provided a few more details about the informant, who he said Solano has known for about six years. The informant served about four years in prison after he was convicted of posing as a police officer and had previously done undercover work for the Drug Enforcement Administration.\u00a0 It was the informant who went to the FBI after Solano began discussing his hatred of the U.S. and its policies around the time of the 2016 presidential election, Clancy said.\u00a0 \"It was a conversation that built over time. The conversations became increasingly more serious and frequent,\" the agent testified.",

She expressed hope for cooperation of other social media and tech giants such as Twitter and Alphabet (the parent company of Google), which also witnessed Russian influence efforts on their platforms. \"I must really commend Facebook for doing this because it is a breakthrough moment, and hopefully we will be getting more cooperation from the tech community in this very difficult arena,\" Feinstein said. \"This is not easy stuff because people abuse it, they use it for reasons inventors didn't think would be possible, encryption has a double edge to it and it's a very difficult arena.\"  The senator suggested that there is still more work to be done to understand the extent of the targeted ads which endeavored to wedge divides between the American electorate on issues ranging from Black Lives Matter to immigration.\u00a0  \"So, I think Facebook did the right thing by producing this information and I think you can ask us,\" Feinstein said, \"at least ask our side of it, the judiciary side of it, some questions in about a week or two when we have an opportunity to go through all of these Facebook messages.\" Business representatives from Twitter and Facebook will be back on Capitol Hill soon.\u00a0 Both have agreed to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee in a public hearing on November 1 about the role and extent to which Russian trolls, hundreds of fraud accounts and targeted advertising sculpted the political landscape.

            "article_content": "HAVANA -- Frightening attacks on U.S. personnel in Havana struck the heart of America's spy network in Cuba, with intelligence operatives among those attacked, CBS News' Steve Dorsey confirmed. According to The Associated Press, which first reported the targeting of intelligence operatives, the operatives were the first and most severely affected victims.   It wasn't until U.S. spies, posted to the embassy under diplomatic cover, reported hearing bizarre sounds and experiencing even stranger physical effects that the United States realized something was wrong, individuals familiar with the situation said.   While the attacks started within days of President Trump's surprise election in November, the precise timeline remains unclear, including whether intelligence officers were the first victims hit or merely the first victims to report it. The U.S. has called the situation \"ongoing.\"   To date, the Trump administration largely has described the 21 victims as U.S. embassy personnel or \"members of the diplomatic community.\" That description suggested only bona fide diplomats and their family members were struck, with no logical motivation beyond disrupting U.S.-Cuban relations.   Behind the scenes, though, investigators immediately started searching for explanations in the darker, rougher world of spycraft and counterespionage, given that so many of the first reported cases involved intelligence workers posted to the U.S. embassy. That revelation, confirmed to the AP by a half-dozen officials, adds yet another element of mystery to a year-long saga that the Trump administration says may not be over.   The State Department and the CIA declined to comment for this story.   The first disturbing reports of piercing, high-pitched noises and inexplicable ailments pointed to someone deliberately targeting the U.S. government's intelligence network on the communist-run island, in what seemed like a bone-chilling escalation of the tit-for-tat spy games that Washington and Havana have waged over the last half century.   But the U.S. soon discovered that actual diplomats at the embassy had also been hit by similar attacks, officials said, further confounding the search for a culprit and a motive.   Of the 21 confirmed cases, American spies suffered some of the most acute damage, including brain injury and hearing loss that has not healed, said several U.S. officials who weren't authorized to speak publicly on the investigation and demanded anonymity. They heard an unsettling sound inside and in some cases outside their Havana homes, described as similar to loud crickets. Then they fell ill.   Over time, the attacks seemed to evolve.   In many of the more recent cases, victims didn't hear noises and weren't aware an attack was occurring, identifying the symptoms only later. That has raised concerns among investigators that the attacks may be getting more sophisticated and harder to detect, individuals briefed on the investigation said.   Though the State Department has called all the cases \"medically confirmed,\" several U.S. officials said it's unclear whether all of the victims' symptoms can be conclusively tied to attacks. Considering the deep sense of alarm among Americans working in the embassy, it's possible some workers attributed unrelated illnesses to attacks.   Almost nothing about what has transpired in Havana is perfectly clear. But this is Cuba.   For decades, Washington and Havana pushed their rivalry to unprecedented levels of covert action. The former enemies tracked each other's personnel, turned each other's agents and, in the case of the CIA, even mounted a failed attempt to overthrow the Cuban government in the 1961 \"Bay of Pigs\" invasion.   There were hopes, though, that the two nations were starting to put that bitter history behind them after renewing diplomatic relations in 2015. When the attacks first occurred, the U.S. and Cuban governments were hard at work on clinching new commercial and immigration agreements. No new spat among intelligence services was publicly known.   Eleven months on, the U.S. cannot guarantee the threat is over. Last week, the State Department warned Americans to stay away from Cuba and ordered more than half the embassy staff to leave indefinitely. The U.S. had previously given all embassy staff the option to come home, but even most of those struck by the mysterious attacks had opted to stay, individuals familiar with the situation said.   For those staying and new arrivals, the U.S. has been giving instructions about what to watch and listen for to identify an attack in progress. They're also learning steps to take if an attack occurs that could mitigate the risk, officials said.   But the U.S. has not identified whatever device is responsible for the harm. FBI sweeps have turned up nothing.   So to better identify patterns, investigators have created a map detailing specific areas of Cuba's capital where attacks have occurred, several individuals familiar with the matter said. Three \"zones,\" or geographic clusters of attacks, cover the homes where U.S. diplomats live and several hotels where attacks occurred, including the historic Hotel Capri.   Since first disclosing the situation in August, the United States had generally avoided the word \"attacks.\" It called them \"incidents\" instead until last Friday. Now, the State Department deems them \"specific attacks\" targeting Americans posted in Havana, without saying what new information, if any, prompted the newfound confidence they were indeed deliberate.   The most obvious motive for attacking Americans in Havana would be to drive a wedge between the U.S. and Cuba. If that's the case, the strategy appears to be succeeding.   Last week's embassy drawdown added to the growing friction between the nations. And an accompanying new travel warning deemed Havana's hotels unsafe for visitors, threatening to drive down tourism, a backbone of Cuba's economy.   In Havana, American diplomats are frantically selling off possessions -- from mattresses to canned goods to children's toys -- and hunting for jobs and places to live in the United States. Many have spent years overseas and don't have homes waiting for them in the United States.   \"Heartbroken? Me too, but this will make you feel better,\" one seller posted in a chatroom for foreigners in Cuba, under a picture of a Costco artichoke hearts jar selling for $6.   For Cubans, it may be no better. The U.S. has been providing 20,000 visas a year to Cubans moving to the United States. It has issued thousands more to Cubans wishing to visit family in America. The reduction in U.S. staff in Havana means visa processing there has been suspended indefinitely.   Cuba has vehemently denied involvement or knowledge of the attacks. Some in the U.S. government believe the Cubans may be telling the truth, officials said.   When President Raul Castro denied any culpability in February, he did so on the sidelines a meeting in Havana with five visiting U.S. members of Congress, the AP found. The U.S. had raised complaints about the attacks to Cuba just days earlier through diplomatic channels.   But the visiting lawmakers knew nothing of the attacks taking place in the country they were visiting.   Nor did they know that Castro had used the occasion of their meeting to pull aside Jeff DeLaurentis, then the top U.S. diplomat in Cuba, to say privately that his government was equally alarmed and willing to help.   The lawmakers all declined to comment. Cuban officials say they're disappointed in the U.S. retaliatory measures but will continue cooperating with the investigation.  ",

            "article_content": "By Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus, Kabir Khanna and Anthony Salvanto Most Americans continue to see North Korea as a threat that can be contained, though the number who say it requires military action has risen slightly in recent weeks. A majority disapprove of President Trump's handling of the situation, and more voice concern that the U.S. would go to war too quickly than too slowly. Republicans approve of the president's handling, and worry the U.S. will not act fast enough. A clear partisan division underlies the differing concerns about North Korea. \u00a0 A majority of Americans continue to see North Korea's weapons program as a threat, but one that can be contained for now.\u00a0 Still, the percentage that think the North Korea situation requires immediate military action has gone up slightly from last month, from 29 percent in August to 33 percent today, its highest measure.\u00a0 This shift is largely among independents, whose percent seeing it as a threat requiring action has risen seven points \u2013 from 24 percent last month to 31 percent today. Like last month, Republicans are split on this.\u00a0 Few Democrats see it as requiring military action now. \u00a0 Overall, most Americans disapprove of the way President Trump is handling the situation with North Korea.\u00a0 Here again, large partisan divisions are evident, with 79 percent of Republicans approving and 83 percent of Democrats disapproving. More broadly, a majority of Americans now think Mr. Trump is making the U.S. image in the world weaker rather than stronger.\u00a0 Fifty-two percent think so, up from 46 percent in April. This measure it largely tied to how Americans view the president's handling of the North Korea situation.\u00a0 Those who approve of the president's handling of North Korea think he is making the U.S. image in the world stronger, while the opposite is true of those who disapprove. President Trump's approval rating on the response to recent hurricanes is positive, but it's the only positive measure of those tested. His rating for handling health care is the lowest this poll tested -- at just 29 percent. Immigration meets just 35 percent approval. His overall approval rating, also now at 35 percent, is one point lower than August, and the lowest it has reached in this poll so far. Mr. Trump's overall job rating has been similarly negative since June. Those who disapprove of the president overall are overwhelmingly likely to also disapprove of his handling health care, while they are relatively more approving of his handling the economy and hurricanes. Evaluations of the president continue to be highly driven by partisanship. Mr. Trump gets high marks from Republicans, while a large majority of Democrats disapprove.\u00a0 Amid public optimism about the nation's economy, his ratings are mixed on that issue. Overall ratings of the U.S. economy continue to be very positive, with two-thirds saying it is good, but two-thirds also believe the country is not going in the right direction. Republicans nationwide increasingly feel their party in Congress could be doing more to help President Trump.\u00a0 Seven in 10 say congressional Republicans are not doing enough to help him, up 12 points from June. \u00a0 Across the aisle, most Democrats would like to see congressional Democrats work more with Donald Trump on issues they both agree on, rather than oppose the president in order to weaken him politically.\u00a0 A majority of Americans say possible Russia interference into the election is at least a serious matter for the country, but partisan division remains. Most Republicans continue to view the investigation as a political distraction, while most Democrats see it as a critical issue of national security. \u00a0 This poll was conducted by telephone September 21-24, 2017 among a random sample of 1,202 adults nationwide.\u00a0 Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Glen Mills, PA.\u00a0 Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones.\u00a0 The poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone.\u00a0 Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers.\u00a0 The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables. The sample included additional interviews conducted with African Americans, who had previously completed a survey as part of a random sample. The combined African American and non-African American samples were weighted separately to match their group's population characteristics such as gender, age, education, region, marital status and phone use based on recent U.S. Census estimates.\u00a0 The samples were then combined and weighted to the total U.S. adult population. The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample could be plus or minus three percentage points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request. The margin of error includes the effects of standard weighting procedures which enlarge sampling error slightly.\u00a0 This poll release conforms to the Standards of Disclosure of the National Council on Public Polls.

            "article_content": "WOODBRIDGE, Va.\u00a0--\u00a0Ahead of President Trump's Tuesday announcement where he is expected to terminate the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, a group of young, undocumented immigrants are trying to rally support and convince others why they should be allowed to stay in the United States.   Siblings Angel, 19, and Jennifer Romero, 20, went door-to-door in the pouring Virginia rain Saturday in order to advocate for DACA, the 2012 executive order penned by the Obama Administration that deferred deportation for two years and granted options for higher education and work permits to undocumented young people in the U.S. Now five years after DACA's rollout, the fate of both the program and undocumented families rests with President Trump's determination of whether DACA should be renewed, relinquished to Congress for a possible permanent legislative fix, or repealed altogether.   The worst option, according to the Romeros, would be any diminishment of DACA.   This possibility has motivated the Romeros and their fellow canvassers at CASA In Action, an organization that advocates for pro-immigrant policies and politicians, to trek through their neighborhoods and to advocate on behalf of the almost 800,000 \"Dreamers\" who were brought into the U.S. illegally as children by their parents.  CBS News went along with the Romeros, who came into the U.S. as toddlers from Mexico, and their canvassing companion, Francisco Lasso, 25, originally from Ecuador, as they all rung doorbells and rapped doors to remind their fellow Virginians to vote in the upcoming elections.   While this is their job, the Romeros and Lasso told CBS News the impending decision has created a sense of urgency and has recently motivated them and several other Dreamers to knock on an estimated 10,000 doors. \"As a DACA recipient, I can't vote but this is my vote per se,\" Angel told CBS News. \"Going out to canvass, knocking on doors, it is kind of my way of informing people who can vote,\" he said.   Jennifer said that a DACA dismissal would mean that all three of the DACA canvassers would lose their jobs.  Lasso told CBS News that his online university studies, which he called \"the best opportunity,\" would cease alongside the DACA program. \u00a0  When asked last week if young people like this small group should be worried, the president said, \"We love the Dreamers. We love everybody,\" and later added, \"I think the Dreamers are terrific.\" CBS News asked the Romeros and Lasso what they would say to the president before his ultimate decision. \"Mr. Trump, you've said you have a heart, you say you are going to treat this [decision] with heart, this is a chance to share your heart. Prove you have a heart and that you do care,\" Angel said.  For Jennifer and Lasso, they said that they would tell the president that their aim is to contribute to this country.  Jennifer said she wants to join the military -- specifically, the Marines -- and then jumpstart a career as a teacher.   \"We are not breaking any rules. We are not doing anything bad,\" Lasso asserted. \"We are just trying to find our voice and make a better life in this country.\"  These canvassers' calls have been echoed across the political spectrum from the U.S. Conference of Mayors to House Speaker Paul Ryan. Angel said he recognizes that the DACA executive order was a temporary solution to a problem that could plague his whole life. He said he is encouraged by the outpouring of support on Capitol Hill but he hopes that the president will see what he does: his American values.  Soaking wet from an afternoon of door knocking, Angel avowed, \"I am an American in every way except for on a piece of paper.\"  The Romeros and Lasso said that they plan to travel to the front of the White House on Tuesday before Mr. Trump makes his expected final DACA decision.  Until then, these Dreamers said they will continue to knock on doors -- rain or shine. ",

            "article_content": "President Trump's support and opposition falls into four groups, as the CBS News Nation Tracker has shown over the course of the year. CBS News' polling unit has explored each group's attitudes and views on the president, and here we're taking a closer look at their demographics \u2013 who they are, and where we find them, using more conventional labels. First, here's an overview: The president has both loyal backers (\"I am a strong Trump supporter, period\") whom we have labeled \"Believers,\" as well as more transactional supporters who say he has to deliver what they want to keep their support. This second group we're calling \"Conditionals.\"\u00a0 Then there are the opponents who could turn into supporters if Mr. Trump reaches out to them. These we've labeled them the \"Curious.\" Lately they have been trending away from the president, feeling that he has not earned their support. Finally, there are the \"Resisters,\" who are the four in ten Americans saying they firmly oppose President Trump. Their numbers have grown slowly but steadily over the last six months. Believers are President Trump's staunchest supporters and include almost one in five Americans. They tend to be on the older side, with three in four aged 45 or over a third 65 or over. A third are retired. Believers are the least racially diverse group. Over eight in ten are white. Geographically, almost half live in the South, a region that went heavily for Trump in the election, and three in ten live in rural areas. About four in ten identify as born again Christians. These identities are important to them: in the most recent survey, this group is the most likely to feel that the President is fighting and standing up for their culture and way of life, and also working for people of their faith, as much as their economic class. This sentiment is mixed with strong conservativism. Believers are most likely to call themselves \"very conservative,\" and twice as likely to do so as other Trump supporters, more of whom call themselves \"somewhat\" conservative. Their conservatism extends into today's top policy debates. Believers are the least likely group to view health care as a right \u2013 most say health care is a service to be purchased like any other. (In the rest of the country, a three-to-one majority takes the opposite view, saying healthcare is a right that everyone deserves.) Their view seems to be based more on principle, as nearly half receive health insurance primarily through Medicare and Medicaid, the highest proportion in any group. Conditionals currently support President Trump, but they say that he has to deliver what they want to keep them. This group makes up nearly a quarter of the public. They are similar to Believers in that eight in ten are white, and geographically, with a similarly sized plurality residing in the South and three in ten living in rural areas. On the other hand, Conditionals tend to be younger than Believers are. Four in ten are under 45; only 21 percent are seniors. They are more likely to get their health insurance through an employer than through government programs. While more than a third identify as born again, they are overall less likely than Believers to say that religion is \"very important\" in their lives. Conditionals tend to be more economically focused than culturally focused, which may partially stem from being younger and less religious. Younger adults face greater economic difficulties, such as unemployment and student debt, than older generations, according to recent research. Along these lines, Conditionals are less confident than Believers are that the American Dream is still achievable, and more likely to say circumstances and opportunities determine outcomes more than hard work and effort do. Only half say the economy is better than it was one year ago, compared to over eight in ten Believers. And three quarters say that if President Trump does not fix the economy, he would lose some or all of their support. Conditionals are also much less likely than Believers to say that their culture and way of life have become safer since President Trump took office. They are more mixed on social issues like Mr. Trump's transgender ban in the military. They are warmer towards immigrants and more likely to describe their general viewpoint as \"moderate\". The Curious are currently against President Trump but are willing to reconsider him if he does a good job. This group is approximately one sixth of the country. They are the youngest of the four groups, with 59 percent under 45 and almost a third under 30. They are also the least likely group to be covered by health insurance. By a large margin, they want to see Republicans and Democrats work together to improve Obamacare. The Curious are also the most racially diverse of the four groups. Only half are white, with 17 percent Hispanic and 17 percent black. The non-white Curious feel that Trump does not speak for people like them and that, if anything, he is working against their racial group. The Curious are also the only group more likely to live in cities (four in ten do) than in suburbs or rural areas. A quarter live in the Northeast, and a fifth live in the West. This group's demographic profile has political consequences. First, their diversity is associated with more positive views about immigrants \u2013 nearly half say immigration makes society better in the long run, and six in ten are opposed to a U.S.-Mexico border wall. They also feel warmer towards Muslims than either group of Trump supporters. Second, the relative youth of the Curious likely contributes to their lack of partisan loyalty and political engagement. They are the least likely group to have voted, with more than half doubting the efficacy of voting (\"Whoever you vote for, things go on pretty much the same\"). This group is also the only one in which a majority feel that political opponents nonetheless share many other values and goals. They are less polarized, leaving them more in play politically, and possibly more open to supporting Trump. They are largely self-described \"moderates\" and more than half would consider voting for a Republican in 2018, though probably someone independent from Trump, rather than someone in line with him. Resisters, who are strongly against President Trump, are by far the largest group, comprising more than four in ten people nationwide. Like the Curious, they tend to be racially diverse and young. Over half are under 45, over a quarter under 30. They also have the most women of any group, at 56 percent female. Like the Curious, many of them are in cities, but more live in the suburbs. Only a third live in the South \u2013 the lowest proportion of any group \u2013 with the rest evenly spread out between the Northeast, Midwest, and West. Unlike the Curious, Resisters are politically engaged and much more polarized. More than any other group, they rely on newspapers for political news and information. More than half have shared their political opinion on social media, such as Facebook and Twitter. Half call themselves \"somewhat\" or \"very\" liberal, which is twice as high as the national average. And eight in ten say that political fights today are a fundamental matter of how our democracy works. They primarily receive health insurance through Medicare or Medicaid, and one third are covered by an employer. Nearly six in ten report having a preexisting condition. Nearly nine in ten view healthcare as a right that everyone deserves. People's financial situation bears little on which of the four groups they identify with. In terms of family income, for example, Believers and Resisters are not so different, nor are Conditionals and the Curious. There is a bit of a difference in terms of formal education, with the Believers and Conditionals being less likely than the Curious and Resisters to hold a college degree.",

            "article_content": "The Trump administration faced a busy weekend, even as Tropical Storm Harvey\u00a0devastated millions of Texas residents. Here's some of the major political news you may have missed while keeping up with the storm. President Trump pardoned former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio Friday shortly after being advised against it. White House lawyers suggested refraining from the Arpaio pardon until after he is sentenced for contempt.  \"Throughout his time as Sheriff, Arpaio continued his life's work of protecting the public from the scourges of crime and illegal immigration,\" reads a statement from the White House released Friday. Later, Mr. Trump added in a tweet that Arpaio \"kept Arizona safe!\" I am pleased to inform you that I have just granted a full Pardon to 85 year old American patriot Sheriff Joe Arpaio. He kept Arizona safe! Arpaio was awaiting sentencing after he was convicted of criminal contempt last month. He was found guilty of disproportionately targeting Latinos through traffic patrols in his Arizona county.  \"I feel very privileged for the president to issue this... pardon,\" Arpaio told CBS affiliate KPHO. \"He's a big supporter of law enforcement. I know it came from his heart.\" Deputy Assistant to the President Sebastian Gorka left the Trump administration Friday, CBS News confirmed.  Several sources familiar with the matter said that Gorka expressed \"dissatisfaction with the current state of the administration\" in a letter to Mr. Trump prior to his resignation. The letter also cites Mr. Trump's recent speech on strategy in the war in Afghanistan as a reason for his frustration at the White House.  A White House official said that Gorka had not resigned, while confirming that he no longer works at the White House. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is now examining the role former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn\u00a0may have played in an attempt to get hacked Hillary Clinton emails from Russian hackers, according to reports.  Mueller, who was appointed to investigate possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, will investigate whether or not Flynn had a part in attempts to obtain the former Democratic presidential candidate's emails from Russian hackers, according to the Wall Street Journal. In June, the WSJ reported that a Republican activist named\u00a0Peter W. Smith\u00a0believed that Russian hackers may have acquired thousands of Hillary Clinton's emails, which she said were personal and had been deleted. Smith said he had been in contact with five groups of hackers, two of whom he believed to be composed of Russians. Smith suggested that he had Flynn's support in these efforts. Mueller has recently issued grand jury subpoenas to public relations executives connected to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.  A source familiar with the matter confirmed the existence of the subpoenas to CBS News. This comes after an FBI raid of Manafort's home last month provided the investigation with a variety of records.  The PR executives worked on a Ukrainian lobbying campaign organized by Manafort. Mueller's team will focus on Manafort's lobbying efforts between 2012 and 2014 for a pro-Russian Ukrainian political party, his offshore banking and some of his financial dealings. Mr. Trump signed a memo Friday directing the Department of Defense to renew the ban on transgender military recruiting and outlining other restrictions relating to transgender military service members. The formal guidelines include: The guidelines are a step back from the president's announcement in a tweet last month that transgender individuals would not be allowed to serve in \"any capacity\" in the United States military. Sunday morning, the president engaged in a tweet storm regarding the U.S.-Mexico border.  \"With Mexico being one of the highest crime Nations in the world, we must have THE WALL. Mexico will pay for it through reimbursement/other,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a tweet.\u00a0 With Mexico being one of the highest crime Nations in the world, we must have THE WALL. Mexico will pay for it through reimbursement/other. He followed up by threatening to terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), calling it the \"worst trade deal ever made\" and adding that both Mexico and Canada are \"being very difficult\" in the renegotiation process.\u00a0 We are in the NAFTA (worst trade deal ever made) renegotiation process with Mexico & Canada.Both being very difficult,may have to terminate? In response, Mexico's foreign ministry released its own statement saying the country \"will not pay, under any circumstances, for a wall or physical barrier built on U.S. territory along the Mexican border.\" It went on to add that Mexico won't renegotiate NAFTA over social media, and said of the president's language on drug trafficking problems in Mexico that the U.S. shares the responsibility, given the high demand for illegal drugs in the U.S. Blair Guild is a politics reporter and video producer for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "John Kasich's bid for the presidency went nowhere in 2016, but he's good at keeping his name out there, and sure enough we're all talking about him again.  Or at least those of us in the media are talking about him. I personally haven't met many people outside of the press or the state of Ohio who think much about him either way, or even know how to pronounce his name. Still, we're going to be hearing it periodically over the next two years as he mulls a 2020 bid, in which he'll probably run as either a Republican or an independent.  It's hard to see him getting to the White House on either track, but it's the former option that will probably propel him nowhere at a faster clip. A Republican primary challenge against Donald Trump will get Kasich a lot of TV appearances. But even if we assume Trump remains unpopular, and probably gets a bit more so over the next couple years, Kasich will still find himself facing down essentially impossible odds.  For one thing, Kasich would be running against Trump as a centrist. Kasich is in many ways quite conservative, particularly on social issues like guns and abortion. However, that's belied by his habit of speaking like a noble Republican character on an Aaron Sorkin show, which no doubt assists in his appeal to the national press, and his discomfort with cutting government assistance programs in Ohio.  So while he's an awkward moderate in some ways, that's the part he's been cast in, and the part he seems eager to play. He'll complain about Trump's tone and his rhetoric, which is the easy path to respectability for a Republican under this president. But Trump's feral performances on the stump are what endeared him to many in the GOP rank-and-file, so attacks on that front are likely to be a non-starter in a Republican primary. Many of their voters like that he sounds like that.  This is a major problem for all the would-be Republican saviors of the Trump era, from Kasich to Ben Sasse to Ted Cruz. Unlike Trump, these are all people who came up within the Party, who learned its ways and more or less earned their promotions. Trump did not. He understood that what the GOP really wants from its leaders\u00a0is confrontation and rants about perfidious elites. They want entertainment, and he's delivering. Trump understood all that because he is, at heart, a cynic. The problem Kasich and company have, in part, is that deep down they really believed Republican voters liked hearing highfalutin stuff about the Founders, mediating institutions, personal responsibility, and the joys of an unfettered free market.  Perhaps they once did, but Trump's realization was that by 2016 most Republican voters were as dependent on the government as anyone else. Meanwhile, Republican lifers like Paul Ryan were and are still convinced their voters can be sold on cuts to Medicare. Trump looked at the GOP from without and saw its true and anxious self; meanwhile, the guys on the inside had totally deluded themselves as to what their party was all about.  This raises another question for anyone thinking of mounting a primary challenge against Trump: How does someone get to his right? What does that mean? What does that even look like?  If you're mounting a primary challenge against any incumbent, much less a president, you don't want to run at them from the center \u2013 you run at them from the base, where the voters are. So if you're challenging a fellow Republican, you always go at them from the right. For a long time, this was simple enough. The right of the spectrum meant a belief in small government, cultural conservatism, lower taxes, more guns, etc. Then Trump came along and scrambled the math.  Trump took a deviationist stance during the primaries, particularly on economic issues. He ran as a candidate skeptical of trade, agnostic on low marginal tax rates for the rich, and against reforming entitlement programs.  He also ran with the sound and attitude of a culture warrior, albeit one attuned to the realities of 21st century America. He didn't really talk about Jesus or God's love or anything like that; he didn't need to, because cultural conservatism had become unmoored from orthodox Christianity. The cultural issues they cared most about now \u2013 immigration, guns, smug elites \u2013 are the ones he focused on.  It would be hard for any candidate to get to Trump's right on most cultural issues. On economic issues, there is quite a bit of room, assuming you want to challenge him as a kind of libertarian who wants to reform entitlements and reduce trade barriers.  But that obscures what has been a major political accomplishment for Trump, which is redefining what Republicanism and conservatism mean in America. Anything Trump says is now broadly understood to be the most allowable right-wing position.  In 2017, and into the foreseeable future, being a conservative Republican tends to mean liking and supporting Trump, regardless of whether the president adopts a philosophically conservative stance.  This is disorienting for Trump's opponents within the GOP, in part because they know they can never get to Trump's right. They know the most conservative position on any issue is understood to be the one that escapes his mouth. Mounds of conservative philosophical tracts can be invalidated and deemed heretical by no more than a Trump tweet.  That's a tragedy for the conservative ideologues who until recently ran the GOP, which is the Party of Trump now. Assuming he runs in 2020, he will be the Republican nominee, because he's the man who speaks in its voters' current voice.\u00a0 Will Rahn is a political correspondent and managing director, politics, for CBS News Digital.",

You know, John and I are not hung up about who wins, who loses, who gets credit, who doesn't because as a governor you can't spend a lot of time doing that, said Kasich.\u00a0 He added, \"The American people want things to function. And they can function. If you don't worry about which party gets the credit or which politician gets the credit, it can work.\" According to Axios' reporting, the two are planing to extend their joint platform to policy areas like immigration and job creation. \u00a0 But both of them have dispelled the notion of a \"unity ticket\" to challenge President Donald Trump. Hickenlooper\u00a0told the Denver Post, \"It's fun to talk about, but it's not in the cards.\" \"We're in a two-party system, and that kind of a campaign generally distracts. It's symbolic, and I can understand the point of that,\" he added. Kasich said in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper that he had \u00a0\"no plans to do anything\" like challenge Mr. Trump, and instead says he's \"rooting\" for the president to \"get it together.\" The two sitting governors would both bring years of experience on the state level and policy work to the White House if their rumored run turned into a reality. Kasich, who served nine terms in the House, has been in his role as governor of Ohio since 2010. While Hickenlooper, who is term-limited and will leave office in 2018, has evolved from businessman to politician -- serving two terms as Denver's mayor and has been Colorado's governor since 2011.\u00a0 This would be Kasich's second stab at a presidential race since the 2016 campaign.\u00a0 CBS News' John Bat contributed to this report.\u00a0 Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump's widely criticized response to white supremacist violence in Virginia has left Democrats in a quandary: how to seize the moral high ground without getting sucked into a politically perilous culture war. Democrats have denounced Mr. Trump for blaming \"both sides\" for deadly protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, and, more recently, for defending Confederate monuments. But the party faces a complex task: While addressing race and history in ways that reflect the party's values, Democrats also need to focus on issues like jobs and the economy that resonate with a wider range of voters, including white independents, ahead of the 2018 midterm election. The party has been looking to answer Mr. Trump's populism by crafting its own middle-class brand, yet Democratic leaders across multiple states now are pushing to take down Old South monuments like the one that ostensibly sparked the events in Charlottesville, and three rank-and-file House Democrats want to pursue a congressional censure of the president. The differences among Democrats were evident in Congress. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California called for \"reprehensible\" Confederate monuments to be removed from the Capitol. Her Senate counterpart, Chuck Schumer of New York, said the focus should remain on Mr. Trump's refusal to single out neo-Nazis and other white supremacists. In interviews this week before his resignation was announced Friday, White House strategist Steve Bannon gleefully suggested Democrats are falling into a trap. \"I want them to talk about racism every day,\" Bannon told The American Prospect, a liberal magazine. \"If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\" Mr. Trump himself has called Confederate memorials, most of them actually erected decades after the Civil War, \"beautiful statues\" that reflect \"our nation's history and culture.\" Polls taken after last weekend's violence offer some evidence backing Bannon's and Mr. Trump's view. While polls found widespread disgust with white supremacists, a Marist Poll for NPR and PBS found that just 27 percent of adults queried believe Confederate monuments \"should be removed because they are offensive.\" About two out of three white and Latino respondents said they should remain, as did 44 percent of black respondents. Andrew Young, a Democrat, civil rights leader and former U.N. ambassador, warned this week that the monuments are \"a distraction.\" He told reporters in Atlanta it is \"too costly to refight the Civil War.\" Boyd Brown of South Carolina, a former state lawmaker and onetime member of the Democratic National Committee, says Democrats are right to oppose Confederate monuments and criticize Mr. Trump's remarks. \"He tweets something crazy, we react \u2014 and we're not wrong,\" Brown said. But \"we have to talk about a lack of jobs and education in poor districts, voter suppression laws. Ask why Medicaid funding is always the target. And then explain how all those things hurt more than just African-Americans.\" Mr. Trump upset Democrat Hillary Clinton on the strength of his support from white voters, particularly working-class whites who possessed a combination of economic frustration and racial resentments salved by mr. Trump's promises of immigration controls, law-and-order and a booming economy. Clinton, meanwhile, concentrated so much on Mr. Trump's deficiencies and outlandish statements that her own policy proposals received less attention. That's a problem that has beset Mr. Trump rivals since he first declared his candidacy: All the attention focused on Mr. Trump \u2014 even unflattering stories \u2014 prevent them from getting out their own messages. Brian Fallon, who was spokesman for Clinton's campaign, said Democrats shouldn't let that happen after Charlottesville. \"As horrifying as what the president has said is, you have to have an affirmative agenda,\" he said. Still, Fallon praised Democratic efforts to keep Mr. Trump and Republicans on the defensive over the president's response \u2014 even if it doesn't help them politically. Democrats have tried various tactics to press the Charlottesville issue. Besides the push to censure Mr. Trump and remove monuments, they are planning voter organization drives across the United States. Andrew Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, Florida, and candidate for governor, is among the Democrats calling for monuments to be moved to museums or cemeteries. Gillum, who is black, says Democrats must argue \"these monuments have been weaponized. We can't pretend that didn't happen.\" The issue is reminiscent of South Carolina's decision to remove the Confederate battle flag from statehouse grounds in 2015 after a white gunman killed nine people at a historic black church in Charleston. Then-Gov. Nikki Haley, a Republican who is now Trump's United Nations ambassador, declared the flag untenably divisive after the wide distribution of photos showing the killer clutching it. \"She was focused on leading the state through a grieving process so it could begin healing,\" recalls Rob Godfrey, one of her top aides at the time. But Godfrey notes Haley never considered jettisoning other Old South relics. \"That was going to drive people apart,\" Godfrey says.",

            "article_content": "Shortly after his inauguration, President Donald Trump told a group of business leaders that \"there are some really exciting times ahead.\" This may not be exactly what Corporate America had in mind. Following Mr. Trump's handling of the violence and terror attack in Charlottesville, Virginia, Merck CEO Ken Frazier said he could no longer serve on the president's manufacturing advisory council. A cascading number of CEOs and industry leaders soon joined him, including the CEOs of Campbell Soup and 3M.\u00a0 Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both. Thank you all! Mr. Trump responded on Wednesday by announcing in a tweet that he is disbanding the manufacturing council and his strategy and policy forum, which is another CEO-heavy advisory board.\u00a0 The decision follows two bruising days for Mr. Trump, who had portrayed himself as a pro-business president. On Tuesday, AFL-CIO president\u00a0Richard Trumka\u00a0and his deputy chief of staff Thea Lee issued a statement saying they could not serve on a council for \"a President who tolerates bigotry and domestic terrorism.\" 3M (MMM) CEO Inge Thulin stepped down from the manufacturing council on Wednesday. In a statement, he noted he had joined to \"advocate for policies that align with our values\" such as diversity and inclusion, as well as to promote investment and job growth. He added he felt the council is \"no longer an effective vehicle for 3M to advance these goals.\" Still, not every CEO on the council stepped down before Mr. Trump called the whole thing off. Walmart (WMT) CEO Doug McMillon on Wednesday also rebuked him for missing \"a critical opportunity to help bring our country together by unequivocally rejecting the appalling actions of white supremacists.\" Likewise, Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky said he would remain in his advisory role because the company \"has a responsibility to remain engaged.\" At the start of Mr. Trump's presidency, corporate leaders had high hopes the real estate mogul would follow through on a series of pro-business promises, ranging from lowering the corporate tax rate to revving up economic growth. And even before his inauguration, Mr. Trump showed an unusual willingness to both publicly praise and excoriate companies, not hesitating to unload on CEOs who displeased him. That rhetorical cudgel earned Mr. Trump a healthy measure of respect, and even fear. But that testy relationship appears to be changing.\u00a0 pic.twitter.com/9uYGTu04WP \"The fact that CEOs are leaving a prestigious White House council that could do them some good is a good indicator that they don't think this president will accomplish much,\" said Elaine Kamarck, founding director of The Brookings Institution's Center for Effective Public Management. \"A couple months ago he was a new president, and the expectation was he would grow into the job and that he would learn something. None of those things have happened.\" A number of prominent CEOs have also publicly taken issue with Mr. Trump on issues ranging from the administration's move to take the U.S. out of the Paris Accord, to immigration policy, to a ban on transgender people serving in the military.\u00a0 The power of Mr. Trump's tweets -- often directed in anger at those he feels have wronged him -- also appears to be fading.\u00a0 After his November electoral win, a critical tweet from Mr. Trump could send a company's stock spiraling downward. Lockheed Martin (LMT) shares lost more than 5 percent of their value in December when the president criticized the \"out of control\" costs for its F-35 jets. Manufacturer Rexnord saw its shares slip 2.5 percent after Mr. Trump attacked its plan to fire workers and outsource jobs to Mexico.\u00a0 Today, however, investors are less sensitive to his Twitter-finger. On Monday, the president mocked Merck CEO Ken Frazier after the drugmaker chief said he'd step down from his advisory role on the manufacturing council. In his tweet, Mr. Trump said Frazier would now have more time to \"lower ripoff drug prices.\" Merck shareholders shrugged off the abuse. The stock has increased about 0.3 percent since the close of trading on Friday.\u00a0 \"The business community, especially people who are successful CEOs, evaluate people not on ideology but accomplishments -- does the guy or gal have capacity?\" Karmarck said. \"He hasn't had a major legislative achievement.\" To be sure, there are still plenty of top CEOs who had remained on Mr. Trump's business and manufacturing councils, including Walmart's McMillon, who explained in his statement he believes \"we should stay engaged to try to influence decisions in a positive way and help bring people together.\" For every CEO that drops out of the Manufacturing Council, I have many to take their place. Grandstanders should not have gone on. JOBS! Others who remain on the councils include Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman. Mr. Trump said in a tweet on Tuesday that he has \"many\" CEOs in the wings waiting to take a spot on his manufacturing council if one of them drops out. \"Grandstanders should not have gone on,\" he added. The executives' decision about whether to stick around may be influenced by another important constituency: their customers. Campbell Soup, for one, is the focus of a call-in campaign from consumers who had urged CEO Denise Morrison to step down from her Trump advisory role. Twitter users added the hashtag #SoupNazi. Morrison said she would step down on Wednesday, shortly before Mr. Trump dissolved the council.\u00a0 Hey @Campbells wanna get off that Advisory board NOW? #SoupNazi Companies that\u00a0remain publicly aligned with the Trump administration may be concerned about another group: the so-called heartland consumers, or Americans who live in Southwestern, Midwestern and Southeastern states such as Ohio and Missouri. These consumers aren't as keyed into political issues and are more concerned with earning and saving money, said Jordan Cohen, chief marketing officer of Fluent, a marketing company.\u00a0 \"There is a lot of talk about the disconnect between the big brands in the aftermath of the election and how can we connect with the heartland consumer,\" he said. Companies that back out of Mr. Trump's councils run the risk of playing into the president's playbook by allowing him to take potshots on issues like drug pricing, which his core supporters do care about, he added.\u00a0 \"There might be a bigger risk in alienating their own employees than any ramifications to the business in selling to heartlanders,\" Cohen added. \"It turns into an internal PR nightmare when your own colleague base is in opposition to a president you don't support.\"",

            "article_content": "President Trump's frustration with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto's public denials that Mexico would pay for Mr. Trump's southern border wall was on display in a transcript of the leaders' January phone call, acquired and released by the Washington Post. \"You cannot say that to the press,\" Trump said repeatedly to Pe\u00f1a Nieto in response to his public outcries over refusing to fund the border wall, according to a transcript of the Jan. 27 call obtained by The Post. \"If you are going to say that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then I do not want to meet with you guys anymore because I cannot live with that,\" Mr. Trump added.\u00a0 The Post published the transcript of the call, which it said had been prepared by the White House but not released. The transcripts were reportedly based on records kept by White House notetakers who monitored Mr. Trump's phone calls. The transcript expands on previous reporting about the tense call\u00a0between the two back in January, as well as his past exchanges with Pe\u00f1a Nieto during the campaign trail. The president described his major campaign promise to build a \"big, beautiful wall\" as \"the least important thing we are talking about, but politically this might be the most important.\" \"On the wall, you and I both have a political problem,\" Mr. Trump said. \"My people stand up and say, 'Mexico will pay for the wall,' and your people probably say something in a similar but slightly different language.\" \"I have to have Mexico pay for the wall -- I have to,\" he pressed. \"I have been talking about it for a two-year period.\" His reasoning for why Mexico should pay was that it had \"made a fortune out of the stupidity of U.S. trade representatives. They are beating us at trade and they are beating us at the border, and they are killing us with drugs.\" While acknowledging that Pe\u00f1a Nieto was \"not involved with that,\" Mr. Trump said that nonetheless, all of the billions of dollars made through drug trafficking \"is bigger than the business of taking our factory jobs.\" During the call, the president placed much of the blame for America's drug crisis on Mexican drug lords who \"are sending drugs to Chicago, Los Angeles, and to New York.\" \"We have a massive drug problem where kids are becoming addicted to drugs because the drugs are being sold for less money than candy,\" Mr. Trump said. He also claimed, \"I won New Hampshire because New Hampshire is a drug-infested den.\" (In fact, Mr. Trump did not win New Hampshire in the presidential election, although he did win the New Hampshire GOP primary.) The president suggested that the Mexican military is \"afraid of\" the drug lords, \"but our military is not afraid of them,\" and he offered to send U.S. help to Mexico. Pe\u00f1a Nieto agreed that the two countries should work together but countered that drug trafficking in Mexico is \"largely supported by the illegal amounts of money and weapons coming from the United States.\" Mr. Trump continued, pressing Pe\u00f1a Nieto to coordinate their messaging on the wall's funding, saying, \"[W]hat I would like to recommend is -- if we are going to have continued dialogue -- we will work out the wall,\" Mr. Trump told him. \"They are going to say, 'Who is going to pay for the wall, Mr. President?' to both of us, and we should both say, 'we will work it out.'\" The president tried to assure his Mexican counterpart that the funding \"will work out in the formula somehow. As opposed to you saying, 'We will not pay,' and me saying, 'We will not pay.'\" Ultimately Pe\u00f1a Nieto agreed that talking about the wall was counterproductive. \"Let us stop talking about who pays for the wall, talking about the wall in general, because I think there is a more creative way we can start looking for a solution,\" he told Mr. Trump. \"And it is the way we can remove the big block in our path.\" The Mexican Foreign Ministry had no comment about the Post's report. The House has since given tentative approval\u00a0to a $1.6 billion down payment for Mr. Trump's long-promised wall. The wall money is attached to defense spending legislation that has passed in the House.",

            "article_content": "More voters than ever are not satisfied with President Trump's job in office, according to new approval ratings released Wednesday.  A poll from Quinnipiac University found that only a third of American voters, 33 percent, approve of his performance in office, while 61 percent disapprove of it. This marks his lowest approval and highest disapproval number since he was inaugurated, Quinnipiac said.  His latest approval rating is down 7 percentage points from the 40 percent approval rating Mr. Trump received in a similar survey in late June.  Majorities of voters said that Mr. Trump is not honest, doesn't have good leadership skills, isn't a strong person, isn't intelligent, doesn't share their values and doesn't care about average Americans. Voters gave Mr. Trump negative approval ratings for handling key issues like foreign policy, the economy, immigration,\u00a0health care\u00a0and terrorism.  More than half of voters also said that the president \"has attempted to derail or obstruct the investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election.\" Nearly two-thirds said that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 election. Thirty percent of voters said that the president did something illegal in dealing with Russia, with another 30 percent saying he did something unethical but not illegal and 32 percent saying he did nothing wrong.  Gallup, meanwhile, said that the president's approval rating in their latest poll hit 36 percent, a new low, with 60 percent disapproving.  The Quinnipiac poll surveyed 1,125 voters between July 27 and August 1 nationwide with a 3.4 percentage point margin of error. The Gallup poll surveyed 1,500 adults on August 1 with a 3 percentage point margin of error.  Rebecca Shabad is a video reporter for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "He sure does. This is what he tweeted Monday: So why aren't the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations? Then this is what he tweeted Tuesday morning: Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump campaign - \"quietly working to boost Clinton.\" So where is the investigation A.G. @seanhannity Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers! To put an even finer point on it, newly installed White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci told radio host Hugh Hewitt that Mr. Trump wants Sessions to go during an interview Tuesday morning. When asked by Hewitt if Mr. Trump wants Sessions \"gone,\" Scaramucci replied, \"If there's this level of tension in the relationship, that's public then you're probably right.\" Mr. Trump reiterated that he was \"very disappointed\" in Sessions during a Tuesday press conference with Prime Minister Saad Hariri of Lebanon.He also said he wanted Sessions to be \"much tougher\" on leaks from the intelligence community, and \"time will tell\" if he remains Attorney General.\u00a0 Needless to say, it's is extremely unusual for a president to publicly attack his attorney general. And it is not normal for a president to seemingly call for the investigation and prosecution of his opponent.  Right. We all remember those \"lock her up!\" chants from his rallies. And during the second presidential debate in October, after Clinton said that it's \"just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of law and order in this country,\" Trump replied,\u00a0 \"Yeah, because you'd be in jail.\" However, Mr. Trump sang a different tune once he was actually elected president. He told The New York Times last November that \"not looking\" to push for any prosecution of Clinton, saying it would be \"very, very divisive for the country.\"  \"My inclination would be for whatever power I have on the matter is to say let's go forward,\" Mr. Trump said then, adding that he did not \"want to hurt the Clintons.\"\u00a0 It would seem that way.  This is a matter of some speculation, and theories abound. Some TV commenters friendly to Mr. Trump, particularly Fox News' Sean Hannity, have been calling for Clinton's prosecution for month. It's possible Mr. Trump has just changed his mind on the issue, or is just \"thinking aloud,\" as White House aide Kellyanne Conway told Breitbart on Tuesday.\u00a0 Kellyanne Conway on Trump\u2019s tweets about prosecuting Hillary: \u201cHe didn\u2019t change his mind, he\u2019s wondering out loud\u201d Then again, there are other issues to consider.  Special Counsel Robert Mueller, for one. Mueller is subordinate to the Justice Department, meaning he could be fired. But Sessions recused himself from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election that Mueller is now heading, meaning that Session can't fire Mueller.  Yes. Mr. Trump has made it clear how unhappy he is with Mueller's investigation, which has a broad mandate to look into and prosecute crimes. That means the investigation could go beyond the Russia matter and into business deals that Mr. Trump made as a private citizen. Eventually, yes. But Mr. Trump could appoint one while the Senate is in recess later this month, meaning a confirmation could be put off until January. That means Mr. Trump would be able to install someone willing and able to fire Mueller and worry about keeping the new Attorney General next year.  There are big political risks to firing Sessions. For one thing, Sessions is well-liked by Republican lawmakers, particularly in the Senate. Some Senate Republicans have already stepped up to defend Sessions, in fact. Plus, Sessions is respected by ideological conservatives you would think Mr. Trump wants to keep happy. And it would be seen as a profound act of disloyalty to Sessions, a noted immigration hawk who was the first Senator to endorse Mr. Trump during the Republican primaries.  Also, while Mr. Trump is famous for his \"you're fired!\" catchphrase, Mr. Trump has been deeply hesitant to fire anyone in his administration. He seems to prefer it when they just quit their jobs, as now-former Press Secretary Sean Spicer did last week.  Mr. Trump, however, left the door open to firing Sessions in a Tuesday interview with the Wall Street Journal. \"It's not like a great loyal thing about the endorsement,\" Mr. Trump told the paper. \"I'm very disappointed in Jeff Sessions.\" Not yet. According to CBS News' Paula Reid, he's just going about his business as if everything was normal.  Clearly he wants to, at least on some level. But given the risks, and Mr. Trump's hesitancy to fire anyone, it's pretty clear at this point he'd prefer if he just leaves on his own. That scenario, in theory, would also allow Mr. Trump to pass some level of blame for Mueller's firing onto someone else, namely the new Attorney General.  Depends. It might be the moment Mr. Trump's base, and Republican lawmakers en masse, turn on him. But they stuck with him, more or less, when former FBI Director James Comey was fired, and they might stick with him through this.  In any event, given that Republicans control both houses of Congress, the chance that Mr. Trump is impeached before next year's midterms is close to zero. Firing Sessions and/or Mueller would likely do great damage to his already testy relationship with Republican lawmakers, but there's not much evidence that Mr. Trump cares all that much about that relationship to begin with. \u00a0",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- President Trump has spoken with advisers about firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions as he continues to rage against Sessions' decision to recuse himself from all matters related to the Russia investigation, according to reports. The president's anger again bubbled into public view Monday as he referred to Sessions in a tweet as \"beleaguered.\" Privately, Mr. Trump has speculated aloud to allies in recent days about the potential consequences of firing Sessions, three people who have recently spoken to the president told The Associated Press. They demanded anonymity to discuss the private conversations. The Washington Post, citing people familiar with the talks, says \"some confidants\" are discussing possible replacements. Mr. Trump often talks about making staff changes without following through, so those who have spoken with the president cautioned that a change may not be imminent or happen at all. What is clear is that Mr. Trump remains furious that the attorney general recused himself from the investigations. \"So why aren't the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations?\" Mr. Trump tweeted Monday. His tweet came just hours before his son-in-law, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, traveled to Capitol Hill to be interviewed about his meetings with Russians. So why aren't the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations? Later, at a photo op with interns, the president was asked whether Sessions should resign. The president rolled his eyes. Mr. Trump's intensifying criticism has fueled speculation that Sessions may quit even if Mr. Trump opts not to fire him. During an event at the White House, Mr. Trump ignored a shouted question about whether Sessions should step down. But the attorney general said last week he intended to stay in his post, and CBS News Justice Department reporter Paula Reid says Sessions still has no plans to resign. The attorney general has been working seven days a week, and does not plan to take an August vacation, eschewing the custom of his two predecessors in the job. If Mr. Trump were to fire Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein would be elevated to the top post on an acting basis. That would leave the president with another attorney general of whom he has been sharply critical in both public and private for his handling of the Russia probe, according to four White House and outside advisers who, like others interviewed, spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. It could also raise the specter of Mr. Trump asking Rosenstein - or whomever he appoints to fill the position - to fire Robert Mueller, the special counsel leading the investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election and potential collusion with Mr. Trump's campaign. Rosenstein is the official who named Mueller to his special counsel post to begin with. The name of one longtime Trump ally, Rudy Giuliani, was floated Monday as a possible replacement for Sessions, but a person who recently spoke to the former New York City mayor said Giuliani hadn't been approached about the position. Giuliani told CNN Monday he didn't want the post and would have recused himself had he been in Sessions' position. Another name that's come up as a possibler replacement is that of Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, but his office issued a statement saying, \"Jeff Sessions is a friend and a strong conservative.\u00a0 I was proud to vote to confirm Jeff and to vigorously defend his confirmation, and I'm deeply gratified that we have a principled conservative like Jeff Sessions serving as Attorney General.\u00a0 The stories being reported in the media tonight are false. My focus is and will remain on fighting every day to defend 28 million Texans in the U.S. Senate.\" The president's tweet about the former Alabama senator comes less than a week after Mr. Trump, in a New York Times interview, said Sessions should never have taken the job as attorney general if he was going to recuse himself. Sessions made that decision after it was revealed that he had met with a top Russian diplomat last year. Mr. Trump has seethed about Sessions' decision for months, viewing it as disloyal - arguably the most grievous offense in the president's mind - and resenting that the attorney general didn't give the White House a proper heads-up before making the announcement that he would recuse himself. His fury has been fanned by several close confidants - including his son, Donald Mr. Trump Jr., who is also ensnared in the Russia probe - who are angry that Sessions made his decision. Mr. Trump and Sessions' conversations in recent weeks have been infrequent. Sessions had recently asked senior White House staff how he might patch up relations with the president but that effort did not go anywhere, according to a person briefed on the conversations. Newt Gingrich, a frequent Trump adviser, said the president, with his criticisms of Sessions, was simply venting and being \"honest about his feelings. But that doesn't mean he's going to do anything.\" Still, he said the president's comments would have repercussions when it comes to staff morale. \"Anybody who is good at team building would suggest to the president that attacking members of your team rattles the whole team,\" Gingrich said. Sessions and Mr. Trump used to be close, sharing both a friendship and an ideology. Sessions risked his reputation when he became the first U.S. senator to endorse the celebrity businessman and his early backing gave Mr. Trump legitimacy, especially among the hard-line anti-immigration forces that bolstered his candidacy. Several of Sessions' top aides now serve in top administration posts, including Stephen Miller, the architect of several of Mr. Trump's signature proposals, including the travel ban and tough immigration policy.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Armand DeKeyser, who worked closely with Sessions and became his chief of staff in the Senate, said he didn't see the attorney general as someone who would easily cave to criticism, even from the president. \"If Jeff thinks he is in an untenable position and cannot be an effective leader, I believe he would leave,\" DeKeyser said. \"But I don't think he's reached that point.\" But Anthony Scaramucci, the president's new communications director, said it's time for Mr. Trump and Sessions to hash out a resolution, regardless of what they decide. \"My own personal opinion, I think they've got to have a meeting and have a reconciliation one way or another. You know what I mean? Either stay or go, one way or another,\" he said. The Justice Department declined to comment",

            "article_content": "NEW YORK - Last winter, the U.S. tourism industry fretted that Trump administration policies might lead to a \"Trump slump\" in travel. But those fears may have been premature. International arrivals and travel-related spending are up in 2017 compared with the same period in 2016. There might even be a \"Trump bump,\" said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, a nonprofit representing the travel industry. A few months ago, Dow and others warned that President Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric and ban on travel from a handful of mostly Muslim countries could send an anti-tourism message. But \"impending doom hasn't manifested itself,\" Dow said in an interview. \"Right now we cannot identify a loss. It's contrary to everything we've heard, but travel is in slightly better shape than it was a year ago. Everyone wants me to tell the story of the sky is falling, but for the travel industry, the sky is not falling.\" Latest numbers from the U.S. Travel Association's Travel Trends Index showed 6.6 percent growth in international travel to the U.S. in April and 5 percent growth in May compared with the same months last year. The Travel Trends Index uses hotel, airline and U.S. government data. Individual sectors have good news, too. Hotel occupancy for the first five months of 2017 was \"higher than it has ever been before,\" said Jan Freitag, senior vice president with STR, which tracks hotel industry data. American Express Meetings & Events has \"not seen a slowdown in either domestic U.S. meetings or international meetings from the U.S. in the past six months,\" according to senior vice president Issa Jouaneh.  Even New York's National September 11 Memorial and Museum has more international visitors: 554,381 at the museum Jan. 1-July 11, up from 517,539 the same period last year. Florida's Orlando International Airport, a gateway for theme park visitors, reported growth for domestic and international passengers year-to-date, though Visit Orlando CEO George Aguel said it was \"still premature to determine a specific impact\" from Trump administration policies. International trips are often planned months in advance, so decisions made this year about travel may not be evident yet. \"For us, we already planned before the election,\" said Alban Michel, waiting with a group of Swiss tourists to see One World Trade's observatory in New York on Monday. Companies that track online behavior say searches for U.S. travel are down. Yet tour companies that bring foreigners here are \"not only holding year-over-year, but in many cases they're having a record year,\" according to Chris Thompson, CEO of Brand USA, which markets the U.S. to the world. Thompson thinks it's \"too early to tell\" how the travel industry will fare, adding that its ups and downs may have \"little or nothing to do\" with President Donald Trump and more to do with the strong dollar and lackluster economies elsewhere. Asked if there's a \"Trump slump\" in travel to the 12 Southern states marketed by Travel South USA, CEO Liz Bittner said, \"The truth of the matter is no. I think it was a lot of media hype.\" Bittner agreed that the challenge for U.S. tourism \"isn't so much Trump. It's the strong U.S. dollar against some of the other currencies,\" which makes the U.S. an expensive destination for foreigners. Daniele Biron, an Italian visiting the 9/11 memorial Monday while in New York for a conference, agreed that \"the value of the dollar\" is a factor for many travelers, but \"I don't know if the politics\" matter to most visitors. Isabelle Bornemann, owner of Alaska Travel Connections, said her international group bookings are down 30 percent, mainly because of the strong dollar. But some European travel agencies tell Bornemann the decision to stay away is political, based on the perception that foreigners aren't welcome in the U.S. Charlie Mallar, owner of the 1785 Inn in Conway, New Hampshire, had his busiest July 4th weekend in 34 years, but he said \"foreign visitors were off a bit -- Trump effect. We have to assure foreign visitors that they are welcome in America.\" The Travel Trends Index predicts slower growth for the rest of 2017, but still nearly 2 percent higher than last year through November. New York City's tourism agency, NYC & Co., predicts that 300,000 fewer international travelers will visit the city this year than last, according to spokesman Chris Heywood. It's due to concerns about the Trump administration's policies include \"rhetoric surrounding the travel ban, laptop bans on certain airline carriers and the threat of having visitors reveal social media accounts,\" along with \"the lack of a proactive welcome message on behalf of the nation,\" Heywood said.  New York has put up its own signs saying \"New York City -- Welcoming the World\" in England, Germany and Mexico. Comprehensive international arrivals data from the U.S. Commerce Department take seven months to compile, so it will be next year before definitive 2017 statistics are available. But the Commerce Department has seen a 5 percent increase January-March over the same period last year in collections from ESTA fees, which are electronic travel authorization fees paid by foreigners who don't need visas to enter the U.S.  That suggests increased visitation from visa-waiver countries like the U.K., Japan, Germany and Australia.",

            "article_content": "Even by the quirky standards of billionaires, Peter Thiel marches to the beat of his own drummer.  Thiel, who co-founded PayPal, is one of the few tech moguls to back President Donald Trump, and he funded wrestler Hulk Hogan's libel suit against Gawker Media, which led to its bankruptcy and subsequent sale. His foundation runs a contest for young people \"under 23 and working on a cool project or company,\" with the winner getting a two-year $100,000 fellowship.\u00a0 Now, the 49-year-old entrepreneur has raised eyebrows yet again by obtaining New Zealand citizenship -- even though he spent only 12 days in the country.  New Zealand officials were unable to explain why they decided in January to divulge Thiel's citizenship, six years after it happened. Revelations about the time Thiel has spent in New Zealand were uncovered in press reports yesterday.\u00a0 In an interview with the New Zealand Herald, Nathan Guy, who was Immigration Minister in 2011 when Thiel became a citizen, argued that the entrepreneur was a \"great ambassador and salesperson for New Zealand\" without explaining what he meant. A spokesman for the New Zealand Embassy in Washington, D.C., had no immediate comment.  It's not clear what prompted Thiel to seek New Zealand citizenship. The move doesn't necessarily indicate that Thiel, who was born in Germany, has renounced his U.S. citizenship. According to the State Department, the U.S. government recognizes dual nationality but doesn't encourage it because it can cause problems. \"Claims of other countries on dual nationality U.S. nationals may conflict with U.S. law, and dual nationality may limit U.S. Government efforts to assist nationals abroad,\" the State Department website says. \"The country where a dual national is located generally has a stronger claim to that person's allegiance.\"  A spokeswoman for Thiel didn't respond to a request for comment. New Zealand, which has a population of less than 5 million, is proving to be a draw for many U.S. citizens. According to media reports, applications from Americans seeking New Zealand citizenship soared 70 percent in the three months after Mr. Trump's election compared with same period a year earlier. \u00a0\u00a0  Foreign buyers are also snapping up New Zealand property, buying nearly 1,400-square miles of land in the first 10 months of 2016, more than quadruple what they acquired in 2015. Americans were the second-largest buyers behind Australians, fueled by demand by wealthy \"doomsday preppers\" who fear a collapse in the U.S. Jonathan Berr is an award-winning journalist and podcaster based in New Jersey whose main focus is on business and economic issues.",

            "article_content": "As if the 2016 campaign had never ended, a pugnacious President Trump delivered a free-wheeling speech at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa on Wednesdaynight, where he bashed Obamacare, Democrats, and the media, and touted with hyperbole the successes of his five-month-old presidency fraught with infighting and scandal.\u00a0 \"They have a phony witch hunt going against me and you know what: all we do is win, win, win,\" Mr. Trump told the clamorous crowd over the course of an hour and ten minute long speech, relishing Tuesday night's congressional special election GOP wins in South Carolina and Georgia.\u00a0 Mr. Trump announced that he was going to introduce legislation \"very shortly\" barring immigrants from having access to welfare during their first five years in the country. Under existing law, many immigrants are already barred from applying for federal welfare programs during their first five years in the country. It's unclear how Mr. Trump's proposal will differ.\u00a0 The President, who claimed that after \"years of lawlessness,\" the U.S. was enforcing immigration laws for the first time, also revealed a new vision of the wall along the southern border.\u00a0 Candidate Trump's \"Who's gonna pay for the wall\" call and response was replaced by a plan to build a solar wall along the border \"so it creates energy and pays for itself.\"\u00a0 \"And this way, Mexico will have to pay much less money and that's good,\" Mr. Trump told the crowd of over 5,000 people at the U.S. Cellular Center. While White House staffers spent the night with Republican Senators on the Hill, drafting their secretive healthcare bill to be released on Thursday, Mr. Trump offered no details of the replacement bill but defended the controversial process to the audience \u2014 \"I've only been there for five months\" \u2014 and assailed Democrats for being Trumpcare \"obstructionists.\"\u00a0 \"If we came to you and said, here's your plan, you're going to have the greatest plan in history and you're going to pay nothing, they'd vote against it folks,\" Mr. Trump claimed.\u00a0 \"I can't guarantee anything, but I hope we're going to surprise you with a really good plan,\" he added. \"You know I've been talking about a plan with heart. I said add some money to it, a plan with heart. But Obamacare is dead.\"\u00a0 Mr. Trump's speech was riddled with reversals and contradictions that received applause nevertheless.\u00a0 While describing the situation in the Middle East \u2014 \"$6 trillion of thousands of young beautiful lives\" \u2014 Mr. Trump, who ran on a campaign opposed to engagement, conveniently failed to mention that he had recently delegated authority to the Pentagon to send several thousand more U.S. troops to Afghanistan.\u00a0 Hours after his 2020 campaign team confirmed that the President would be hosting a fundraiser at the Trump Hotel in D.C. on June 28th, Mr. Trump claimed that he does \"not answer to any donors of financial contributors\" And after a campaign spent lambasting Goldman Sachs and a corrupt establishment, Mr. Trump bragged that he had entrusted the role of Chief Economic Adviser to former Goldman Sachs CEO Gary Cohn.\u00a0 \"I love all people \u2014 rich or poor \u2014 but in those particular positions I just don't want a poor person. Does that make sense?\" Mr. Trump quipped, explaining why he had hired Cohn.\u00a0 Mr. Trump's tone on China had also been dramatically tailored. After praising the newly confirmed Ambassador to China Terry Branstad, the former Governor of Iowa, informed the group that Branstad had told him that \"we've had a very good relationship with China.\" \u00a0 \"I wish we would have a little more help with respect to North Korea, but that doesn't seem to be working out,\" Mr. Trump added in a muted manner.\u00a0 After lauding himself for exiting the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the President gingerly walked the crowd of loyal Trump supporters through why he had not yet ripped up the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as he had promised to do on the campaign trail.\u00a0 \"So I announced that essentially that I was going to terminate [NAFTA] but got a very nice call from Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada and the President of Mexico asking me not to terminate \u2013 could we negotiate and I'm always willing to negotiate,\" Mr. Trump told the crowd, who booed at the mention of Trudeau.\u00a0 Mr. Trump, prone to embellishments, littered his speech with factual inaccuracies. Explaining why he had pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement several weeks ago, Mr. Trump cited a \"permanent economic disadvantage\" if the United States had remained in the accord.\u00a0 \"And they all say it's non-binding, like hell it's non-binding,\" Mr. Trump said. \"When we get sued by everybody because we thought it was non-binding, then you can tell me it was non-binding.\"\u00a0 The agreement is, indeed, non-binding.\u00a0 The President also repeated an oft-repeated false claim that the United States is one of the most highly taxed nations in the world.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "President Trump says the United States has a \"very strong\" relationship with Panama, and in a meeting with the Panamanian president, he noted the U.S. role in building the Panama Canal. Mr. Trump was meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela to discuss organized crime, immigration, fighting drug trafficking along with economic issues. After the president and first lady Melania Trump escorted Varela and his wife, Lorena Castillo, to the Oval Office, the president quickly noted their historic ties. \u00a0 \"The Panama Canal is doing quite well. I think we did a good job building it, right?\" Trump told Varela, who responded, \"Very good job.\" \u00a0 Opened in 1914, the Panama Canal was built by the United States between 1904 and 1913 and revolutionized sea traffic travel in the region. The canal was under U.S. control until a 1977 agreement led to its transfer to Panama in 1999. The canal recently expanded its locks as part of a $5.25 billion expansion project.\u00a0 Varela noted the U.S. and Panama face many of the same challenges in the region, and he said that \"the idea of this visit is to work closely together.\" The two leaders were also expected to address unrest in nearby Venezuela, which has been grappling with anti-government protests and calls for new presidential elections amid major inflation, crime and food and medical shortages. During the meeting, Mr. Trump ignored reporters' questions about whether he is under investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, after a member of his legal team vehemently denied that he was. Top Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow told CBS News' John Dickerson on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that the president is not and has not been under investigation.\" Sekulow's comments came after\u00a0Mr. Trump slammed reports\u00a0that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is reviewing whether or not Mr. Trump tried to obstruct justice amid ongoing investigations into any ties between his presidential campaign's or transition's associates and the Russian government. The Washington Post first reported the story.\u00a0 \"They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice,\" Mr. Trump tweeted on Thursday. A day later,\u00a0Mr. Trump said in a tweet, \"I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt.\" He appeared to be referring to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Sekulow told CBS News that the legal team has \"received no notice of investigation.\"",

            "article_content": "There's an enormous disconnect between the Federal Reserve's projections for plodding economic growth and the White House's rosier view. The Fed's estimate stays stuck at the recent level, around 2 percent yearly. President Donald Trump's hits 3 percent. Both the Fed, which released its latest estimates Wednesday as it announced its rate-hike decision, and the Trump administration's Office of Management and Budget, whose forecast came out last month along with its proposed spending blueprint, foresee an almost identical economic growth figure for 2017. For the Fed, it's 2.2 percent; for Mr. Trump, 2.3 percent. But then things diverge. The Fed, which only does estimates for three years, looks for a slowdown: 2.1 percent gross domestic product growth for 2018 and 1.9 percent for 2019. For the administration, the GDP picks up speed, with 2.5 percent next year, 2.8 percent in 2019, and then 3.0 percent each year through 2027. Lately, GDP growth has been well short of soaring. For this year's first quarter, it rose just 1.2 percent on an annual basis.\u00a0 The administration bases its more optimistic view on the assumption that the Trump program of tax cutting and infrastructure spending gets enacted and delivers the intended results. Progress is slow on the former front, given Congress' distraction over issues like the Trump campaign's relations with Russia. Still, the Republicans do control both the House and the Senate, so some semblance of his plan could get passed. \"The foundation of the plan is 3 percent growth,\" White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told the House Budget Committee last month. \"In fact, that is Trumponomics.\" \u00a0 Skeptics are many, even within the president's own party. \"This budget presumes a Goldilocks economy,\" said Rep. Mark Sanford, a South Carolina Republican. \"It assumes the stars perfectly align with regard to economic drivers.\" To Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at tax and audit consultancy RSM, tax cuts would deliver merely a temporary boost. \"Tax cuts are not a panacea,\" he said. \"They're a short-term sugar rush.\" Mr. Trump won election on a promise to step up the sluggish pace of the economy. His challenge is to overcome some tall obstacles. The two biggest are:  Slow productivity growth. This has been on the downswing since before the Great Recession. From around 3.5 percent growth in 2005, it tumbled below 1 percent 10 years later. While it has nudged up a bit recently, productivity -- how much economic output workers can create -- has a lot further to go to generate the type of GDP growth that the president seeks.\u00a0 \"Productivity has increased 1.2% over the last four quarters, which is twice its trailing five-year annualized growth rate,\" noted Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economy at Deutsche Bank Research. For the economy to maintain 2 percent growth, that tempo would need to be maintained, he said. And that's no sure bet. The last productivity surge occurred in the 1990s, thanks to the greater efficiency brought on by the advent of information technology to the U.S. workplace. Since then, though, corporate capital spending has lagged, with companies citing a lack of consumer demand as the reason. According to the Census Bureau, \u00a0capital spending in 2015 (the last year available) rose a miserly 2.5 percent, far below the mid- to high-single digits that have been the postwar norm.\u00a0 Demographics. When the enormous baby boom generation was in its prime and women were entering the workforce, an ample labor pool and burgeoning consumer spending helped drive the economy.\u00a0 These days, the labor force -- the currently employed and those who are looking -- is only fitfully increasing, as an average 10,000 baby boomers are retiring daily. Retirees don't buy as much as younger people, and don't contribute to economic growth much because they're not working. Immigration could make up some of the shortfall, but Mr. Trump wants to restrict it. \u00a0 Trump-style stimulus could pump up GDP for a time. Still, warned Allen Bond, co-portfolio manager of the Jensen Quality Growth Fund (JENSX), \"an aging population and declining workforce participation likely will bring growth back\" to what the Fed envisions. If so, that's bad news for the Trump agenda. Larry Light is a veteran financial editor and reporter who has worked for the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Business Week, Money, AdviceIQ and Newsday.",

            "article_content": "U.S. President Donald Trump announced Thursday that the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, dealing a significant blow to international efforts to combat climate change. Speaking from the White House Rose Garden, Mr. Trump said the agreement \"is very unfair at the highest level to the United States.\" What follows if the full text of the president's remarks. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much. Thank you. I would like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila. We are closely monitoring the situation and I will continue to give updates, anything happens during this period of time, but it is really sad as to what's going on throughout the world with terror. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those affected. Before we discuss the Paris accord, I'd like to begin with an update on our tremendous, absolutely tremendous economic progress since Election Day on November 8. The economy is starting to come back, and very, very rapidly. We've added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than 1 million private-sector jobs.\u00a0 I've just returned from a trip overseas where we concluded nearly $350 billion of military and economic development for the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. It was a very, very successful trip, believe me. (Applause) Thank you, thank you. In my meetings at the G7, we have taken historic steps to demand fair and reciprocal trade that gives Americans a level playing field against other nations. We're also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up -- and you see that, you see it all over -- from the previous administration, including getting many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against terror. Big, big contributions are being made by countries that weren't doing so much in the form of contributions.\u00a0 One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the American people during my campaign for president. Whether it's cutting job-killing regulations, appointing and confirming a tremendous Supreme Court justice, putting in place tough new ethics rules, achieving a record reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border, or bringing jobs, plants and factories back into the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible, and believe me, we've just begun. The fruits of our labor will be seen very shortly, even more so. On these issues and so many more, we are following through on our commitments, and I don't want anything to get in our way. I am fighting every day for the great people of this country. Therefore, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and it's citizens, the U.S. will withdraw from the Paris climate accord. (Applause) Thank you. But begin negotiations to re-enter either the Paris accord or an entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the U.S., its business, its workers, its people, its taxpayers. So we are getting out. But we will start to negotiate and we will see if we can make a deal that's fair. And if we can, that's great. And if we can't, that's fine. The Paris climate accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering an agreement that disadvantages the U.S., leaving American workers who I love and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs and lower wages and vastly diminished economic production. Thus, as of today, the U.S. will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris accord and the draconian and financial economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country. This includes ending the implementation of the Nationally Determined Contribution and, very importantly, the Green Climate Fund, which is costing the U.S. a vast fortune. Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Economic Research Associates. This includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs -- not what we need -- believe me, this is not what we need -- including automobile jobs, and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely. They rely for so much, and we would be giving them so little. According to this same study, by 2040, compliance with the commitments put into place by the previous administration would cut production for the following sectors: paper down 12 percent; cement down 23 percent; iron and steel down 38 percent; coal -- and I happen to love the coal miners -- down 86 percent; natural gas down 31 percent. The cost to the economy at this time would be close to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs, while households would have $7,000 less income and, in many cases, much worse than that. Not only does this deal subject our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals. As someone who cares deeply about the environment, which I do, I cannot in good conscience support a deal that punishes the United States -- which is what it does -- the world's leader in environmental protection, while imposing no meaningful obligations on the world's leading polluters. For example, under the agreement, China will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years -- 13. They can do whatever they want for 13 years. Not us. India makes its participation contingent on receiving\u00a0billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. There are many other examples. But the bottom line is that the Paris accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States. Further, while the current agreement effectively blocks the development of clean coal in America -- which it does, and the mines are starting to open up. We're having a big opening in two weeks. Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, so many places. A big opening of a brand-new mine. It's unheard of. For many, many years, that hasn't happened. They asked me if I'd go. I'm going to try. China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So we can't build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020. Think of it: India can double their coal production. We're supposed to get rid of ours. Even Europe is allowed to continue construction of coal plants.\u00a0 In short, the agreement doesn't eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States, and ships them to foreign countries. This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States. The rest of the world applauded when we signed the Paris Agreement -- they went wild; they were so happy -- for the simple reason that it put our country, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very big economic disadvantage. A cynic would say the obvious reason for economic competitors and their wish to see us remain in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. We would find it very hard to compete with other countries from other parts of the world. \u00a0 We have among the most abundant energy reserves on the planet, sufficient to lift millions of America's poorest workers out of poverty. Yet, under this agreement, we are effectively putting these reserves under lock and key, taking away the great wealth of our nation -- it's great wealth, it's phenomenal wealth; not so long ago, we had no idea we had such wealth -- and leaving millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness. The agreement is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries. At 1 percent growth, renewable sources of energy can meet some of our domestic demand, but at 3 or 4 percent growth, which I expect, we need all forms of available American energy, or our country (Applause) will be at grave risk of brownouts and blackouts, our businesses will come to a halt in many cases, and the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life. Even if the Paris Agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree -- think of that; this much -- Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100. Tiny, tiny amount. In fact, 14 days of carbon emissions from China alone would wipe out the gains from America -- and this is an incredible statistic -- would totally wipe out the gains from America's expected reductions in the year 2030, after we have had to spend billions and billions of dollars, lost jobs, closed factories, and suffered much higher energy costs for our businesses and for our homes. As the Wall Street Journal wrote this morning: \"The reality is that withdrawing is in America's economic interest and won't matter much to the climate.\" The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth. We'll be the cleanest. We're going to have the cleanest air. We're going to have the cleanest water. We will be environmentally friendly, but we're not going to put our businesses out of work and we're not going to lose our jobs. We're going to grow; we're going to grow rapidly. (Applause)\u00a0 And I think you just read -- it just came out minutes ago, the small business report -- small businesses as of just now are booming, hiring people. One of the best reports they've seen in many years. I'm willing to immediately work with Democratic leaders to either negotiate our way back into Paris, under the terms that are fair to the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects our country and its taxpayers. (Applause) So if the obstructionists want to get together with me, let's make them non-obstructionists.\u00a0 We will all sit down, and we will get back into the deal.\u00a0 And we'll make it good, and we won't be closing up our factories, and we won't be losing our jobs.\u00a0 And we'll sit down with the Democrats and all of the people that represent either the Paris Accord or something that we can do that's much better than the Paris Accord.\u00a0 And I think the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of the world will be thrilled.\u00a0 But until we do that, we're out of the agreement.\u00a0 I will work to ensure that America remains the world's leader on environmental issues, but under a framework that is fair and where the burdens and responsibilities are equally shared among the many nations all around the world.\u00a0 No responsible leader can put the workers -- and the people -- of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, while empowering some of the world's top polluting countries, should dispel any doubt as to the real reason why foreign lobbyists wish to keep our magnificent country tied up and bound down by this agreement: It's to give their country an economic edge over the United States. That's not going to happen while I'm President. I'm sorry. (Applause) My job as president is to do everything within my power to give America a level playing field and to create the economic, regulatory and tax structures that make America the most prosperous and productive country on Earth, and with the highest standard of living and the highest standard of environmental protection. Our tax bill is moving along in Congress, and I believe it's doing very well. I think a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised.\u00a0 The Republicans are working very, very hard. We'd love to have support from the Democrats, but we may have to go it alone. But it's going very well.\u00a0 The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country's expense. They don't put America first. I do, and I always will.\u00a0 (Applause) The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance. You see what's happening. It's pretty obvious to those that want to keep an open mind. At what point does America get demeaned? At what point do they start laughing at us as a country? We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers. We don't want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore.\u00a0 And they won't be. They won't be. I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. (Applause) I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve America's interests. Many trade deals will soon be under renegotiation. Very rarely do we have a deal that works for this country, but they'll soon be under renegotiation. The process has begun from day one. But now we're down to business. Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris accord, it includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund -- nice name -- which calls for developed countries to send $100 billion to developing countries all on top of America's existing and massive foreign aid payments. So we're going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars, and we're already way ahead of anybody else. Many of the other countries haven't spent anything, and many of them will never pay one dime. The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars of which the United States has already handed over $1 billion -- nobody else is even close; most of them haven't even paid anything -- including funds raided out of America's budget for the war against terrorism. That's where they came. Believe me, they didn't come from me.\u00a0 They came just before I came into office.\u00a0 Not good.\u00a0 And not good the way they took the money.\u00a0 In 2015, the United Nation's departing top climate officials reportedly described the $100 billion per year as \"peanuts,\" and stated that \"the $100 billion is the tail that wags the dog.\" \u00a0In 2015, the Green Climate Fund's executive director reportedly stated that estimated funding needed would increase to $450 billion per year after 2020.\u00a0 And nobody even knows where the money is going to.\u00a0 Nobody has been able to say, where is it going to? Of course, the world's top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated. America is $20 trillion in debt. Cash-strapped cities cannot hire enough police officers or fix vital infrastructure. Millions of our citizens are out of work. And yet, under the Paris accord, billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us. So think of that.\u00a0 There are serious legal and constitutional issues as well. Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the world should not have more to say with respect to the U.S. economy than our own citizens and their elected representatives. Thus, our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of America's sovereignty. (Applause) Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the world, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. And I will. Staying in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States as we begin the process of unlocking the restrictions on America's abundant energy reserves, which we have started very strongly. It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is the new reality we face if we do not leave the agreement or if we do not negotiate a far better deal. The risks grow as historically these agreements only tend to become more and more ambitious over time. In other words, the Paris framework is a starting point -- as bad as it is -- not an end point. And exiting the agreement protects the United States from future intrusions on the United States' sovereignty and massive future legal liability. Believe me, we have massive legal liability if we stay in. As president, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to the American people. The Paris Accord would undermine our economy, hamstring our workers, weaken our sovereignty, impose unacceptable legal risks, and put us at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world. It is time to exit the Paris accord -- (Applause) -- and time to pursue a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country. It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania -- along with many, many other locations within our great country -- before Paris, France. It is time to make America great again. (Applause) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Very important. I'd like to ask Scott Pruitt, who most of you know and respect, as I do, just to say a few words.",

            "article_content": "PORTLAND, Ore. -- A suspect made repeated verbal outbursts Tuesday as he appeared in court to face charges that he fatally stabbed two men and wounded another after yelling hate speech at two young women, one of whom was wearing a hijab, on a Portland light rail train Friday.  A defiant Jeremy Joseph Christian made his first appearance Tuesday afternoon before Judge Paul G. Crowley at the Multnomah Justice Center. As the 35-year-old entered the courtroom, he yelled about free speech before saying, \"Death to the enemies of America. Leave this country if you hate our freedom.\"  \"You call it terrorism, I call it patriotism,\" Christian said. \"You hear me? Die.\"  The outbursts were followed by a commotion outside the courtroom.  Micah David-Cole Fletcher, 21, suffered a slash wound to his neck and chest as he tried to confront Christian and help the young women. Two other men who also came to the aid of the young women -- Ricky John Best, 53, and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, 23 -- were killed in the incident.  Police reports say Christian is seen on surveillance video yelling racial and anti-Muslims slurs at the two young women and attacking the men, who intervened, with a knife, CBS News' Mireya Villarreal reports. Fletcher told investigators Christian \"threatened to decapitate people.\"  Late Tuesday, the Associated Press reported that recently released court documents for the first time mentioned a fourth man who was the first to intervene and was not attacked, but they did not identify him by his full name. Police said they'll examine what appears to be Christian's extremist ideology, including social media posts indicating an affinity for Nazis and political violence.  Fletcher,\u00a0recently released from the hospital, appeared in the courtroom during the brief hearing along with family of victims and supporters.  Christian is charged with two counts of aggravated murder, two counts of second-degree intimidation and one count of attempted aggravated murder, one count of first-degree assault and three counts of unlawful use of a weapon, reports CBS affiliate KOIN.  He has been appointed public defenders. Lane Borg, the head of the local public defender agency, said the office was \"saddened by this tragedy\" but urged people to let the justice system take its course.  Tuesday, Christian's case was assigned to a judge and an attorney requested a speedy trial.  In the probable cause affidavit, prosecutors said video feeds in the back of a patrol car captured Christian saying after his arrest that he had stabbed three people in the neck. His court-appointed attorney, Gregory Scholl, did not immediately return a call for comment. The deaths stunned the city, but also underscored nervousness about recent events, including a series of apparent hate crimes in the region and contentious public rallies that have drawn national attention. The Pacific Northwest has a long and violent history of white supremacist and other racist activities, despite its more recent reputation for being one of the nation's most socially liberal regions. \"The idea that Portland is so liberal supersedes this dark, hidden secret about racism,\" said Karen Gibson, a professor of urban studies at Portland State University. Many of the early settlers to Oregon were from Southern states and brought with them negative attitudes about blacks, Gibson said. Only about 6 percent of the Portland population is black, while more than 70 percent is non-Hispanic white, statistics show. Some residents said President Donald Trump has caused those racist demons to stir again with his administration's travel ban, his promise to build a wall along the border with Mexico and his crackdown on illegal immigration. Since Trump's election, Portland has led all major metropolitan areas in reported hate crimes, Mayor Ted Wheeler's office said. \"I don't have that feeling like it can't happen here -- the way people talk about Portland -- because we've got racism. We've got all kinds of things,\" said Murr Brewster, who came to see a memorial at the city's transit center. \"It's everywhere and the trouble is, it's getting more and more prevalent.\"",

            "article_content": "PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Innkeepers, restaurateurs and landscapers around the U.S. say they are struggling to find seasonal help and turning down business in some cases because the government tightened up on visas for temporary foreign workers.  \"There's going to be a lot of businesses that just can't function on a full-time basis, and some might not even open at all,\" said Mac Hay, who co-owns Mac's Seafood on Cape Cod and has organized seasonal businesses to lobby Congress.  At issue are H-2B temporary visas, which are issued for workers holding down seasonal, nonagricultural jobs.  The U.S. caps the number at 66,000 per fiscal year. Some workers return year after year, and Congress has let them do so in the past without being counted toward the limit. No such exception was passed for 2017 at the end of last year, after the presidential election.  Lawmakers on Monday unveiled a government spending bill that would allow the homeland security secretary to increase the number of H-2B visas this fiscal year to almost 130,000.  But there is concern that even if the measure passes, it will take weeks for visas to be processed, meaning many workers probably won't arrive in time for Memorial Day and maybe not until after the Fourth of July.  Many resorts rely heavily on foreigners on H-2B visas to work as housekeepers, cooks, dishwashers and the like, saying they cannot find enough Americans willing to take such jobs. President Donald Trump himself has hired seasonal workers at his Mar-a-Lago resort in this way.  Each visa typically costs at least $1,000 in government fees, travel and other expenses, paid by employers.  At the Beachmere Inn in Ogunquit, Maine, owner Sarah Mace Diment said she cut back on the number of rooms available during New England's spring vacation week in April because she is short eight housekeepers, who are paid $10 to $12.50 an hour. None of her visa requests were granted, she said.  Critics say that bringing in cheap foreign labor undercuts U.S. workers and drives down wages and that employers aren't trying hard enough to hire Americans. Under the H-2B rules, employers must advertise for U.S. workers first.  Diment said she hires housekeepers from Jamaica because there aren't enough people in rural, southern Maine looking for seasonal work. Maine is at its lowest unemployment on record, 3 percent. She has hired U.S. college students, but they go back to school in August, well before the season ends in October.  \"I'm always going to hire an American first. I'm always going to hire someone locally first,\" Diment said. \"We're not using this program because it's easy. It's not. It's very difficult and expensive, but we're using it because we have no other options.\"  Landscapers are the biggest users of the H-2B program. Stephen Faulkner, who owns a landscaping and nursery business in Hooksett, New Hampshire, said he expects to turn away hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of work this season because he could not get visas for any of the six Mexican landscapers who have been with him for a decade.  He said he is considering giving up the landscape division.  \"My company is being devastated by not having my returning workers,\" he said. \"I'm running out of energy and fortitude, and American jobs might be lost because of it.\"  The AFL-CIO says the H-2B program enables discrimination and exploitation of workers and hurts efforts to raise wages and improve working conditions. And U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders has questioned whether willing Americans truly are unavailable for these jobs.  \"We supposedly live in a supply-and-demand economy, and if employers can't find workers to fill their jobs, they might want to raise wages,\" the Vermont independent recently told The Burlington Free Press.  Joseph Lieghio and his family operate hotels and restaurants in Mackinaw City, Michigan. Lieghio said he doubts he could attract Americans even if he doubled the $10-to-$11-an-hour wage for dishwashers, short-order cooks and front desk staff.  \"If they breathe and walk in the door, we give them a job,\" he said. \"There's no one here.\"  He said about 130 of his visa requests were granted and 80 were not. He is cutting hours at his restaurants, raising prices and postponing the opening of a new restaurant, he said.  Novelette Barnes-Chin began leaving Jamaica for seasonal work in the U.S. at 32. Now 50, she said she is praying she will be able to work at the Beachmere Inn for at least part of the season.  \"In Jamaica we would say that's our breadbasket. That's what we look forward to every year, to go work, save and buy our food, buy our clothes and supplies,\" she said. \"I feel really, really heartbroken right now, really sad.\" ",

            "article_content": "President Trump is banking on Congress to approve federal funding for his planned border wall this fall, but Republican lawmakers are not guaranteeing it, raising questions about whether his most prominent campaign promise will ever come to fruition. Democrats opposed border wall funding in the latest government spending debate and the White House eventually backed off of its demand to secure the money this month. When the funding fight comes up again in September, Democrats are still likely to deem it a non-starter in negotiations.  \"I have said repeatedly and consistently, I will not support an omnibus that includes funding for a wall; not going to do it,\" said Rep. Joe Crowley, D-New York, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, at a recent press conference.  \"Building a wall is not a solution,\" Rep. Linda Sanchez, D-California, the vice chairwoman, agreed. \"It's wasteful. It's expensive. It doesn't do much for our economy. And it's certainly not going to solve the immigration mess that we're in.\" The $1.1 trillion government spending package Congress passed and the president signed into law earlier this month includes $1.5 billion in border security funding, but it can only be used to replace existing fencing and barriers; it cannot be used to build a concrete wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.  In late March, Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, said that border wall funding would be addressed in 2018 funding due this fall, but now Republicans have said little about whether that will actually happen. \"That's going to be the debate in the next round of appropriations for next year,\" said Rep. John Carter, R-Texas, the chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on Homeland Security, when asked recently if Republicans will ever secure border wall funding.  Asked what will change between the current debate and September, he said, \"What's going to change between today and tomorrow? Who knows?\" The chairman of the full Appropriations panel, Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-New Jersey, dodged a question before the House's recess last week about whether there would ever be border wall funding. \"We have border funding in this bill: $1.5 billion,\" he said. Earlier this year, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reportedly estimated that the border wall would cost $21.6 billion, nearly twice the amount of previous estimates. But Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill calculated it would be three times as high -- nearly $67 billion. Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed that Mexico would finance the wall, a proposal its president has rejected. Still, the initial plans for the wall are underway. DHS issued a notice\u00a0earlier this month saying that the department was in the process of completing phase I of design-build procedures for \"several prototype wall structures in the vicinity of the United States border with Mexico.\" Site visits for phase II of the project are planned for mid-May.  In early May, Mr. Trump suggested in a tweet that a government shutdown might be needed in September to change Senate rules so that he and Republicans could have full control over government spending and, as a result, fund the wall. Spending packages must be bipartisan because Senate Republicans need Democratic votes to advance the legislation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, quickly rejected the president's suggestion about changing the rules to eliminate the 60-vote threshold for such measures, and other Republicans agreed that a shutdown should be avoided. \"I don't ever want to see a government shut down again because I think it's a bad thing for the country and nation,\" Frelinghuysen told reporters in response to the president's threat.  Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, said he was surprised that the latest spending package excluded border wall funding and said there's only one way it will happen.  \"The way I'm certain we'll get border wall funding is if the Republican leadership is more interested in getting Republican votes than it is in getting Democratic votes,\" he told CBS News. Gohmert said he supports the president's border wall, with some exceptions.  \"Well, you don't need a wall everywhere,\" he said. \"Big Bend National Park, the parts of the Rio Grande that are plenty wide, you don't need a wall in the river there or even on the bank. You can control it without a wall in those places, but there are some places you need a wall, you need to have equipment that will discern whether there's tunnels being dug.\" Though Gohmert opposes a shutdown, he's glad that \"we have a guy in the president now who understands how to negotiate, and you don't take anything off the table.\" If the government does shut down, he thinks Democrats should be blamed.  \"Any kind of a shutdown of the government over this one issue is one that will hurt Republicans in the 2018 elections. It will definitely put a black mark on [Trump's] presidency, and my guess is this is another one of his blusters that is not realistic,\" Bill Hoagland, senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center, told CBS. Hoagland spent 25 years on Capitol Hill working on budget issues and appropriations.  \"If you're the president of the United States, and you can even say you want to shut down the government, maybe he's suited for a better job,\" Rep. Nita Lowey, D-New York, the ranking member on House Appropriations, said. OMB Director Mick Mulvaney has said one reason the White House decided to back off its demand for wall funding now is that the administration \"realized it was almost impossible if not impossible to actually get bricks and mortar on the ground in five months.\" But Mulvaney thinks Congress will change its attitude between now and September. \"A lot could happen in five months,\" Mulvaney said. \"Maybe we can prove to folks in both parties that we're serious about this and that the border wall is not just some campaign concept, it's real and that we're serious about securing the border.\"  But even Republicans who represent congressional districts along the border aren't on board with a concrete wall.  Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, who represents more than 800 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border, told CBS that while physical barriers are one of many tools used for urban environments, gaining control of the southern border \"will require a sector-by-sector approach that adequately empowers the men and women on the ground with technology, resources, and manpower.\" \"I've said time and time again that building a wall from sea to shining sea is the most expensive and least effective way to secure the border,\" Hurd said.  Hoagland doubts Congress will ever fund a border wall.  \"I think the thought that we'll ever build a Great Wall of China across our southern border is just simply not realistic at all, and Congress will never fund such an endeavor,\" he said.\u00a0 Rebecca Shabad is a video reporter for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "BEIJING - When the sister of White House Senior Adviser Jared Kushner\u00a0promoted investment in her family's new skyscraper to investors in Beijing earlier this month, she was pitching a controversial American visa program that's proven irresistible to tens of thousands of Chinese. Over the last decade, more than 100,000 Chinese have poured at least $24 billion into \"golden visa\" programs across the world, an Associated Press analysis has found. These programs offer residence in exchange for investment in a country's businesses. Nowhere is Chinese demand greater than in the United States, which has taken in at least $7.7 billion and issued more than 40,000 visas to Chinese investors and their families in the past 10 years, the AP found. One such investor is Jenny Liu, a doctoral student in the coastal city of Nanjing, who sold her apartment two years ago and moved in with her parents. She used the money from the sale to invest $500,000 in a U.S. hotel project. If the project creates enough jobs in two years, she'll get a prized permanent residency -- a \"green card\" -- and a pathway for a less stressful education for her 9-year-old son. \"My son has a lot of homework to do every day, but I don't think he has learned a lot from school,\" Liu said. \"I hope he can actually pick up some useful knowledge or skills rather than only learn how to pass tests.\" The flood of investors is a reminder of how China's rise has catapulted tens of millions of families into the middle class. But at the same time, it shows how these families are increasingly becoming restless as cities remain choked by smog, home prices multiply and schools impose ever-greater pressure on children. They also feel insecure about being able to protect their property and savings. Their money goes toward government bonds, businesses, mountain ski resorts, new schools and real estate projects, including a Trump-branded tower in New Jersey built by the Kushner Companies, once run by Jared Kushner, now President Donald Trump's son-in-law and a White House senior adviser. But the industry is murky, loosely regulated and sometimes fraud-ridden. In the U.S., federal regulators have linked the EB-5 visa program to fraud cases involving more than $1 billion in investment in the last four years. Despite criticism from Congress, Mr. Trump signed a spending bill that included a renewal of the program through September, although federal authorities have proposed an increase in the required minimum investment. Just one day later, Kushner's sister, Nicole Meyer, was in Beijing courting Chinese for a new project funded by EB-5. That's raised complaints about conflicts of interest and new calls to revise or even end the program. \"It is a growing industry and we do need more oversight,\" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an expert on the program and a professor at Cornell Law School. \"EB-5, when it is done properly, can and does benefit the economy.\" The number of Chinese using investment migration programs worldwide tripled between 2010 and 2015, the AP found. In the last decade, Chinese have taken 75 percent of the investor visas issued by the United States, 70 percent for Portugal and 85 percent for Australia. China also remains the top recipient of investor visas in Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Spain, Hungary and Malta. To be sure, those migrating make up only a small fraction of the around 18 million households that could be considered upper-middle-class or wealthier in China, but they echo the laments of many better-educated, urban Chinese. \"Middle-class investors' choosing to leave shows that their confidence in their future, their dreams and the regime in China is fading,\" said Zhang Lifan, an independent political scholar in Beijing. China's \"golden visa\" investors are part of a wave of migrants characterized not by poverty, persecution or war, but by people with steady jobs and homes who are pursuing happiness that's eluded them in their homeland. After decades of economic mismanagement and political upheaval, the ruling Communist Party reversed some of its most destructive policies and unleashed a four-decade-long economic boom in the 1970s. That growth lifted 500 million people out of poverty and vaulted generations of Chinese from peasantry into relatively well-paying manufacturing or service jobs. More than 3 million households in China now have an income of more than $34,000 a year, according to the consultancy McKinsey & Company. Key to their spending power is China's real estate boom. Real estate prices in China's largest cities have more than tripled in the last decade, with prices in Beijing rising by an average of 25 percent a year during that time. Just since late 2015, Beijing's home prices have jumped 63 percent, making a 1,300 square-foot apartment worth more than $1 million. A family that gained ownership of an ordinary apartment more than a decade ago can now sell it for the price of a \"golden visa.\" And more and more families are choosing to do so, \u00a0as their dissatisfaction with China's problems grows. Like Liu, many of about a dozen investors or prospective investors interviewed by the AP say they don't want their children to struggle in China's rigid and intensely competitive education system, which emphasizes rote learning and can stifle creativity. Cherry Deng, the mother of a 10-year-old boy in Sichuan province, invested in a port construction project in North Carolina through the U.S. EB-5 program. Deng, who used funds from her car dealership business, said she wants her son to learn from the American emphasis on self-reliance. Deng said she sees Chinese parents supporting their children even after they've graduated from college - securing for them homes, jobs and, sometimes, even spouses. \"I don't want to take care of my children forever,\" Deng said. \"I want them to learn how to live independently and to create wealth on their own.\" Urban Chinese have also been disgusted by scandals ranging from tainted baby formula to toxic running tracks, and alarmed that even the most prosperous cities are not safe from deadly factory explosions and other man-made disasters. Despite her success running an online clothing business in the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu, Peng Jie isn't confident in her future in China. She sees the prices of property and schools rising and the value of the yuan falling, and fears that success could be taken away. \"In China, we have family and friends, and daily life is convenient,\" Peng said. But, she added, \"someone in the middle class can become poor in one second.\" China is central to the success of almost every major investment migration program in the world, so many countries are going out of their way to court Chinese investors. Ads for investment programs pop up on Chinese cellphones and websites, full of promise and intrigue. In crowded hotel ballrooms, foreign officials with pamphlets and flashy presentations tout the same message: Start a new life in a country with better education, clean air and a stable future. Agents selling U.S. projects to Chinese take great pains to prove their expertise on the states, the EB-5 program and perceived ties to American leaders. Some marketing materials include photos of Chinese posing with former President Barack Obama. Now, they're competing directly against the current president's relatives. Meyer, Kushner's sister, appeared this month at events in Beijing and Shanghai to promote One Journal Square, a New Jersey tower project planned by the Kushner family that would be partially funded through EB-5 investment. The presentation included a photo of Mr. Trump and vague promises that the project had \"government support\" and was \"founded by celebrity developers.\" The company later apologized for any implication that Meyer's brother was supporting the project, and she pulled out of a presentation to Chinese investors scheduled for this past weekend. Mr. Trump's name already appears on another New Jersey residential tower, Trump Bay Street, built with the help of EB-5 funding. And one month before the November election, an ad appeared on a Chinese website catering to foreigners seeking a \"white American to join our team\" for a new project: \"A 200 million dollar hotel developed by The Trump Organization in Austin.\" A brochure posted online described Mr. Trump as the \"king of real estate\" and included a photo of him giving a speech. White House press secretary Sean Spicer this month said Kushner would follow government policies on potential conflicts of interest, and that the president and Congress would review \"all the various visa programs and whether or not they are serving the purpose that they were intended to.\" The AP obtained data from officials in 13 countries on how many Chinese have used their investor programs since 2007. To estimate money spent, the organization multiplied the numbers of Chinese investors in each country by the minimum investment required, making the figures an undercount. The market leader is the United States' EB-5 program, which gives green cards to anyone who invests $500,000 in a business that creates or saves at least 10 jobs. Several others market themselves as cheaper or quicker alternatives. Portugal has drawn at least $1.7 billion over four years from Chinese investors willing to buy property to support its faltering real estate market. Spain and Greece offer similar programs. Chinese have bought the most visas in all three countries. Five Caribbean nations offer passports for as little as $100,000. Chinese are the top buyers in Antigua and Barbuda, according to government statistics. Australia goes the more expensive route, requiring an investment of 5 million Australian dollars (nearly $3.7 million). Despite a price nearly eight times as high as the EB-5 program, Australia is estimated to have attracted more than $6 billion in Chinese investment in just four years. But problems in the industry worldwide are rife. The U.S.'s EB-5 program has been heavily criticized by government watchdogs and targeted by lawmakers of both parties in Congress, who say it promotes fraud and helps developers building megaprojects more than struggling communities. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat who has introduced legislation to end the program, has called EB-5 a \"Ponzi scheme.\" Her Republican counterpart, Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, has said EB-5 \"poses significant national security risks\" and \"may be facilitating terrorist travel, economic espionage, money laundering and investment fraud.\" Federal investigators said in April they found that at least three Chinese investors who obtained green cards through the program were fugitives wanted by Beijing. And the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has opened more than a dozen civil cases since 2013 alleging fraud in projects involving around 2,000 investors and more than $1 billion in funds. Defenders of the EB-5 program say it creates jobs and provides vital funding for projects across the United States, from massive developments in New York to hotels, restaurants and small businesses in the Midwest and on the West Coast. \"That's the program working as it should, and more often than not, it is working as it should,\" said Matthew Galati, a Philadelphia-based attorney who helps Chinese investors migrate to the U.S. Canada's program drew an estimated $2.4 billion through Chinese investors over the past decade, but the national government ended it in 2014, saying that it \"significantly undervalued\" Canadian residency and created little economic benefit. The province of Quebec has kept in place its separate program, which has drawn at least $1.9 billion from Chinese investment. And a former Portuguese interior minister and other senior government officials have been on trial since February for corruption, influence-peddling and misconduct in handling \"golden visa\" applications of investors linked to three Chinese businessmen. Hungary suspended its program selling visas for government bonds earlier this year after opposition parties and watchdogs accused it of corruption. Ironically, calls to end investment migration programs often end up as marketing tools for the hundreds of agents selling them in China. One agent made note of proposals to change the EB-5 program by saying, \"Do not hesitate, and act quickly!\" Du Juan attended a seminar in Beijing held by an investment group pitching ski resorts and other projects. She knows the potential danger of investing through the U.S. program, but she's willing to bear the risk as long as she can get her 10-year-old daughter enrolled soon in an American school. \"I don't worry about the $500,000, but I worry about the loss of time,\" Du said. \"I am afraid that we'll be unable to get the visa when we need it.\" There are signs that China is trying to slow down its exodus. These investors are among the category of people China hopes will buy its domestically made rice cookers, electric cars and energy-saving light bulbs to fuel a new chapter of consumer-led growth. Research by McKinsey shows that the upper-middle class already accounts for a fifth of China's private consumption in cities. Articles critical of investment visa programs have appeared in China's state media, often highlighting fraud cases or stories of Chinese who faced trouble after going abroad. China has also tightened controls on how much money individuals and companies can move out of the country as part of broader efforts to stop the currency from further weakening. Banks are expected to enforce more strictly the yearly limit of $50,000 that individuals are allowed to take out of the country, and will be required to report any transfers above $10,000. Still, Chinese have typically worked around such controls by moving money slowly or by using friends and family members to help them amass an overseas account. If China, which doesn't recognize dual nationality, can't keep entrepreneurs and middle-class families from leaving, it risks endangering its economic future. That includes people like Joey, a 30-year-old Beijing resident who works for a major Chinese state-owned conglomerate. He shared his story on the condition that his last name not be used because he hadn't told his employer of his plans. Joey and his fianc\u00e9e have a two-bedroom apartment and plan to get married and have a child in China. Despite their seemingly bright future, they want to raise that child elsewhere. His friends and relatives helped him move enough money offshore to invest in the American EB-5 program. Joey says he's seen parents and children struggling to breathe outside in China's smoggy air, and signs that China's economy is headed for deeper trouble. \"In China, you have to plan ahead,\" Joey said. \"You cannot just leave today, whenever you want. You never know what happens next.\"",

            "article_content": "The cartoonist who created Pepe the Frog has killed off the character in a rebuke to far-right extremists who transformed a benevolent internet meme into a racist, anti-Semitic symbol. A Pepe cartoon released Saturday in comic book stores shows Matt Furie's creation in an open casket. Furie didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment Monday. Matt Furie with a great single page send-off. #freecomicbookday #mattfurie https://t.co/lKGUL9lmyd pic.twitter.com/qhngOyoVPV In a Time magazine essay last year, Furie described Pepe as \"chill frog-dude\" who debuted in a 2006 comic book called \"Boy's Club\" and became a popular online subject for user-generated mutations. But internet trolls hijacked the character and began flooding social media with hateful Pepe memes more than a year before the 2016 presidential election. Pepe became a tongue-in-cheek symbol of the \"alt-right\" fringe movement and its loosely connected brand of white nationalism, neo-Nazism and anti-immigration. Pepe memes promoting Donald Trump's presidential campaign became so ubiquitous that Trump himself tweeted an image blending his likeness with the cartoon frog in October 2015. \"@codyave:  @drudgereport @BreitbartNews @Writeintrump \"You Can't Stump the Trump\" https://t.co/0xITB7XeJV pic.twitter.com/iF6S05se2w\" Pepe the Frog also took off after pop singer Katy Perry tweeted the following as a \"sad frog\" meme: Australian jet lag got me like pic.twitter.com/kriAAd6mZe The Anti-Defamation League branded Pepe as a hate symbol in September 2016 and promoted Furie's efforts to reclaim the character, with a social media campaign using the \"#SavePepe\" hashtag. \"That's a huge challenge,\" said Oren Segal, director of the ADL's Center on Extremism. \"It just didn't pick up.\" Segal said he doubts Pepe's cartoon death will erode his iconic status with the \"alt-right\" movement. Richard Spencer, a white nationalist who popularized the term \"alt-right,\" said it could have the opposite effect. \"The artist isn't in control of his work once it enters the culture in the way it has,\" Spencer said. Kyle Bristow, a Michigan attorney who founded a self-described \"alt-right\" nonprofit educational group called the Foundation for the Marketplace of Ideas, said he already has seen a meme depicting Pepe as Jesus rising from the dead. \"The Republicans have an elephant. The Democrats have a donkey. The alt-right has a cartoon frog,\" Bristow said with a laugh. Furie wasn't amused by how his creation became an \"icon of hate,\" calling it a \"nightmare\" in his Time essay. \"Before he got wrapped up in politics, Pepe was an inside-joke and a symbol for feeling sad or feeling good and many things in between,\" Furie wrote. \"I understand that it's out of my control, but in the end, Pepe is whatever you say he is, and I, the creator, say that Pepe is love.\" Fantagraphics, which published \"Boy's Club,\" also published the one-page strip in which Furie killed off Pepe. Fantagraphics spokeswoman Jacq Cohen said she would be surprised if Furie never draws Pepe again but she hadn't discussed his plans for the character with him. \"This whole Pepe co-opting experience has been pretty rough on Matt as an independent artist,\" Cohen said.",

            "article_content": "RICHMOND, Va. -- A challenge to President Donald Trump's revised travel ban appears to hinge on whether a federal appeals court agrees that the Republican's past anti-Muslim statements can be used against him. For over two hours a panel of 13 judges from the 4th Circuit grilled lawyers from the Justice Department and the ACLU about the legality of the president's revised travel ban, CBS News' Paula Reid reported.\u00a0 The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals wrestled Monday with whether the court should look beyond the text of the executive order to comments made by Trump and his aides on the campaign trail and after his election in order to determine whether the policy illegally targets Muslims. \"That's the most important issue in the whole case,\" said Judge Robert King, who was appointed to the court by President Bill Clinton. The 13 judges peppered both sides with tough questions but gave few clues as to how they might rule. The judges did not immediately issue a decision on Monday. A federal judge in Maryland who blocked the travel ban in March cited Trump's comments as evidence that the executive order is a realization of his repeated promise to bar Muslims from entering the country. The administration argues that the court shouldn't question the president's national security decisions based on campaign promises. \"This is not a Muslim ban. Its text doesn't have to anything to do with religion. Its operation doesn't have anything to do with religion,\" Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall told the appeals court. The countries were chosen because they present terrorism risks and the ban applies to everyone in those countries regardless of religion, Wall said. Further, the banned countries represent a small fraction of the world's Muslim-majority nations, lawyers for the administration say. Wall, according to Reid, also argued that the president wanted time to review vetting procedures, although he admitted the government has not been able to fully assess those procedures because of the obstacles posed by litigation. Omar Jadwat, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, noted that Trump had called for a \"total and complete shutdown\" of Muslims entering the U.S. remained on his campaign website even after he took office. That call, which was still online earlier Monday, appeared to have been taken down by the afternoon hearing. Jadwat claims the administration has failed to provide a legitimate national security reason for the policy. \"The order is completely unprecedented in our nation's history,\" Jadwat said. Several judges expressed skepticism about the idea that the court would blind itself to Trump's comments about Muslims. \"Don't we get to consider what was actually said here and said very explicitly?\" asked Judge James Wynn Jr., who was appointed by President Barack Obama. Another judge said he was worried about the idea of a court opening the door to using a president's past to evaluate the constitutionality of a policy. \"Can we look at his college speeches? How about his speeches to businessmen 20 years ago?\" asked Judge Paul Niemeyer, who was tapped by President George H.W. Bush. The first travel ban in January triggered chaos and protests across the country as travelers were stopped from boarding international flights and detained at airports for hours. After a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused in February to let the travel ban take effect, the administration tweaked the order and issued a new one. The new version made it clear the 90-day ban covering those six countries doesn't apply to those who already have valid visas. It removed language that would give priority to religious minorities and erased Iraq from the list of banned countries. But critics said while the new executive order impacts fewer people, it remains a realization of Trump's promised Muslim ban and cannot stand. The ACLU and National Immigration Law Center brought the case on behalf of several organizations, as well as people who live in the U.S. and fear the executive order will prevent them from being reunited with family members from the banned countries. Elite universities, democratic attorneys general and former foreign policy and national security officials like ex-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called on the court to block the travel ban. Meanwhile, a group of 12 state attorneys general and the governor of Mississippi argued that the action is not a \"pretext for religious discrimination\" and should be allowed to take effect. Attorneys for the president likely see the moderate 4th Circuit as friendlier territory than the 9th Circuit, which conservatives have long accused of being too liberal. Three 9th Circuit judges appointed by Clinton are scheduled to hear a more-sweeping challenge to Trump's revised travel ban next week. While the 4th Circuit was long considered one of the most conservative appeals courts in the country, it moved to the center under Obama, who appointed six of the 15 active judges. Two Republican-appointed judges - Judge Allyson Duncan and Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III - didn't hear the travel ban case. Wilkinson's daughter is married to the acting solicitor general. It was not immediately clear why Duncan was recused. CBS News' Paula Reid contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "Democrats scored some major victories despite their position in the minority in the bipartisan agreement\u00a0reached late Sunday on legislation that would fund the government through September.\u00a0 The $1.1 trillion omnibus spending package, for example, does not fund President Trump's planned wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, funding for Planned Parenthood is included and the deal would provide the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with a budget boost, rather than the $1.2 billion cut that the White House proposed. Part of the administration's \"skinny budget\" submitted to Congress in March requested $18 billion in cuts to non-defense domestic programs as well as $3 billion in border security funding. None of the $18 billion in cuts is fulfilled in the deal, according to a senior congressional aide, though Republicans have touted cuts that were already built into their appropriations bills. Of the $3 billion requested for border security, the measure would provide $1.5 billion. Lawmakers are expected to vote on the comprehensive deal by Friday night, before government funding expires. It would keep the government funded through Sept. 30. Vice President Mike Pence told \"CBS This Morning\" on Monday that the president signed off on the parameters of the deal on Sunday, before negotiators put on the finishing touches. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said Sunday it's a \"good agreement for the American people and takes the threat of a government shutdown off the table.\" Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, said Monday morning that the country will be \"stronger and safer because of this government funding bill.\" Here are some of the major highlights, and the winners and losers: The White House dropped its demand last week to include funding for a border wall in the package after Democrats made clear that they'd oppose any bill that includes it. Republicans need 60 votes in the Senate to advance the package to a final vote, which they can't do without Democrats. The bill would allot $772 million to Customs and Border Protection for the maintenance and improvements to existing infrastructure, an increase in hiring of border patrol agents and new technology.  While the measure excludes wall funding, it requires the administration to craft a plan to improve border security that includes \"personnel, fencing, other forms of tactical infrastructure and technology.\" If enacted, after three months, the package also requires the Homeland Security secretary to deliver a \"detailed implementation schedule\" for the next five fiscal years that points to \"planned locations\" of \"fencing\" or \"other physical barriers.\"  There are also no federal spending cuts to \"sanctuary cities,\" which protect undocumented immigrants who might otherwise be deported by federal immigration law enforcement officials.  The president lost out on a number of key domestic areas, but his big win is a $25 billion spending increase for the U.S. military over the 2016 level. The bill includes more than $76 billion for the Pentagon's war fund, known as the overseas contingency operations (OCO) account, used for operations overseas such as those against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).  The measure, however, withholds $2.5 billion of war-related funding until Mr. Trump submits his comprehensive plan to defeat ISIS to Congress, according to a summary prepared by Democrats. It said, \"The plan shall include benchmarks for progress in defeating ISIS and directs the secretary of defense and secretary of state to provide quarterly updates to Congress.\"  It also directs the president to submit a report to Congress on the administration's policy toward Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime and a \"strategy to address the suffering of the civilian population of Syria.\" This follows the president's decision to authorize missile strikes against the regime after it launched a deadly chemical attack against its own people. Republicans say the legislation rejects the proposed troop reductions from the Obama administration and instead provides funds that would cover an additional 1,000 active-duty soldiers for the Army, 1,000 Army National Guard soldiers, 1,000 active-duty Marines and 1,000 Army Reserve soldiers.  The administration had asked in March for $18 billion in cuts for domestic programs, but as CBS News reported earlier this month, they were expected to be ignored in the deal. But rather than cutting, the senior congressional aide said the funding levels for domestic programs would actually increase under the bill. The NIH would receive a $2 billion increase over 2016 spending levels, which prioritizes funding for research related to the brain, antibiotic resistance, Alzheimer's Disease and the Precision Medicine Initiative.  Even though Mr. Trump called for a 31 percent funding cut to EPA in his March budget for 2018, negotiators decided to only cut 1 percent from its budget for 2017. The spending package cuts $80 million from the agency's $8 billion budget, which Democrats couched as 99 percent of EPA's budget being protected. Republicans, on the other hand, pointed out that it rejects proposed staffing increases from Obama and maintains staffing at 15,000 positions, which they said is the lowest in nearly 30 years. Originally, Republicans had proposed slashing up to $200 million from the EPA. Democrats cheered the fact that the package continues funding to Planned Parenthood, which provides services for women's health. Federal funding is barred for abortions, and besides, Republicans said that budget reconciliation is the better avenue for its long-held desire to defund the organization. In 2015, their efforts to defund the group almost led to a government shutdown.\u00a0 Republicans and Democrats had argued over Obamacare's cost-sharing payments, which subsidize insurers to help them keep health care costs lower for poorer consumers. The appropriation for the payments comes from the White House, and the president has threatened to stop the payments. During the Obama administration, the GOP-controlled House sued the White House, arguing that the Executive Branch doesn't have the right to appropriate funds. Democrats had wanted Congress to fund the payments. This fight ends in a draw -- Congress will not be making the payments, and the White House will continue to appropriate the funds. Since the election, Democrats have called on the GOP majority to reimburse the New York Police Department (NYPD) for the costs incurred for protecting the president during the transition period at Trump Tower in Manhattan. This is another item they won in the spending deal, which totals $61 million that will be reimbursed to any local law enforcement agency, including in Florida, that has protected the president-elect, president and the rest of the first family.  In the wake of Russia's cybersecurity attacks during the 2016 election, the measure includes funding boosts to the Department of Homeland Security's National Protection and Programs Directorate that protects networks from cyberattacks, espionage and data theft. The extra money is targeted for diagnostics and mitigation, intrusion detection on civilian federal networks and cybersecurity education.  Lawmakers reached a deal to permanently fund health benefits for retired coal miners \"orphaned\" by the bankruptcy of their mining companies. About 22,600 coal miners and their families were at risk of losing their their health care benefits at the end of April, though Congress last week extended them until this Friday.  Democrats were also pleased about blocking what they call \"poison pill\" provisions that Republicans were pushing. They were able to head off the inclusion of one rider that that would have affected the FDA's final rule on menu labeling, another that would have restricted travel and transactions with Cuba, and one more that would have strengthened states' rights, they said, in light of North Carolina's HB-2 law. Meanwhile, Republicans maintain the provision that prevents funding from being used to house, release or transfer detainees housed at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. If Congress is able to pass the omnibus this week, the next spending showdown is expected this fall, since they'll need to pass a new package by Oct. 1. Lawmakers will likely have to strike a budget deal to lift spending caps put in place by a 2011 law and then find a way to address raising the debt ceiling.

            "article_content": "CAIRO -- Egypt\u2019s President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, a former general who was elected but rules with a heavy hand, may find a kindred spirit in Donald Trump this week. The two first met in September at New York\u2019s Plaza Hotel, with the U.S. president calling el-Sissi \u201ca fantastic guy\u201d and proclaiming \u201cgood chemistry\u201d in a meeting that boosted a struggling candidate short on foreign policy experience. Soon el-Sissi became the first foreign leader to congratulate Trump on his surprise electoral win, his office says. On Monday he visits the White House. That contrasts sharply with el-Sissi\u2019s distress under President Barack Obama, who seemed far more sensitive to human rights abuses than his successor, holding up various forms of assistance and never inviting el-Sissi to Washington. El-Sissi is hardly cut from Trump cloth: He is a somewhat taciturn career military man, while his host is a brash real estate developer and reality TV star who inherited a fortune. Yet their instincts and language seem strikingly similar: BAD PEOPLE Trump often speaks of \u201cbad people\u201d seeking to infiltrate the United States, using the term to justify attempted visa bans for nationals of various Muslim countries and to slam illegal immigration from Mexico. El-Sissi often speaks of \u201cevil people\u201d seeking to undermine Egypt, seeming to reference the once-governing Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group he overthrew, banned and declared a terrorist organization, as well as the Islamic State group which has launched attacks in Egypt. Some see a hint at mysterious other foreign powers as well. FAKE NEWS In el-Sissi\u2019s Egypt, journalists have been imprisoned on charges of disseminating \u201cfalse news,\u201d and information that contradicts official statements can lead to prosecution. El-Sissi has also said that \u201cthe media and the state should not disagree.\u201d Trump hasn\u2019t come close to arresting journalists, but he does rail against reporters he doesn\u2019t like, often dismissing critical stories and even entire media outlets as \u201cfake news\u201d regardless of the facts. He also has bitterly criticized the use of anonymous sources. GREAT AGAIN Trump\u2019s controversial borrowed slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d struck a nostalgic chord among certain Americans who yearn for what they view as a simpler time of unabashed national greatness. Many Egyptians are also proud of past glories and despondent over present decline - which el-Sissi has tapped into with skill. \u201cLong Live Egypt\u201d was a mantra, as is \u201cEgypt is the Mother of the World and will become as big as the world.\u201d Both seek greatness in massive projects: Trump wants a wall on the Mexico border and other infrastructure upgrades; el-Sissi has launched a much-ballyhooed widening of the Suez Canal, roadworks and ambitious plans to build a new capital city. WINNING Both leaders whip up supporters with talk of victories and seek to project a mystic sense of inevitable success. El-Sissi frequently claims Egypt is winning its continuing war on terrorism in the Sinai Peninsula and has urged people to not \u201clisten to anybody\u2019s words but me.\u201d Trump promised to make Americans \u201cbored from so much winning,\u201d speaks of himself in singular terms and frequently references his surprise election victory. SO-CALLED JUDGES Trump\u2019s attacks on the judiciary for blocking his executive orders have led him to refer to \u201cso-called\u201d judges and to tweet that the public should blame them in case of another terrorist attack. El-Sissi has his conflicts with his judiciary, saying that they were \u201cholding back the hands of justice\u201d and should be sentencing more Islamists to death.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, said that a government shutdown would have a \u201cdestabilizing\u201d impact on global affairs amid the ongoing conflict in Syria and as \u201cpotential crisis\u201d is brewing with North Korea.  Rubio, who appeared on CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d Sunday, said a fight over border wall funding is a \u201cfight worth having\u201d but that the \u201clast thing\u201d the U.S. can afford is the appearance that the country is \u201conly partially functioning.\u201d Congress has until Friday to pass spending legislation to avoid a shutdown, and White House budget director Mick Mulvaney has indicated border wall funding is a top priority. \u201cUunderstand we\u2019re just trying to finish out the current cycle, the current budget year,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAnd so I think that\u2019s a fight worth having and a conversation and a debate worth having for 2018. And if we can do some of that now, that\u2019d be great.\u201d  \u201cBut we cannot shut down the government right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a potential crisis brewing with North Korea. We\u2019ve seen what\u2019s going on-- the ongoing crisis in Syria. We don\u2019t know what the outcome of the French election is going to be, but that could potentially throw the European Union and the NATO alliance into some level of consternation.\u201d  \u201cThe last thing we can afford is to send a message to the world that the United States government, by the way, is only partially functioning,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cI mean, that would just have catastrophic impact in my view or certainly very destabilizing, I should say, impact on global affairs.\u201d  Asked if the U.S. is going to war with North Korea, Rubio said, \u201cI hope not.\u201d He also said that the possibility of North Korea launching nuclear weapons and hitting the U.S. is an \u201cunacceptable risk,\u201d he said. Rubio\u2019s interview came briefly after\u00a0reports that North Korea has detained a third U.S. citizen. \u201cObviously we have to ask ourselves a very fundamental question,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAnd that is: Is it acceptable? Can we live in a world where Kim Jung-un possesses not just nuclear weapons but the ability to deliver those weapons against the continental United States? Can we live in a world like that?\u201d  \u201cIf the answer is yes, then I suppose that, you know, there\u2019s all sorts of things we would not do,\u201d Rubio continued. \u201cIf the answer is no, then the options -- and the answer is no for me -- then the options before you are truly quite limited. And none of them are good. I mean, none of those options are good. But it is my view at the end of the day that we must do almost whatever it takes, just about anything, to prevent Kim Jung-un from acquiring a nuclear capability he can deliver against the mainland of the United States of America.\u201d  Rubio, who had reservations on the campaign trail about then-candidate Donald Trump\u2019s ability to handle foreign affairs, said he believes President Trump is handling North Korea \u201cwith the seriousness that this deserves.\u201d  Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

He was asked about the alleged remark in an interview that aired on NPR\u2019s \u201cMorning Edition\u201d Thursday. New York Magazine reported last month that Bush had made the comment, citing three people who were also present at the ceremony.  \u201cIf I said it, I don\u2019t remember it,\u201d Bush said in an interview on NPR\u2019s \u201cMorning Edition,\u201d adding that the inauguration is a \u201cbeautiful experience\u201d because it\u2019s the peaceful transition of power. He does, however, clearly remember his awkward response to rain that day. \u201cI wish I got the rain poncho on a little more cleanly,\u201d Bush joked, referring to his struggle to put on a transparent poncho during the ceremony as it began to rain. \u201cMy daughters were aghast. \u2018Dad, you\u2019re a national tweet sensation. You\u2019re trending,\u2019 or whatever the words are. I said, \u2018I don\u2019t know what the heck that means.\u2019 But then I saw the pictures and I can see why I was trending.\u201d Asked again if he made the \u201cweird s***\u201d comment, Bush said, \u201cI just don\u2019t remember, David. I really don\u2019t.\u201d  The former president also discussed the debate over immigration reform and he said that he think the plan he outlined during his administration that would have provided a path to citizenship will eventually be implemented in some form. \u201cLet\u2019s discuss the issue of people here illegally. What are the options? Do nothing? I think that option\u2019s been bypassed because of the election -- people talked about it a lot. Secondly, legalize everybody and that option simply won\u2019t work. Then what do you do? My judgment is there needs to be a way for somebody to be able to get in line to become a citizen so long as they met certain criteria.\u201d Bush said on the idea of building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, \u201cWell, I built a wall...It\u2019s not going to be a brick wall all the way across Mexico.\u201d Rebecca Shabad is a video reporter for CBS News Digital.",

The two parties have not disclosed the terms of the settlement.\u00a0 Mr. Trump sued Andr\u00e9s for $10 million in 2015, and Andr\u00e9s, a Spanish immigrant, countersued for $8 million, claiming Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks made it difficult to attract Hispanic staff or customers. Andr\u00e9s offered to settle that suit in February.\u00a0 \u201cI am glad that we are able to put this matter behind us and move forward as friends,\u201d Donald Trump, Jr., said in joint news release with the chef\u2019s firm, ThinkFoodGroup. \u201cSince opening in September 2016, Trump International Hotel, Washington, D.C. has been an incredible success and our entire team has great respect for the accomplishments of both Jos\u00e9 and TFG. Without question, this is a \u2018win-win\u2019 for both of our companies.\u201d Andr\u00e9s, in the statement, said he was \u201cpleased that we were able to resolve our differences and move forward cooperatively, as friends.\u201d The dispute began after Mr. Trump said referred to some Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists during his June 2015 presidential announcement. Andr\u00e9s backed out of his lease to open a restaurant, prompting Mr. Trump to respond with a lawsuit. Mr. Trump, after his election, was deposed in the lawsuit and answered questions under oath. Mr. Trump has been involved in at least 3,500 legal actions over the last 30 years, according to a USA Today analysis. On his first Monday in office, Mr. Trump was sued by ethics lawyers for the previous two presidents who claimed he already had constitutional ethics violations involving his businesses.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump makes predictions. They vary in topic and degree of import \u2014 from celebrity relationships to global political events \u2014 but they are a recurring staple of his digital and public presence. The president, a billionaire who delights in tweaking\u00a0\u201chaters and losers\u201d on social media, seems to relish the moments when he believes his predictions are proven correct \u2014\u00a0 even on some occasions when the evidence suggests otherwise. This is one takeaway, among many, from his interview with TIME magazine published on Thursday. \u00a0 As he shares predictions with his millions of followers on Twitter, Mr. Trump\u2019s forays into soothsaying are not always borne out. How does the president respond when asked about his inaccurate predictions, or his many public statements and pronouncements that have been debunked or proven false? In the TIME interview, he conceded nothing. \u201cWhat have I said that is wrong?\u201d Trump said. Elsewhere in the interview, he mused, \u201cI tend to be right. I\u2019m an instinctual person, I happen to be a person that knows how life works. I said I was going to win the election, I won the election.\u201d The president\u2019s headline-driving Twitter account \u2014 the very existence of which has been endlessly scrutinized, and a source of fascination or disbelief, depending on whom you ask \u2014 is a good source of material for assessing his relationship with truth, falsehoods, predictions and validation.\u00a0 He often peppers his tweets with the phrase: \u201cJust as I predicted.\u201d\u00a0 The habit dates back at least to 2011, when he declared, \u201cJust as I predicted,\u00a0@Joe_Biden\u00a0was a complete disaster in China.\u201d Just as I predicted, @Joe_Biden was a complete disaster in China. He condoned the Chinese one-child policy an\u2026 (cont) http://t.co/M3TnJw5 The armchair prognostication extends far beyond politics.\u00a0 \u201cJust as I predicted\u201d appears in tweets about Seth Meyers\u2019 2014 Emmys ratings (he \u201cbombed,\u201d Trump then wrote) or Rosie O\u2019Donnell\u2019s return to The View (\u201cjust as I predicted,\u201d she \u201cwould fail\u201d).  In 2012 and 2013, before the Iran nuclear deal was announced, Mr. Trump appeared to have another hunch: that then-President Obama would \u201cat some point\u201d attack Iran.  Just as I predicted, @BarackObama is preparing a possible attack on Iran right before November. http://t.co/ISaJp1xo I predict that President Obama will at some point attack Iran in order to save face! Remember that I predicted a long time ago that President Obama will attack Iran because of his inability to negotiate properly-not skilled! Of course, an attack on Iran did not happen during Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency.\u00a0 Another popular topic for Trump predictions involves the mainstream media. ... I will soon start naming magazines that I think will fold--I predicted Newsweek. Remember I predicted that New York Magazine would  fold and people scoffed? Just announced (N.Y.Post) it lost big $'s & is cutting way back! Newsweek and New York Magazine have not folded, and the New York Post is still churning out daily headlines \u2014 often in support of President Trump. Mr. Trump seldom mentions the predictions that failed to come to fruition. In other instances, he asserts that he\u2019s been proven right, even if there was scant evidence of the initial prediction.  @Anon_Farmer @PeaceLibLady   Not me, I predicted the housing bubble and told people not to buy.  I now tell people it is a great time to buy His claim \u2014 that he accurately predicted the 2008 housing market crash \u2014 is muddy, at best. In a 2006 audiobook, intially reported by CNN in May 2016, Trump says he \u201csort of hopes\u201d the housing bubble will burst. It\u2019s not a full-throated forecast, but a moderately vague pronouncement \u2014 one that could be easily leaned into should it come true (it did). Notably, in the TIME interview, Mr. Trump makes 11 references to Brexit. \u201cI predicted Brexit,\u201d he tells the reporter three separate times. His certainty about the outcome of June 2016 vote, he believes, is demonstrative of his instincts.  In this instance, there\u2019s plenty of evidence to support Mr. Trump. \u201cI think that Britain will separate from the EU,\u201d then-candidate Trump told a British TV show in March 2016, three months before the vote. \u201cI think that maybe it\u2019s time, especially in light of what\u2019s happened with the craziness that is going on with immigration.\u201d His prediction that Brexit would pass was especially significant at a time when most experts were saying the opposite. He repeated a similar sentiment to Fox News in May 2016: \u00a0\u201cI would say that they\u2019re better off without it, personally, but I\u2019m not making that as a recommendation. Just my feeling.\u201d\u00a0 Sports bettors, stock traders, actuaries and clairvoyants can likely agree that those who traffic in predictions will inevitably get it wrong. Does Mr. Trump have concerns about his credibility taking a hit if he makes predictions that are later proven incorrect? \u201cThe country believes me,\u201d he said. \u00a0\u00a0",

            "article_content": "VIENNA - Austria was among the first countries in Europe to put out the welcome mat when waves of people fleeing war and poverty reached the continent. Now, its focus is showing them the door. Parliament is set to pass a law stripping pocket money, food and shelter from those denied asylum, potentially leaving them on the street. The interior minister proudly touts figures showing Austria as the European Union\u2019s per-capita leader in expelling those rejected. Austrian courts are toughening up too. On Thursday, eight Iraqi men were sent to prison for up to 13 years for the gang rape of a German woman on New Year\u2019s Eve more than a year ago. Lawyer Andreas Reichenbach, who defended one of the men, said the stiff sentences were a signal to migrants that \u201cwhen they come to Austria, that such behavior won\u2019t be tolerated.\u201d In Germany, where during the height of the influx Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted \u201cwe will manage,\u201d the government now considers some areas of Afghanistan \u201csafe,\u201d and has started returning failed asylum-seekers to those regions. Additional tough measures have followed Berlin\u2019s deadly Christmas market attack by rejected Tunisian asylum-seeker Anis Amri and gains by the nationalist Alternative for Germany party. The pro-migrant attitudes that once led thousands of Austrian volunteers to turn out with food, shelter and advice to the first asylum-seekers are still heard some places, but they appear outnumbered. \u201cWe have to keep welcoming those who have nowhere else to go,\u201d said Marlis Bosch. \u201cWe in Austria have more than enough to share.\u201d A survey of 10 EU member countries last month showed 65 percent of the 1,000 Austrian respondents favored stopping all immigration from Muslim nations. Only Poles scored higher - at 71 percent - on Britain\u2019s Royal Institute of International Affairs survey. But anti-migrant sentiment in Poland has been fueled by the government. Not so in Austria. Former Chancellor Werner Faymann urged Austrians to deal generously with migrants as late as fall 2015, even as his government worked to secure its borders. But he was forced out last year after migrant policies threatened to tear apart his government coalition after he took a harder line. His successor, Christian Kern, has found little choice but to stay tough - or risk boosting the right-wing Freedom Party and its message that migrants are overwhelmingly behind the kind of crimes the eight Iraqis were convicted of Thursday. Freedom Party candidate Norbert Hofer, who advocates a tough line on migrants, was narrowly defeated in December in Austria\u2019s presidential election. Polls continue to show his populist party with the most voter support. But Kern\u2019s Social Democrats have almost caught up since he took office less than nine months ago and continued hardening the country\u2019s migrant policies. Also gaining support on a tougher migrant stance is the centrist People\u2019s Party, the Social Democrats\u2019 coalition partner. Party member Sebastian Kurz, Austria\u2019s foreign minister, is advocating setting up North African holding camps for would-be emigres from there. The Austrian government plans to stop all support for those whose asylum requests have been rejected - including meals, shelter and a monthly allowance of 40 euros (about $40). If Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka has his way, those refusing to leave will also pay high fines and end up in compounds until they are forcibly deported. The coalition\u2019s majority in parliament means that approval of the draft law is virtually certain. Still, some members of Kern\u2019s Social Democratic party have joined with human rights advocates who say its passage could lead to increased misery for thousands and a possible rise in crime. \u201cFamilies with children, or the sick, all could end up on the street from one day or the other,\u201d warns Christoph Pinter of the U.N. refugee organization UNHCR. Sobotka shrugs, reflecting Austria\u2019s sharp about-turn on migrants. \u201cWho is contravening the law - me or those who do not leave the country?\u201d he asked reporters.\u00a0 \u201cMy responsibility is enforcing the law.\u201d",

Booker\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment about his West Coast trip.\u00a0 Following the discussion, the group will have \u201can interactive conversation on ways the entertainment community can establish a substantive working relationship with the Senator and help ensure continued progress on key causes in the years to come,\u201d the invitation reads.

            "article_content": "AUSTIN, Texas --\u00a0Federal judges found more problems in Texas\u2019 voting rights laws, ruling that Republicans racially gerrymandered some congressional districts to weaken the growing electoral power of minorities, who former President Obama set out to protect at the ballot box before leaving office.  The ruling late Friday by a three-judge panel in San Antonio gave Democrats hope of new, more favorably drawn maps that could turn over more seats in Congress in 2018. But the judges in their 2-1 decision didn\u2019t propose an immediate fix, and Texas could appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Republicans hold two of three congressional districts ruled newly invalid and were found to have been partly drawn with discriminatory intent. The GOP-controlled Texas Legislature approved the maps in 2011, the same year then-Gov. Rick Perry signed a voter ID law that ranks among the toughest in the U.S. Courts have since weakened that law, too.\u00a0 \u201cThe Court has repudiated the Republican refusal to treat Hispanics fairly in accordance with the Voting Rights Act,\u201d U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat, told\u00a0CBS affiliate KENS. \u201cIt requires the creation of genuine Hispanic-influence districts, not crooked lines that are only designed to increase Republican domination.\u201d Judges noted the \u201cstrong racial tension and heated debate about Latinos, Spanish-speaking people, undocumented immigrants and sanctuary cities\u201d that served as the backdrop in the Legislature to Texas adopting the maps and the voter ID law. Those tensions are flaring again over President Trump\u2019s executive orders on immigration, and Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is also demanding tough crackdowns on so-called sanctuary cities.  \u201cThe record indicates not just a hostility toward Democrat districts, but a hostility to minority districts, and a willingness to use race for partisan advantage,\u201d U.S. District Judges Xavier Rodriguez and Orlando Garcia wrote in their opinion.  Crunching the Numbers: Can Congress change? Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton did not immediately remark on the ruling.\u00a0 An attorney for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund welcomed Friday\u2019s ruling.\u00a0 \u201cThe court\u2019s decision exposes the Texas Legislature\u2019s illegal effort to dilute the vote of Texas Latinos,\u201d said Nina Perales, the group\u2019s vice president of litigation and lead counsel in the case. \u201cMoving forward, the ruling will help protect Latinos from manipulation of district lines in order to reduce their political clout.\u201d  Hispanics were found to have fueled Texas\u2019 dramatic growth in the 2010 census, the year before the maps were drawn, accounting for two out of every three new residents in the state. The findings of racially motivated mapmaking satisfied Democrats and minority rights groups, who are now pushing a separate federal court in Texas to determine that the voter ID law was also crafted with discriminatory intent.\u00a0 Texas was forced ahead of the November election to weaken its voter ID law, which allows concealed handgun licenses but not college student IDs, after a federal appeals court found that the requirements particularly hampered minorities and the poor.  The Obama administration had brought the muscle of the U.S. Justice Department into Texas to help challenge both the maps and voter ID law. But barely a month after Mr. Trump took office, the federal government reversed course and announced it would no longer argue that Texas purposefully discriminated against minorities with its voter ID law.  It was not yet clear whether the Trump administration will also drop opposition to Texas\u2019 maps. But U.S. Circuit Judge Jerry Smith, in a blistering dissent, had strong words for Obama administration attorneys after they joined the case.  \u201cIt was obvious, from the start, that the DoJ attorneys viewed state officials and the legislative majority and their staffs as a bunch of backwoods hayseed bigots who bemoan the abolition of the poll tax and pine for the days of literacy tests and lynchings,\u201d Smith wrote. \u201cAnd the DoJ lawyers saw themselves as an expeditionary landing party arriving here, just in time, to rescue the state from oppression, obviously presuming that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel were not up to the task.\u201d  The stakes in finding discriminatory intent are higher because it provides a window for opponents to argue that Texas should be forced to resume having changes to voting laws \u201cpre-cleared\u201d by the Justice Department or a federal court. A 2013 U.S. Supreme Court ruling did away with preclearance by striking down a key provision in the federal Voting Rights Act.  The congressional districts voided by the panel belong to Doggett and Republicans Will Hurd and Blake Farenthold. Hurd\u2019s district, which runs from San Antonio to El Paso, has been a rare competitive swing district in Texas in recent years.",

            "article_content": "A man sentenced in May 2016 to 30 months in federal prison for conspiring to act as a secret agent for Russia will receive early release on Saturday and will then be deported, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has spokesman confirmed to CBS News. Federal Bureau of Prisons documents obtained by CBS News cite good behavior in the agency\u2019s decision to grant early release to Evgeny Buryakov, who collected intelligence for Russia while working for a Russian bank in New York City.\u00a0 A spokesman for ICE confirmed that the agency will take custody of Buryakov on Saturday upon his release. \u201cHe will be transferred to ICE custody upon release from Elkton,\u201d said Khaalid Walls, ICE\u2019s Northeast Regional Director of Communications. \u201cTravel arrangements will be finalized in the very near term\u2026but for operational security reasons, we do not confirm removal dates prior to a person\u2019s departure.\u201d The Bureau of Prisons declined a request for comment. Buryakov worked at the New York office of Vnesheconombank, a Russian government-owned bank, before he was arrested in January 2014 and accused of being part of a spy ring that collected intelligence for the S.V.R., Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence agency. Buryakov and two Russians with diplomatic immunity were recorded by the FBI allegedly conspiring to gather economic intelligence and recruit sources in New York City. Buryakov was arrested at his home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, a few blocks from the Russian Embassy Residences, on Jan. 26, 2015. Prosecutors later said an FBI agent posing as an analyst for an energy firm had given Buryakov binders of industry analysis within which were \u201ccovertly placed recording devices.\u201d Russia and Vnesheconombank denied that Buryakov and the bank were involved in espionage, but Vnesheconombank later paid $45,000 as settlement in a lawsuit filed by Buryakov\u2019s landlords. The Bronx homeowners claimed that after Buryakov\u2019s arrest, one of his associates came to his home and did tens of thousands in damage, tearing up walls and furniture. Vnesheconombank did not admit to wrongdoing when settling the case. Vnesheconombank made headlines earlier this week when it confirmed to Reuters that in 2016 its representatives met with then candidate Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who is now senior advisor to the President. Senate investigators plan to question Kushner about the meetings as part of a probe into Russian meddling in the presidential election. Requests for comment to Vnesheconombank and Buryakov\u2019s attorneys were not immediately returned. Buryakov entered a guilty plea in March 2016, and was sentenced two months later. As part of the plea deal, he agreed to be deported following his release. Including time served before his 30-month sentence was imposed by a judge in Manhattan\u2019s federal court, Buryakov has been incarcerated for about 26 months. Originally, July 27 was scheduled to be his date of release from the low-security Federal Correctional Institution in Elkton, Ohio.",

            "article_content": "Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from investigations involving the Trump campaign, he announced at a Thursday afternoon press conference after consulting with Justice Department lawyers about his role in investigations into Russian contacts by Trump campaign associates. Former Obama administration officials are taking issue with a New York Times report published Wednesday night which suggested that Obama aides had disseminated information about Trump campaign associates and Russian officials across the government in order to leave a \u201cclear trail for the intelligence and government investigators\u201d to follow and to ensure that no meddling occurred in other elections -- in the U.S. or overseas.\u00a0 That contention struck at least two officials from the Obama administration as overstated. \u201cTo the extent there was an effort, it was organic on the part of [intelligence] professionals to document and retain,\u201d one official told CBS News. \u201cI was not aware of a strategic White House driven effort to do so.\u201d\u00a0 Russia\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak, has now come up in several communications with President Trump\u2019s associates, officials say, as administration officials look into contact between his team and Russia. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, for instance, has\u00a0come under fire\u00a0after it became known Thursday night that\u00a0he had two contacts with Kislyak during the presidential campaign, Justice Department officials confirmed to CBS News, following an initial report by The Washington Post. Sessions didn\u2019t disclose his two conversations with Kisylak during his Senate confirmation process and it\u2019s unclear what they discussed in their private conversation. \u201cWell, I have not met with any Russians at any time to discuss any political campaign,\u201d Sessions said Thursday. \u201cAnd those remarks are unbelievable to me and are false. And I don\u2019t have anything else to say about that.\u201d Mr. Trump went aboard the Navy\u2019s newest carrier,\u00a0the USS Gerald R. Ford,\u00a0to promote his plans for a military buildup. \u201cWe will give our military the tools you need to prevent war,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201c... And if required, to fight war ... and only do one thing -- you know what that is? Win, Win! We\u2019re going to start winning again.\u201d But as the most expensive ship ever built -- which will begin its sea trials next month -- the Ford stands for something else as well. \u201cThe Ford is a poster child for how you don\u2019t build a ship,\u201d says Ray Mabus. He was\u00a0former Secretary of the Navy\u00a0during the Obama administration. At a\u00a0speech aboard the U.S.S. Gerald Ford, Donald Trump explained how additional defense spending would help the military.\u00a0 \u201cI asked Congress to eliminate the defense sequester,\u201d he said, as well as to support his request for additional defense funding,\u201d he said. \u201cBy eliminating the sequester and the uncertainty it creates, we will make it easier for the navy to plan for the future and thus control costs and get the best deal for the taxpayer,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhich of course is very important, right?\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 The soon-to-be-commissioned Navy warship that cost almost $13 billion and faced delays in its construction. Mr. Trump has proposed\u00a0adding $54 billion\u00a0to the Pentagon\u2019s budget this year, an increase of approximately 10 percent. \u00a0 Donald Trump says he still has confidence in Attorney General Jeff Sessions, as lawmakers call on Sessions to recuse himself from probes into Russian contacts by Trump campaign associates. Asked directly about whether he still had confidence in Sessions, Mr. Trump replied, \u201cTotal.\u201d The president was on the U.S.S. Gerald Ford in Newport News, Virginia and was meeting with Navy and ship officials in what the White House called an operations briefing. Two of President Donald Trump\u2019s former rivals for the GOP White House nomination won Senate confirmation Thursday to join his administration. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson was confirmed as secretary of the Department of House and Urban Development on a vote of 58-41. A few hours later, the Senate backed former Texas Gov. Rick Perry to be energy secretary, 62-37. Carson and Perry are the 17th and 18th of Trump\u2019s 22 Cabinet and Cabinet-level nominations to win Senate approval. The Department of Homeland Security has identified only $20 million in funding that could be shifted to President Trump\u2019s plan to build a wall along the southern border, significantly less than the more than $21 billion price tag, according to Reuters. The money was included in a document obtained by Reuters and prepared by DHS to distribute to congressional staff last week. It would only be enough to cover a handful of contracts for wall prototypes, the report said, but not enough to start building a physical wall. In order to move forward, Congress would need to approve new funding to pay for the wall, but there\u2019s been little movement on such action on Capitol Hill. Last month, Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, said in an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Greta Van Susteren that\u00a0congressional leaders were considering legislation to fund the border wall, drawing on taxpayer dollars despite promises that Mexico would finance the project. Attorney General\u00a0Jeff Sessions\u00a0had\u00a0two contacts with Russian envoy Sergey Kislyak\u00a0during the presidential campaign, Justice Department officials confirmed. The Washington Post first reported the meetings Wednesday. When he was asked in his\u00a0confirmation hearing\u00a0whether anyone associated with Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign had communicated with the Russians, Sessions replied that he wasn\u2019t aware of any such \u201cactivities,\u201d and added, \u201cI did not have communications with the Russians.\u201d A questionnaire he filled out for the committee also asked whether he had had contact with the Russians, to which Sessions, according to the Post, wrote, \u201cNo.\u201d The White House has confirmed to CBS News that\u00a0the White House counsel told the president\u2019s aides to preserve emails and other materials\u00a0that could be connected to various probes regarding Russian interference.\u00a0 A White House official told CBS News\u2019 Margaret Brennan that this is \u201csimply taking proactive steps to push back against false and politically motivated attacks.\u201d Viewers nationwide\u00a0strongly approved of President Trump\u2019s speech Tuesday night, with many Democrats joining Republicans in calling it \u201cpresidential\u201d and positive in tone. Republicans and Independents found it \u201cunifying,\u201d though Democrats were slower to come around on that measure. The President gained support for his policy plans among viewers: Interviewed before and after the address, they came away from it more positive on his ideas for the economy, immigration, terrorism, crime and Obamacare. As is often the case in addresses to Congress, those who watched were more likely to be from the president\u2019s party \u2013 in this case, Republicans. And they described a president they felt was keeping campaign promises and offering an \u201cinspiring\u201d message. Every so often, we get\u00a0one of these moments where he seems so jarringly normal. President Trump\u2019s speech on Tuesday was a success. The remarks were good and, on the Trump scale, delivered quite well.\u00a0 It hit the notes he needed to hit. It was optimistic \u2013 not Trump\u2019s usual speed, but one he now seems equipped to use. But back to the \u201cnormal\u201d thing. That\u2019s been his critics\u2019 big fear, that we would all get over the sheer weirdness of a President Trump, that we\u2019d soon get used to it and accept. That our category for how presidents look, act, and speak would expand to include him. --Will Rahn Vice President Mike\u00a0Pence said Wednesday\u00a0that a report claiming that no significant intelligence was gathered from\u00a0the raid President Trump authorized in Yemen\u00a0last month is \u201cwrong.\u201d In an interview on \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d Pence reiterated what Mr. Trump had said a night earlier in\u00a0his first address to a joint session of Congress. \u201cSecretary Mattis, as recently yesterday, confirmed again to the administration that there was significant intelligence that was gathered that will lead to American success and to the safety and security of the American people,\u201d Pence said about the raid, which he said they were briefed on on Tuesday.

            "article_content": "The nation is not simply divided.\u00a0The last election left many wondering\u00a0if they really understood the views of Americans who disagreed with them, or whether they were truly being heard at all. A single poll number can\u2019t always answer those puzzles, so here we look deeper at all the groups who support and oppose the Trump administration at its outset: who they are, what they want and - most of all - what might change their minds. It turns out that while there are hard-and-fast views on either side of the nation\u2019s divide, the range of President Trump\u2019s potential support - both to the high and low side - is actually bigger than you might think. In this study, people separated themselves into four groups: the strongest of Trump backers (who we\u2019ll call the Believers); those backing him but waiting for him to deliver (the Conditionals); those opposing him for now but waiting to see some results (the Curious) and those who seem immovably, firmly opposed (The Resistors.) We\u2019ll plan to follow these groups over time. Here\u2019s the new CBS/YouGov poll showing how they break down now. In case you missed the show, check out the \u201cFace the Nation\u201d page here. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, chastised President Trump Sunday for his condemnations of the judiciary branch, following a federal court decision\u00a0not to reinstate his travel ban. The Arizona Republican told \u201cFace the Nation\u201d host John Dickerson that while it was \u201cfine to disagree with opinions\u201d of judges, blasting specific judges was inappropriate. \u201cIt\u2019s fine to question the judgment. But to go after individual judges or to talk about them, I think Judge Gorsuch said it right, that is disheartening,\u201d Flake said. \u201cAnd I think that we ought to avoid any personal attacks like that.\u201d On \u201cFace the Nation\u201d Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser to President Trump, weighed in on\u00a0North Korea\u2019s ballistic missile test\u00a0Sunday, defending the president\u2019s response as a \u201cshow of strength\u201d to the Asian nation. \u201cHe went out, stood shoulder to shoulder and sent a message to the whole world that we stand with our allies,\u201d Miller said in an interview with CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d referencing the president\u2019s brief statement Saturday standing beside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Mr. Trump, on Saturday, said the U.S. \u201cstands by\u201d Japan, but did not mention North Korea. \u201cLast night was a show of strength,\u201d Miller said of the president\u2019s remarks. \u201cSaying we stand with our ally, having the two men appear on camera worldwide to all of planet Earth was a statement that will be understood very well by North Korea.\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wants President Trump to abandon his executive order on immigration and start from scratch, following a federal appeals court\u2019s decision\u00a0not to reinstate his travel ban last week. \u201cI think he ought to throw it in the trash,\u201d Schumer said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d Sunday. \u201cI think this executive order is so bad and so poison and its genesis is so bad and terrible that he ought to just throw it in the trashcan.\u201d President Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee has returned a 68-page questionnaire to the Senate Judiciary Committee ahead of confirmation hearings expected in March. In the questionnaire, Judge Neil Gorsuch lists what he considers the 10 most significant cases he presided over while on a federal appeals court. Top of his list is a 2016 case in which he wrote for a panel of judges who sided with a Mexican citizen seeking permission to live in the U.S. Also listed is a 2013 case involving a family business that raised religious objections to paying for contraception for women covered under its health plans. Gorsuch states that none of the opinions he authored has been reversed. The questionnaire also contains a long list of his published writings and speeches. President Trump is hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at his resort in West Palm Beach. Today they teed off for some rounds of golf at Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter. First Lady Melania Trump took Akie Abe on a tour of Morikami Museum and Gardens in Delray Beach. After a report that the cost of building a wall on the southern border could reach $21 billion, the president tweeted this morning: I am reading that the great border WALL will cost more than the government originally thought, but I have not gotten involved in the..... ...design or negotiations yet. When I do, just like with the F-35 FighterJet or the Air Force One Program, price will come WAY DOWN! The president also sent out\u00a0a tweet criticizing the \u201cbroken\u201d legal system. He blasted the recent court decision refusing to reinstate his travel ban as \u201cSO DANGEROUS.\u201d President Trump took aim at the nation\u2019s legal system early Saturday, calling it \u201cbroken\u201d following his administration\u2019s failed challenge to a federal judge\u2019s stay on his travel ban. The president unleashed his criticism of the judicial branch in a tweet Saturday, days after the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decided not to reinstate the ban, which bars refugees and citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S. When a judge who helped derail President\u00a0Trump\u2019s travel ban\u00a0was hit with online threats, the abuse raised safety concerns among jurists across the country, and experts are worried that the president\u2019s own attacks on the judiciary could make judges a more inviting target. U.S. District Judge\u00a0James Robart\u00a0imposed the temporary restraining order that halted enforcement of Mr. Trump\u2019s ban last week. The president soon sent a tweet saying the opinion of \u201cthis so-called judge\u201d was \u201cridiculous and will be overturned.\u201d In\u00a0an interview published Friday with Israel Hayom, the president was asked how soon he would make a decision on relocating the embassy to the holy city of Jerusalem from Tel Aviv -- a controversial shift that could inflame tensions across the Islamic world. \u201cI am thinking about the embassy, I am studying the embassy [issue], and we will see what happens,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe embassy is not an easy decision. It has obviously been out there for many, many years, and nobody has wanted to make that decision. I\u2019m thinking about it very seriously, and we will see what happens.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Late last night, National Security Adviser Michael Flynn resigned.\u00a0 Flynn said in his resignation letter that during the course of his duties as incoming national security adviser he held \u201cnumerous\u201d phone calls with foreign counterparts, ministers and ambassadors that were \u201cto facilitate a smooth transition and begin to build the necessary relationships\u201d between President Trump, his advisers and foreign leaders. \u201cUnfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador,\u201d he said. \u201cI have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology.\u201d Sunday, on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d White House policy adviser Stephen Miller assessed the administration\u2019s ability to handle the frantic pace: \u201cto say that we\u2019re in control would be a substantial understatement.\u201d\u00a0 Today, National Security adviser Michael Flynn resigned. Sunday, a friend of the president, Newsmax editor Chris Ruddy who had\u00a0just shared a late night drink at the White House, went on CNN\u2019s\u00a0Reliable Sources\u00a0and said Chief of Staff Reince Priebus was in over his head. Administration-friendly Breitbart\u00a0reported Tuesday that a list of possible replacements for Priebus is being evaluated as a part of a staff shake-up. The reports of such a shakeup are not just appearing in administration-allied organs, but also\u00a0here,\u00a0here,\u00a0here\u00a0and\u00a0here. A look at the developments in Flynn\u2019s recent past -- from his travel to Russia months before the election through his resignation just over three weeks into his tenure as national security adviser The White House is considering three candidates to serve as President Trump\u2019s national security adviser after\u00a0Gen. Michael Flynn\u2019s resignation from that position\u00a0Monday night. Officials have floated three names, including retired Lt. General Joseph Keith Kellogg, Jr., who\u2019s been named acting national security adviser in the interim. \u00a0Former CIA Director David Petraeus and Vice Admiral Bob Harward, who\u2019s a retired Navy SEAL and a former deputy commander of CENTCOM, or U.S. Central Command, are the other two names. Canadian citizens Fadwa Alaoui and her cousin Fadela Boutaleb were off on one of their quick shopping trips across the border, this time to celebrate Alaoui\u2019s 5-year-old son\u2019s last chemo treatment. But when they arrived at the U.S. border in Highgate Springs, Vermont, the women say they were asked repeated questions about their religion, illegal under us law. Hillary Clinton late Monday weighed in on Twitter on the resignation of Gen. Michael Flynn as President Trump\u2019s national security adviser. The 2016 Democratic presidential nominee retweeted a tweet from her longtime aide, Philippe Reines, who joked about Flynn\u2019s situation, alluding to him and his son spreading the conspiracy theory known as \u201cPizzaGate\u201d that accused Clinton and her former campaign manager of running a child sex slave ring out of Comet Ping Pong, a pizza restaurant near Washington, D.C. Sen. Armed Services chairman John McCain responded to \u201cthis Flynn situation\u201d at the Capitol today. \u201cI think there is significant dysfunction in the national security apparatus of the Trump administration,\u201d McCain said, according to CBS News\u2019 Alan He. \u201cWhen you see they don\u2019t know who\u2019s in charge, this Flynn situation, the whole environment is one of dysfunction in the Trump administration as far as national security concerned.\u201d Earlier, House Speaker Paul Ryan said that Mr. Trump made the right call on Flynn. \u201cI think the president made the right decision to ask for his resignation. You cannot have a national security adviser misleading the vice president and others,\u201d he told reporters, according to CBS News\u2019 Catherine Reynolds. \u201cSo I think the president was right to ask for his resignation, and I believe it was the right thing to do.\u201d \u00a0 The president has lunch with Chris and Mary Pat Christie, 12:30 p.m. President Trump signs H.J. Resolution 41, which nullifies a Dodd-Frank SEC rule requiring oil and gas companies to disclose taxes, fees they pay to foreign governments, 2:30 p.m. He\u2019ll meet with parents and teachers for \u201clistening session,\u201d 10:30 a.m. 10:30a.m. Neil Gorsuch meets with Sen. Joe Donnelly, then Sen. Mazie Hirono at 12:30 p.m.. He meets with Sen. Chris Coons at 2:30 pm. and Sen. Minority Whip Dick Durbin at 3:30 p.m. Senate votes on Linda McMahon\u2019s confirmation to be small business administrator, 11 a.m. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Vice President Pence swears in David Shulkin as Veterans Affairs secretary, 3 p.m. A longtime White House reporter says that\u00a0President Trump\u2019s aide Omarosa Manigault\u00a0\u201cphysically intimidated\u201d her when they got into an argument in the West Wing last week, according to The Washington Post. The reporter, April Ryan of the American Urban Radio Networks, said that the former star of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d intimidated her in a way that could have invited involvement by the Secret Service. \u201cShe stood right in my face like she was going to hit me,\u201d Ryan told the Post. \u201cI said, \u2018You better back up.\u2019 .\u2009.\u2009. She thought I would be bullied. I won\u2019t be.\u201d National Security Adviser\u00a0Michael Flynn\u2019s job security is in jeopardy, CBS News chief White House correspondent Major Garrett has learned, and White House policy adviser Stephen Miller\u2019s studied non-defense of Flynn illustrates a new level of isolation from Trump and his inner circle.\u00a0 Flynn\u2019s deception about\u00a0conversations\u00a0with the Russian ambassador about Obama administration\u00a0sanctions\u00a0have deeply soured his relationship with Vice President Mike Pence. Two sources with direct knowledge of the situation describe Pence as aggravated by Flynn\u2019s decision to deceive Pence -- forcing him to say things on Flynn\u2019s behalf on \u201cFace The Nation\u201d and other shows that have proven to be untrue. Pence relied on Flynn\u2019s representations and feels burned, the sources said.\u200e The White House says President Trump is \u201cevaluating the situation\u201d\u00a0involving his national security adviser Michael Flynn. \u201c[H]e is speaking to Vice President Pence relative to the conversation the Vice President had with General Flynn and also speaking to various other people about what he considers the single most important subject there is, our national security,\u201d White House spokesman Sean Spicer said in a statement Monday.\u00a0 President Trump\u00a0dealt with a major national security issue during his weekend getaway\u00a0at Mar-a-Lago with members of the club eating dinner near his table on the terrace outside. One guest who joined the club a few months ago, Richard DeAgazio, posted photos of what happened on his Facebook account, that were publicly taken down but then obtained by CBS News. DeAgazio, a retired investor, told The Washington Post in an interview Monday that he was sitting about six tables away from where Mr. Trump and his team sat with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. While he was sitting there, DeAgazio said that he learned that North Korea had just test-fired a ballistic missile and he turned to look at the president\u2019s table. The\u00a0U.S. sanctioned Venezuelan Vice President Tareck El Aissami\u00a0on Monday, calling him a \u201cprominent Venezuelan drug trafficker.\u201d In a statement, the U.S. Treasury Department said its Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated El Aissami as \u201ca Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act) for playing a significant role in international narcotics trafficking.\u201d\u00a0 The U.S. is also sanctioning Samark Bello, a wealthy businessman connected to El Aissami who has held significant business interests in the U.S. The U.S. says Bello provided assistance or support to El Aissami\u2019s trafficking activities.\u00a0 The Justice Department\u2019s request for a delay in action on the lower court case on the merits of\u00a0President Trump\u2019s travel ban\u00a0was denied by the federal court in Seattle. The Washington State Attorney General\u2019s office confirmed to CBS News that District Judge Robart ruled that the travel ban case can proceed on the merits in his court.\u00a0 That means the two sides will begin submitting briefs and arguments on the issue of whether this policy is actually Constitutional.\u00a0 In a memo filed Monday afternoon regarding the legal fight over President Trump\u2019s travel ban, the Justice Department had informed the court that it wanted to postpone any further action at the District Court level until the 9th Circuit decides whether it will hear the case\u00a0en banc.\u00a0 President Trump\u2019s adviser Stephen Miller said in a round of TV appearances Sunday that the\u00a0administration is exploring multiple avenues to get some type of travel ban implemented. Just a few days after\u00a0a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decided to uphold a lower court\u2019s decision to temporarily block the travel ban, Miller said the White House is considering further legal action as well as executive actions. \u201cWe\u2019re considering new and further executive actions that will enhance the security posture of the United States,\u201d Miller said in an interview on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have any news today to make on it but I think the point John is that the President has enormous powers both delegated to him by Congress and under the Constitution, his article 2 foreign affair powers to control the entry of aliens into our country and he\u2019s going to use that authority to keep us safe.\u201d President Trump met with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at 11 a.m. They\u2019ll held a round table at 12:15 p.m. on women business leaders and entrepreneurs, and then held a joint press conference. The joint news conference follows a bilateral meeting between the two leaders. Issues including trade and possibly immigration might come up on their agenda. There might be questions regarding the administration\u2019s plan moving forward on the travel ban and new executive action(s) they\u2019ve said they\u2019d roll out this week.\u00a0 The Senate voted 53-47 to confirm Steven Mnuchin as Treasury secretary\u00a0on Monday evening. Mnuchin was expected to be confirmed. His confirmation came in spite of strong objections by Democrats that the former banker made much of his fortune by foreclosing on struggling homeowners during the financial crisis. Republicans said Steven Mnuchin\u2019s long tenure in finance makes him qualified to run the Treasury Department, which will play a big role in developing Trump\u2019s economic policy. President Trump will speak with President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria, 9:45 a.m., and then at 10:10 a.m. he\u2019ll have a call with President Jacob Zuma of South Africa Late this afternoon, Mr. Trump speaks with Maureen Scalia, the widow of late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, on the anniversary of his death.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump delivered what is likely the most polished speech of his presidency, in his address to the joint session of Congress Tuesday. Standing before lawmakers, Supreme Court justices and military leaders, the famously unrestrained politician struck a strikingly diplomatic tone, steering clear of the personal attacks that defined his presidential campaign.\u00a0 It was an opportunity to reset the chaotic start to his administration. Gone was the dark tone that marked his inaugural address, replaced by optimism and pleas for bipartisan support. \u201cI am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart,\u201d he said, in the opening of his hour-long speech. But while his prime-time address wrapped his nationalistic approach to policy in more presidential prose, it\u2019s unlikely to overcome the deep political divides that exist not only between parties, but also within his own party. Republicans have united control for the first time in decades but do not agree about the specifics of long-promised plans to repeal Obamacare and revamp the tax code. The civil service is in not-so-quiet revolt. Weeks of protests and raucous town halls are putting renewed political pressure on lawmakers from both parties to resist his agenda. The stakes are high not only in terms of policy but politics: If the GOP is unable to make good on years of election promises, they could enter the midterm elections in a far weaker position than expected. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, faces record low approval ratings - just 44 percent of Americans approve of his job performance, according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey. Trump is nearing the end of big achievements he can enact by executive order, forcing him to rely on Congress to turn the bold promises of his campaign into actual achievements He arrived at the Capitol in a blaze of accusations, enraging his opponents before he even entered the building. In the 24 hours before his address, he blamed former President Obama for town hall protests and security leaks, called House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi \u201cincompetent\u201d and said his generals, not the commander in chief, were responsible for a military raid in Yemen that killed a Navy SEAL. Mr. Trump needed to use his prime-time address to show he could steady his flailing White House and focus on the difficult work required to pass his legislative agenda. And Republicans were desperate for a new direction. So in his speech, he called on Washington to \u201cwork past the differences of party.\u201d The candidate who won the White House by taking a hard-line stance on immigration, seemed to express openness to a bipartisan immigration bill. The president whose administration spent much of its first weeks in office battling with the media, intelligence community, federal judiciary and even Hollywood celebrities asked for an end to \u201ctrivial fights.\u201d And he condemned the anti-Semitic attacks and other hate crimes, saying the country was \u201cunited in condemning hate and evil.\u201d For House GOP leaders, the president came tantalizingly close to backing their plan to overhaul the tax code by imposing a new tax on imports while exempting exports. He appeared to lend support to the House Republican leaders\u2019 plan for Obamacare, by embracing \u201ctax credits\u201d and health savings accounts. His comments won praise from Republican leaders. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the speech a \u201chome run.\u201d Ryan\u2019s Democratic counterpart, Nancy Pelosi, said the speech was \u201cutterly disconnected from the cruel reality of his conduct.\u201d But on other issues, Trump offered barely a blueprint for his initiatives. He repeated his campaign pledge to make a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure, adding no new details to a proposal that\u2019s sure to face fierce resistance from budget hawks. Big promises to make childcare more affordable, ensure paid family leave, invest in women\u2019s health and a school choice-focused education bill were mentioned merely in passing. He promised a massive expansion in military spending, even as he made no mention of Iraq or Afghanistan, where American troops are still stationed. And he avoided commenting on U.S.-Russia relations, which sparked controversy even within his own party, making only a nebulous reference to an America \u201cwilling to find new friends.\u201d There was no discussion of how his administration would fund any of the new - and expensive - programs, putting him in direct conflict with a Republican Party that\u2019s long focused on cutting the deficit. \u201cWe will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American greatness began,\u201d Trump said at the conclusion of his speech. \u201cI am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit. I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country.\u201d",

            "article_content": "About a week after Michael Flynn resigned from his job as national security adviser, Americans are concerned about the possibility of improper contact with Russian agents by some of President Trump\u2019s associates \u2013 information that came to light possibly due to the leaking of information by members of U.S. intelligence agencies. Fifty-one percent of Americans are more bothered that communications with Russian officials may have occurred, while 38 percent are more bothered by the leaks.  There are significant partisan differences. \u00a0Eight in 10 Democrats and half of independents are more concerned about possible improper communication with the Russians, while seven in 10 Republicans are more concerned about the leaks.  Most Americans \u2013 57 percent - think these leaks are okay because releasing this information to the media by members of the U.S. intelligence community provides information the public needs to know about.\u00a0 Just 37 percent think these leaks are not all right because they put the country at risk.\u00a0 Here again, most Democrats (75 percent) and independents (58 percent) think these leaks are okay, while most Republicans (58 percent) disagree.     Nevertheless, about seven in 10 Americans think Congress should investigate both the possibility of improper communications with the Russians (72 percent) as well as the leaking of classified material to the news media (69 percent).\u00a0 Democrats and independents are more concerned with the former, while Republicans are more concerned with the latter.  Amidst these reports from U.S. intelligence agencies, many Americans remain concerned that Mr. Trump is too friendly towards Russia. \u00a0Forty-three percent think so, while another 44 percent think his approach is about right.\u00a0 Views are largely partisan:\u00a0 Eight in 10 Republicans think his approach is about right, while three in four Democrats think he is too friendly toward Russia.\u00a0 Independents are more divided.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Sixty-two percent of Americans think the sanctions enacted against Russia by the outgoing Obama administration should remain in place.\u00a0 Just a quarter of Americans think these sanctions should be lifted.\u00a0 The view that sanctions against Russia should remain in place is held by most Democrats and independents, but just under half of Republicans.  Fifty-three percent of Americans view Russia as unfriendly to the U.S., including 24 percent who think of Russia as an enemy.\u00a0 While these percentages are roughly similar to what they were a month ago, the partisan make-up of these opinions has shifted dramatically since 2015. \u00a0 Back in February 2015, 62 percent of Republicans thought of Russia as unfriendly or an enemy; now just 43 percent do.\u00a0 In contrast, the percentage of Democrats that views Russia as unfriendly or an enemy has risen 15 points \u2013 from 52 percent in 2015 to 67 percent today. A similar shift can be seen in partisan views of Russian President Vladimir Putin. \u00a0 In May 2014, Democrats and Republicans held similar views of the Russian leader.\u00a0 Today, unfavorable views of Putin have risen 12 points among Democrats, while unfavorable views of Putin among Republicans have dropped 13 points.  This poll finds Americans don\u2019t trust either the news media or the Trump administration to tell the truth a lot of the time.\u00a0 More than six in 10 Americans say the news media tells the truth only some of the time or hardly ever, but a similar percentage says that about members of the Trump administration. There is a divide along partisan lines, however. Republicans are more critical of the news media and more likely to think the Trump administration tells the truth. The reverse is true among Democrats. Just over a month after taking office, President Trump\u2019s overall job approval rating is 39 percent -- similar to what it was earlier this month. Fifty-one percent of Americans disapprove, and 10 percent don\u2019t have an opinion.\u00a0 Views continue to be strikingly partisan.  President Trump has described his administration as a \u201cfine-tuned machine,\u201d but 49 percent of Americans say it is more disorganized than previous administrations at this point in time. Forty-eight percent say the Trump administration is more organized (17 percent) or just as organized as previous administrations (31 percent). \u00a0  Much of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign for president focused on jobs and keeping the country safe. Six in 10 Americans are very or somewhat confident that President Trump\u2019s policies will create jobs, but they divide on whether his policies will keep the country safe from terrorism -- 50 percent are very or somewhat confident his policies will keep U.S. safe from terrorism, and 49 are not very or not at all conifdent in those policies.\u00a0  There continues to be some concern about Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to handle an international crisis. Sixty-two percent are uneasy about his approach, and only 35 percent say they\u2019re confident about his ability to deal with an international crisis. However, among Republicans, 75 percent are confident, and 22 percent are not.\u00a0  The opposite is true for Democrats -- 92 percent are uneasy with his approach, and only six percent are comfortable. Sixty-four percent of independents are also uneasy about the president\u2019s approach to international crises.\u00a0  A slim majority views President Trump as a strong leader but he gets more negative ratings on other characteristics. A majority (58 percent) of Americans don\u2019t think he understands the complicated problems a president has to deal with and most (57 percent) don\u2019t think he has a clear plan for solving the country\u2019s problems. About eight in 10 Republicans think Mr. Trump does have a clear plan and that he understands the problems he faces, while about nine in 10 Democrats don\u2019t think he does.  On empathy, 47 percent of Americans think Mr. Trump cares a lot or some about the needs and problems of people like them, while 52 percent say he cares not much or not at all.\u00a0  While the President\u2019s overall job rating may be underwater, his Vice President is viewed more positively. Fifty percent of Americans approve of the job Mike Pence is doing, while 35 percent disapprove. He gets especially high marks from Republicans and more independents approve than disapprove.\u00a0  Mr. Trump announced that he was stepping down from running the Trump Organization, turning over operations to a trust controlled by his adult sons.\u00a0 Most Americans - 55 percent - don\u2019t think he\u2019s done enough to prevent any conflicts of interest he may have between his business interests and his job as president. \u00a0  While most Republicans (69 percent) think he\u2019s done enough, most Democrats (82 percent) and independents (56 percent) do not. And as they did before he took the oath of office, Most Americans\u00a0 - 56 percent - think Mr. Trump needs to release his tax returns.\u00a0 On this question as well, the public is divided along party lines.  Other questions have been raised as to how Donald Trump\u2019s presidency will influence the Trump brand, including the product line of his eldest daughter, Ivanka.\u00a0 Most Americans (57 percent) say having a product or service being associated with Donald Trump or members of his family would make no difference in their decision of whether or not to purchase it, though more than a third (35 percent) would be less likely to buy something associated with the Trump family.\u00a0 Far fewer - just 7 percent -\u00a0 would be more likely to \u201cbuy Trump\u201d. \u00a0  Most Democrats (63 percent) would be less likely to buy a Trump product, while most Republicans (76 percent) and independents (61 percent) say the Trump brand would make no difference. Following a Presidents\u2019 Day holiday which saw witness to another wave of anti-Trump protests in various localities across the country, most Americans \u2013 53 percent - think people who oppose the Trump Administration and its policies should give the administration more of a chance, while 44 percent think the protests are justified. Eighty-six percent of Republicans and 54 percent of independents think Mr. Trump should be given more of a chance, while 74 percent of Democrats think the protests are justified.  More than one in 10 Americans have either attended a rally or meeting in opposition to the policies of the Trump administration, or donated money to a group or organization that opposes the policies of the Trump administration. More than one in five Americans have shared an anti-Trump quote, article, or other information through a social networking site like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.\u00a0  Anti-Trump activists \u2013 those who have either donated money or attended a rally or meeting in opposition to the Trump administration \u2013 are far more likely than Americans overall to demand a stance of opposition from Democrats in Congress.\u00a0 While 73 percent of Americans and half of Democrats (52 percent) want Congressional Democrats to try to work with Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress in order to get things done, just 41 percent of anti-Trump activists agree.\u00a0 Instead, more - 49 percent - would rather Democrats in Congress oppose Mr. Trump and the Republicans even if it means not getting as much done.  A quarter of Americans now say the Affordable Care Act should be repealed, similar to last month and lower than two years ago. Sixty-four percent say it is working well but needs some changes. Forty-eight percent of Republicans would like to see the law repealed; just 6 percent of Democrats and 20 percent of independents say the same. Just over half of those who want the law to be repealed say that should happen once there is a replacement. 43 percent who favor repeal would do so immediately, even if there is no replacement for it.    Americans are divided as to the law\u2019s impact on the country\u2019s health care system. About a third think it has made the U.S. healthcare system better, while about as many say the law has made it worse. Views are highly partisan. Americans are also divided in their overall views of the law -- 46 percent approve and 49 percent disapprove. Most Republicans disapprove, while most Democrats approve.  Approval of Congress ticked up last month, and at 22 percent remains slightly higher now than it has been in recent years. Nearly a third of Republicans approve of the job Congress is doing.\u00a0  The public\u2019s approval of their own Congressional representative is much higher \u2013 as has historically been the case. Although, ratings in recent years have been lower than they were about a decade ago. Forty-nine percent approve of their own members of Congress, and 34 percent disapprove. \u00a0  In October, Americans held more positive views of the Democratic Party than the Republican Party \u2013 but in the wake of last November\u2019s election, that has changed. Positive views of the Democratic Party have dropped and now both parties are viewed in a negative light.\u00a0 Positive views of the Republican Party have risen among Republicans, while positive views of the Democrats have dropped among members of their own party.  The last five years have seen a sharp uptick in the percentage of Americans who think there is too little U.S. support for Israel: 42 percent feel that way now, up from 33 percent in 2015 and 17 percent just over five years ago.    \tAt 40 percent, Republicans are especially likely to say there is too little support for Israel.  Americans overall are divided about establishing a Palestinian homeland in the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and a third don\u2019t have an opinion. Nearly half of Republicans oppose that.  This poll was conducted by telephone February 17-21, 2017 among a random sample of 1,280 adults nationwide.\u00a0 Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Media, PA.\u00a0 Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones.   The poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone.     Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables.     The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample could be plus or minus three percentage points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request. The margin of error includes the effects of standard weighting procedures which enlarge sampling error slightly.

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON --\u00a0\u00a0Attorney General Jeff Sessions has signaled his support for the federal government\u2019s use of private prisons, rescinding a memo meant to phase out their use.\u00a0 Sessions issued a new memo Thursday replacing\u00a0one issued last August by Sally Yates, the deputy attorney general at the time.\u00a0 That memo told the Bureau of Prisons to begin reducing and ultimately end its use of privately run prisons. She said the facilities were less well run than those managed by the Bureau of Prisons, and were less necessary given declines in the overall prison population. That memo directed that when federal government\u2019s contracts with private prison companies reach the end of their term, the Bureau of Prisons should either decline to renew or \u201csubstanially reduce its scope.\u201d \u00a0 But Sessions says in his memo Thursday that Yates\u2019 directive contradicted longstanding Justice Department policy and \u201cimpaired the Bureau\u2019s ability to meet the future needs of the federal correctional system.\u201d The Department of Justice began contracting with private prisons as the prison population soared 800 percent from 1980 to 2013. In 2013, approximately 15 percent of the federal prison population were housed in privately operated prisons.\u00a0 A report by the Inspector General in 2016 found that private facilities do not maintain the same level of safety and security that government run facilities provide. \u00a0 Stock in some private prison companies has soared after Donald Trump\u2019s election in November. Mr. Trump\u2019s directive to crack down on illegal immigration has led analysts to predict big profits in 2017 for major private prisons companies such as CoreCivic and Geo, due to increased demand for facilities. In fact, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Tobey Sommer picked CoreCivic among one of his best investment picks for the year.\u00a0 In a statement to CBS News after Thursday\u2019s memo, CoreCivic said Sessions\u2019 memo \u201cvalidates our position that the Department\u2019s previous direction was not reflective of the high quality services we have provided to the federal government for decades.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Trump stepped back into campaign mode this week, once again taking aim at one of his favorite targets: the media. During\u00a0an extended and extraordinary press conference in the East Room of the White House, he vowed to punish the \u201clow-life leakers\u201d within the government and intelligence agencies responsible for passing inside information along to the press. The press conference came on the heels of a chaotic week, which began Monday with the resignation of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. Flynn handed in his notice amid reports that he had not be entirely honest with administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, about the nature of his conversations with the Russian ambassador on the day the United States took retaliatory actions against Moscow for its meddling in the 2016 elections. Although Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the president asked Flynn to resign due to a lack of trust, Mr. Trump berated the media on Thursday for what he said was his unfair treatment of Flynn. This Sunday we\u2019ll ask White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus about reported chaos within the new administration -- even though Trump said it was running like \u201ca fine-tuned machine.\u201d With a shaky roll out of the executive order on immigration and the loss of a National Security Advisor, does Priebus agree with the president\u2019s optimistic view? Friday, the Chief of Staff denied a Wall Street Journal Story that claimed intelligence officials are withholding classified information from the president because of the leaks. During an interview, Priebus called the reports \u201ctotally fake\u201d and \u201ctotally false\u201d and downplayed any alleged relationship between the Trump campaign and Russia. We\u2019ll ask him about all of this and the week ahead.  South Carolina Republican and Member of the Armed Service Committee Sen. Lindsey Graham also joins us Sunday.\u00a0 Graham has called for in-depth investigations into the relationship Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign had with Russian intelligence officials, but it remains to be seen how many other members of his party will support the inquiry. We\u2019ll also speak with California GOP Representative Devin Nunes. The Republican chair of the House Intelligence Committee and has voiced concern over intelligence leaks, saying in an interview, \u201cIt\u2019s totally unacceptable for anyone within government to be doing this.\u201d But beyond the leaks, is he concerned about reports that Mr. Flynn lied about the content of his calls with Russians? Maryland Democrat Rep. Elijah Cummings, who was mentioned during Mr. Trump\u2019s marathon press conference , says he\u00a0did not turn down a meeting at the White House, despite the president\u2019s assertions. Cummings, who serves as the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, blasted Republicans within the committee including committee Chair Jason Chaffetz, R- Utah, for their failure to look into the president\u2019s ties to Russia.\u00a0 We\u2019ll get his take on possible Flynn investigations, the White House and the road ahead. Tom Donilon served as National Security Advisor in the Obama administration.\u00a0 What can he tell us about the role of National Security Adviser and why this is such a crucial positionformer Acting CIA Director Michael Morell to provide some insight into the meaning behind the administrations\u00a0troubled relationship with intelligence agencies. Without the counsel of a National Security Advisor, who does the president turn to in times of crisis? Finally, we\u2019ll turn to our political panel for analysis on the news of the week.

Marco Rubio \u2013 along with human rights groups - for not honoring the long tradition of personally unveiling the State Department\u2019s annual Human Rights Report, which is expected Friday.\u00a0 For 1st time in a long time @StateDept #humanrights report will not be presented by Secretary of State. I hope they reconsider. White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway is opening up about the pressures of working in the male-dominated world of politics. CBS News\u2019 Norah O\u2019Donnell spoke with her and her family in their New Jersey home. \u00a0 Asked\u00a0whether she had ever considered making a political run of her own, Conway told O\u2019Donnell she would not run for office.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s not just the fire in your belly anymore. You have to have the bile in your throat. And this is why I think many women do not run for office,\u201d Conway told O\u2019Donnell. \u201cMany good men and women who would \u2014\u201d \u201cBile in your throat?\u201d O\u2019Donnell asked. After a week of noticeably less Twitter activity, President Trump is lashing out against Democrats over their treatment of Attorney General Jeff Sessions because of his contacts with Russian Envoy Sergey Kislyak.\u00a0 Mr. Trump tweeted a demand for an investigation of Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer over a photo of him with Russian President Vladimir Putin from 2003, and over House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi over a photo showing her seated at a table with Kislyak, whom she denied having met. The last two nights of U.S. airstrikes in Yemen were not based on intelligence collected during\u00a0the commando raid last month, Pentagon spokesman Jeff Davis said Friday. Over the last two days, the U.S. has conducted more than 30 airstrikes, but has not been involved in any of the reported firefights. \u00a0 The latest airstrikes are part of a stepped up campaign against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula that was developed near the end of the Obama administration, and which began with the Jan. 28 raid that resulted in the death of Navy SEAL William \u201cRyan\u201d Owens and several civilians. President Trump and his staff have repeatedly pronounced the raid a success, and the Pentagon also stated that a lot of intelligence came out of the raid.\u00a0 President Trump on Friday reiterated his call for a merit-based immigration system, citing the systems used by Australia and Canada as potential models to pursue. The president posted a single tweet about his vision on Twitter, naming the book \u201cGreen Card Warrior\u201d as a must-read. Nick Adams new book, Green Card Warrior, is a must read. The merit-based system is the way to go. Canada, Australia! @foxandfriends Health insurance tax credits, mandates, taxation of employer coverage, essential benefits. Mind-numbing health care jargon is flying around again\u00a0as Republicans move to repeal and replace the Obama-era Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s time to start paying attention. The GOP plan emerging in the House would mean less government, and many fear that will translate to less coverage and a step backward as a nation. Still, there would be new options for middle-class people who buy their own policies but don\u2019t now qualify for help under the ACA. Some popular provisions such as allowing young adults to stay on a parental plan remain untouched. In an effort to\u00a0highlight his push for school vouchers, President Trump will visit St. Andrew Catholic School in Orlando on Friday to participate in what the White House is calling a \u201clistening session.\u201d The visit follows up on the president\u2019s nod to education reform in\u00a0his address to Congress Tuesday, when he labeled education \u201cthe civil rights issue of our time.\u201d\u00a0 His visit and tour are scheduled for 1:30 p.m. President Donald Trump\u00a0painted an overly bleak picture of the condition of the armed forces\u00a0as he made his case for military expansion. A look at some of his statements from the Gerald R. Ford, a $12.9 billion aircraft carrier being built in Newport News, Virginia: TRUMP: \u201cWe are going to have very soon the finest equipment in the world.\u201d THE FACTS: Pentagon leaders have said for years that the U.S. already has the world\u2019s best weaponry and military equipment. They sometimes claim the U.S. is in danger of losing its advantage unless the Congress continues to spend heavily to develop and build new generations of weapons. Attorney General\u00a0Jeff Sessions recused himself\u00a0from investigations involving the Trump campaign, he announced at a Thursday afternoon press conference after consulting with Justice Department lawyers about his role in investigations into Russian contacts by Trump campaign associates. Former Obama administration officials are taking issue with a New York Times report published Wednesday night\u00a0which suggested that Obama aides had disseminated information about Trump campaign associates and Russian officials\u00a0across the government in order to leave a \u201cclear trail for the intelligence and government investigators\u201d to follow and to ensure that no meddling occurred in other elections -- in the U.S. or overseas.\u00a0 That contention struck at least two officials from the Obama administration as overstated. \u201cTo the extent there was an effort, it was organic on the part of [intelligence] professionals to document and retain,\u201d one official told CBS News. \u201cI was not aware of a strategic White House driven effort to do so.\u201d\u00a0 Russia\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak, has now come up in several communications with President Trump\u2019s associates, officials say, as administration officials look into contact between his team and Russia. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, for instance, has\u00a0come under fire\u00a0after it became known Thursday night that\u00a0he had two contacts with Kislyak during the presidential campaign, Justice Department officials confirmed to CBS News, following an initial report by The Washington Post. Sessions didn\u2019t disclose his two conversations with Kisylak during his Senate confirmation process and it\u2019s unclear what they discussed in their private conversation. \u201cWell, I have not met with any Russians at any time to discuss any political campaign,\u201d Sessions said Thursday. \u201cAnd those remarks are unbelievable to me and are false. And I don\u2019t have anything else to say about that.\u201d Mr. Trump went aboard the Navy\u2019s newest carrier,\u00a0the USS Gerald R. Ford,\u00a0to promote his plans for a military buildup. \u201cWe will give our military the tools you need to prevent war,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201c... And if required, to fight war ... and only do one thing -- you know what that is? Win, Win! We\u2019re going to start winning again.\u201d But as the most expensive ship ever built -- which will begin its sea trials next month -- the Ford stands for something else as well. \u201cThe Ford is a poster child for how you don\u2019t build a ship,\u201d says Ray Mabus. He was\u00a0former Secretary of the Navy\u00a0during the Obama administration. At a\u00a0speech aboard the U.S.S. Gerald Ford, Donald Trump explained how additional defense spending would help the military.\u00a0 \u201cI asked Congress to eliminate the defense sequester,\u201d he said, as well as to support his request for additional defense funding,\u201d he said. \u201cBy eliminating the sequester and the uncertainty it creates, we will make it easier for the navy to plan for the future and thus control costs and get the best deal for the taxpayer,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhich of course is very important, right?\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 The soon-to-be-commissioned Navy warship that cost almost $13 billion and faced delays in its construction. Mr. Trump has proposed\u00a0adding $54 billion\u00a0to the Pentagon\u2019s budget this year, an increase of approximately 10 percent. \u00a0 Donald Trump says\u00a0he still has confidence\u00a0in Attorney General Jeff Sessions, as lawmakers call on Sessions to recuse himself from probes into Russian contacts by Trump campaign associates. Asked directly about whether he still had confidence in Sessions, Mr. Trump replied, \u201cTotal.\u201d The president was on the U.S.S. Gerald Ford in Newport News, Virginia and was meeting with Navy and ship officials in what the White House called an operations briefing. Two of President Donald Trump\u2019s former rivals for the GOP White House nomination\u00a0won Senate confirmation Thursday\u00a0to join his administration. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson was confirmed as secretary of the Department of House and Urban Development on a vote of 58-41. A few hours later, the Senate backed former Texas Gov. Rick Perry to be energy secretary, 62-37. Carson and Perry are the 17th and 18th of Trump\u2019s 22 Cabinet and Cabinet-level nominations to win Senate approval. The Department of Homeland Security has identified\u00a0only $20 million in funding that could be shifted to President Trump\u2019s plan\u00a0to build a wall along the southern border, significantly less than the more than $21 billion price tag, according to Reuters. The money was included in a document obtained by Reuters and prepared by DHS to distribute to congressional staff last week. It would only be enough to cover a handful of contracts for wall prototypes, the report said, but not enough to start building a physical wall. In order to move forward, Congress would need to approve new funding to pay for the wall, but there\u2019s been little movement on such action on Capitol Hill. Last month, Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, said in an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Greta Van Susteren that\u00a0congressional leaders were considering legislation to fund the border wall, drawing on taxpayer dollars despite promises that Mexico would finance the project.",

In late January, a White House official said that the president was supposed to sign an executive order on cybersecurity that was going to advise agency and department heads that they will be held accountable for cybersecurity, but the signing of the order was cancelled and has not yet taken place.

            "article_content": "Better days may well lie ahead for U.S. manufacturing, but the recovery won\u2019t come easy or without bumps, nor will it usher in a return to the days of near-full employment for unskilled workers. That\u2019s according to noted economist and manufacturing expert Diane Swonk, a past president of the National Association for Business Economics whose clients include major manufacturers, Fortune 500 CEOs and elected officials. Many residents of communities hardest hit by the decline in manufacturing, including Erie, Pennsylvania, were heartened by President Trump\u2019s election victory, relieved to have someone they see as an advocate in the White House for the U.S. manufacturing economy. Donald Trump\u2019s bold campaign promises offered plenty of hope, and his blunt-force approach showed early promise to many blue-collar supporters. But he hasn\u2019t yet put forward a plan to reconcile the economic nationalism he successfully harnessed during the campaign with the broader economic fundamentals of U.S. manufacturing -- including technological change and threats from global competitors. Swonk, a Michigan native whose company is based in Chicago, tells CBS MoneyWatch that U.S. manufacturing can indeed grow again in the current climate, but it will be led by a different kind of manufacturing -- one that relies more heavily than ever on education and training a new generation of workers. Here are a few of Swonk\u2019s key points on the outlook for manufacturing: You can still make good money in manufacturing, Swonk says, but it requires a different skill set, including problem-solving skills, tech expertise, even coding: \u201cThe idea on the campaign trail, there was a sense you could turn back the hands of time and recreate an environment we had in the 1950s and 60s, when you literally didn\u2019t have to train workers very much to do repetitive jobs and get paid a decent wage that could get them a house and a car and the American dream. We need to bring up the skills level of the workers we have left in the existing pool. More firms are willing to train workers, as the labor market tightens. It\u2019s not the old traditional kind of training -- shop class -- it\u2019s an entirely different kind of manufacturing, often very specific to a manufacturer.\u201d There\u2019s an often-overlooked reason that larger urban areas have captured economic growth while smaller cities and rural areas have weathered a vicious cycle of decline: \u201cThere\u2019s no question the economic and political establishment has left large swaths of our population behind, and in the process of globalization we didn\u2019t make the necessary investments we needed to make in our own human capital. One of the biggest problems we have in the United States is most education is done at the state and local level, not the federal level. All the promises to upgrade our education level for the overall country have fallen flat, because there\u2019s an inherent mismatch for money in education based on the local conditions.\u201d Mobility is important for an economy to work: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have an ability for not just goods to flow, but for people to flow, to where they need to get skills they need. We\u2019ve not provided any of that. What we\u2019ve done, if anything, is let the world move forward without letting people make choices even in their lives to move forward in the economy.\u201d Some people on the sidelines may never return to work, due to atrophied skills, unhealthy habits and rampant drug use in the most economically depressed areas: \u201cThere are more high-wage jobs out there than we can fill in the manufacturing sector. That\u2019s the good news. The bad news is you still can\u2019t provide the tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of jobs with barely any skill set that can pay at a level commensurate with what we once called the American dream.\u201d Revitalizing manufacturing towns will require a different kind of labor force and, in the meantime, a strong safety net: \u201cWe need bridges for these communities so they can walk across them to a better career path. That means investments in better education and training. It means pairing a willingness of companies to invest and work with community colleges, or establish their own training programs. Can you have that happen in an environment where prices are rising and borders are closing because of nationalism? That\u2019s very difficult.\u201d The decline of manufacturing is not a new problem, and the politics can be complicated, Swonk notes: \u201cThis has been decades in the making. My father worked for GM; I grew up in Detroit and know people who\u2019ve gone through this. My best friend went into poverty when I was 16; her father died, and he was a union president. They literally had to dig up their backyard and plant vegetables to live. The only bread they had was fresh-baked because that\u2019s all they could afford. Having seen this firsthand, the differences and the break between prosperity and poverty, those who got highly educated and those who did not, it certainly is something we\u2019ve ignored for a very long time. It was okay to ignore it in the 1990s when we got a reprieve in the bubble economy.\u201d In the past we would have assumed taking a hard line on trade would boost production in one country and hurt it in others. That may not hold true today: \u201cSo much of trade and manufacturing is integrated across the continent, makes the entire continent competitive. But that\u2019s not where the policy out of Washington, D.C., is going, and that could hurt job growth initially instead of help it. What we see now is more of a simultaneous loss in production on both sides of the border, because of the inter-linkages we have.\u201d Automation will be required to enhance productivity: \u201cTo some extent we are running out of workers. Especially with less immigration, we have an aging population that\u2019s going to need more services. The Baby Boomers are retiring, and some are dying out. All of this requires we think about policies for the next century.\u201d Swonk says many of those who blame trade for taking their jobs ironically have the most to lose from tighter regulations on trade, in the form of higher costs for consumer products. And tighter trade could hit rural communities particularly hard -- for instance, limiting markets for farmers to sell their crops: \u201cThe costs of trade are specific, and the benefits are diffuse. Trade arguments have always been difficult because even though people benefit from the free flow of goods, better quality and prices, when you fail to create a safety net or a bridge for those displaced you are going to have backlash. The trade protection programs, displacement programs, were poor and ineffective.\u201d Getting specific, Swonk says the shale industry is bouncing back, and deregulation will give it another boost. The resulting cheaper fuel could have positive spillover effects for traditional manufacturing. Meantime, to the down side, vehicle sales appear to be peaking: \u201cThe one sector of traditional manufacturing that\u2019s sort of been a silver lining -- autos -- has started to slow. In a broad sense, recovery is taking hold in much less traditional manufacturing -- \u201cbehind-the-glass\u201d manufacturing that requires more education, such as making medical devices or creating goods through 3-D printing.\u201d Extreme solutions -- such as paying people not to work, or trying to recreate the nation\u2019s past manufacturing glory -- are equally unrealistic: \u201cThe reality is much more complex and messy. These are proud people. They don\u2019t just want handouts. They want to work.\u201d On the consequences of failure: \u201cIf we cannot figure out a way to leverage what skills they have and bring them up to a speed where they can work in our economy, with some support, then what we will have is a further rebellion and regression. History is pretty strong on these lessons, and it wasn\u2019t pretty in the 1930s.\u201d",

With the hasty draining of Oroville Lake, fears have eased, but there are still a lot of questions to answer after what was a stressful evening for thousands of people. A major winter storm slammed into northern New York and New England on Sunday, just days after towns and cities across the northeast were walloped with heavy snow. More than a foot of new snow is expected, from New York to Maine, and some parts of New England could get double that amount. The Ford Explorer is the best-selling midsize SUV in the country, with around one million on the road. But hundreds of customers say the vehicles might be making them sick. They describe it as a sulfur or rotten egg smell, and it\u2019s purportedly causing some dangerous incidents. A Universal Basic Income (UBI) is the concept of giving people taxpayer dollars, either in lieu of or in addition to benefits they\u2019re already receiving.

            "article_content": "By Sarah Dutton, Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus, Kabir Khanna and Anthony Salvanto  Two weeks into Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, the country remains sharply divided along partisan lines. A large majority of Republicans approves of President Trump and his recent executive order temporarily restricting entry into the U.S. by foreigners and refugees, while Democrats disapprove in similar numbers.  Slightly more Americans disapprove (51 percent) than approve (45 percent) of President Trump\u2019s executive order temporarily banning people from entering the U.S. from seven designated countries. Views on temporarily suspending entry for refugees are the same.\u00a0 Opinions on these issues are highly partisan. The public splits on whether a temporary ban on people from the seven designated countries will make the U.S. safer, but most Republicans (who support the ban) think it will. On a more positive note for Mr. Trump, more Americans think the Senate should vote to confirm his Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, than vote against him. However, 56 percent can\u2019t say at this point. Republicans and independents are more supportive of Gorsuch than Democrats.  In the CBS News Poll\u2019s first measure of Mr. Trump\u2019s job performance as president, 40 percent of Americans approve of the job he is doing -- the lowest of any president just after his first inauguration since the Gallup Poll began taking those measures in 1953. Some 48 percent disapprove. Americans are divided on the president\u2019s executive order that temporarily bans foreigners from entering the U.S. who are from seven majority Muslim countries \u2013 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen \u2013 though more disapprove (51 percent) than approve (45 percent).\u00a0 The partisan differences are striking:\u00a0 85 percent of Republicans approve, while an identical 85 percent of Democrats disapprove. \u00a0  A third of Americans agree with the rationale given by the Trump administration for this measure:\u00a0 that it will make the United States safer from terrorism.\u00a0 Thirty-six percent of Americans agree that this provision will make the U.S. safer by preventing unwanted people from entering the country, but just as many \u2013 36 percent -- think it will make the U.S. less safe by making people around the world angry at the U.S.\u00a0 Another 22 percent think it will not have any effect.\u00a0  Another major provision of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order is to temporarily prohibit all refugees from any country from entering the U.S.\u00a0 Here again, Americans are largely divided along party lines, though more Americans disapprove (51 percent) than approve (45 percent). Fifty-seven percent of Americans think a temporary ban on refugees goes against the founding principles of the United States.\u00a0 Nearly seven in 10 Republicans think that ban is in keeping with the country\u2019s founding principles, while more than eight in 10 Democrats and most independents disagree. President Trump signaled that Christians might receive preference when it comes to assessing whether travelers affected by the ban would be allowed to enter the U.S., but most Americans reject this as a condition for allowing immigration into the country.\u00a0 Eight-right percent of Americans - and 87 percent of American Christians - think the government should treat all potential immigrants the same, regardless of religion. The seven countries singled out by the executive order all have Muslim majority populations. Some critics of the executive order have characterized it as a Muslim ban, a charge the administration has denied.\u00a0 In principle, three in four Americans would oppose a ban on all Muslims from entering the U.S. \u2013 including large majorities of Democrats (92 percent) and independents (75 percent), and a slight majority of Republicans (55 percent). And despite strong language before the election by the Trump campaign about the threat of violence from radical Islam, most Americans don\u2019t believe that the Islamic religion as a whole is more violent than other religions. More than six in 10 Republicans think Islam is more violent than other religions, while most Democrats and independents think Islam is no different than other religions. Most Americans are taking a wait and see approach on the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court \u2013 56 percent can\u2019t say at this point whether he should be confirmed. Still, more say Judge Gorsuch should be confirmed than not.  Democrats are three times as likely to think the Senate should vote against Judge Gorsuch rather than for him, but about six in 10 don\u2019t have an opinion yet. Most Republicans want him confirmed. Among independents with an opinion, more would like to Judge Gorsuch confirmed than not.  Similar percentages of Americans did not have an opinion on the confirmation of past nominees to the U.S. Supreme Court at this early stage. Overall public support for Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation is in line with that of recent nominees. One of the most controversial decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court was the Roe vs. Wade ruling that effectively legalized abortion. Fifty-four percent of Americans say they are looking for a Supreme Court justice who would uphold Roe v. Wade; only 30 percent want someone who would vote to overturn it. Three in four Democrats are looking for a justice to uphold that 1973 decision. Republicans are more divided in their views but more want the next justice to vote to overturn Roe v. Wade (45 percent) than want the next justice to uphold it (39 percent). Former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was a conservative, and Mr. Trump vowed to name a conservative to fill his seat. Not surprisingly, 64 percent of Republicans want the next justice to be a conservative. Democrats are somewhat divided in their desire for a liberal (41 percent) and a moderate (39 percent). Independents are looking for a moderate.  Many Republicans think Judge Gorsuch is in line with their own ideology. Thirty-eight percent think he is about right ideologically, while far fewer say he is either too conservative (4 percent) or not conservative enough (2 percent). Democrats are more likely to say Judge Gorsuch is too conservative. Still, most Americans, including more than half of Republicans, don\u2019t know enough about Judge Gorsuch yet to have an opinion Amid the flurry of far-reaching executive orders signed during his first two weeks in office, the president\u2019s first recorded job approval rating in the CBS News Poll is at 40 percent.\u00a0 Some 48 percent of Americans disapprove, and 12 percent don\u2019t have an opinion yet.\u00a0 Views of the 45th president are strikingly partisan: More than eight in 10 Republicans approve and more than eight in 10 Democrats disapprove of how he is handling his job.\u00a0 Independents are more likely to disapprove (46 percent) than approve (36 percent). Mr. Trump\u2019s first approval rating is a historic low when compared with other presidents during their first month in office, and he is the first president since 1953 (when Gallup started measuring the job performance of presidents just after their first inauguration) to have more Americans disapprove than approve of the job he is doing so early in his term.\u00a0 \u00a0  Ratings of the most recent U.S. presidents were far less partisan. About a third of Republicans approved of the job Barack Obama was doing at the start of his presidency, and a similar percentage of Democrats approved of George W. Bush at the start of his first term.  President Trump does better on a couple of specific issues. Forty-three percent of Americans approve of his handling of the economy, while 37 percent disapprove.\u00a0 Americans split on how he is handling terrorism.\u00a0 Again, these results are highly partisan. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This poll was conducted by telephone February 1-2, 2017 among a random sample of 1,019 adults nationwide.\u00a0 Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Media, PA.\u00a0 Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones.  The poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone.  Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables.  The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample could be plus or minus four percentage points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request. The margin of error includes the effects of standard weighting procedures which enlarge sampling error slightly.

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0-- The lack of fireworks surrounding Senate consideration of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks may reflect a slew of statements his choices have made contradicting the billionaire businessman\u2019s position on key issues. Trump acknowledged the differences early Friday, posting a message on his Twitter account saying: \u201cAll my Cabinet nominee are looking good and doing a great job. I want them to be themselves and express their own thoughts, not mine!\u201d This week\u2019s confirmation hearings produced an odd political chemistry where, for instance, one of the harshest examinations of a Trump Cabinet choice came from one of Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, presidential campaign rival Sen. Marco Rubio. Despite Democrats\u2019 dismay over some of Trump\u2019s selections, the hearings were relatively tranquil, with Democrats generally restrained even in quizzing the more contentious picks. The reason, according to a few Democrats: The nominees are proving more palatable than Trump himself. \u201cAs I meet members of the Cabinet I\u2019m puzzled because many of them sound reasonable,\u201d said Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat. \u201cFar more reasonable than their president.\u201d That could change in weeks to come, because some of the most potentially explosive hearings are still pending, including the scrutiny of former Goldman Sachs partner Steven Mnuchin for Treasury secretary. Several of Trump\u2019s Cabinet selections this week made statements this week contradicting policy stances espoused by their soon-to-be boss on issues ranging from Russia and NATO to climate change and Muslims. Sen. Jeff Sessions, picked for attorney general, said he\u2019s against any outright ban on immigration by Muslims, in contrast to Trump\u2019s onetime call to suspend admittance of Muslims until U.S. officials could learn more about nature of the threat of extremism. His secretary of state candidate, Rex Tillerson, took a relatively hard line on Washington\u2019s dealings with Russia, even though Trump has been talking about improving relations between Washington and Moscow and held out for days before saying he accepted the intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Moscow meddled in the U.S. election process. Tillerson demurred, however, when one senator tried to lure him into calling President Vladimir Putin, whom he knows, a \u201cwar criminal,\u201d although he emphasized support for NATO commitments that Trump had questioned. The secretary-of-state designate also said the United States should not back away from its efforts against nuclear proliferation, notwithstanding Trump\u2019s suggestion earlier this year that some key U.S. allies like Japan and South Korea provide their own defense. Some of the toughest questioning of Tillerson came not from Democrats but from Rubio, who grilled the Exxon Mobil executive on human rights issues. As Mnuchin\u2019s confirmation hearing approaches, Democrats have set up a website to solicit stories from the thousands of people whose homes were foreclosed on by OneWest Bank while he headed a group of investors who owned the bank. They hope to use Mnuchin\u2019s nomination hearing to attack Trump\u2019s populist appeal with working-class voters and cast themselves as defenders of the middle class. Thus far, though, Republicans are congratulating themselves for generally smooth sailing. And overall, the lack of drama may also be due to the decision by Democrats while in the Senate majority to lower the vote threshold for Cabinet nominees and others from 60 votes to 50, allowing Republicans to ensure approval as long as they can hold their 52-seat majority together. \u201cThe purpose of confirmation hearings is to examine the record and views of potential nominees and I think that\u2019s what these hearings are doing,\u201d said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. \u201cI think it\u2019s likely that all of the Cabinet nominees are going to be confirmed, I think the hearings have gone quite well this week.\u201d A hearing Thursday for neurosurgeon Ben Carson to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development featured some pointed questioning from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, but also warm exchanges between Carson and other committee Democrats. Afterward Carson thanked the panel and said that it \u201cwas actually kind of fun.\u201d Sessions was denied confirmation once before by the Senate, but that was three decades ago for a federal judgeship. This time around the Alabaman is a sitting senator and was treated gently, for the most part, by his colleagues, even when Democrats brought up the racial issues that brought him down him last time around. There was potential for drama as Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, broke with Senate tradition to testify against his colleague, but it came on the second day of the hearing after Sessions had finished testifying, so he was not even in the room. Tillerson had the rockiest outing thus far, with Rubio pressing him on Russia and Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon confronting him about climate change and other issues. With Rubio and others undecided on supporting Tillerson, his ultimate confirmation is in question. But even with Tillerson, Democrats seemed to pull their punches at times. \u201cI don\u2019t want to argue with you,\u201d Sen. Tom Udall of New Mexico remarked at one point, seeming to speak for several colleagues. And it was practically bipartisan lovefests at the hearings for the choices for Central Intelligence Agency, Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo; retired Gen. James Mattis for Defense; and retired Gen. John Kelly for Homeland Security. \u201cPompeo\u2019s very popular, Mattis, Kelly - these are popular selections,\u201d said Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona. The hearings seemed to underscore some emerging dynamics of Trump\u2019s relations with Capitol Hill. Despite his highly unconventional approach, and his lack of Capitol Hill experience, many of his appointees and aides could have been selected by any other Republican, and the Senate is responding accordingly. And even where Trump\u2019s surprising approach raises the potential for problems, congressional Republicans are working overtime to paper them over, not highlight them. \u201cWe are in complete sync,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, insisted Thursday in a discussion about a different topic, health care. That could change in weeks to come, as the Senate holds hearings on Mnuchin and other more divisive selections. These include conservative Rep. Tom Price for Health and Human Services; Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, a vocal denier of climate change science, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency; and fast-food executive Andrew Puzder to head the Labor Department. Still, given that it\u2019s the Senate, not daytime TV, there may be a limit to the potential for conflict, said Ben Marter, Durbin\u2019s communications director. \u201cYou have to adjust your excite-o-meter down a little bit, because it\u2019s a Senate hearing. It\u2019s not Maury Povich.\u201d",

Pence announced Mr. Trump\u2019s decision, which he said is intended to \u201censure the continuity of government,\u201d during a press conference at the Presidential Transition Office in Washington, D.C., a day before the inauguration. Some of the officials who have been asked to stick around are Robert Work, the deputy secretary of defense; Chuck Rosenberg, the acting administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration; Nick Rasmussen, the National Counterterrorism Center Director; Thomas Shannon, under secretary of state for political affairs; Susan Coppedge; ambassador-at-large to monitor and combat trafficking in persons; Brett McGurk, special presidential envoy for the Global Coalition to Fight the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL); and Adam Szubin, acting under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence at the Treasury Department.  Pence, the chairman of the transition team, said that all 21 Cabinet nominees have been named, with the latest being\u00a0Sonny Perdue for agriculture secretary. He said that the transition team had received more than 86,000 resumes and interviewed 170 people before the November election and 200 people since then. He said that the team is wrapping up its work \u201cunder budget\u201d and will return 20 percent of taxpayer funding to the treasury. \u00a0 Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, then took over the press conference -- he did not confirm that Mr. Trump will be visiting the CIA on Saturday, which has been reported by CBS News.  On reports that the Trump administration is considering moving the White House press corps to a bigger space outside of the White House for briefings, Spicer said that there has been \u201cunprecedented interest in covering this president.\u201d He said the first couple of briefings will be hold in the White House\u2019s Brady Briefing Room, but they are looking at larger spaces that are more accommodating. Spicer slammed Senate Democrats for what he called \u201cdelay tactics\u201d in the process to confirm Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees, arguing that they\u2019re \u201cslowing down the continuity of government.\u201d  Spicer suggested that Mr. Trump will soon issue executive orders on NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership and did not answer a question about whether there would be an immigration executive order coming soon. \u00a0 Asked if Mr. Trump has decided to move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Spicer said, \u201cStay tuned. There will be a further announcement on that.\u201d  Rebecca Shabad is a video reporter for CBS News Digital.",

One says that the president\u2019s aides \u201cconfer in the dark because they can\u2019t figure out how to operate the light switches in the cabinet room.\u201d Times reporters Glenn Thrush and Maggie Haberman observed in the story that Mr. Trump and his team are changing their strategy after the \u201cbungled rollout\u201d of his executive order banning immigrants from seven countries, \u201ca flurry of other miscues and embarrassments,\u201d and historically low approval ratings for a first-term president. \u00a0The story also says that Mr. Trump would, from now on, \u201cbe looped in on the drafting of executive orders much earlier in the process.\u201d The article also archly notes, \u201cFor a man who sometimes has trouble concentrating on policy memos, Mr. Trump was delighted to page through a book that offered him 17 window covering options.\u201d Mr. Trump often appends the word \u201cfailing\u201d to the New York Times in his tweets, and in recent days referred to its \u201cdwindling subscribers and readers.\u201d After the president tweeted about the \u201cdwindling\u201d audience for the Times, its CEO, Mark Thompson, addressed him directly during the 2016 fourth quarter earnings call last week, declaring, \u201cMr. President, we had spectacular audiences in the quarter with 220 million unique users coming to us in November.\u201d Its digital growth was \u201cunprecedented,\u201d Thompson went on to say, noting that in the fourth quarter, the Times added 276,000 net new digital subscriptions -- more in that single quarter than in all of 2013 and 2014 combined.\u00a0 Thompson also said that in the new quarter, post-election, the Times is \u201ccontinuing to see remarkably strong numbers of new subscribers.\u201d\u00a0 Mr. Trump may not be right about the size of the Times\u2019 audience, but the media company has been struggling. Growth on the digital side has not been enough to offset the losses in the Times\u2019 more lucrative print advertising, which fell 16 percent for the year -- 20 percent for the fourth quarter. Total revenue was down 2 percent for the year for the Times. In the coming year, overall advertising is forecast to continue to fall off, though the Times expects digital advertising to increase 10 to 15 percent. \u00a0",

            "article_content": "VALLETTA, Malta -- European Union leaders on Friday sought a common stand on President Trump, now that they increasingly fear that campaign rhetoric will be turned into policy and further tear their troubled bloc apart. At a summit in Malta, several of the 28 leaders highlighted the fundamental gap between the EU position and how Mr. Trump wants to plug migration and refugee flows from certain mostly Muslim nations, one of many potential flashpoints undermining trans-Atlantic relations. EU Council President Donald Tusk already moved the U.S. into a \u201cthreat\u201d category for the EU in the run-up to the summit, following several negative comments about the bloc. For France and Germany, there is only one solution to facing an unpredictable partner. \u201cMany countries have to realize that their future is first in the European Union, rather than who knows what bilateral relation with the United States,\u201d said French President Francois Hollande upon arrival at the summit. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that \u201cthe more strongly we are clear about how we define our role in the world, the better we can tend our trans-Atlantic relations.\u201d It didn\u2019t take away any of the worries which have been increasing by the day since Mr. Trump took office on Jan. 20. Even though he has called Hollande and Tusk and hosted British Prime Minister Theresa May, Europe keeps searching for how to get a grip on Mr. Trump. \u201cWho knows what the president of the United States really wants,\u201d notably when it comes to NATO, Hollande said of the military alliance uniting most EU member nations with the United States. Summit leader Tusk was hoping that the debriefings from May and others to EU leaders would not turn into another Trump-bashing session. On Tuesday though, Tusk himself said that Mr. Trump was contributing to the \u201chighly unpredictable\u201d outlook for the bloc with a slew of \u201cworrying declarations.\u201d The message had seeped through the ranks of the member states. \u201cTrump must be judged by his actions and not by his rhetoric and his election campaign. But now he has delivered enough actions that are worrying,\u201d Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern said. His Luxembourg counterpart Xavier Bettel added: \u201cWhat happened the last days are really not the values I\u2019m fighting for.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s tough talk on trade with China, including threats of punitive tariffs and accusations of illegal currency manipulation, is bringing long-simmering tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies to a boil. And that could have ramifications for many U.S. companies. About a dozen Fortune 500 companies rely on China for more than 50 percent of their annual sales, per a recent Morgan Stanley (MS) report to clients. Semiconductor maker Ambarella (AMBA) gets 90 percent of its revenue from China, and other tech firms, such as Marvell (MRVL) and Qualcomm (QCOM), get more than 50 percent of their sales from the world\u2019s most populous country. China also looms large for Apple (AAPL). The nation has surpassed the U.S. as the biggest iPhone market. It also is a big revenue-generator for casino operators such Las Vegas Sands (LSV) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN), which have invested heavily in the Macao gaming market in recent years.\u00a0 Boeing (BA) is expecting big things from China, predicting last year that the country would need $1 trillion worth of aircraft over the next two decades. General Electric (GE) also is eager to expand its foothold in China and is partnering with companies there to expand into other emerging markets.\u00a0 U.S. farmers also depend on China, which is now the second-largest market for American agricultural exports,\u00a0worth $20.2 billion as of 2015. Mr. Trump this week scrapped the 11-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement that his predecessor Barack Obama negotiated. It didn\u2019t include China as a member and was at least partially aimed at stemming China\u2019s rising economic power across Asia-Pacific. The new president\u2019s anti-TPP move was expected because he had criticized the deal during the campaign. Killing the TPP, though, could have unintended consequences. Economists at research firm Capital Economics argue that Mr. Trump\u2019s decision \u201ccreated an opportunity for China to expand its influence in Asia.\u201d\u00a0 Since winning the election, trade isn\u2019t the only area in which Mr. Trump has ratcheted up his war of words with Beijing. In early December, he spoke with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and signaled he might abandon the decades-long \u201cOne China\u201d policy, which views Taiwan as a \u201crenegade province\u201d of China. He also has joined the international condemnation of China\u2019s island-building in international waters in the South China Sea. \u201cNeither side wants a trade war, but there is a risk of escalation from these trade disputes,\u201d said Michael Hirson, Asia director for the Eurasia Group. \u201cThere also is a risk if President Trump presses China on some of these very sensitive security issues like support for Taiwan and territorial disputes in the South China Sea.\u201d Should trade tensions escalate, China and the U.S. likely would target specific industries using tools like filing complaints with the International Trade Commission alleging unfair government subsidies. Competitors to U.S. companies, such as Boeing\u2019s European rival Airbus, could benefit as might other national players in the agricultural market, such as Australia and Canada. \u201cChina may retaliate by saying \u2018I will not import as many soybeans from the United States,\u2019\u201d said Yukon Huang of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cI will no longer allow Apple to operate here and use China as the base of assembly and exports. I will buy Airbus planes rather than Boeing planes. I will no longer buy turbine engines and nuclear power plants from General Electric.\u201d U.S. companies were already feeling uncomfortable in China.\u00a0A recent survey\u00a0released by the Chinese-American Chamber of Commerce found that 81 percent of respondents felt less welcome in China, and another 55 percent found that foreign companies were treated worse there than local ones. \u201cGetting anything done in China or exporting to China requires various approvals,\u201d said Hirson, formerly the Treasury Department\u2019s top official in Beijing. \u201cGiven there is no real separation between the Communist Party and the regulatory regime, it\u2019s quite easy for the government to put regulatory pressure on American firms.\u201d Even much closer to home, trade is a flashpoint for Mr. Trump. On Thursday, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto canceled a planned visit to the White House amid the dustup over President Trump\u2019s plans for a multibillion-dollar wall on the U.S. Southern border (and add a 20 percent import tax on Mexican goods to pay for it) in addition to his intention to renegotiate or scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement.\u00a0 In a recent interview with CBS Morning News, FedEx (FDX) CEO Fred Smith called on Mr. Trump to \u201crethink\u201d his trade positions. Smith noted that the average American family benefits from trade \u201cto the tune of about $13,000 in lower-price goods than would otherwise be the case.\u201d\u00a0 European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m described President Trump\u2019s tougher policies on trade and immigration as \u201cdoomed to fail.\u201d For now, though, his \u201cAmerica First\u201d vow is carrying the day.

            "article_content": "TORONTO -- Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a message for refugees rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump: Canada will welcome you.  He says he also intends to talk to Mr. Trump about the success of Canada\u2019s refugee policy.  Trudeau reacted to Trump\u2019s visa ban for people from certain Muslim-majority countries by tweeting Saturday: \u201cTo those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada.\u201d\u00a0 To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada Trudeau also posted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto\u2019s airport in late 2015. Trudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected.\u00a0 #BienvenueAuCanada pic.twitter.com/rUhrIXiFcR A spokeswoman for Trudeau said he has a message for Trump.  \u201cThe Prime Minister is looking forward to discussing the successes of Canada\u2019s immigration and refugee policy with the President when they next speak,\u201d spokeswoman Kate Purchase told The Associated Press.  Trudeau is expected to the visit the White House soon.  The prime minister has refrained from criticizing Trump to avoid offending the new president. More than 75 percent of Canada\u2019s exports go to the U.S.  Toronto Mayor John Tory also weighed in, noting that the city is the most diverse in the world.  \u201cWe understand that as Canadians we are almost all immigrants, and that no one should be excluded on the basis of their ethnicity or nationality,\u201d Tory said in a statement.\u00a0 Trump signed a sweeping executive order Friday\u00a0that he billed as a necessary step to stop \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d from coming to the U.S. Included is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen and a 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program.\u00a0 Trump\u2019s order singled out Syrians for the most aggressive ban, ordering that anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war, are indefinitely blocked from coming to the United States.\u00a0 The order said, \u201cthe entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States,\u201d and it suspended \u201cany such entry\u201d until the president has determined that \u201csufficient changes have been made to the USRAP [U.S. Refugee Admissions Program] to ensure that admission of Syrian refugees is consistent with the national interest.\u201d \u00a0 In fiscal year 2016, the U.S. admitted nearly 85,000 refugees,\u00a0according to the Pew Research Center. Almost 39,000 -- 46 percent -- of those refugees were Muslims. Roughly 12,500 were refugees from the Syrian civil war. \u00a0 \u00a0 In Canada, the Syrian refugee crisis became a major issue in the country\u2019s election in late 2015 because of the haunting image of a drowned 3-year-old Syrian boy washed up on a Turkish beach. The boy had relatives in Canada.\u00a0 By Saturday evening, Trudeau\u2019s tweet welcoming \u201cthose fleeing persecution, terror & war\u201d had more than 290,000 likes. \u201cWelcome to Canada\u201d trended in Canada.",

The Trump team\u2019s response is due at 6 p.m. ET today. President Trump suggested Monday morning that any polls that signal public disapproval of him, his administration or his policies should be considered \u201cfake news.\u201d The president seemed to suggest on Twitter that surveys measuring the public\u2019s opinion of his executive order that instituted the travel ban and called for extreme vetting are not accurate. WASHINGTON --\u00a0The debate over\u00a0Betsy DeVos\u00a0followed senators home this weekend as protests popped up outside the state offices of several GOP members. In Washington the pressure is even more intense. The Senate switchboard is swamped by hundreds of thousands of phone calls. Some Democratic senators even took their own turn at the phones, like Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. Donald Trump\u00a0attacked the \u201cfailing @nytimes\u201d on Twitter Monday, attempting to cast doubt on its reporting.\u00a0 Mr. Trump was apparently responding to a Times story published online Sunday and in the paper Monday headlined \u201cTrump and Staff Rethinking Tactics After Stumbles.\u201d The story relies largely on interviews with dozens of unnamed government officials, congressional aides and former Trump staffers and includes anecdotes that have not been published before. One says that the president\u2019s aides \u201cconfer in the dark because they can\u2019t figure out how to operate the light switches in the cabinet room.\u201d President\u00a0Trump on Monday said that news outlets are covering up terrorist attacks without citing any evidence that supports that claim. He made the comment in a speech to U.S. servicemembers at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida after receiving a briefing and eating lunch with troops. The president began talking about how \u201cradical Islamic terrorists are determined to strike our homeland\u201d as they did on 9/11, in the\u00a0Boston bombings\u00a0and in\u00a0San Bernardino. He said it\u2019s also happening \u201call over Europe\u201d like in\u00a0Paris and Nice. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten to a point where it\u2019s not even being reported. In many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn\u2019t want to report it. They have their reasons and you understand that,\u201d Mr. Trump said. There is no evidence that any media outlet is covering up terrorist attacks. An interview with the president and Fox News\u2019 Bill O\u2019Reilly will air ahead of Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl game.\u00a0 President Trump has chosen Vice President Mike Pence to head up\u00a0a commission investigating unsubstantiated claims of mass voter fraud\u00a0in the 2016 election. The president made the announcement in an interview with Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly that aired Sunday, televised just hours before the Super Bowl sporting event. \u201cI\u2019m going to set up a commission to headed by Vice President Mike Pence and we\u2019re going to look at it very, very carefully,\u201d the president told O\u2019Reilly. Vice President Mike Pence, meanwhile, attended the game in Houston as the guest of Houston Texans owner Robert McNair, but he left before the end of the game. His motorcade arrived at the airport just as James White scored the winning touchdown for the Patriots in overtime, CBS News\u2019 Josh Gross reported from the pool covering Pence. Mr. Trump tweeted today, after the Ninth Circuit rejected his appeal to immediately reinstate the travel ban. Complaining that the judge had \u201cput our country in such peril,\u201d the president tweeted, \u201cIf something \u201chappens blame him and the court system. People pouring in. Bad!\u201d Just cannot  believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad! The president is in Mar-a-Lago for the weekend, the Florida property where he continues to hold weekend meetings. Vice President Mike Pence said Sunday on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d\u00a0that President Donald Trump wasn\u2019t questioning the legitimacy of a federal judge who\u00a0halted his immigration executive order\u00a0when he lambasted the judge on Twitter this weekend -- he was \u201csimply expressing a frustration.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The latest CBS News poll shows Americans are sharply divided about President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration. Thirty-six percent say the travel ban will make the country \u201csafer from terrorism.\u201d The same number say it will make us \u201cless safe.\u201d On Mr. Trump\u2019s Supreme Court pick, 27 percent say the Senate should confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch. Fourteen percent say no, and 56 percent \u201ccan\u2019t say.\u201d  This poll started in Allentown, Pennsylvania. We began calling Wednesday and got the results overnight. In phone rooms just like this one, over 100 interviewers dialed phone numbers randomly to people all over America, reports CBS News elections director Anthony Salvanto.\u00a0 \u201cDo you think of yourself as liberal, moderate or conservative?\u201d one poll caller asked over the phone. The phone numbers randomly generated by a computer include both landlines, and these days, mostly cell phones. Eran Ben-Porath oversees the Allentown phone center that makes the calls for CBS News. So how many numbers do we typically have to dial to do a CBS poll? \u201cTo get 1,000 interviews such as we\u2019re going to get on this poll, we probably need to dial 20,000 numbers,\u201d said Ben-Porath, SSRS\u2019 vice president of public opinion research Everyone who takes the poll is included in the results. Carol DeVault from Derby, Kansas, is a Trump supporter who took today\u2019s poll.\u00a0\u201cWhen I voted for Donald Trump, it was a matter of hope that things would change, and as far as what he\u2019s doing now, so far I\u2019m in favor of the things he\u2019s been doing,\u201d DeVault said.\u00a0 We call people from all over the fifty states. The key to a good poll is that it looks like a cross section of America. We call enough people so the poll does that, which statistically happens when we get to around a 1,000 people.\u00a0We make sure the poll matches the U.S. census on demographics like age \u2013 talking to both the young and the old and everyone in between, on gender \u2013 talking to women and men, and the correct proportions by race. This is done so that the poll reflects the statistical makeup of the United States. We talk to Democrats, Republicans and Independents. Remember all polls have a margin of error. Any number you see, there\u2019s a range around it. If you don\u2019t talk to enough people, that range around any given number starts to get wider. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to add anything to questions even by way of explanation. We never want to skip questions and assume answers,\u201d SSRS senior project director Rebecca Sevem said.\u00a0 The questions these interviewers are asking are focused on the news of the day. So in the latest poll, it\u2019s the Supreme Court pick and the travel ban.\u00a0 \u201cDo you approve or disapprove of temporarily banning refugees from entering the United States?\u201d a poll caller could be heard asking. The goal is for us to word the questions to be unbiased so that people of all different views feel like they have a choice. \u201cI took the poll last night because I believe that if we\u2019re given the opportunity to express ourselves as Americans that we should do that,\u201d DeVault said. Polls are not predictions. They\u2019re what people think today. So when you see poll numbers move, remember there are people on the other end of those numbers -- and sometimes people change their mind. If you ever wonder, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they call me?\u201d Odds are we talked to someone just like you, or at least someone who agrees with you. \u00a0 \u00a0",

France\u2019s Prime Minister has called it a terrorist attack, seemingly thwarted by the beefed-up security presence in Paris following the deadly attacks of 2015.  Two weeks into Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, the country remains sharply divided along partisan lines. A new CBS News poll finds a large majority of Republicans approves of the job Mr. Trump is doing, and his recent executive order temporarily restricting entry into the U.S. by foreigners and refugees. Democrats disapprove in similar numbers. \u00a0 Republicans are thrilled with Donald Trump\u2019s pick for the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, with some calling him a \u201chome run\u201d pick for his conservative bona fides. But 27 years ago, President George H.W. Bush\u2019s Supreme Court nominee David Souter was described in the same glowing terms by Republicans, and he turned out to be just the opposite: a reliable liberal vote. Could it happen again? As the showdown over the empty seat on the Supreme Court bench continues, we\u2019re keeping a running tally of whether senators have come out against President Trump\u2019s pick Neil Gorsuch, whether they favor giving him a hearing, or whether they would support a possible filibuster of the nominee rather than allowing a straight up-or-down vote. A new CBS News poll shows Americans are sharply divided about President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration. It is important to CBS News that our viewers understand how we conduct these surveys, so we asked CBS News elections director Anthony Salvanto to take us behind the scenes.

            "article_content": "One member of the global elite has this message for his peers: ignore the youth at your peril. Among the divisions made clear at this month\u2019s annual gathering of global economic and political leaders in Davos, Switzerland -- between the rich and poor, the educated and not -- another one is emerging: the young versus the old. The youngest generations find themselves hit hardest by global inequality. Worldwide youth unemployment is on the rise and projected to hit 13.1 percent, the\u00a0International Labor Organization\u00a0found last year. The crisis has reached dramatic proportions especially in North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia, where young people make up just 17 percent of the labor force but more than 40 percent of the unemployed. Meanwhile, developed economies are struggling to deal with a workforce that is rapidly aging into their social safety nets -- and not being replaced with enough younger workers to support those benefits. Germany has seen a\u00a0shortage of skilled workers\u00a0in manufacturing and engineering fields. Japan\u2019s population is set to contract by 25 percent in less than 50 years. Even the United States, whose welfare state is minimal by comparison, faces challenges as the baby boomer generation ages into retirement and strains the country\u2019s healthcare and social security systems. This quandary has a simple solution, argues Felix Marquardt: Give the world\u2019s youth greater freedom of movement. Marquardt, a\u00a0hip-hop producer\u00a0turned security consultant turned founder of the Youthonomics think tank, has previously advocated for\u00a0paying young Europeans\u00a0to move elsewhere. Now the president of cybersecurity consultancy Cylance International, his argument for this new system is simple: Moving potential workers from developing countries where they can\u2019t find jobs to developed countries that can\u2019t find workers would help both parties. Creating what is effectively a free market in youth labor would spur countries and companies to compete for younger workers, creating a better environment for everyone, Marquardt says. It\u2019s also a way to curtail the rise of demagogues in future generations, he adds, since people who have traveled are more likely to favor open borders and less likely to subscribe to protectionism and anti-immigrant impulses. The specific mechanism Marquardt argues for is a two-year global work visa. Many economic migrants, currently leaving their insecure nations to work in Europe or the U.S., are essentially already making this choice. Marquardt\u2019s idea would formalize it and remove most of the current obstacles. \u201cIf we allow young people to move around, which today\u2019s technology allows more than it ever has, we can turn the world into a beauty contest of countries, companies, cities, vying to attract young people,\u201d he told CBS News in Davos. \u201cWhen you travel, you grow, you learn, you learn many of the skills that you imperatively need to become an adventurer, an entrepreneur.\u201d In addition to solving labor shortages, he says the program would go a long way to amplifying the voices of youth, who are not well represented in international decision-making bodies as well as in national and local elections. On the surface, this seems like a neat idea, as immigrants overwhelmingly benefit the countries they enter. Immigration\u00a0boosts a country\u2019s economic growth. In the U.S., immigrants accounted for nearly half of workforce growth from 2002 to 2012, and more than 70 percent of Europe\u2019s workforce growth over the same time period, according to the\u00a0OECD. The same brief also found that immigrants contribute more in taxes and social contributions than they receive in benefits and that they contribute to overall technological progress. Immigrants are more likely to start businesses than native-born Americans, found an analysis by the Small Business Administration; and immigrants were behind 51 percent of America\u2019s privately owned\u00a0billion-dollar startups. Many studies have also found that immigrants provide\u00a0a slight boost\u00a0to wages of native-born workers, though the data is not as uniform on this point. Other studies suggest that competition from immigrants lowers wages for high-school dropouts and the least educated workers. Still, it\u2019s not clear how countries will be made to accept these economic migrants, especially with nativist sentiments surging in much of Europe, Australia, the U.S. and even Canada. And even if developed countries were to go along with a global visa program that aims to create a mass movement of young people of color, it\u2019s not hard to see what could go wrong with this scenario. Widespread use of work permits risks creating a permanent global underclass, akin to the millions of\u00a0migrants from Southeast Asiacurrently working in\u00a0Persian Gulf\u00a0nations, who are susceptible to\u00a0abuses\u00a0and cut off from politically participating in their home countries. And even complete freedom of movement can\u2019t create more jobs for workers, who will outnumber the available jobs by 400 million, according to\u00a0The Guardian. Still, if a program along these lines takes off, it could potentially act as a foil to fundamentalism. Marquardt hopes that giving young people new and empowering experiences will spur more entrepreneurs -- something that will be necessary if the job shortage is as dire as economists predict. Whether it does or not, bringing young people together would help develop the political consciousness of a new generation that finds itself increasingly grappling with the poor political choices of its predecessors. And that is something to encourage. Reporting for CBS News from Davos, Switzerland: Lulu Chiang, Lauren Hoenemeyer and Gilad Thaler.",

            "article_content": "In his first speech to State Department employees, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made a pitch for unity on Thursday, praising employees at every level of the department.\u00a0 \u201cI know this was a hotly contested election and we do not all feel the same way about the outcome. Each of us is entitled to the expression of our political beliefs but we cannot let our personal convictions overwhelm our ability to work as one team,\u201d Tillerson said. Tillerson, a former Exxon Mobil CEO, specifically showered State Department employees with adulation for carrying out their duties \u201cregardless of who was in charge.\u201d He also made a point to thank both civil and foreign service officers for the work they contribute to the State Department on a daily basis. And the self-proscribed \u201cnew guy\u201d explained that he will be \u201cproud\u201d to draw on their expertise. \u201cThe individuals who comprise this department are among the finest public servants in the world,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cState Department staffers in the field are not just conduits for policies and plans. You are our emissaries of our nation and the ideals we stand for. When people see you they see America.\u201d Still, Tillerson signaled that change is likely. He committed to a review of processes that need reform and promised efficiency of \u201ctalent and resources.\u201d He also stood up against implementing any knee-jerk adjustments. \u201cChange for the sake of the sake of change can be counterproductive and that will never be my approach. But we cannot sustain ineffective traditions over optimal outcomes,\u201d he said. Tillerson walks into a tense environment as just this week State Department employees submitted a dissent memo in opposition to Trump\u2019s Executive order on immigration. Perhaps alluding to that memo, Tillerson committed to developing an atmosphere of respect.\u00a0 \u201cNo one will tolerate disrespect of anyone,\u2019\u2019 he said. Tillerson, who rose up the ranks throughout his career at Exxon, gave the speech a personal touch in explaining that he had been ready to run off into retirement when he got the call from Trump. In that moment his wife told him \u201cyou are supposed to do this.\u201d Mixing in dashes of humor, Tillerson also got the crowd laughing. At the top he joked that the prayer breakfast had gone longer than expected because people felt they had to pray longer this year -- which is why he was late. He also jokingly assured the room that Congress is as thorough as ever in regards to the confirmation process, which he had just completed. Without much formal foreign policy experience, gauging Tillerson\u2019s views can be difficult. Yet after today Tillerson has signaled that he won\u2019t dive into this job alone -- he will closely rely on his new colleagues. \u201cI remind you that our undertakings are larger than ourselves or our personal careers. Our duty is to faithfully represent our nation in the arena of foreign affairs,\u201d Tillerson said.",

            "article_content": "BRUSSELS - The European Union on Tuesday told President Donald Trump that his \u201cAmerica First\u201d and protectionist trade policies are \u201cdoomed to fail\u201d and said the kind of trade deals like the one he scuttled with the Asian Pacific countries \u201care a handy scapegoat.\u201d Instead of protectionism, EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said the EU -- the world\u2019s biggest trading bloc -- remains committed to open borders and economies. She insisted that most countries still share the same vision of open commerce and investments. \u201cThose who in the 21st century think that we can become great again by rebuilding borders, reimposing trade barriers, restricting people\u2019s freedom to move, they are doomed to fail,\u201d Malmstrom said during a speech. It was the most comprehensive and scathing EU reaction since Trump came into office Friday. \u201cBuilding a wall is not the answer,\u201d Malmstrom told an audience at the Bruegel think tank. \u201cThe success of the EU relies on our open societies.\u201d Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership on Monday was seen as an indication of a more closed U.S. trade policy that could include tariffs on some imports and exclude foreign competition to favor local industry. Trump argued he was protecting domestic jobs by pulling out of the agreement, which would have lowered barriers to trade between the Pacific countries. Malmstrom insisted the problem is an inability of economies to deal with evolution -- in this case \u201cautomation: with machines and computers replacing manual work.\u201d \u201cAgainst this reality, trade deals are a handy scapegoat,\u201d she said. The Europeans had wanted to seal a free trade deal between the EU and U.S., the world\u2019s two biggest economies, before President Barack Obama left office. Proponents said it would have added about 100 billion euros (about $100 billion) a year in output to each side. \u201cThe election of Donald Trump seems likely to put our EU-U.S. negotiations firmly in the freezer,\u201d said Malmstrom. Instead, she said that the EU would now center its efforts on deals with some other nations and blocs, including Japan, Mexico and the Mercosur South American trade group. And as Trump has been talking about undoing NAFTA, the North America free trade deal, the EU is on the verge of clinching an agreement with Canada. Both sides have already signed, and the European Parliament is set to ratify it next month. Malmstrom said the alternative to such far-reaching agreements \u201cis little short of catastrophic.\u201d",

President Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto spoke on the phone for an hour Friday morning amid rising tensions over Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal for a southern border wall, a White House official confirmed to CBS News. Mr. Trump and Pe\u00f1a Nieto were supposed to meet in Washington next week, on Tuesday, but the Mexican president said Thursday that\u00a0he was canceling the visit\u00a0after Mr. Trump moved forward with plans to construct a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and have Mexico pay for construction.\u00a0 President Trump will speak with Russian leader Vladimir Putin over the weekend, senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said in an interview Friday. Conway confirmed to \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d that it would be taking place Saturday.\u00a0 \u201cThe president continues to talk to leaders of foreign nations,\u201d Conway said, also pointing to the Mr. Trump\u2019s meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday. \u201cThat\u2019s what presidents do.\u201d\u00a0 Anti-abortion protesters march in Washington just shy of a week after the women\u2019s march on Washington last Saturday, and the president is expected to call in to voice his support. Vice President Mike Pence and top adviser Kellyanne Conway are also addressing the movement.\u00a0 President Trump said he would be in favor of deploying the so-called \u201cnuclear option\u201d if his Supreme Court nominee gets blocked in the Senate, meaning that he would back a change in rules to allow a simple majority vote to push through his chosen justice.\u00a0 \u201cWould you want [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell to use the nuclear option?\u201d Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity asked the president Thursday. \u201cYes, I would,\u201d Mr. Trump responded, citing Democrat \u201cobstructionists\u201d in the Senate. President Trump spoke directly over the phone Saturday with the National Park Service (NPS) chief following his inauguration -- \u00a0the same day the White House aired grievances about reporting on crowd sizes at the historic ceremony. A National Park Service spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that Michael Reynolds, the acting NPS director, had a phone call with Mr. Trump over the weekend. The Washington Post first reported on the direct communications between the two.\u00a0 President Trump is expected to sign a executive action related to national security at 4:30 p.m. at the Defense Department.\u00a0 President Trump\u00a0threatened to cancel a meeting with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u00a0that was supposed to be next week, following the foreign leader\u2019s statements Wednesday night that he was reconsidering his visit to the United States. But then\u00a0Pe\u00f1a Nieto beat him to the punch.\u00a0 Congressional leaders\u00a0are considering legislation to fund President Trump\u2019s proposed wall\u00a0along the U.S.-Mexico border -- House Speaker Paul Ryan told MSNBC\u2019s Greta Van Susteren Congress would front the money. \u201cFirst off, we\u2019re going to pay for it and front the money up,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cBut I do think that there are various ways -- as you know, I know your follow-up question is, is Mexico going to pay for the wall? There are a lot of different ways of getting Mexico to contribute to doing this. And there are different ways of defining how, exactly they pay for it.\u201d \u00a0 In an\u00a0interview with The New York Times\u00a0published Thursday, Stephen Bannon said that the media is the \u201copposition party\u201d of the new administration and \u201cshould be embarrassed and humiliated\u201d by the unanticipated election result. The article cites Bannon as referring to himself at one point as \u201cDarth Vader.\u201d White House spokesman Sean Spicer\u00a0said Thursday President Trump is proposing a 20 percent tax on imports, particularly on products and services from Mexico, so that revenues could be used to pay for the construction of Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed wall along the U.S. southern border. Later in the afternoon, however, Spicer and White House chief of staff Reince Priebus told reporters that the proposal was in fact just one of several options the White House was considering, including a border tax in the range of 5 - 20 percent. \u201cIt is part of a buffet of options,\u201d White House chief of staff Reince Priebus told reporters, according to CBS News\u2019 Margaret Brennan. Mr. Trump\u00a0headed up to Philadelphia\u00a0to visit the Republican House and Senate retreat. He began by ribbing Republican leaders about their pre-Trump electoral losses and then touched on a number of topics, including his executive actions. He assured the American people that they \u201cwill not pay for the wall.\u201d And he said he\u2019s working on a tax reform bill that would include making Mexico foot the bill for the wall \u201cif we decide to go that route.\u201d Mr. Trump also commented on the executive order he signed on immigration Wednesday, saying that it means the \u201cimmediate removal of criminal aliens\u201d and \u201ccracking down on sanctuary cities.\u201d President Trump\u00a0blasted Chelsea Manning\u00a0in an early morning tweet Thursday, calling the convicted Army leaker an \u201cungrateful TRAITOR\u201d who he said should \u201cnever have been released from prison.\u201d The president also charged that Manning had called former President Obama a \u201cweak leader,\u201d though the transgender soldier -- whose prison commutation was one of\u00a0Mr. Obama\u2019s last acts in the Oval Office\u00a0-- didn\u2019t exactly say that.\u00a0 At the Pentagon, Mr. Trump signed two executive actions -- one on \u201cextreme vetting\u201d and another on rebuilding the military. \u201cI\u2019m establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States,\u201d the president told an audience at the Pentagon Friday.\u00a0 Mr. Trump was initially expected to roll out\u00a0an executive action on voter fraud\u00a0today, but that has now been postponed and the timing for its release is unclear. \u201cIt will be a follow up on the announcement yesterday of his commitment to better understand voter fraud, faulty registration, etcetera,\u201d Spicer told reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday, CBS News Steven Portnoy reports. A day after Mr. Trump signed an immigration executive action targeting sanctuary cities, the\u00a0Miami-Dade mayor dropped his city\u2019s status\u00a0as a sanctuary city.\u00a0",

But we\u2019re going to start renegotiating on NAFTA, on immigration, on security at the border.\u201d Mexico, the president went on, has so far been \u201cterrific\u201d in their conversations, and Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto -- who spoke with Mr. Trump by phone Saturday -- has been \u201creally very amazing.\u201d  Mr. Trump ran a campaign in 2016 promising to rip up international trade deals, calling them a \u201cdisaster\u201d and blasting them as reasons for the lowering employment opportunities in the manufacturing industry.  In an interview on CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in 2015, the then-candidate promised to revamp NAFTA or \u201cwe will break it.\u201d \u00a0 \u201cEvery agreement has an end,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cEvery agreement has to be fair. Every agreement has a defraud clause. We\u2019re being defrauded by all these countries.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for commerce secretary also listed a second look at NAFTA as a top priority.\u00a0 In his confirmation hearing last week, billionaire investor Wilbur Ross said the trade agreement was \u201clogically the first thing for us to deal with.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWe must solidify relationships in the best way we can in our own territory before we go off to other jurisdictions,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will be a very, very early topic in this administration...I think all aspects of NAFTA will be put on the table.\u201d The discussions to overhaul the 23-year-old trade deal could start as early as next week: the president is scheduled to meet with the Mexican president on Jan. 31, according to White House press secretary Sean Spicer.\u00a0 And Mr. Trump said Sunday at East Room ceremony that he has also scheduled a meeting with Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada, the third country directly impacted by NAFTA.  Mr. Trump is also expected to meet with British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday, following an appearance May will make at a retreat in Philadelphia for Congressional Republicans.  The president, in his wide-ranging remarks to his senior White House staff, briefly hinted at running for re-election in 2020. \u201cWe are going to do some great things over the next eight years,\u201d he said, before stepping aside to allow Vice President Mike Pence to swear in his administration officials. Mr. Trump also weighed in on the traditional letter every departing president gives to his successor, which he held up during the ceremony to show the audience.  \u201cWe will cherish that,\u201d he said, before ribbing that \u201cwe won\u2019t even tell the press what is in that letter.\u201d",

And he spotlighted the historic Supreme Court ruling that same-sex couples now have the constitutional right to marry in the United States. \u201cNo union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family,\u201d Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the majority in 2015. \u201cWe\u2019ve made history in our work to reaffirm that all are created equal,\u201d Mr. Obama tweeted. From realizing marriage equality to removing barriers to opportunity, we've made history in our work to reaffirm that all are created equal. He finished off his tweeting by adding that he looked forward to standing with fellow Americans \u201cas a citizen,\u201d and wished everyone a happy 2017. His messages was followed up a swell of responses on Twitter, with some coming from admiration alums like former speechwriter Jon Favreau.\u00a0 I'm so proud of this President, and all my colleagues and friends who worked their asses off for eight years to make this country better. https://t.co/0uVgpyMo7P Some of this is spin. But a lot of it is what will make history see Obama as a great president. https://t.co/0qqxViPMYy Mr. Obama\u2019s tweets, which were shared on the @POTUS handle, will be moved to a\u00a0new handle called @POTUS44. The @POTUS handle will transition over to Mr. Trump when he takes over the presidency come January 20.\u00a0 Mr. Trump has been critical about the Obama administration\u2019s stance on immigration, foreign policy and the economy. However, he told CBS News\u2019 Lesley Stahl on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d after winning the 2016 Presidential Election that he was open to keeping some of the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obama\u2019s signature domestic policy.\u00a0 In his final days in office, Mr. Obama will go to the Capitol Hill to meet with Democrats and strategize a way to save the healthcare law, which the White House says provides health coverage to 20 million Americans. Mr. Obama will be delivering a farewell address to the nation from Chicago next week, the White House confirmed Monday. The speech, which will be delivered from his hometown, will possibly be his last chance to defend his presidential legacy directly to the American people before departing the Oval Office.",

            "article_content": "Hispanic people in the U.S. are divided about what Donald Trump\u2019s presidency means for them, according to a new survey from the Pew Research Center.  The poll found that 54 percent of Hispanics said that they\u2019re confident about their place in America after Mr. Trump\u2019s election and 41 percent said they have serious concerns.  Among undocumented immigrants, 55 percent said that they have serious concerns about their place in the U.S. The same was said by 38 percent of U.S.-born Hispanic and 34 percent of Hispanic immigrants to the U.S. Forty-nine percent of Hispanic lawful permanent residents said they have serious concerns, too.  Nearly half, 49 percent, said the situation for Hispanics is about the same today as it was a year ago, Pew found. Nearly a third, 32 percent, said their situation was worsened and 16 percent said it has improved.  More than two-thirds of undocumented immigrants, 67 percent, said they worry a lot about being deported or someone close to them being deported and 22 percent said they worry some. Even two-thirds of green card holders said they are worried about deportation of themselves or someone close to them. The same was said by a third of U.S.-born Hispanics while 55 percent of them said they don\u2019t worry much or at all about deportation.  The Department of Homeland Security issued two memos Tuesday morning that could expand the number of immigrants detained or deported as part the administration\u2019s crackdown on undocumented immigrants in the U.S. While a DHS official rejected the idea of this plan leading to mass deportations, the official said that just because criminals will be prioritized doesn\u2019t mean everyone else is exempt from potential enforcement.  The poll found that 40 percent of Hispanic adults think Mr. Trump will be a poor or terrible president and 28 percent said he would be an average president. Twenty-two percent said he would be a good or great president.  The survey polled 1,001 Hispanic adults between Dec. 7 and Jan. 15 with a 3.6 percentage point margin of error.

Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, say that Russia has continued its cyberattacks against the United States. Morell and Rogers, who both serve on the advisory council for the Alliance for Securing Democracy, say that the U.S. has failed to stop Russia from using social media to \"disseminate propaganda designed to weaken our nation.\u00a0 \"There is a perception among the media and general public that Russia ended its social-media operations following last year's election and that we need worry only about future elections. But that perception is wrong. Russia's information operations in the United States continued after the election and they continue to this day,\" they write in a Tuesday op-ed for The Washington Post. The two write that the issue should be of concern for everyone -- Republicans and Democrats alike.\u00a0 \"Foreign governments, overtly or covertly, should not be allowed to play with our democracy.\" They write that the Russian government is still deploying effective tactics that target specific parties and politicians, much as they did by manipulating social media in the build up to the 2016 election.\u00a0 According to Rogers and Morell, Russian-influenced Twitter accounts were leading participants in November's #BoycottKuerig movement on social media. The boycott began to protest the coffee-maker company pulling its adds for Sean Hannity's Fox News show.\u00a0 \"This was a Russian attack on a U.S. company and on our economy,\" Morell and Rogers say.\u00a0 More recently, Morell and Rogers say that in a single week in December alone, Kremlin-linked social media accounts attempted to discredit the FBI over an agent's anti-Trump text messages, to attack ABC News for its erroneous reporting on Mr. Trump, and to warn about violence by immigrants after the acquittal of a undocumented man who was\u00a0accused of murdering Kate Steinle in San Francisco. Morell and Rogers warn that Russia's use of social media as a \"political weapon\" will keep moving forward, with more countries expected to follow suit, unless the U.S. intervenes. \"The sanctions that the Obama administration and Congress put in place in the aftermath of the 2016 election are steps in the right direction, but they were not significant enough to check Russian President Vladimir Putin,\" Morell and Rogers suggest. They add, \"True deterrence requires policies that prevent adversaries from achieving their objectives while imposing significant costs on their regimes. So far, we have done neither.\" Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

            "article_content": "One year ago today, Americans elected Donald Trump as our 45th president. What do they think now? Democrat Halle Minchin-Skook, a special education teacher who voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, said her views on President Trump have not changed since the election.  \"His rhetoric \u2013 he's just a bully,\" Michin-Skook told CBS News' Elaine Quijano. \"And I just morally, I cannot support someone like that.\" Republican Steven Shook, a musician who voted for Mr. Trump, said he'd still cast the same vote.  \"I really feel like, in a lot of ways, he got a crash course in Politics 101, but at the same time, he's really come through fairly well,\" Shook said. In our ongoing series, \"We the People,\" we've followed four people from across the country with varying political beliefs and perspectives. We brought the four of them \u2013 Michin-Skook, Shook, Leo Smith and Cesar Vargas \u2013\u00a0 to New York City to meet for the first time. Smith, an activist and businessman, also voted for Mr. Trump last fall. He ran for a seat in Georgia's state senate and lost the election on Tuesday.  \"I think even more today, I'm more convinced that Donald Trump was the right person for what we needed in America at this time,\" Smith said. \"The economic growth that we are experiencing. I think that the last couple of months we've experienced three percent growth and that is a bigger number than I thought that was even possible.\"  Vargas, a lawyer and undocumented immigrant who couldn't vote, wasn't as positive. \u00a0  \"This administration disappointed me because of the fact that he is trying divide all of us, when, in fact, we're all in this together. And, yeah, I cannot support someone like that,\" Vargas said.  \"We have\u2026 been divided, we've just been silent about it,\" Smith said in response.  The group also reflected on the Charlottesville white supremacist rally in August that led to violent clashes, which starkly exposed divisions within the country.  \"You have people who are truly racist, people who are truly anti-immigrant, people who truly want to have this nation as a white nation,\" Vargas said. \"And this administration is just simply, surprisingly is just fueling that division amongst us.\"   \"I was horrified by that entire situation in Charlottesville,\" Smith said. \"I mean, Donald Trump did not create white nationalism. He did not create the Nazis. \u2026 Those people existed. And so we needed to see them. They are in the light now. \u2026 And so, yeah, the way I've always looked at Donald Trump is sort of like he's a catalyst to bring awareness.\"  \"There is nothing more anti-American than those groups,\" Shook said. \"No offense to the media, but I think the media really construes it into that whole thing and helping place blame on the president.\" Mr. Trump received criticism after he blamed \"both sides\" for the Charlottesville violence.  \"You had a group on one side that was bad and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. And nobody wants to say that, but I'll say it right now. You had a group on the other side that came charging in without a permit and they were very, very violent,\" Mr. Trump said in August.  \"It's true,\" Shook said. \"There is violence on both sides of it. There is bad people on both sides of it. And it's not just Donald Trump.\"\u00a0 Minchin-Skook, on the other hand, said she was \"appalled\" by Mr. Trump's response.\u00a0 \"I think Donald Trump's rhetoric has allowed these people to be more vocal about it. And honestly, I think it's a good thing because now we can do something about it,\" she said.  A recent CBS News poll shows the president's overall job approval rating is 39 percent. Among Republicans, 84 percent approve of his performance. \"The last time we talked to you, Steven and Halle, you both agreed that the president was effective in dealing with global issues like Syria and with Korea,\" Quijano said.   \"I do agree with that,\" Minchin-Skook said. \"We have the strongest military in the world. We need to keep it that way. And I agree with\u2026 Syria, how we bombed over there.\" But she said the president \"needs work\" on his rhetoric and how he speaks about other world leaders, including North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. \"Like the 'Rocket Man' and the 'fire and fury,'\" Minchin-Skook said. \"Like you can say those things but not using that verbiage.\"   \"It's one thing to be tough in the world arena but another things to be reckless,\" Vargas added. \u00a0 Shook said he believes Mr. Trump has a \"compassionate side.\"  \"I do believe that he's improving,\" Shook said. \"The thing about Donald Trump is that he's not a politician, he's a businessman. And he's also a TV personality, too. \u2026 And he's learning\u2026 what it's like to be a leader of this country. And I think that seeing that gave me a lot of hope.\"  But Vargas said Mr. Trump's rhetoric has \"concrete, detrimental effects.\" Despite having been a businessman and TV personality, he said the country needs Mr. Trump to be a president right now.  \"Like what happened in Puerto Rico \u2014 U.S. American citizens who have suffered and lost everything,\" Vargas said. \"And then he throws napkins as if this is a football game.\"   \"Is there anything that you heard today that surprised you or changed your opinion at all?\" Quijano asked the group. \"Well, being able to engage with folks from all over the country with, you know, sort of different, divergent backgrounds\u2026 Look, we are very similar. We are very similar,\" Smith said. \"We all have aspirational hopes for our country, for our communities.\"   \"I think, for me, it's just bringing all of us together and appreciating each other as neighbors, not as, 'Oh, you're Republican, you're my enemy,'\" Vargas said.  \"We don't always agree on things, but if more people would just talk to one another respectfully and respect people's differences of opinion, I think the United States would be a much better place,\" Minchin-Skook said.  \"For the most part, I think that we all want to see everybody doing well,\" Shook said. \"And we all want to\u00a0see the president succeed.\"\u00a0",

Former first lady of Mexico Margarita Zavala told the network in a phone interview Wednesday that \"the wall does not help in any way the relationship between the two countries,\" adding that the wall is \"pulling us apart.\" Zavala is expected to be the nominee of the center-right National Action Party in this summer's Mexican presidential election. The wife of ex-president Felipe Calderon, who has been referred to as the \"Hillary Clinton of Mexico\" in local media reports, went on to say that \"the U.S. has to decide: What kind of a relationship does it want with Mexico? I think Donald Trump and the United States have a lot to lose if we don't get along, so it's time to decide how we're going to conduct our relationship in the future.\" While Mr. Trump officials have since conceded the fight over funding for the border wall which will now be put off until the fiscal 2018 negotiations, the president vowed in a tweet that it will indeed be built to help stop drugs from entering the U.S. Don't let the fake media tell you that I have changed my position on the WALL. It will get built and help stop drugs, human trafficking etc. But Zavala, according to NBC, says Mexico \"will never pay for the wall.\" This isn't the first time Zavala gone after Mr. Trump. She previously aimed tweets at him when he was invited to visit her country, saying \"he is not welcome.\" Sr. @realDonaldTrump aunque lo hayan invitado, sepa que no es bienvenido.

Now he is the billionaire behind America\u2019s bestselling Greek yogurt, Chobani.\u00a0 But the immigrant living the American dream has been harshly criticized for sharing a little of that dream with refugees by hiring them to work in his yogurt plants.\u00a0 It\u2019s one part of his remarkable story which he tells to Steve Kroft for a 60 Minutes profile Sunday, April 9 at 7 p.m. ET/PT. Ulukaya\u2019s 5-year-old plant in Twin Falls, Idaho, is partly staffed by refugees, some from Muslim countries, who were resettled by the U.S. government. It became a flash point for the right during the past election when it was claimed he brought refugees, crime and tuberculosis to the town.\u00a0 One headline read: \u201cAmerican yogurt tycoon vows to choke U.S. with Muslims.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIt was an emotional time. People...hate you for doing something right,\u201d says Ulukaya. \u201cThere\u2019s not much you can do.\u201d Refugees helped Ulukaya build his business at a smaller plant in upstate New York. As demand grew for his product, he needed more workers and turned to refugees the government had resettled in Utica, New York.\u00a0 He provided transportation to the plant in New Berlin and translators on the floor.\u00a0 \u201cThe minute they get a job, that\u2019s the minute they stop being a refugee \u2026 They are the most loyal, hard-working people right now in our plant here. We have 19 different nationalities, 16 different translators,\u201d he tells Kroft. It was natural for Ulukaya to turn to refugees once again to help staff his much larger operation in Twin Falls.\u00a0 Idaho Governor Butch Otter defends Ulukaya, whose plant has created over a 1,000 jobs and helped to make Twin Falls a thriving town.\u00a0 \u201cI think his care about his employees, whether they be refugees or they be folks that were born 10 miles from where they\u2019re working \u2013 I believe his advocacy for that person is no different,\u201d says Otter. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u201d Ulukaya was born into a shepherding life where he learned to make yogurt from the milk of the family\u2019s goats and sheep.\u00a0 He came to the U.S. as a student with hardly any money and build his huge, profitable business that has become the source for his philanthropic efforts aimed at helping refugees.\u00a0 He has donated millions to the care of refugees in Europe and the Middle East in addition to helping them thrive in America by hiring them in his plants. The name \u201cChobani\u201d he chose for his product speaks to his life. He tells Kroft, \u201c[It means] shepherd.\u00a0 It\u2019s a very beautiful word. It represents peace\u2026giving\u2026kindness and it meant a lot to me\u2026I come from a life with shepherds and mountains and all that stuff.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW DELHI -- Life for the 14,000 Rohingya Muslim refugees crammed into slums in the Indian capital is a daily struggle. There is little in the way of sanitation. Even electricity can be hard to come by. Row after row of small shanties -- most, just simple bamboo frames covered with tarps -- are crammed onto low-lying pieces of land in New Delhi. There are no proper roads, just narrow tracks weaving through the fetid maze of shacks. In one slum, home to about 50 Rohingya refugee families, there are just two water pumps and a couple toilets for all to share. Human and animal waste litters the alleyways, drawing armies of flies and mosquitoes in the steaming Delhi summers when temperatures regularly top 110 degrees.  \"Health and sanitation are the key challenges here,\" Muhammad Haroon told CBS News. He lives in the slum with his children, including a son born just three months ago. \"Our children fall ill due to mosquito bites and the unhygienic conditions here.\" The United Nations refugee agency helps the Rohingya, who fled alleged government-backed persecution in their home country of Myanmar. The UNHCR helps the refugees gain access to public education and health facilities in India, but many of the kids don't actually go to school, and if they do, they often drop out within months.  Most adults in the slums don't have a stable income. A few have opened shops funded by UNHCR, like Haroon, but most work as laborers, earning less than $5 a day -- and they don't get work every day.  \"This is not a human life,\" refugee Ali Johar told CBS News. \"The basic human rights; a proper place to stay, toilet, water, are missing.\" \u00a0  And those are just the immediate concerns.  In early April, Indian media reports suggested the government was working on a plan to try to arrest and deport the Rohingya refugees on the grounds they were illegal immigrants. Some officials within the Indian security and intelligence agencies believe the Rohinya are prone to radicalization by Muslim extremist groups.  But it may be difficult -- if not impossible -- for India to deport the Rohingya, even if such planning is afoot. A senior UNHCR official in India told CBS News it was \"considered part of customary international law, binding on all states\" that registered refugees cannot be sent back to their home countries if they could be subjected to persecution.  The official also noted that India is party to several international human rights conventions, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, Convention on the Rights of the Child, which would make a mass-deportation impossible.  \"If India sends us back to Myanmar, we will face much more persecution than we have already faced,\" Johar told CBS News. \"It will be like feeding us to the sharks.\"  Just as they did at home, the Rohingya face regular threats in the country to which they have fled. A trade body in Jammu, northern India, has threatened to \"identify and kill\" Rohingya Muslims and Bangladeshi immigrants in the city if they're not deported. \"Why doesn't the world help solve our issue with the Myanmar government, so that we won't need to flee to any other country?\" Johar wondered as he spoke to CBS News. Myanmar's de-facto leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi spent decades under house arrest in Myanmar as an outspoken critic of the country's ruling military junta, which seized power in the early 1960s.  Significant reforms, much lauded by the West, saw her released in 2015 and her political party won huge support in elections that year. Her rise to power, after years as an outspoken but imprisoned advocate for democracy, brought new hope that the contentious issue of the Rohingya might finally be addressed. In a recent interview, however, Suu Kyi denied that her country's Rohingya Muslim minority is deliberately targeted. \"Ethnic cleansing is too strong an expression\" she said, suggesting violence in the western Rakhine state also included, \"Muslims killings Muslims.\" Johar believes Myanmar's government is still, \"in the habit of lying to the international community.\"  \"When Suu Kyi was under detention, she told the world, 'please use your liberty to promote ours,'\" Johar said. \"I want to tell her today, 'now you are free, please use your freedom to promote ours.'\" Johar does not, however, intend to just wait for others to help his people. When he first arrived in India he worked as a laborer on construction sites for about six months, but then managed to finish school in Delhi with the help of the UNHCR. Now he's studying to earn a bachelor's degree from the University of Delhi, and he intends to become a lawyer, to fight for his people.",

That two-track approach - going directly to typically Democratic voters and vocal opponents of President Donald Trump, while using television to convince just enough independents and even moderate Republicans - is a necessary balancing act for Ossoff to pull off an upset over Republican Karen Handel in a district Republicans have held since 1979. For Democrats nationally, it's the latest attempt ahead of the 2018 midterm elections to answer questions that linger after a disastrous presidential election cycle and two recent losses in special congressional elections in GOP-leaning Kansas and Montana. Can Democrats win back Republican seats based on anti-Trump sentiments among the young voters, women and nonwhites who helped fuel former President Barack Obama's wins? Should the priority be white voters who have drifted away from the party and helped deliver Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton in November? Or, as Ossoff is attempting, can Democrats manage both with the same campaign? The strategic two-step \"isn't contradictory,\" says pollster Paul Harstad, who worked on both Obama campaigns. Harstad notes the so-called \"Obama coalition\" included voters across the demographic and ideological spectrum, even working-class whites identified as Trump's anchor, and Harstad said Democratic performances this year, even in closer-than-expected losses in Kansas and Montana, suggest a rebound. \"It's a combination of an energetic base, soft Democrats, independents and a small slice of Republicans,\" Harstad said, and it is \"probably a harbinger of things to come.\" Democrats need to pick up 24 seats to reclaim a House majority, and they're also targeting several GOP-held governor's seats in Democratic-leaning and presidential battleground states. For his part, Ossoff sidesteps the electoral math and its implications beyond Georgia. \"This campaign is about unifying people in this community who share core values ... and who recognize that our interests are more aligned than career politicians and partisans would have us believe,\" he says. Other Democrats are more forthright. \"If we can win over 50 percent in this district, we know we can do that statewide and around the country,\" says Georgia Democratic Chairman DuBose Porter. Ossoff aides and supporters, meanwhile, acknowledge the dual method. Trump's election, they say, has fired up the left, while giving Ossoff openings with some Republicans. Trump barely edged Clinton in the district last November and fell shy of a majority; previous Republican presidential nominees won more than 60 percent of the vote. Nationally, Democrats are targeting 23 House districts held by Republicans but where Clinton defeated Trump, and there are several more like the Georgia 6th where Trump underperformed the usual GOP benchmark. The idea is that Democrats like Ossoff don't have to feed liberal intensity by harping on Trump and Republicans in a way that risks turning off potential swing or crossover voters. And, it's worth noting, Georgia voters already see a deluge of GOP ads framing Ossoff as a \"D.C. liberal\" and the \"hand-picked candidate\" of House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Ossoff \"talks like a Republican,\" Handel quipped at a recent campaign appearance alongside House Speaker Paul Ryan. Voters like Skyler Hanson, 21, and Hannah Gray, 22, seem to validate Ossoff's angles. Both attended the recent happy hour party for millennials, where they both signed up to knock on doors for the campaign. \"We just couldn't believe Trump won,\" Gray says. The two are recent University of Georgia graduates who will soon start jobs in Atlanta, just south of the 6th District, but they are remaining in their parents' suburban homes to vote June 20. They say they aren't worried about Ossoff's pledges to \"work with anyone.\" \"All my favorite podcasts have had him on, so that's pretty cool,\" Hanson says. Ossoff's recent campaign schedule also is dotted with gatherings like a block party celebrating Asian-American Heritage Month and La Raza Fest, a celebration of Hispanic culture. He's touted an endorsement from the Georgia Association of Black Women Attorneys and launched Latinos for Ossoff. At those events, Ossoff steers clear of Trump and blatantly partisan rhetoric that animates liberals like Hanson and Gray. At the same time, he continues with his moderate, seemingly nonpartisan message on the airwaves. His latest ad bemoaning wasteful spending doesn't mention his party affiliation. Clinton's loss may serve as a cautionary tale for Ossoff. Clinton regularly blasted Trump, while her voter turnout efforts tried to replicate Obama's electorate. But she also pitched herself a get-it-done centrist, with her \"Stronger Together\" slogan. Ultimately, she fell short of Obama's vote totals among minorities, young voters and whites. Nonetheless, Ossoff backer Johanna Gadomski maintains her candidate is striking the right tone in Georgia. \"That makes him a more efficient candidate for me,\" says the 18-year-old, who works with political refugees from other nations, \"because I think he can actually be more equipped to get stuff done when he's in Washington.\" She pauses and adds, \"Hopefully.\"",

Coming to the U.S. as a refugee  \"It's really very difficult, very difficult, you cannot imagine it,\" Albawi tells CBS News.  Albawi and his family escaped the violence in Iraq 6 months ago.\u00a0 Now, they live in this San Diego suburb with other refugees. \u00a0  Albawi says most people in the area are from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. California resettled nearly 8,000 refugees last year, the most in the country. The state also received more Syrian refugees than any other.\u00a0 Starting over in a new world comes with challenges, like learning English and finding a place to live. It often takes weeks before refugees receive government benefits.  \"With a constant stream of new refugee families arriving here in southern California each month, volunteers are scrambling to get them much needed resources,\" says Miry Whitehill, who launched a website called Miry's List. \u00a0Families make a list of their needs like diapers, clothes and furniture -- and donors can purchase the items on Amazon. Whitehill started with three families eight months ago.  \"Around the time of the election, I stopped being able to keep up with the inbound messages from volunteers and donors,\" she says.     \tNow she's working with 100.

She was addressing a luncheon for Annie\u2019s List, which works to elect progressive women in the state of Texas.  During her tenure at the State Department and her presidential campaign, Clinton advocated for more aggressive action to deter Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and said the U.S. should implement a no-fly zone. She reiterated that position in an event in New York Thursday just hours before the airstrikes began. \u201cAs I said yesterday afternoon it is essential that the world does more to deter Assad from committing future murderous atrocities,\u201d Clinton said Friday. \u201cBut the action taken last night needs to be followed by a broader strategy to end Syria\u2019s civil war and to eliminate ISIS strongholds on both sides of the border so I hope this administration will move forward in a way that is both strategic and consistent with our values.\u201d She did not mention Mr. Trump by name when discussing Syria, but concluded that the action in Syria the night before \u201cserve as a reminder that \u201cpolitics matter enormously.\u201d \u201cThe leaders we choose matter. The role the United States plays in the world matters,\u201d Clinton said. During her speech she lauded gains made by both women candidates and the Democratic Party in Texas during the 2016 election. Her own 9-point loss to Mr. Trump in the state, she said, was the closest presidential election in the state in two decades.  Her advice to those who still view the landscape as bleak in the wake of the election?\u00a0 \u201cJust turn off the TV.

Anas Modamani\u00a0sued Facebook in Germany\u00a0earlier this year after his 2015 picture with Merkel began showing up in fake news posts falsely linking him to attacks in Brussels and Berlin. Modamani had sought an injunction to keep Facebook users from posting any version of the selfie in fake news stories. He also wanted the social network to delete any such existing posts. A judge on Tuesday found Facebook was \u201cneither perpetrator nor participant in the undisputed slander,\u201d according to a\u00a0CNN report. Because the company hadn\u2019t altered the content, it wasn\u2019t legally responsible for its distribution, leading Judge Volkmar Seipel to find no grounds for an injunction, according to a\u00a0The New York Times report. \u201cWe appreciate that this is a very difficult situation for Mr Modamani,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson said in response to the ruling. \u201cThat is why we quickly disabled access to content that has been accurately reported to us by Mr. Modamani\u2019s legal representatives, and will continue to respond quickly to valid reports of the content at issue from Mr. Modamani\u2019s legal representatives.\u201d \u201cWe are pleased that the Court shares our view that legal action was not merited or the most effective way to resolve the situation,\u201d the company added. Facebook also said it will continue to follow German law relating to content shared on its site. Chan-Jo Jun, Modamani\u2019s lawyer, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. The\u00a0proliferation of fake news, or false information, gained widespread attention in last year\u2019s US presidential election. The term fake news has morphed since then and is sometimes used, including by President Donald Trump, as a label to try to discredit factual stories by the mainstream media. Tech giants like Facebook and Google have\u00a0struggled to stop fake news\u00a0from appearing on their sites. The two companies teamed up in February to launch an\u00a0initiative in Europe called CrossCheck\u00a0aimed at curbing the problem. Anne Dujmovic is an associate editor at CNET News.

            "article_content": "Starbucks (SBUX) is facing calls for a boycott on social media over CEO Howard Schulz\u2019s plan to hire 10,000 refugees over the next five years. Critics argue that he\u2019s helping foreigners at the expense of struggling veterans. The Seattle-based company, though, has done quite a bit to help members of the military over the years, and evidence that veterans are losing out on job opportunities is sketchy at best. The coffee house chain has hired 8,800 of the 10,000 veterans and active duty spouses that it pledged in 2013 that it would hire by 2018. Starbucks has dedicated recruiters who target members of the armed forces in \u201ckey focus cities,\u201d including Washington, D.C., Seattle, and Austin. It has also established more than 200 relationships with military bases in the U.S. and overseas and has attended more than 500 military hiring fairs that attract veterans and military spouses. \u201cWe have the potential to come together as a nation to change how people see and engage with our veterans and military spouses, express gratitude and recognize their service and sacrifice,\u201d according to a statement the company provided to CBS MoneyWatch. Starbucks operates 30 military family stores that are located near bases and which help provide them assistance. Veterans Service Organizations, which offer free legal help and other services, hold meetings at the store on \u201cMilitary Mondays.\u201d The company also has an internal organization for its employees who are vets. In addition, Starbucks backs various groups that help both active-duty members of the military and veterans. Among those groups are the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Hiring Our Heroes Foundation, which helps veterans and service members leaving the military find jobs, and Blue Star Families, which supports military spouses. Critics of Starbucks appear unaware of Starbucks\u2019 track record with veterans.\u00a0 Twitter user @education4liberals and others have questioned why Starbucks should help refugees at a time when 50,000 homeless veterans are on the streets. \u00a0 That number, however, is out of date. Data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates that about 39,500 veterans are homeless on any given night -- still too big of a group. Many homeless vets suffer from mental illness and may not be able to hold a job, according to the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans. Starbucks isn\u2019t the only company feeling this sort of pressure. Since Donald Trump\u2019s election, Kellogg (K) has faced a boycott from the president\u2019s supporters after it pulled its ads from\u00a0Breitbart News, an ultraconservative website that has served as a platform for the white nationalist alt-right movement. \u00a0\u00a0 Trump supporters have also called on consumers to quit doing business with Macy\u2019s (M) because the retailer wouldn\u2019t promise to bring back Mr. Trump\u2019s clothing line; Amazon (AMZN) because CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, which has been critical of Mr. Trump; and Oreos because the cookie-maker has moved production to Mexico. In a strange twist, Mondelez (MDLZ), the parent of Oreos, hasn\u2019t been targeted. On the opposite side, opponents of Mr. Trump have started #GrabYourWallet, which encourages consumers to avoid doing business with companies that have supported Mr. Trump or have business ties to him. It lists more than two dozen such companies such as athletic footwear maker New Balance, LendingTree (TREE) and MillerCoors, whose CEOs have raised funds for Mr. Trump and/or super PACs affiliated with his campaign. Given how divided the U.S. is politically, the number of boycotts from supporters -- and critics -- of Mr. Trump is bound to grow.

            "article_content": "HARTFORD, Conn.\u00a0\u2014 Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, known nationally for seeking stronger gun laws after the Newtown school shooting and for welcoming a Syrian refugee family rebuffed by then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, announced Thursday he won\u2019t seek a third term. The 61-year-old Democrat appeared with his wife, Cathy, and the couple\u2019s eldest son, Dannel, at an unexpected state Capitol news conference. He denied his decision has anything to do with low public approval ratings, saying he and his family have been in politics for years and decided they\u2019re \u201cready for another stage\u201d in their lives. \u201cI\u2019ve run for governor three times,\u201d said Malloy, who won two of those races after serving 14 years as mayor of Stamford. \u201cI just think that\u2019s enough for me personally and for Cathy. We\u2019ve put in our time and I\u2019ve devoted six full years to trying to turn this state around.\u201d Malloy, who is also chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, said he will finish out his second term as governor, which ends in January 2019. A list of Republicans and Democrats interested in the seat has been growing in recent months. Much of Malloy\u2019s tenure has been marked by fiscal struggles, due in large part to Connecticut\u2019s slow recovery from the economic recession of the late 2000s. He\u2019s signed budgets that included the state\u2019s two largest tax increases, large-scale government layoffs and spending cuts to popular programs. Malloy has yet to reach an agreement with the General Assembly on a new budget that will cover a projected $1.7 billion deficit in the fiscal year that begins July 1. The state\u2019s main spending account is typically about $18 billion. Immediately after Malloy\u2019s announcement, the Republican Governors Association said his \u201ctoxic legacy\u201d of \u201cdestructive anti-jobs, high-tax policies,\u201d coupled with his decision not to seek re-election, had created a \u201ctop pick-up opportunity\u201d for the GOP in 2018. Malloy said Thursday he\u2019s proud of his record but understands not everyone recognizes his administration\u2019s accomplishments since he took office in 2011. \u201cThroughout our work, we\u2019ve tried to play the long game for Connecticut, not doing what is politically expedient, but rather what we believe is in the best interests of the people we serve today, and for generations still to come,\u201d he said. Malloy touted his efforts to improve private sector job growth and high school graduation rates, as well as make \u201ccommonsense and compassionate changes\u201d to the state\u2019s criminal justice system, such as giving nonviolent criminals more opportunities to get drug treatment and successfully reintegrate into society. Last year, he was awarded the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage for supporting resettlement of Syrian refugees after the Paris attacks. Malloy personally welcomed to Connecticut a family that had fled Syria in 2011 and planned to resettle in Indiana. The couple and their 5-year-old son were turned away when Pence, now the Republican vice president, ordered state agencies to halt resettlement activities. \u201cWhat I have always stood for is a more inclusive society where people recognize their obligations to one another,\u201d Malloy said, after learning he was last year\u2019s recipient of the award. Malloy previously banned state-funded travel to Indiana because of a religious objections law he said was discriminatory toward gays. He also banned travel to North Carolina in response to a law he and other critics said was discriminatory to members of the LGBT community. Following the Dec. 14, 2012, mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Malloy signed sweeping new restrictions on weapons and ammunition magazines similar to the ones used by the man who fatally shot 20 children and six educators. Malloy later joined former President Barack Obama in pushing for stronger background checks and other measures on the federal level, eventually chastising the U.S. Senate for failing to pass the legislation, saying the \u201cmembers who voted against this proposal should be ashamed of themselves.\u201d",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- The language was intended to stir up hate, using pictures and incendiary language: \"They won't take over our country if we don't let them in.\"  The group behind the messages called itself Secured Borders. But investigators say it was part of a Russian campaign to influence the 2016 election, CBS News' Jeff Pegues reports. To that end, Secured Borders used Facebook's event and initiation tool to promote an anti-immigrant rally in Twin Falls, Idaho, a city it called \"a center of refugee resettlement\" responsible for a \"huge upsurge of violence toward American citizens.\"\u00a0 That was false, and the rally itself never happened, in spite of the Russian campaign. \"They are using these new social media sites, which is kind of a wild, wild West with very few rules, to influence the election,\" said Sen. Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. \"I think what we've seen so far from Facebook is only the tip of the iceberg,\" Warner said. Facebook shut down Secured Borders, but there are other groups, including one that worked out of Texas. CBS News has learned that investigators believe there were many more, and are scrambling to identify them. A source familiar with the investigation suggested that there are likely many more incidents of \"Facebook fronts\" for the Russians urging Americans to take action.\u00a0 Just last week, Facebook\u00a0disclosed that an internal investigation\u00a0identified about 3,000 ads, costing $100,000, containing messages about divisive issues.Those ads also were linked to Russian internet trolls.\u00a0 A Facebook official told CBS News that because of federal laws and the ongoing Russia investigations the company is limited in what it can say publicly. The company says it is still digging into how far and wide Russia's activities were using the social media giant's reach.\u00a0 U.S. intelligence officials believe the Kremlin sought to interfere in the U.S. election, and one tactic of the multi-pronged attack was a wave of misinformation. Warner said the company hasn't been transparent enough and needs to step up its efforts. \"I think there's much more than 350-odd accounts that were involved in this process,\" Warner said, referring to ads linked to Russia that the company acknowledged last week. \"I think it was much more than the simply one internet troll farm they found in St. Petersburg.  And frankly, Facebook, who prides itself on knowing more about you and me than frankly the United States government knows, I got to believe they know more about this or could find more out about it if they put adequate resources behind it.\"  Warner said Facebook was \"slow\" to come out and reveal its findings, and that \"they didn't check on other countries that were close to Russia.\" \"Moldova, for example, there were lots of indications that there were internet trolls working throughout the election out of that country and other countries in Eastern Europe,\" he said. \"I don't believe they've run any of that information.\"  Warner said there are meetings now underway to discuss next steps but indicated a strong likelihood that he wants more from the social media giants.\u00a0 \"We will have Twitter in and then on a staff level, I want Facebook, Twitter and potentially other social media firms,\" he said. \"I think they owe an explanation to all of us on the committee.\" There are growing indications social media company executives will be called to testify in public on Capitol Hill. \u00a0",

He says he didn't foresee a future in politics when he first arrived to Helena, Montana's capital. As he has grown with the community, Collins remembers being \"shocked\" when he first moved into town. Collins won a narrow race Tuesday, defeating a four-term incumbent by just over 300 votes, according to CBS affiliate KXLH-TV. Since then, well, the rest is history. Collins is a child protection specialist with the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services, according to KXLH-TV. The station adds that his wife spent time as an exchange student at Helena High School and that a family that hosted her assisted her in securing a scholarship to Carrol College. \u00a0 Collins told KXLH-TV that he has done dozens of media interviews with such outlets like BBC, Voice of America -- and now CBS News. He told Quijano that his campaign was focused on local issues that seemed to resonate with the community and led to a path to victory. \"I focused on teenage and veterans' homelessness, I was focused on providing funding for the providers of essential services like police and firefighters ... those are the things I was looking at ... those are the things my campaign focused on,\" Collins told CBSN. Collins ran with a self-described progressive slate of candidates and CBSN asked if he sees himself as a capital \"D\" Democrat. \"I see myself as a Progressive,\" Collins said. \"I always tell people I vote the issues. When the issues are close to home, when the issues matter ... I'm there. Right now, I tell people I lean Democrat, but right now I'm on a presently Progressive slate.\" Collins gave a local TED Talk earlier this year about the refugee process addressing and the cultural changes he had to make once arriving to Montana from Liberia. \"Nobody told me how cold it was going to be; nobody told me about the demographics,\" he said. \"I was shocked because I came here [Montana] February -- when we have most of our below-zero weather ... so I struggled. But I had my family with me and that's all that matter. And three years later, I'm still here.\" \"My only focus was getting a second chance and care for my family,\" Collins said. \"The community grows on you. It grew on me and I'm comfortable enough to do what I'm doing.\" Although Collins wouldn't sugarcoat the community's pitfalls -- he mainly called residents \"downright nice.\" \"I'm in a community that's maybe 96 percent Caucasian, but I never made this about race,\" Collins said. He reiterated that the issues in the community were his driving force and he connected with the people. \"The voters heard the issues -- and thought I was the better of the two.\" Collins said he never thought about race and being the first African American mayor until the media made it national headlines. Collins will be officially sworn in in January. To hear more of Wilmot Collins' interview with CBSN's Elaine Quijano, click the video in the player at the top of this page.

            "article_content": "JOHN DICKERSON, CBS HOST: Today on FACE THE NATION: The Republican Senate health care bill is on life support. And the president blames the Obama administration for not stopping Russian interference in the election. When Senate Republican leaders finally removed the veil of secrecy from their health care bill, they were met with stinging criticism from all sides, including their own. Even President Trump, who once promised a beautiful plan that would cover everyone at lower cost, has put away his trademark hyperbole. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I speak from the heart. That's what I want to see. I want to see a bill with heart. Health care is a very complicated subject, from the standpoint that you move it this way, and this group doesn't like it. You move it a little bit over here -- you have a very narrow path. And, honestly, nobody can be totally happy, (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: Republican leaders long ago gave up on total happiness and are just trying not to lose the two votes that wound sink the bill, but opposition appears to be growing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: Hey, Toomey, we are afraid you will take grandma's Medicaid! (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: We will talk to two key Republicans, Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey, who was part of the team that negotiated the bill, and Louisiana doctor-turned-Senator Bill Cassidy. And we will break down a blockbuster \"Washington Post\" report that details top-secret efforts of the Obama administration the head off Russian attacks on our election process. We will talk to a key Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, West Virginia's Joe Manchin. Plus, we will take a closer look at what, if anything, can be done to stop the North Korean nuclear threat, as the president of South Korea prepares to visit the U.S. We will have plenty of political analysis and a final word on taping at the White House. It's all coming up on FACE THE NATION. Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I'm John Dickerson. We're juggling two big stories today, but we begin with the investigation into Russian efforts to influence the outcome of the 2016 election. This week, Homeland Security officials told Congress that the Russians targeted voter databases in 21 states. And CBS News justice correspondent Jeff Pegues has learned that nearly twice showed evidence of a breach. \"The Washington Post\" this week came out with a bombshell investigation into the Obama administration's top-secret efforts to combat Russia attempts to influence the election, reporting that the administration knew as early as last August that Vladimir Putin had ordered the effort specifically to help defeat Hillary Clinton. The Obama team considered a number of responses, including a package of cyber-bomb strikes, that ultimately they did not use and left behind for the Trump administration. Yesterday, President Trump launched several tweets criticizing the Obama administration for inaction. He spoke about it in a FOX News interview. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Well, I just heard today for the first time that Obama knew about Russia a long time before the election, and he did nothing about it. If he had the information, why didn't he do something about it? He should have done something about it. (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: There's a lot to process. So we turn to CBS News senior national security contributor and former number two at the CIA Michael Morell, plus \"Washington Post\" columnist David Ignatius, as well as his colleague Adam Entous, who was on the team that broke \"The Washington Post\" story. Adam, so let's start with you. Lay out this story for us. ADAM ENTOUS, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": Well, the story opens with a dramatic scene, which is the delivery of this intelligence country courier to the White House. It comes with eyes-only instructions to be given to the president and three top advisers at that point. And in the package was intelligence from a high-level source of information that was deemed highly reliable by the CIA describing directly Putin's order to carry out this operation and the goal of trying to help Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton. Once they read that, they were instructed to put it back in the envelope and tell the courier to take it back to Langley. That's just an example of, you know, what was being given to the president at that point. This was a CIA assessment early. This was raw intelligence. And it was not good enough for Obama. He instructed the intelligence community to go out and see if they could validate what the CIA was picking up. DICKERSON: Michael Morell, the validation happened. Give us a sense from your expertise. I know we have talked about this before, but the president has been skeptical about whether this actually ever happened, whether it was the Russians, it could have been the Chinese. Put this latest story into context for us in terms of the intelligence, how solid it was and what really administration officials know. MICHAEL MORELL, CBS NEWS SENIOR SECURITY CONTRIBUTOR: One of the important things, John, about intelligence is that the information doesn't come just at one time, right? It comes in very slowly over time, and so intelligence stories build. I don't know about this particular source, and if I did, I couldn't talk about it. But this seems to have kicked off the process. And then more intelligence comes in over the months. And by the time we get into the fall, there's high-confidence judgments across the intelligence community that Russia's trying to interfere in the election, it's trying to hurt Secretary Clinton, it's trying the to help Donald Trump, and the orders come from the highest levels, Vladimir Putin. So, by early fall, that's what the Obama administration knew. DICKERSON: David Ignatius, put this in context. Is this a huge deal, small deal? How do people process this? There's been a lot of hyperbole in the coverage over the last several months. In terms of the history of American threats and relations... DAVID IGNATIUS, COLUMNIST, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": It's a big deal. It was an assault on our election process. In the history of covert action or even the history more broadly of intelligence operations, you wouldn't put this at the very top. There were three things that struck me about the reporting by Adam and his colleagues at \"The Post.\" First, they revealed that, as of August, we knew, our intelligence agencies knew this was Vladimir Putin orchestrating this. I heard the same thing in Moscow three weeks ago from Russian investigative reporters. This was personal. This was Vladimir Putin himself directing this attack. Second thing that I thought was powerful... DICKERSON: Personal against Hillary Clinton. IGNATIUS: ... was -- because of intense feelings about Clinton, I think, more than anything. Second thing that we see so clearly in this reporting is the Obama's administrations fear that, if they retaliated, if they did something, it would have terrible consequences. I heard that in my own reporting right after the election. They were scared that the Russians would do something. And just finally, this opens the door on a new era of covert action, in which information itself becomes the domain of warfare. And that I think is beautifully captured and should scare everybody. DICKERSON: Michael, grade the Obama administration response. MORELL: Yes, so I thought three things in Adam's piece, too. I saw, OK, what can we, the Obama administration, do to make sure that this interference doesn't get worse? And I give them a pretty high grade on that piece, in terms of the warnings that they gave directly to Moscow, John Brennan to his counterpart, President Obama... DICKERSON: Former CIA director. MORELL: Former CIA director to his counterpart, President Obama to Putin directly, the work that they did with states to lock down the voting systems. I think they get a high grade, because I think they prevented this from being worse than it would have been otherwise. That's first thing. The second thing is the decision not to share fully with the American people what was happening. So, the Obama administration did not tell the American people that Putin was behind this and did not tell the American people what Putin was trying to do, hurt Hillary Clinton, support Donald Trump. That's a big, big decision. You know, the White House, I think, was exactly where David said they were, which is they didn't want to make this worse. But by not entering the playing field, they ceded it to Vladimir Putin. So, I give them a C on that, and I think historians are going to debate this for a long time. The third issue is how to deter the Russians in the future from doing this again, and here I think they failed miserably. I give them an F, because the package they put together, the kicking the diplomats out, intelligence officers out, closing down a couple of compounds, putting limited sanctions on in no way -- it was a slap on the wrist to Vladimir Putin. He sees it that way. It will not deter him in the future. ENTOUS: I think the fear that anything they did was going to be cast as partisan was amplified when Brennan went about meeting with the Gang of Eight, as it's known, when they met... DICKERSON: Congressional leaders. ENTOUS: Right. When they met with the Democrats, they were alarmed by the intelligence. When they met with Paul Ryan, the speaker, he was also alarmed by the intelligence. But when they met with Senator McConnell, he was extremely skeptical. And he raised questions about the intelligence. He thought it was being politicized. And from talking to administration officials who were part of that, that sent the White House, if anything, back to the drawing board. They were afraid that if they moved unilaterally, it would be seen as playing to Trump's public statements as a candidate that this all was rigged in favor of Hillary Clinton. DICKERSON: Finally, David, to you. What now? The president, President Trump, is saying that the Obama administration choked, well, suggesting now he believes it in a way he might not have before. Now it's on his plate. Give us a sense of the retaliation. IGNATIUS: Well, we don't know what options he's considering, but I must say, for Trump to in effect blame this on the Obama administration, it is true, as Adam's reporting documents, that they were slow to act, but one reason was resistance from Republicans. Mitch McConnell and the Gang of Eight, when briefed, did not want to take action and was a strong voice against it when Democrats wanted to do more. The second thing, crucial -- I mean, it may be right, as Michael says, that expelling the 35 Russians, closing down their compounds was insufficient retaliation, but it was something. And Donald Trump, on the day that that happened, said, let's move on to other things. We know that Michael Flynn, on the day that that happened, talked to the Russian ambassador, you know? And there's suspicion they talked about those very sanctions and how, when we can in, we will undo them. The next day Putin said, we're not going to retaliate. And instantly Donald Trump tweeted, this man is as smart as I thought he was. So, and now he's going to blame Obama for not having taken action?  DICKERSON: All right, we are going to have to leave it there. Thanks to all of you gentlemen. We turn now to Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee. And he joins us from Charleston, West Virginia. Senator, you have read \"The Washington Post.\" You have heard this discussion. Give the Obama administration your grade on how they handled this. SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D), WEST VIRGINIA: Well, hindsight being 20/20, I guess we can grade it any way a person sits politically. First of all, John, you have to have confidence that the intelligence community we have, that you trust them and they're accurate and they do their job. And I believe that. I feel very confident that our intelligence community is the best in the world. You have to spend some time with them to understand what they're doing, their job they're doing, and how well they're doing it. So, if you don't have confidence in the intelligence community, if the Gang of Eight, which is a higher level -- a little higher level than what we on Intelligence are getting briefed on, then there's a concern. There's a concern there. I don't have that concern. When they come and tell me something, whether it's the CIA, FBI, NSA, I take it as gospel truth because they're doing their job, and they have cross-checked it before they give it to us. I have never detected one ounce of politicism. I can't tell one side or the other how they're favoring, if they're Democrats, Republicans, or whatever. So I don't know why there's so much skepticism, not believing what the intelligence community is telling you. I do. And I have found it to be extremely beneficial to me to make decisions with. DICKERSON: And do you see the skepticism as you look at the administration? Do you see skepticism simply from the president, or do you see it from other members of the administration in terms of what we know now, not necessarily, as Michael Morell mentioned, the building of a case, but what now seems to be the case, what is now known in total about what the Russians tried to do? MANCHIN: Well, what was known back in August and once it was verified and cross-checked should have been made public. It should have been made public, OK? That wasn't done. I can't second-guess that. But I know that when at that time President Obama and his administration took action, and they took action basically on December the 29th, and closed down two compounds, threw out 35 diplomats, we knew there was a serious problem, and it was verified. So, I just can't understand why we don't go forward and put more sanctions. We have done that. You know we voted 97-2 to enforce more sanctions against Russia, 97-2? I have not seen that happen in any type of scenario in the Senate in a long time. So, we're committed to getting this done. DICKERSON: Is that enough, Senator? MANCHIN: And I think -- you mean the sanctions? DICKERSON: Yes, is that enough in response to this? MANCHIN: We've got to hurt -- John, here's the thing. We have got oligarchs. There are certain people that benefit in the Russian sphere, if you will, the oligarchs, who basically feed Putin. They have got to be hurt without hurting the people. The people are hurting bad enough in Russia, and they're very skeptical of what's going on and all of the corruption that goes on in Russia. Russia is not our ally. Russia is not our friend. And to treat Putin as an ally and a friend is wrong. I don't look at him as a friend. I don't look Russia -- and I'm very skeptical of what they're doing, their intentions. There are a lot of good people in Russia that don't have any say whatsoever, and they're starting to basically express their frustration and start marching and hopefully getting their point across. So, we have got to make sure that we put the hurt on the oligarchs, all the money, the way the money flows through Russia and the people that benefit by it. DICKERSON: All right, Senator Manchin, we're going to take a very quick break. But stay there. When we come back, we want to talk about the Republican health care bill that's scheduled for a vote next week. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he will bring the Senate Republican health care bill to the floor this week, just days after it was unveiled. The bill would end the individual mandate to buy health insurance and would reduce and eventually eliminate federal funding for the Obamacare Medicaid expansion, leaving it up to states to fill in that gap. It allows states to seek waivers, so they can drop services currently required, like maternity care, substance abuse benefits, and mental health treatment. It repeals taxes put in place to pay for Obamacare and also rolls back some tax credits currently given to help individuals buy insurance. Republicans need 51 votes to pass the bill, or 50, if Vice President Mike Pence casts the tie-breaking vote. But five GOP senators say they can't vote for the bill in its current form, which is more than enough to kill it. Kentucky's Rand Paul summed up one side of the GOP opposition. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY: I just didn't run on Obamacare- lite. (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: While Nevada's Dean Heller voiced another. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. DEAN HELLER (R), NEVADA: I cannot support a piece of legislation that takes insurance away from tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of thousands of vets. (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: That means Leader McConnell is going to have to find a way the change the bill to attract more votes from conservative members without losing too many moderates. Senator Manchin, I want to get you response just first to the bill and whether you think there's anything you can do to improve it. MANCHIN: Oh, John, there is an awful lot that can be done to improve it. And we have identified -- let's sit down, but we can't even get in the room. You know, if Mitch would just expand to a bipartisan working group to repair it and quit talking about repealing it, we have a pathway forward. I think we could fix it. There are some good people on both sides of the aisle that know it needs to be fixed. There is not one person in West Virginia that's not been touched by the bill that was sent by the House, which was horrible, and the bill they have now, which makes it even worse. So, I have said, work with me. Don't work against us. They have proven that they are going to need Democrats to pass this. And if Mitch doesn't have the votes, call off this bill right now and let's sit down and start working toward repairing the basic concept of what we have in the Affordable Care Act. We're willing to do that, John. DICKERSON: Let me ask you, specifically, Senator, though, on this bill, on the theory that perhaps Senator McConnell is not likely to call the whole thing off, what in it do you think needs improvement and is there any chance that it could be improved? MANCHIN: Well, sure. First of all, the private market, John. You can't force people to buy a product and then, if you don't buy it, you fine them. And I knew that was a mistake from the get-go. I wasn't there in 2010 when they passed it. They did go through an orderly process. Everybody had input. And at the end of the day, not one Republican voted for it. There should have been a way for us to sit down and say major pieces of policy such as this -- and that's the reason the proper -- for the purpose of the Senate having 60 votes for cloture, is to get bipartisan buy-in. Now they're going to get rid of it with not one Democrat. And, John, if they don't have me sitting down, someone is who is in the middle, who wants to work with them to get good policy, they are in serious problems. The private sector needs to be fixed. The policy and the market need to match up. John, we -- they expanded 20... (CROSSTALK) MANCHIN: Go ahead. I'm sorry. DICKERSON: Has the White House reached out to you at all in this process or Senator McConnell? MANCHIN: No, not yet. No. Some of my colleagues have. Susan Collins and I have been speaking about it. Bill Cassidy and I have spoken about it. And I told him, I said, if you take repeal off the table, sit down and talk about repair and fixing what we have and how to make it better, I'm with you, and I said we will get more Democrats that will sit down. And Chuck Schumer says, if we can get a repair organization or repair group sitting down, that's fine. So we're not getting -- we're not hindered from our side whatsoever. But this is about our country, and it's about you have to have a policy to get your people healthier, gets them in a productive work force, if you will. And we are going to do that by intervening. We have given 20 million people health care without one word of instructions. The people in West Virginia, the only health care they had before, the 175,000, John, was they had to go to the emergency room. Well, if you gave them now a health care card, and they're still practicing the same procedures they did before, they're using it at the highest cost. Can we help them be more and better as far as in tune to how to use it, better educated on how to use it? DICKERSON: All right. MANCHIN: I'm sure there's energies, but not just throwing them off. Why does it have to be so mean-spirited? Why can't there be some compassion, saying, listen, here's how you can keep it, here's how you're going to use your health care, it's going to make you a better person, it's going to give you opportunities? That's what we should be doing. DICKERSON: All right. OK, Senator, we're going to have to leave it. And we will be back with two Senate Republicans to get their thoughts about the bill. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: We're joined now by Republican Senator Pat Toomey, who is in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and Louisiana's Bill Cassidy, who is in New York this morning. Senator Toomey, I want to start with you. There seem to be two criticisms of the bill. We just heard Senator Manchin on the Democratic side. But on the Republican side, there are two criticisms, that too much Obamacare is left in place, and then criticisms from, say, Senator Heller, which is that these Medicaid cuts are too big. How do that -- how do those get solved? SEN. PAT TOOMEY (R), PENNSYLVANIA: Yes, listen, it's going to be a challenge, but I have to strongly disagree with the characterization that we're somehow ending the Medicaid expansion. In fact, quite the contrary. The Senate bill will codify and make permanent the Medicaid expansion. And, in fact, we will have the federal government pay the lion's share of the cost. Remember, Obamacare created a new category of eligibility. Working-age, able- bodied adults with no dependents for the first time became eligible for Medicaid if their income was below 138 percent of the poverty level. We are going to continue that eligibility. No one loses coverage. What we are going to do, gradually over seven years is transition from the 90 percent federal share that Obamacare created and transition that to where the federal government is still paying a majority, but the states are kicking in their fair share, an amount equivalent to what they pay for all the other categories of eligibility. As far as some of my conservative friends who are concerned that the bill doesn't go far enough, I'm sympathetic about the kinds of reforms they would like the make to lower premiums through more market forces and greater freedom on the part of consumers, but I see this bill as a first step, a first important step in the direction of repealing those portions of Obamacare that we can, stabilizing the individual market, which is collapsing, and making important reforms to Medicaid. It's not the last step. DICKERSON: Let me ask, Senator Cassidy, you served in a hospital with a lot of low-income folks when you were practicing as a doctor. Picking up on what Senator Toomey said, the worry is, on Medicaid, is that, as the amount of money shrinks, states just won't be able to cover all the people that need to be covered. What's your sense of that, and is that something that can be solved? SEN. BILL CASSIDY (R), LOUISIANA: People will move off of the Medicaid expansion on to the private health insurance market. And that can be a good thing. It isn't so much whether we are spending lots of money on Medicaid. It's whether or not people are covered. Now, I have concerns about the bill, but let's acknowledge that as folks would move off Medicaid, they would go on private insurance, coverage would continue, and in some cases that actually gives the patient more options for doctors that they can see than does Medicaid. So I think coverage could continue. DICKERSON: Will you support this bill, Senator? CASSIDY: Right now, I am undecided. There are things in this bill which adversely affect my state that are peculiar to my state, a couple of things I'm concerned about. But if those can be addressed, I will. And if they can't be addressed, I won't. So, right now, I'm undecided. DICKERSON: Senator Toomey, on this question of people moving off of Medicaid into the private market, the concern from critics is that moving them off into the private market puts them in a market where they will be unable, because the subsidies are going away or are lowered in this bill, or the tax credits are shrunk in this bill, and because the people basically will be into a private market where they can't afford, either if the premiums are low, the deductibles will be too high, or both, premiums high and deductibles high. TOOMEY: Yes, John, obviously, we have thought about that. And this bill provides very generous tax credits, considerably more generous than the House. They're more oriented toward lower- income people, and those are the people who obviously need it. And I would also point out, I think it's important to note, the federal government spending on Medicaid is going to grow every year. It's never going to be cut. It's never going to shrink. It will eventually be growing at a slightly slower rate. And we need that in order to make the program viable and to deal with these massive deficits and the mounting debt that we have. DICKERSON: All right, Senator Toomey and Senator Cassidy, we're going to be right back in a moment. We have got a hard break here, so we will take that break, and we will be back with more on health care in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: And we will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: And welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We're back with more from Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey and Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy. Senator Cassidy, I want the start with you. In reporting on this and talking to Republicans, two things they really like in this bill are that it changes the Medicaid entitlement, something Republicans have been trying to do for a while to shrink costs, and it -- it repeals a lot of the tax increases that are a part of the -- of Obamacare. How do those two big items make people healthier? CASSIDY: First, Medicaid in its current form is not sustainable. If you look at even under the Affordable Care Act, the state's portion of the Medicaid expansion cannot be sustained. In my state, it will be -- it will be $310 million a year. In California, $2.2 billion a year just for the state's portion. Now, I worked in a public hospital for the uninsured and saw many Medicaid. Why was I seeing Medicaid at a hospital for the uninsured? Because states could not afford their match, paid doctors so poorly that patients could not go see a private physician. If we can put Medicaid on a sustainable path, where the state is receiving a certain amount of money and can budget for that, and then the state, in turn, gives it to managed care organizations, federal, state managed care, the patient will have certainty as to their access. I actually think that's better for patients. I think they can improve outcomes. And it's certainly better for the state and the federal taxpayer. DICKERSON: Senator Toomey, you mentioned that there won't be cuts. It would just be the rate of growth that will be slowing on the specific question of Medicaid. But Governor John Kasich knows about budgeting. He was a former budget chairman of the House. So he knows about the difference between cuts and slowing the rate of growth, and he has said that -- that in talking about this plan, that he worries that it cuts resources needed to help our most vulnerable. That's a Republican governor. Another Republican governor, Brian Sandoval, says, \"these are our friends, these are our families, and these are our neighbors\" who he worries will get hurt as the rate of growth slows because they just don't think that that will be able to cover future Medicaid participants. So they know the issues here. Why are they wrong? TOOMEY: Well, Senator Kasich was very much in favor of this very approach when he was the chairman of the Budget Committee in the House. Look, I get that governors like having a lot of federal money come in and -- and -- and spent when they don't have to even raise it. But the reality is, this is going to grow. This is going to grow for the permanent future. We're going to fund the lion's share of even this new population within Medicaid that most Republicans didn't support in the first place. But, you know, there's another fundamental aspect to this. What we're trying to do is free the states and free the marketplace to discover ever better ways to deliver services. There's wonderful innovation that's happening all across the country. In Pennsylvania, whether it's Independence or Geisinger, you know, an insurer and a health care provider, they are finding great, new ways to deliver ever better care at lower costs. But there are constraints on the ability of insurance companies and providers to do that. We want to diminish those constraints so that we can continue, though a creative process, discover better ways to do this. And this legislation at least takes us in that direction. DICKERSON: Senator Cassidy, 20 seconds. The majority leader wants this done by July 4th. Why the rush? CASSIDY: I don't know quite why the rush. I, frankly, would like more days to consider this. There will probably be a discussion coming back. I think a few more days to consider would be helpful. DICKERSON: All right, senators, we're very grateful. Thank you both for being here. And we turn now to our politics panel. Amy Walter is the national editor of \"The Cook Political Report,\" Michael Duffy is deputy managing editor of \"Time\" magazine, Ben Domenech is the publisher of \"The Federalist,\" and Ed O'Keefe is a CBS News contributor and covers Congress for \"The Washington Post.\" Let's start with health care. We'll talk also about other news in the week. But, Ben, what's going to happen? Is this bill going to live in its current form -- or passes in its current form, I should say? BEN DOMENECH, \"THE FEDERALIST\": It's important to understand that this is not \"the bill.\" This is \"a bill.\" This is to get to the point where you have \"the bill.\" Getting to that conference is something that I think ultimately will be supported by a number of the senators who have come out with questions early on. This is, frankly, an insult to kabuki (ph). They could do a better job of this. I'm -- this is a group of senators who really will be there at the end of the day. There are a couple of -- DICKERSON: Meaning the critics? DOMENECH: Meaning the critics. DICKERSON: Right. So they're saying they're against it to get leverage room. DOMENECH: They -- they want to have a few things done. They want to have a few changes. It's important, though, I think, to step back and look at the picture of Obamacare here after it's been in existence for quite a while. The truth is that Obamacare failed to do what President Obama wanted it to do when it came to this middle portion of the private insurance market. It really did not lead to the kind of competitive exchanges that he wanted to see. What did succeed and what you've been talking about with these senators this morning is the Medicaid expansion. It added millions more people than the CBO estimated, to a program that, frankly, was already strained in a number of different states. And fixing that fiscal problem is the key question when it comes to all of these issues. You know, you mentioned Governor Kasich. When Governor Kasich, you know, pushed for the Medicaid expansion in Ohio, he ended up having to throw 34,000 disabled people off of the program because it incentivized adding these working, able-bodied adults over people who actually were in the system who had disabilities or had other dependence. So getting that fix right is the key -- is the key argument internally I think. And I expect the Republican bill will end up being even more generous than it currently is right now. DICKERSON: Ed, what's your sense of it on The Hill (ph)? ED O'KEEFE, CBS NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think the fact that you see Doctor Senator Cassidy and others this morning saying, let's not necessarily do it this week, don't be surprised then if maybe McConnell is convinced to wait one more week, allow things to -- to percolate a little more, because trying to get it done by Saturday morning at this point, that would be a really ugly rush job. But -- but Ben is correct, and I think people need to remember this, this -- this bill, more than any other this year, has gone through more verses of the School House Rock song on how bills become law than others. They skipped the committee verses. But the fact that this thing is still in play, still being negotiated and, if passed, will go into a broader negotiation with the House is important. And this is by no means over. You're going to see this week all sorts of proposals to -- to tweak this, either to favor people like those that are holding out, Ted Cruz and Mike Lee, but also potentially some changes, including restoring the funding for Planned Parenthood, which would spark a pretty uncomfortable vote potentially on the floor of the Senate. DICKERSON: Amy, the longer this is alive, though, the theory goes, the longer it's out in the public -- AMY WALTER, \"THE COOK POLITICAL REPORT\": That's right. DICKERSON: The more potentially politically problematic it becomes. WALTER: And it already has been. I mean I think there's another piece of this, which is there's the policy piece. There's the whether it's going to pass piece. And then there is the, how do Republicans actually sell this out on the campaign trail, and, of course, to their constituents. And what we've seen in this time where it's been in this legislative purgatory between when the House passed it until now, support for this bill has actually gone down, even among Republicans. Democrats know quite well what happens when the other side defines your bill and you don't. In 2010, there were 420,000 ads run during the to 2010 campaign that mentioned Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act, 380,000 of those ads were negative. And Democrats have now spent the last five years trying to make the -- actually, I think, not -- they haven't effectively made the case for Obamacare, as well as they're doing it right now as a defense of it rather than a promotion of it. So can Republicans promote this bill I think is going to be very important once they actually pass it. Democrats didn't do a particularly good job of it. Will Republicans do a better job? DICKERSON: And, Michael, what -- give me your thoughts. But, also, what role does the present play. Does he come on stage? Does he stay off? Or does he just work the phones? MICHAEL DUFFY, \"TIME\" MAGAZINE: I think most people in -- on The Hill would prefer he stay off at the moment. I think -- and another thing to point out about what happens next is, Ben talked about it, kabuki, to give people cover for bargaining for more time or more money or whatever it is they want. But the kabuki mostly serves the two great big pieces of Russia -- I'm sorry, Russia -- Republican orthodoxy at the center of this measure, which is massive $1 trillion tax cut, mostly on high-wealth individuals other the next the ten years, that happens pretty quickly, and the second is this -- for the first time really in 23 years, a reduction in a federal entitlement program. That (INAUDIBLE) -- it was only put into place in 2010 with ACA, but this is going to reduce the number of people who get essentially federal payments by 10, 20, we're not sure, some number of -- tens of millions of people. That hasn't happened by a Congress since welfare reform. Normally, and normally that's political suicide, but I don't think any of us would think that we live in normal, political times. DICKERSON: All right, Ben, you know, Senator Toomey said, well, it's going to slow the rate of growth, but there are no cuts. But the Congressional Budget Office has said that of the 23 million who will lose cover, that 14 or so will come to Medicaid. They will give another score this week, which will undoubtedly put a number on people losing coverage. So, how -- who -- who wins in that debate, somebody who's saying -- suggesting, essentially, this is going to be as it is, and then CBO who's saying all these people are going the loose coverage? DOMENECH: You know, one of the things that I have been skeptical about as it comes to this approach is just -- is not an ideological bit of skepticism, but just a practical one. This is a -- this is a massive undertaking. You know, reforming something that affects the lives of so many different millions of -- of Americans in a very direct way can all -- can always have unexpected consequences. President Obama certainly saw that with -- with his bill and HHS had to work very hard under Kathleen Sebelius to try to mitigate a lot of those different changes that happened. I think you're going to see the same thing happen here. This is a dog's breakfast of the bill. There are all sorts of different things thrown in there that senators have problems with, have issues with. But again, they want to get to the point of actually being able to send this to the president's desk. I have -- I've never, you know, said that you should underestimate Mitch McConnell's ability to get something like that done. And I think, frankly, he's going to plow through a lot of these different concern, add -- add various aspects to the bill to try to satisfy individual senators and get there eventually. DICKERSON: And, Ed, it seems like promise kept is the biggest selling point for this. O'KEEFE: Yes. WALTER: Yes. O'KEEFE: Yes. DICKERSON: How does that work over time though? O'KEEFE: Well -- DICKERSON: That's great and that's all that matters? O'KEEFE: That's -- that's the test that Amy's talking about. You can keep the promise, but then how -- how -- how good are you going to be next year at selling this and promoting it and defending it? And I think we don't know. But I -- I agree with Ben that -- that I think the big test right now is, Mitch McConnell really has never had to steer -- I've said this before -- has never had to steer a significant piece of legislation like this through the Senate in these times of, you know, social media pressure and -- and the polarization of -- of politics. If he can get this through, it bodes well, I think, for his tax reform debate that he really want to have, but he's got a lot of other tricky things coming this fall. He's got to do a budget. H's got to reauthorize a bunch of other federal programs. If this goes south, it's going to be very difficult for him, I think, to hold together his Republicans, especially when the president is still as unpopular as he is and as some of the these Democratic attacks are working. The other thing -- and I had some Senate Republican folks point this out, and I think it's -- it's a fair point. What they're doing is a later, more diet version of what the House did. What's being polled right now is the House bill. DICKERSON: Right. O'KEEFE: We haven't seen a poll yet on the changes that are made here and we may not see that for another few weeks to get a real sense of the changes. So they point out, we haven't even really started to explain what's in our bill yet, since it only just came out, and I suspect the numbers may change, especially among Republicans, as this negotiation continues. DICKERSON: Amy, you want the jump in there? WALTER: Go ahead. Yes, go ahead. DICKERSON: Let's talk quickly about the race in the sixth district of Georgia. WALTER: Yes. DICKERSON: Because what we're talking about here is how this played out politically. WALTER: Yes. DICKERSON: Everybody was watching that race to see if it was a harbinger of 2018. Give us your takeaway, now that it has happened, the Democrat loss, the Republican won. What does it mean? WALTER: Right. What does it all mean? One race 18 months out from an election. Of course it's going to tell us everything that we need to know. There's a little something for each party to like and to be scared about. For Republicans, they won in the district. The Republican candidate won in a district that Donald Trump barely carried. That's good news for them because there are only 23 seats right now that Republicans hold that Donald Trump did not win. Guess what, they have a 24-seat majority. If they lose all of those, they still have a one-seat majority. The bad news is, when you look at not just Georgia six but all the other special election that have taken place, all in very Republican districts, Democrats have been outperforming their generic performance by about seven points. If they did that, if Democrats outperformed what they normally get, they would win 80 seats. All right. So there's somewhere that this is going to meet in the middle. And this is where the issue, like health care, is going to play. We don't know how that issue is going to play out. It didn't really play here. Once there is a bill -- or, quite frankly, even if there's not, Republicans control Washington. Obamacare is an issue. They either fix it or they don't, but it's now theirs and they own it. DICKERSON: Michael, it seemed there was a -- a moment where people were asking about Nancy Pelosi and was she the leader that the Democrats want. And -- and the people said the knives are out for Nancy Pelosi. But it ended -- it seems like it was the butter knives were out for Nancy Pelosi. She's not going anywhere. DUFFY: No, she's probably -- she would probably say they are -- they were butter knives, too. The most important thing I think about this race is that something like $50 million at least was spent on a House race. WALTER: Yes. O'KEEFE: Yes. DUFFY: That's a record by half. Again, I think the nearest one was 20, 24. WALTER: Yes. DUFFY: So this is $200 per vote, which is really quite an astonishing number given what we've -- WALTER: And won't happen -- and -- DUFFY: Even in our -- even in our campaign finance system, it can't be sustained. But I -- I think the other things that were happening is that the -- the Republican interest groups unified around the idea of hanging Nancy Pelosi around Jon Ossoff's neck like rarely has she been hung before. They called him, as they have for 25-years, a San Francisco-style liberal. And they worked together on -- in ways they typically don't, which suggests Republicans are a little more cohesive as well. And I'd say one other -- O'KEEFE: Because that's all they have. DUFFY: That -- well, that's right. One other thing that's worth noting. Even in the case of the little things I saw, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce got local chambers of commerce in the district to work with their members and get their employees to get active in the calls (ph). So there's a level of grassroots involvement in this race that's unbelievable (ph). DOMENECH: But there are -- but there are two key things about this race that we need to keep in mind. First, this race was truly nationalized in a way that I think negatively affected the Democrats and -- WALTER: Yes. DOMENECH: The amount of money that was flowing in from California, the national attention that it received actually worked against them in this race. You saw how close the race was in South Carolina, which had none of that national attention, but where the Democrat significantly over performed. Secondly, you had the shooting in Alexandria by a -- a, you know, frankly radical leftist who had been very public about that fact on his social media, including talking about this race, and talking about beating the Republican in that race. While that didn't receive a lot of national attention, it got significant attention on local news programs in Georgia six. And you saw the polls on -- you know, in the days running up to that election go from two or three points down for the Republican, to two or three points ahead. We should not underestimate the fact that that shooting had a significant impact. And, frankly, John, this week, we saw in -- in Washington, we talk a lot on this program about the degradation of faith and institutions, and you saw the FBI come out with this report that said that effectively this shooter was just someone who had anger management issues, that this was some random effect for someone who sat out in a van across from this non-descript baseball park in Alexandria and clearly had the intent of doing what he did. That had an extraordinarily negative effect for Democrats this round (ph). DICKERSON: Last (INAUDIBLE). O'KEEFE: Real quick. Spent most of the week outside of Washington talking to these Democrats who are starting to run, and they made very clear, stop talking about Russia, they said to party leaders. Nobody out here cares. Talk to us about the economy, about how you defend or preserve Obamacare. Let's see whether party leaders actually pay attention to that. DICKERSON: Excellent. Thanks to all of you. That's where we're going to end for now. We'll be right back with a look at whether North Korea can be stopped. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: We're back with Mark Bowden, the author of \"Blackhawk Down.\" His latest book is \"Hue 1968, A Turning Point of the American War in Vietnam.\" But today he's here to talk about this month's cover story in \"The Atlantic,\" \"Can North Korea Be Stopped.\" Mark, let's -- let's just start with that answer. MARK BOWDEN, \"THE ATLANTIC\": I don't think so, John. You know, our best hope is that China will apply significant pressure to get them to back away from this nuclear program. But nothing that the United States has done over the past 30 or 40 years has slowed their progress. And if you look at the actual military options that we have there, they're, you know, none of them are things that we would want to do. DICKERSON: You know, you've -- you've written about Vietnam. You know about the kind of public consensus that forms around ideas and they kind of create a momentum of themselves. And as you write in the piece, there is this consensus in both the left and the right that North Korea cannot have a nuclear weapon. BOWDEN: Right. DICKERSON: Why? BOWDEN: Because, you know, they have been a serious threat to obviously South Korea and to the region for many years now, particularly over the last ten years. And I think for the United States, the threshold has always been building a missile that could potentially reach the United States mainland. And they are probably, most estimates are, three, four years away from doing that. And that means that, you know, they couldn't just wreak havoc in their region, they could actually threaten the United States. DICKERSON: This week the South Korea president is going to be coming to visit with -- with President Trump. What -- he -- he -- he has said that Kim Jong-un is not a rational person. He told that to our -- our colleague Norah O'Donnell, but that he's willing to sit down with him. So how do you think that gets worked out? BOWDEN: Well, I don't think that Kim Jong-un is an irrational person. I think he is precisely the person you would expect him to be, a product of that regime and that family, you know, to become the supreme leader of North Korea. You couldn't design someone who fits the mold more perfectly. So, I mean, I don't believe that short of giving him something he really wants, that the negotiations are going to get him to back away from nuclear weapon. They're to central to their whole philosophy of being. DICKERSON: And you -- you mention -- or you write in the piece this notion that -- and this gets back again to the, why would it be dangerous to have North Korea with a nuclear missile, is that there's a sense of -- of destiny, of -- of almost universal -- their future is wrapped up with being a power that fights against a big western aggression. BOWDEN: Sure. I mean the -- their sort of guiding theory for years has been that the United States is going to launch a huge invasion of North Korea, and the buildup of their military and the nuclear program and the missile program is all designed to make it too costly for the United States to take that step. And that's why, you know, none of these military options would be desirable because they lack -- they have the capability right now of killing millions of people with one or -- one or two weapons. DICKERSON: And give us a sense of the -- what the U.S. military options are, and are they live possibilities? BOWDEN: Well, we certainly hear them talked about a lot. You know, one is to just go in all out, take out the regime, destroy the North Korean government and, you know, eliminate the threat. Another would be to ratchet up pressure, turning the screws, I call it, which is the target their nuclear reactors, their test sites, and -- and ramp up the pressure to get them to back down. A third option is to take out Kim Jong-un and the people around him, which would be virtually impossible, but, you know, theoretically, and -- and you wouldn't know what you'd get when you were finish. And -- and the final option, which is another bad one, is to just accept the fact that they're going to succeed in doing this and we're going to have to live with it. DICKERSON: One of the things that came across in the article was that if the U.S. did try any of these, other than just living with it, I mean basically North Korea's been preparing for an assault from the west since 1953. BOWDEN: Right. DICKERSON: I mean they're ready to retaliate. BOWDEN: Yes, the Korean War never ended as far as they're concerned. DICKERSON: Right. And -- and then you also made a good point about what -- what, in the aftermath, not just the succession, but the clean-up. BOWDEN: Yes. DICKERSON: Who's in charge of -- BOWDEN: I mean even if it were possible to somehow take out the threat without him getting a single nuke ore chemical or biological weapon out, without him killing millions of people, so we're successful, what have we got now? We've got a destroyed North Korean infrastructure, no government, millions of refugees pouring over the Chinese border, the South Korean border. Essentially, the United States would have to move in and govern North Korea for a generation at least. And I don't think we've been too successful at that. DICKERSON: All right, Mark, thank you for laying out these incredibly complex issues for us. BOWDEN: You're welcome. DICKERSON: And we appreciate you being here. We'll be right back. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: This week President Trump said that there was no White House taping system. It ended a mystery he had created. Former FBI Director James Comey described an Oval Office encounter where the president encouraged him to wrap up his investigation into Michael Flynn. The president said it didn't happen and warned the tapes might contradict Comey. Well, there are no tapes, and in making this announcement this week, the president was celebrating an anniversary. Forty-four years ago, on June 23rd, Richard Nixon recorded what would become known as the smoking gun tape, where he told his staff to have the CIA tell the FBI to stop investigating the Watergate break-in. It sealed Nixon's fate. Why would President Trump encourage Nixon obstruction of justice comparisons by talking about tapes? On \"Fox and Friends\" Friday, the president offered insight into his gambit. He was trying to keep James Comey honest. As a private citizen, Donald Trump also reportedly hinted at having made recordings and maybe sometimes did as a way to keep people honest. The press and the president are in agreement on this, a recording keeps people honest. That's why it was a mistake for the White House this week to further limit televised or audio recordings of press briefings. A sketch artist rendering of the audio and video-free briefing makes it look like a courtroom. But it's not a court. The briefing is a place where an administration explains in real time what it is doing on behalf of the people who pay their salaries. There may not be a taping system in the Oval Office, but there is one in the press room, no installation required. The cameras are there and they are on. It's designed to keep people honest. Back in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: That's it for us today. Thanks for watching. You can keep up with the news of the week to subscribing to the FACE THE NATION Diary Podcast.

            "article_content": "When news broke that President Trump had chatted with Russia President Vladimir Putin in a previously undisclosed meeting for an hour at the G-20 summit in Germany, it was another reminder that much of the information about the president's whereabouts and policymaking comes from sources outside the White House.  The scant details of the unusual meeting between the leaders of two traditionally adversarial nations were reported by Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group. He talked about the Trump-Putin t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate during an appearance on \"The Charlie Rose Show.\" The meeting had not been mentioned by the White House press office, senior administration officials, or Mr. Trump himself.  The White House said it wasn't trying to keep the meeting under wraps, though, and later released a background statement saying the \"insinuation that the White House has tried to 'hide' a second meeting is false, malicious, and absurd.\" Since Mr. Trump took office in January, White House reporters -- and by extension the American public -- have on more than this occasion received more detailed information about the president's conversations and whereabouts from foreign governments rather than from official channels in Washington. This is something at least one former White House official finds troubling.  \"These conversations do not belong to President Trump, they belong the country,\" one former Obama administration official told CBS News. \"He's there as an elected representative and these conversations should be part of the historical record.\" Here are a few examples of how the White House has allowed other governments to fill in the blanks about Mr. Trump's conversations with foreign leaders. At the recent G-20 summit, American reporters first learned details of the first encounter between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin through the Russian News Agency TASS, which is owned by the Russian government, when Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov announced to reporters that the two presidents had shaken hands and \"would soon hold a separate meeting.\" After that two-hour meeting, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin provided reports with an off-camera, audio-only press briefing in which Tillerson told reporters that on the issue of Russian interference in the 2016 election, the two \"agreed to exchange further work regarding commitments of non-interference in the affairs of the U.S. and our Democratic process as well as those of other countries.\" In contrast, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who also attended the meeting, strolled out to hold a live, on-camera press conference, where he announced that Mr. Trump had accepted Putin's assurances that Russia did not meddle in the 2016 election. The next day, White House reporters noticed a slate on a live TV feed of the G-20 summit that indicated Mr. Trump was scheduled to hold a press conference in the afternoon prior to departing Hamburg for the U.S. An hour later, after much confusion among the White House press corps, which was somewhat absurdly attempting to track down the president's schedule, U.S. reporters were notified that the president would not be holding a press conference. Mr. Trump may have avoided the cameras, but Putin welcomed them. When he held a press conference later in the day, Putin told reporters that it was his opinion that Mr. Trump was satisfied with his denial of the alleged election interference. The U.S. intelligence community released a report in January concluding that Putin meddled in the elections.  \"He asked a lot of questions on this subject, I was able to answer -- answered all of these questions,\" Putin said of Trump. \"I think he took this into consideration and agreed. But, in fact, how he reacted to this -- ask him.\" Putin also told reporters that it seemed to him, based on his meeting with Trump and their agreement to establish de-escalation zones in Syria, that the U.S. had \"become more pragmatic.\"  The bewildering information flow at the G-20 was not a new phenomenon for White House reporters. Earlier in May, the Trump administration welcomed Lavrov to the White House. He visited Mr. Trump at the White House after a meeting with Tillerson. The meeting was closed to the White House press pool. But shortly thereafter the meeting, handout photos emerged, showing Mr. Trump smiling and apparently joking around in the Oval Office with Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak \u2013 a man at the center of the investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's ties with Russia. The photos were distributed not by the White House, but by Russia's foreign ministry and its embassy. The Washington Post reported that a photographer for TASS had been allowed into the Oval Office, something U.S. intelligence officials viewed as a potential security breach. It also came to light that Mr. Trump revealed classified intelligence provided by Israeli to the Russians.  Readouts of President Trump's conversations released by the White House press office have repeatedly skimped on policy details, especially in comparison to readouts from other governments. On June 20th, there was one notable word missing from the White House's release of Mr. Trump's call with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko: Russia. \"President Donald J. Trump met today with President Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine to discuss support for peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine and President Poroshenko's reform agenda and anti-corruption efforts,\" the one sentence statement released by Press Secretary Sean Spicer's office read. But Ukraine had more details to divulge. \"The validity of the U.S. sanctions against Russia will be prolonged,\" read the specific and lengthy readout of the conversation provided by Poroshenko's office. Earlier in the year, in April, the White House detailed Trump's calls with United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. The press office did note that the leaders \"agreed with President Trump on the importance of holding Syrian President Bashar al-Assad accountable.\" But again, the statement omitted a point of discussion that Merkel and May's office both revealed: Russia's role in Syria. \"The Prime Minister and the President agreed that a window of opportunity now exists in which to persuade Russia that its alliance with Assad is no longer in its strategic interest,\" May's office wrote. In February, Mr. Trump spoke with Argentine President Mauricio Macri for the first time over the phone. Mr. Macri's office distributed a fairly lengthy readout of their call later that afternoon which stated that during the five minute long call, Mr. Trump had \"reiterated his invitation to meet later this year in Washington,\" and that the two discussed Venezuela and the region. \"The dialogue between the two was very cordial and showed the agreement between the two,\" the statement, translated from Spanish, read. A full day later, the White House released a vague three sentence statement with little detail. Also in February, reporters learned of the details of a call between President Trump and Nigerian President Muhammado Buhari from his spokesperson's tweets. \"Pres. Trump assured @NGRPresident of the US readiness to cut a new deal in helping Nigeria in terms of military weapons to combat terrorism,\" one of the tweets stated. That was likely referring to a $592 million dollar arms deal that had been in the works with Nigeria until the Obama administration put on hold on it, after the Nigerial military unintentionally bombed a refugee camp. The Trump White House did not provide a readout of the call. Sometimes, the White House has not provided any guidance for Mr. Trump's meeting with another world leader at all. May 11, the Russian Embassy's press secretary flagged pictures of Mr. Trump meeting with the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin in the Oval office, tweeting that \"the MSM will never find & show. Courtesy leaked by Ukrainian colleagues. Everybody furious.\" The pictures of Mr. Trump with Mr. Klimkin were posted by the Ukrainian Foreign ministry. Contrary to the Russian spin that the media had deliberately ignored the meeting, it was not on the President's White House schedule, nor was press invited to cover it. In April, Mr. Trump met with two former presidents of Colombia at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, which was only revealed by a McClatchy report. The secret meeting came a month before current Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos was to visit the White House. The meeting was not disclosed by the White House to reporters nor was it on the president's schedule however former President Andres Pastrana thanked Mr. Trump for a \"cordial and very frank conversation\" about issues in the region on Twitter. \u00a0Sarah Huckabee Sanders later dismissed the encounter as a \"quick hello.\" Foreign governments have not shied away from pushing back on the White House for peddling unverified statements that have in some cases started diplomatic rows. Just last week, after a press briefing about Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with Russians at Trump tower, Sanders said the DNC colluded with the Ukrainian Government to help Hillary Clinton and leak damaging information on one of Trump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort. The Embassy of Ukraine disagreed, saying in a statement that Sanders was \"misinformed.\" \"While some politicians who are not part of the Ukrainian government might have taken sides during last year's elections in the U.S., the government of Ukraine did not,\" the Embassy wrote. But Spicer and other Trump surrogates have continued to repeat the claim, undercutting the administration's support to Ukraine in recent months. \"We would like to reiterate that the Embassy of Ukraine has neither coordinated with the DNC on opposition research nor taken any actions to undermine campaign efforts,\" a second statement from the Embassy read. And in March, Spicer suggested that then-President Obama had wiretapped then-candidate Trump through the GCHQ, Britain's intelligence agency \u2013 a claim first made by a Fox News commentator. In a break from normal practice, GCHQ released a public statement calling the allegations \"nonsense\" and \"utterly ridiculous.\" Prime Minister May's spokesperson said that she \"received assurances that these allegations won't be repeated and this shows the administration doesn't give the allegations any credence.\" Publicly, Spicer maintained that he was \"merely reading a story that's in a paper\" and was not vouching for the story.

            "article_content": "KOBLENZ, Germany -- European nationalist leaders came together Saturday in a show of strength at the start of a year of big election tests, celebrating Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration as U.S. president and declaring themselves a realistic alternative to the continent\u2019s governments.  Right-wing populist leaders from France, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy and elsewhere strode confidently into the Koblenz congress hall on the banks of the Rhine River ahead of a flag-waving escort, setting the tone for a gathering whose mood was buoyed by Trump\u2019s swearing-in. The European parties hope for similar success in tapping anti-establishment and protectionist sentiment in elections this year.  \u201cI believe we are witnessing historic times,\u201d Dutch anti-Islam leader Geert Wilders told reporters. \u201cThe world is changing. America is changing. Europe is changing. And the people start getting in charge again.\u201d  Wilders, speaking in English, declared that \u201cthe genie will not go back into the bottle again, whether you like it or not.\u201d  The Netherlands will provide the next major test for populist parties\u2019 support. Wilders\u2019 Party of Freedom could win the largest percentage of votes in the March 15 Dutch parliamentary election, even though it is shunned by other parties and unlikely to get a share of power.  Marine Le Pen, leader of France\u2019s far-right National Front, is among the top contenders in France\u2019s April-May presidential vote. In September, Frauke Petry\u2019s four-year-old Alternative for Germany party hopes to enter the German parliament in a national election, riding sentiment against German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s welcoming policy toward refugees. Other German parties say they won\u2019t work with the anti-immigrant group.  Those at the Koblenz conference Saturday are part of the Europe of Nations and Freedom group in the European Parliament, which was launched in 2015. The gathering also featured Matteo Salvini of Italy\u2019s anti-migrant Northern League and Harald Vilimsky, the general secretary of Austria\u2019s right-wing Freedom Party, which last year narrowly failed to win the country\u2019s presidency.  Trump \u201cis a winner, we are winners: Frauke Petry, Marine Le Pen, Geert Wilders, all of us here are winners,\u201d Vilimsky told an audience of around 1,000.  Speakers also denounced \u201cpolitical Islam\u201d and Europe\u2019s common currency, the euro, which Salvini labeled \u201ca failed, criminal experiment.\u201d  Le Pen reveled in Trump taking power in the U.S., months after Britain voted to leave the 28-nation European Union in a referendum that she hopes to emulate.  \u201c2016 was the year when the Anglo-Saxon world woke up. And 2017, I am sure, will be the year of the awakening of the people of continental Europe,\u201d she said.  She denounced the EU as \u201ca force of sterilization\u201d and assailed Merkel - whose name was booed loudly - for allowing in large numbers of asylum-seekers last year.  Le Pen praised Trump for what she said was a clear position on Europe: \u201cHe will not support a system of oppression of the people.\u201d  \u201cWe are experiencing the end of one world and the birth of another,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are experiencing the return of nation states.\u201d  Petry said \u201cjust as Donald Trump in America shows the way out of a dead end, with new prospects - including for (resolving) international conflicts - we want to do that in the coming months and years for Europe.\u201d  The leaders sought to portray their focus on nationalist priorities that don\u2019t necessarily converge as a virtue rather than a weakness. Le Pen lauded \u201cthe coherence that we have, above and beyond our differences, which we like.\u201d  \u201cBy definition, each of us wants to be the master at home. We want our people to be masters at home, so we don\u2019t want to align ourselves on a single policy for everyone,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is exactly what unites us - that is why we are fighting against a European Union that wants to squash us, that wants to eat us all in the same sauce.\u201d  Le Pen added that Trump was elected on the back of many of the ideas the European nationalists hold dear, pointing to \u201ccommon accents\u201d with what they have long said in his inauguration speech on Friday.  \u201cWe have fought, at first separately in each of our countries and now united, together, a whole series of great values: the nation, control of our borders, the defense of our people, patriotism, sovereignty, the defense of our national identities,\u201d she said.  Despite the talk of unity, there is unease among some in the Alternative for Germany party about aligning with Le Pen\u2019s National Front due to her protectionist economic policies, Joerg Meuthen, the AfD\u2019s co-leader, told the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland newspaper group.  Some 5,000 demonstrators gathered outside the congress center in Koblenz, singing the European anthem \u201cOde to Joy.\u201d  Elsewhere in Koblenz, demonstrators from the global AVAAZ activist group placed statues of Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini and Josef Stalin, among others, in front of a landmark statue of German Kaiser Wilhelm.  AVAAZ organizer Pascal Vollenweider said the statues of the dictators were meant to send a \u201cstrong message\u201d to the nationalist politicians\u2019 meeting that \u201cglobal citizens are rejecting their old dangerous ideas.\u201d  \u201cThey are not fascists in jackboots, it\u2019s a different type of fascism, of course. But if you look at the ideas ... it\u2019s very dangerous, and we have to face it,\u201d he said.mselves a realistic alternative to the continent\u2019s governments. ",

            "article_content": "BOSTON\u00a0-- Save the light reading for later. In 2017, dystopian fiction is all the rage. Gloomy classics depicting societies gone terribly wrong have shot to the top of best-seller lists like Amazon\u2019s in recent months, including George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d and Margaret Atwood\u2019s \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d prompting publishers to ramp up production decades after the books were first released. Others have followed close behind, such as Aldous Huxley\u2019s \u201cBrave New World,\u201d Sinclair Lewis\u2019 \u201cIt Can\u2019t Happen Here\u201d and Ray Bradbury\u2019s \u201cFahrenheit 451.\u201d Much of the renewed interest has followed the November election of President Donald Trump, which publishers and scholars say is no coincidence. \u201cDefinitely the election had an effect,\u201d said LuAnn Walther,\u201d editorial director of the paperback division at Knopf. \u201cThere\u2019s fear out there about what is going to happen, and I think these predictive books are helpful to people who are looking for the dangers the future might hold.\u201d One edition of \u201c1984\u201d has seen sales jump by 10,000 percent since January, when Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway defended incorrect claims as \u201calternative facts\u201d in a TV interview. It instantly drew comparisons to the type of government manipulation Orwell wrote about nearly 70 years ago. Some experts say readers often return to dystopian works during periods of great change, hoping to find out how they can avoid the nightmarish worlds the works depict. Beyond the U.S. election, readers might be jarred by events like the global refugee crisis, some say. \u201cThere\u2019s a factor of activism that you can take away from reading dystopian fiction, reading it as a defense against who we might become,\u201d said Therese Cox, a doctoral candidate teaching a course on dystopian fiction at Columbia University. \u201cIt speaks to impulses and fears that we\u2019ve had for a very long time.\u201d John Morillo, who teaches a course on dystopias at North Carolina State University, said dystopian fiction can offer readers a comforting reminder about the world today. \u201cNow maybe it\u2019s a sense that, well, it\u2019s still not that bad,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can close this book and say, \u2018Now there\u2019s hope for the future.\u2019\u201d",

            "article_content": "Ranking Judiciary Committee member Sen. Dianne Feinstein told Rosenstein in the hearing that she wanted to see a special prosecutor appointed, arguing that it would be in the public interest. \u00a0When she asked him whether he would appoint a special prosecutor, he responded that Obama Attorney General Loretta Lynch had been faced with a question on appointing a special prosecutor, and she rejected the request. She had confidence in the career attorneys at the Justice Department to look into the matter, he noted. Rosenstein also pointed out that the acting attorney general in the matter, Dana Boente. \u201cHe currently has full authority to appoint one,\u201d and he has not.\u00a0 Asked whether that could be taken as a \u201cno,\u201d Rosenstein said that he\u2019s \u201csimply not in a position to make that decision.\u201d He also said, however, that he doesn\u2019t presume that Lynch and Boente are correct in not appointing a special counsel. If he were to determine they\u2019re wrong, \u201cI would overrule them,\u201d he told the panel. After Attorney General Jeff Sessions came under fire\u00a0for not disclosing two election-season meetings\u00a0with the Russian Ambassador -- a move that resulted in his\u00a0recusal from investigations involving the Trump campaign\u00a0and Russian contacts -- Sessions on Monday sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee to update his testimony. Rod Rosenstein says he\u2019s \u201cnot in position\u201d to make decision on special prosecutor yet As he said during a press conference last week, Sessions defended the answers he gave during his Senate confirmation hearing in January, saying he answered the question correctly, as he\u2019d interpreted it. Congressional Democrats,\u00a0mostly. And they want one because they don\u2019t think the Trump administration is capable of investigating itself when it comes to\u00a0President Trump\u2019s ties to Russia. \u201cWe need a special prosecutor totally independent of [Attorney General Jeff Sessions],\u201d Elizabeth Warren tweeted last week, after it was revealed that Sessions had an undisclosed meeting with the Russian ambassador before the election. \u201cWe need a real, bipartisan, transparent investigation into Russia.\u201d President Trump incorrectly claimed Tuesday that 122 Guantanamo Bay detainees who were released under the Obama administration have returned to the battlefield. \u00a0 In defending the\u00a0new Republican plan\u00a0to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz suggested in an interview with CNN on Tuesday that lower-income Americans could face a choice between a new iPhone and their health-care insurance.\u00a0 Citing the Kaiser Foundation, host Alisyn Camerota had asked Chaffetz whether it worried him that fewer people would be covered under the Republican bill. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday blasted\u00a0House Republicans\u2019 plan to replace Obamacare\u00a0that they rolled out Monday evening. \u201cJust when you\u2019ve seen it all, the Republicans go to a more extreme place. This will make millions of people -- it\u2019s a question of 10, 15, 20 million people off of having health insurance. It will be the biggest transfer of wealth from low-middle income people to wealthy people in our country,\u201d the California Democrat said in an interview on \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d The measure would still include coverage for preexisting conditions and allow children to stay on their parents\u2019 plans until age 26. Pelosi said that in order to cover preexisting conditions, you have to have a pool of people. President Donald Trump is again citing corporate investments planned before he took office as evidence that his policies are growing jobs and business. \u201cWe are already winning again, America!\u201d he tweeted Monday after Exxon Mobil announced the latest details of an expansion initiative that actually began in 2013. \u201cBuy American & hire American are the principals at the core of my agenda, which is: JOBS, JOBS, JOBS,\u201d he said in another tweet thanking Exxon Mobil for the announcement. It\u2019s the latest in a string of corporate announcements about jobs and investments that date back to plans companies largely made when Barack Obama was president. Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster testifies before Sen. Armed Services Committee for reappointment to his rank, in order to serve as national security adviser, 9:30 a.m. Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch meets with Sen. Al Franken, 4:30 p.m. Frankin will hold a media availability at 5 p.m. Senate Intelligence holds closed meeting to vote on confirmation of former Sen. Dan Coats to be director of National Intelligence, 2 p.m. Tillerson meets with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin at the State Department, 11:15 a.m. Today marks the first State Department briefing of the Trump administration -- Mark Toner will brief at 2 p.m. President Trump\u00a0signed a new executive order Monday\u00a0that will impose a 90-day ban on the issuance of new visas to people from six predominantly Muslim nations and will suspend the U.S. refugee program for all countries for 120 days, a senior Department of Homeland Security official said Monday. Unlike\u00a0the original executive order from Jan. 27\u00a0that now sits in legal limbo, Iraq is the one country excluded from the 90-day ban, the official said, because the Iraqi government has made \u201cfirm commitments\u201d to the U.S. to work toward increased cooperation in terms of information-sharing. The revised order will not indefinitely block Syrian refugees from the U.S., as the original ban had directed, and the 120-day halt to the refugee program will apply to all countries. Like the original order, the administration is lowering the previous administration\u2019s cap for refugees admitted to the U.S. from 110,000 to 50,000 for the current fiscal year. House Republicans have released their long-awaited bill dismantling much of former President Barack Obama\u2019s health care overhaul. The measure would roll back the government\u2019s health care role and is expected to result in fewer people having insurance coverage.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0House committees planned votes on the legislation Wednesday. That will launch perhaps the year\u2019s defining battle in Congress, and GOP success is by no means assured because of internal divisions. The plan would repeal the law\u2019s fines on people who don\u2019t purchase health insurance. Instead of the statute\u2019s income-based premium subsidies, people would get tax credits based on age. The subsidies would phase out for higher-earning people. Republican Senators\u00a0are asking for evidence of President Trump\u2019s assertion\u00a0that former President Obama had ordered the wiretapping of Trump tower.\u00a0\u201cI think the President should tell the American people what evidence he has that indicates his predecessor wiretapped Trump Tower,\u201d Senator John McCain (R-AZ) told reporters on Monday evening. \u201cIt was a very serious charge and one that needs corroboration,\u201d noted McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. \u201cIf it\u2019s true it\u2019s earth-shattering,\u201d commented Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC). When asked if Mr. Trump\u2019s claims were a distraction, he responded, \u201cit\u2019s not a distraction as much as it is unnerving if it\u2019s true.\u201d During the announcement of the new travel ban executive order, Attorney General Jeff Sessions attempted to make the case for the pause in allowing refugees into the U.S. with a statement warning of the potential national security danger they pose. \u201c[M]ore than 300 people who came here as refugees are under FBI investigation for potential terrorism-related activities,\u201d Sessions said Monday morning. He also said that those who are \u201cseeking to support or commit terrorist attacks here will try to enter through our refugee program.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 The line also appears in the text of the executive order: \u201cThe Attorney General has reported to me that more than 300 persons who entered the United States as refugees are currently the subjects of counterterrorism investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\u201d President Donald Trump\u00a0has offered to maintain federal funding for\u00a0Planned Parenthood\u00a0if the group stops providing abortions. Its president spurned the proposal and noted that federal money already is not allowed to be used for abortion.\u00a0 Trump confirmed Monday there had been discussions after The New York Times inquired about what it described as an informal proposal.\u00a0 In a statement, Mr. Trump said polling shows most Americans oppose public funding for abortion.\u00a0 Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Attorney General Jeff Sessions unveiled the new travel ban executive order Monday morning. There are a number of things that are different\u00a0in this version of the travel ban.\u00a0 Tillerson told reporters that after the signing of the first order, there was an intensive review of Iraq\u2019s vetting policies, and as a result, the two countries would implement \u201cmultiple security measures\u201d to help prevent people with \u201ccriminal or terroristic intent\u201d from reaching the U.S. Kelly pointed out that nothing in the new executive order affects \u201cexisting, lawful permanent residents or persons with current authorization to enter our homeland.\u201d President Trump on Saturday\u00a0accused former President Obama of wiretapping his phones\u00a0at Trump Tower during the election. The unsubstantiated and unprecedented claim is raising eyebrows. Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), hundreds of warrants are issued each year to allow eavesdropping on a \u201cforeign power or agent of a foreign power.\u201d But according to the Justice Department, the president cannot order a wiretap if the surveillance involves \u201ccommunication to which a U.S. person is a party.\u201d Two-thirds of Americans\u00a0believe a special prosecutor should be appointed to investigate potential ties\u00a0between\u00a0Trump campaign aides and Russia, according to a new poll out Monday. In the poll,\u00a0from CNN/ORC, 65 percent of those surveyed said they thought an independent special prosecutor should handle the investigation, compared with 32 percent who said Congress is capable of looking into the allegations against the president and his top aides. These numbers come the week after reports that Attorney General Jeff Sessions met twice with the Russian ambassador during the campaign, a revelation that resulted in Sessions\u00a0recusing himself\u00a0from future investigations involving the Trump campaign. On Saturday,\u00a0senior FBI officials called Justice Department officials and asked that they publicly reject President Trump\u2019s assertion\u00a0that then-President Obama ordered the wiretapping of then-candidate Trump\u2019s phones, CBS News\u2019 Jeff Pegues reported, citing law enforcement sources. The message to the Justice Department came from FBI Director James Comey, who disputed the claim because it falsely suggests that the FBI broke the law. Key members of Congress say they will honor President Donald Trump\u2019s request to investigate\u00a0his unsubstantiated claim that Barack Obama overstepped his authority as president and had Trump\u2019s telephones tapped during the election campaign. A U.S. official said the FBI has asked the Justice Department to dispute Trump\u2019s allegation, though no such statement has been issued. Obama\u2019s intelligence director also said no such action was ever carried out. The start of a new administration is never a clean slate, even when parties flip. Day One is just another day for military operations, a budget that is still in place from the old crowd and a vast array of economic, social and law enforcement initiatives left over from the last president. You would not know this from President Donald Trump. He proudly takes credit for any positive development that has bloomed since he took office Jan. 20, even when the roots and buds of it were from President Barack Obama\u2019s time.\u00a0 Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of the long-running conservative website Newsmax, says he talked to President Trump over the weekend and\u00a0hasn\u2019t \u201cseen him this p---ed off in a long time.\u201d \u201cI spoke with the president twice yesterday about the wiretap story. I haven\u2019t seen him this p---ed off in a long time,\u201d Ruddy wrote in a Sunday column. On Saturday, Mr. Trump claimed, without evidence, that\u00a0former President Obama had wiretapped his phones before the election.",

            "article_content": "by Anthony Salvanto, Jen de Pinto, Fred Backus, Sarah Dutton, Kabir Khanna  The nation is not simply divided. The last election left many wondering if they really understood the views of Americans who disagreed with them, or whether they were truly being heard at all. A single poll number can\u2019t always answer those puzzles, so here we look deeper at all the groups who support and oppose the Trump administration at its outset: who they are, what they want and - most of all - what might change their minds.  It turns out that while there are hard-and-fast views on either side of the nation\u2019s divide, the range of President Trump\u2019s potential support - both to the high and low side - is actually bigger than you might think.  In this study, people separated themselves into four groups: the strongest of Trump backers (who we\u2019ll call the Believers); those backing him but waiting for him to deliver (the Conditionals); those opposing him for now but waiting to see some results (the Curious) and those who seem immovably, firmly opposed (The Resistors.) We\u2019ll plan to follow these groups over time. Here\u2019s how they break down now:  These are the president\u2019s strongest backers, who like what he\u2019s doing and how he\u2019s doing it; defend him against his critics, and see him as defending the country against threats.  They put no conditions on their support: \u201cI\u2019m a Trump supporter, period.\u201d  They like the last three weeks: eighty-five percent say he\u2019s off to a \u201cgood start\u201d and doing what he said he\u2019d do during the campaign, or more.  Three-fourths of them agree with his policies and almost all of them are at least glad he\u2019s \u201cshaking up Washington.\u201d At the moment it is terrorism that comes first. Fighting ISIS is their top priority for the new administration and think people ought to evaluate him on whether he keeps them safe, more so than on whether he creates jobs. They\u2019re overwhelmingly for the travel ban (at 91 percent support) and two-thirds would also be for a religious test for those seeking entry. Most would have the President ignore the courts if the courts overturn the ban.  The want the wall and believe Mexico WILL pay for it. They overwhelmingly like how he\u2019s dealing with Russia. And asked to pick something that would signal America being great again, the top choice is \u201crestoring law and order\u201d at home, followed by making sure America is the most powerful nation in the world.  Most believe Mr. Trump is right on the facts, when he\u2019s challenged. They\u2019re defiant toward any who would challenge the President, they think the he ought to pay attention to those who voted for him (which they overwhelmingly did) before reaching out to Democrats or others who oppose him. Describing those who challenge or protest against Mr. Trump, they pick words like \u201cna\u00efve\u201d and \u201cdangerous.\u201d  In governing style, they want Mr. Trump to take care of\u00a0his\u00a0voters first, not try to reach out to others. They like his tweets and think it is a good way for a president to communicate. A quarter do feel he\u2019s been spending too much time talking about TV shows, but the main thing they would not want Mr. Trump to do is start acting like a typical kind of politician.  These are some of the older and retired non-college voters of the sort who backed him in November (and, for that matter, a year ago in the primaries.) On partisanship they\u2019re mostly Republicans and some independents, and more of them turned out in the Presidential election than any of the other groups identified here. One-third of them didn\u2019t vote, but like him - they feel he speaks for them and respects them. They call themselves conservative, but don\u2019t care whether Mr. Trump is conservative, per se\u00a0 - these are views you may recall from the primaries last year, when many Trump voters didn\u2019t care about finding the most conservative candidate in the primaries. And half of them think Mr. Trump is aiming to execute his agenda and go back to his business - which jibes with their notion of him as not being a typical politician.  Americans who say \u201cI support Trump, but he has to deliver\u201d  They \u201cdon\u2019t agree with everything\u201d so far but are \u201cat least glad he\u2019s shaking things up.\u201d  Much more economically-focused and transactional, these voters will remove their support if he doesn\u2019t \u201cfix the economy\u201d for them. They\u2019re also concerned about safety, but aren\u2019t as all-in with everything Mr. Trump does, especially in terms of style. A quarter don\u2019t like the tweets.  They don\u2019t think he\u2019s correct on all the facts, but rather that \u201cfacts are debatable\u201d and he\u2019s trying to make a point, or misspeaks. They like the ban but are more likely than the strongest backers to think he \u201cwent too far\u201d with it. The do NOT think a religious test would be constitutional, and would prefer Mr. Trump work through the courts. They\u2019re a little more leery about Russia. One-third admit he\u2019s off to \u201ca rough start\u201d but remain optimistic.  They have plenty in common with the strongest supporters though, including no desire to reach out to opponents.  These Americans oppose Mr. Trump at the moment but \u201cwould reconsider\u201d supporting him if he does a good job. They\u2019re looking for more than just results, though \u2013 they want Mr. Trump to reach out to them, and they want respect.  Half of them at least like the fact he is \u201cshaking up Washington.\u201d Ninety percent say he\u2019d gain at least some support from them if he improves the economy -- though fewer than half think he\u2019s spending time focused on jobs now. And just as strong in their calculus is him \u201cshowing respect\u201d for opponents. Four in ten of them say that respect could earn him their \u201cfull support.\u201d  But right now 84 percent of this group say that he doesn\u2019t speak for people like them, and 4 in 5 say he doesn\u2019t respect or understand people like them.  They\u2019re a little younger, more likely to be women, and more likely to be independent than Democrats. Fewer than one in ten identify themselves as Republicans. \u00a0  They want an improved economy just like his supporters and could back Mr. Trump if he delivers one -- but they feel personally alienated by the President right now. They want him to reach out, but are not optimistic he will, leaving this group looking like a missed opportunity for the President at the moment.  They\u2019re more inclined to say Democrats should work with Mr. Trump than oppose him on everything. Half say Democrats should take the deals they can get and then look toward 2020.  At the start, the things President Trump is doing don\u2019t resonate with them. They think the travel ban has gone too far and should be lifted; they overwhelmingly think at least some refugees should be admitted. Half think he has gone too far in his dealings with foreign allies (six in ten are concerned about that). Most of them think he does not have the right approach to Russia. In addition, many think he is focusing too much on the election, his approval ratings, TV shows, the wall and the travel ban.\u00a0  Women make up over half of this group, and more than a quarter are under age 30. Politically, they\u2019re split between Democrats and independents.  \u201cI am against Trump, period.\u201d  A large group consisting mainly of Democrats, and with a larger share of minority Americans than the other groups, these Americans don\u2019t foresee themselves ever supporting the president. They\u2019re angry and pessimistic, though they do concede that Mr. Trump is doing what he said he\u2019d do in the campaign. (None of them voted for him, though.)  The biggest differences between this group and the curious are: Resisters want the Democrats to oppose Mr. Trump on many more things, rather than try to work with him; demographically, they are much more likely to be either African-American or Hispanic.  Four in ten of them did not vote in the 2016 election. They have a lower rate of participation than those on the opposite side who strongly support Mr. Trump. One in ten feels \u201cmotivated\u201d by the Trump presidency right now, so the Democrats may still have some work to do rallying this part of their base.  They overwhelmingly disagree with both President Trump\u2019s policies and the way he\u2019s doing things now, at a rate of over nine in 10, and nearly all think the Trump administration is off to a rough start.  Few of them believe there is much Mr. Trump can do to gain their full support, but like the more persuadable opponents, most say he will gain at least some support if he shows respect for people with different views.\u00a0 There is little hope among this group of Americans that this will come to pass. However \u2013 nearly all say the president doesn\u2019t speak for them, respect or understand them, or will try to do things to earn their support.  On governing, they\u2019re different from the \u201cCurious\u201d group on what they want Democrats to do. 8 in 10 of them want Democrats to oppose Trump at least on things they care most about, including 37 percent of them want Democrats to oppose Trump at every turn.  Seven in 10 think he how he handles himself as president matters a lot. But rather than talking about creating jobs, most of them think he spends too much time talking about the border wall with Mexico (which nearly all think is a bad idea), the travel ban, TV shows, his approval ratings, and how he did in the election this past November.  For the Nation Tracker we interviewed over 2,200 panelists, a higher than usual sample size, and balanced, among those who reported voting, between Trump voters and Clinton voters in the same proportion as the election.  The CBS News 2017 Nation Tracker is conducted by YouGov using a nationally representative sample of 2216 U.S. adults between February 8-10, 2017. The margin of error for the full sample is +/- 2.6.

But will this Republican unity last into the New Year? We'll take a look at the political landscape heading into the 2018 midterms and in our annual CBS Correspondents' panel we'll reflect on this year and look ahead to next.\u00a0It's all coming up on FACE THE NATION.\u00a0Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I'm John Dickerson. On this Christmas Eve morning with all the newsmakers out of town we begin with a sixty-seven-year tradition, the annual CBS News Correspondent roundtable. Joining us this year, White House and senior foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan. Ed O'Keefe covers Capitol Hill and politics for the Washington Post and is a CBS News contributor. We've asked him to fill in or congressional correspondent Nancy Cordes, who we hope is enjoying her well-deserved break with her family. Chief White House correspondent Major Garrett. Justice and Homeland Security correspondent Jeff Pegues. And national security correspondent David Martin is also here. We begin with a portion of an interview Margaret did with Vice President Pence late last week on a surprise trip to Afghanistan. She talked to him about the accomplishments of the first year of the Trump administration and what's ahead for 2018.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0MIKE PENCE: First and foremost, this President has rolled back federal red tape in record numbers, unleashed American energy, appointed conservative jurists to our courts including Justice Neil Gorsuch. But to arrive at the end of the year, and thanks to President Trump's leadership to see the Congress of the United States come together, pass the largest tax cut in American history was deeply inspiring.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN (CBS News White House Correspondent/CBS News Senior Foreign Affairs Correspondent/@margbrennan): You see a toehold to get more done?\u00a0MIKE PENCE: As much as we've accomplished this year, rebuilding our military, unleashing the full potential of the American economy. And passing the largest tax cut in American history and-- and other-- and-- and other initiatives that this President has advanced, it's clear we're just getting started. And next year I think you're going to see this administering move on vigorously to an agenda, which will include infrastructure and welfare reform. The progress that we've made in the war against ISIS, where we've virtually crushed the ISIS, caliphate and taken back its-- its-- the capital of Raqqa, the fight here in Afghanistan, taking the fight directly to the enemy. The investment that we're making in our military, the growth and optimism in the American economy I think-- I think sets the stage for tremendous growth and opportunity in security and prosperity in 2018.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you explain to the American people how they should understand what just happened this month with Mike Flynn pleading guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador, which the President said he lied not only to you about but to the FBI and that's why the President fired him.\u00a0MIKE PENCE: We'll let the special counsel and-- and others do their job. We're going to cooperate but we're going to stay very focused on the job the American people elected us to do.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you just clarify how you understand what happened with Mike Flynn who we'd known had lied to you? Did you know he had lied to the FBI?\u00a0MIKE PENCE: Well, I--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The President said that's what made him fire him.\u00a0MIKE PENCE: I stand by everything I've said with regard to that individual and every other aspect of this. But--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But when he was fired, did you know he lied to the FBI?\u00a0MIKE PENCE: What I can tell you is I knew that he lied to me. And-- and I know the President made the right decision, with regard to him.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Margaret, so the Vice President is a fan of the job his boss is doing. Let me ask you about that trip, though. It was supposed to be part of a larger trip that the Vice President was supposed to take. That part was cancelled.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it was interesting because that-- that trip has been postponed until January. It was supposed to be to Jerusalem and also to Egypt, part of what had initially been planned to sort of a, look, I delivered on this promise to eventually move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and then it became a bit more of a trying to soften the blow that was very much dealt to all of the Arab world and the Palestinians. But as more and more cancelled their planned meetings with the Vice President, that's made that trip tougher, but this-- this bond that was dropped in many ways with this decision on Jerusalem. The administration would say, we didn't see the blowback on the security side, the risks and the threats that some had predicted, but you have to understand that symbolically the decision on Jerusalem will continue to be a sticking point for the Arab world. It may not be the breaking point, because they have broader concerns with Iran right now but it is certainly something that the administration's not going to quickly move beyond.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Major, we heard the Vice President's assessment of the year. Give us your assessment?\u00a0MAJOR GARRETT (CBS News Chief White House Correspondent/@MajorCBS): I think it was very revealing in the last week of this year effectively in Washington that the person who had the year-end wrap up press conference was not Donald Trump, was not Speaker Paul Ryan, it was Mitch McConnell. And if you're going to look at the person singularly most responsible for accomplishments on the domestic side for the Trump agenda, it's not Donald Trump, it's Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader who held with the exception of one issue--health care--Republicans together on every single aspect of what the President tried to accomplish. Tax cuts were passed because McConnell held his conference together. All of the twelve circuit judges, nominated and confirmed, a record for any first year of any American presidency because Mitch McConnell held his conference together. And he got forty-nine votes on health care, closer than anyone probably could have under those similar circumstances. So Mitch McConnell put the bow on this year and quite properly so. The President signs, but without McConnell who for the very first time this last week the President actually praised on Twitter because it has finally gotten through to him through many people inside and outside the White House, Mister President, forget what Steve Bannon says, you can't get anything without Mitch McConnell.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Ed, staying with Congress, you heard Mike Pence talk about him-- about infrastructure, you heard him talk about welfare reform, given what Major has laid out, but also the fact that you got a Democratic Party that doesn't want to help out this President, what-- what do you think Congress is going to look like?\u00a0ED O'KEEFE (CBS News Contributor/Washington Post/@edatpost): More likely of those two is infrastructure for sure. It was quite revealing how very quickly this week Paul Ryan tried to pivot to entitlement reform and very quickly Mitch McConnell and Republican Senators said, no, no way. Because remember the math. Fifty-one to forty-nine is new math starting January 3rd. Doug Jones comes to the Senate as a Democrat from Alabama--\u00a0MAJOR GARRETT: Courtesy of Steve Bannon.\u00a0ED O'KEEFE: Courtesy of Steve Bannon exactly, and cooperation is required. And the only thing that most Senators rights now believe could start the year off in a-- in a good way is working on some kind of plan to fund big construction projects basically in this country. The question of course as it always is seems to be, how will you pay for? And that given that you've just slashed tax cuts, Republicans will probably turn around and suggest that entitlement reform is the way to do that in some respects but a lot of those Republican Senators and a fair number of congressional House members who are from suburban swing districts were going after Medicare, Medicaid, social security, is an unpopular thing to do in an election year are-- are going to resist it.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: David, the vice president said ISIS is decimated. The caliphate is gone. Is that accurate? And if so, why has it been-- why has this come to pass?\u00a0DAVID MARTIN (CBS News National Security Correspondent): I think it's accurate to say that the caliphate as it existed in Iraq and Syria is crushed. They used to control all of northern Syria, northern Iraq, western Iraq, they're now down to a few pieces of territory along the u-- Euphrates River in-- in Syria. And I think the trump administration deserves some credit for that. The weight of American airstrikes and the capabilities of American Special Operations Forces would sooner or later crush the ISIS caliphate no matter who was in the White House. But the way that General Mattis, the Secretary of Defense went about it, was to give his commanders more authorities to make decisions in the field. So when they saw a target of opportunity, they didn't have to come all the way back through the chain of command to the White House to get approval. They just did it. And now, the ISIS that once existed is almost dead. But as Secretary Mattis says over and over, they're not-- they're not defeated. ISIS, the caliphate is going to become ISIS the movement. And its followers, we-- we already see them in-- in Afghanistan, Somalia, Yemen, name almost any country in-- in North Africa. These aren't fighters who for the most part escaped from Iraq and Syria, these are just angry young men looking for a cause to serve.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Jeff, the vice president talked about Michael Flynn. Michael Flynn is at the heart of both the relationship with the Russians among Trump advisors but then also the obstruction question about whether the President told the FBI director to go easy on the Flynn investigation. Where are we at the end of the year with this cluster of investigations?\u00a0JEFF PEGUES (CBS News Justice & Homeland Security Correspondent/@jeffpeguesCBS): Well, they're-- they're ongoing. And the questions I know the White House is interested in this went will it all wrap up and it-- it doesn't seem like there is an end in sight right now. I mean you have Mike Flynn who was given this plea deal. He is a figure that straddles, you know, the transition, the campaign and the first few weeks of the White House. So if he's cooperating with the investigators, you get a clearer sense of what the investigators may be looking at. At least according to some of the people that I know who have worked with Mueller in the past, they know how he builds his cases. He tries to get some cooperating witnesses which he-- he has now with Flynn and Papadopoulos, the foreign policy advisor who also took a plea deal. So, you wrap up these witnesses, but you don't tip your hand according to these people who work with Mueller to what the main charges are going to be at the end. So that's the question--when will this end and what are investigators trying to get out of Mike Flynn?\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Well we're going to take a short break now, but we'll be back in a minute with more from our panel.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: And we're back with our panel. Major, I want to start with you. There have been a lot of management changes at the White House.\u00a0MAJOR GARRETT: Yeah.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Where are we at the end of the year on that?\u00a0MAJOR GARRETT: John Kelly has brought order and discipline and functionality to not only the way decisions are brought to the President but who is allowed to bring them to the President. And they go through John Kelly. But that doesn't change the fundamental truth about the Trump approach to the presidency. And I've been trying to think of a metaphor. So you go to a rock concert to-- it's Make America Great, again rock concert. There are two songs Forgotten Americans and America First and fifteen solos. Fifteen solos by the same soloist on different instruments. That soloist is Donald Trump, okay. When he says in interviews, I'm the only one that matters, he fundamentally means that. And everything about this administration pivots off of that truth. He is the central actor, the central soloist in everything. And imagine yourself at this rock concert and you hear fifteen solos. You're probably going to be a little tired by the end of the show, because you get the soloist and very little else. If you talk to cabinet secretaries, which I have the luxury of doing it sometime, they're like we're doing all this things but it's hard to sort of get people aware of it because the soloist is on the flute then he's on the drums then he's on the electric guitar then he's on every other instrument and that is both the kind of reality draw of the Trump presidency, the management reality and the exhausting reality.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Right. By the time he gets to the glockenspiel, it's really-- Margaret, I want to just pivot right from that to the question of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Give us the sense of that powerful job, is Rex Tillerson going to stay in and what's his legacy?\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Major is right, there's only one star in this show and everyone in that administration is keenly aware of it. In the past few weeks in particular you've seen Secretary Tillerson be a bit more assertive, particularly you see this in this newly assertive position perhaps in Ukraine, to open up this idea that we could express more support and actually provide lethal weaponry to the Ukrainians, which is a shot across the bow at Russia which you've heard Tillerson say, time and again this is the one issue of Ukraine where we can't get past this to broker that broader deal with Russia. So I think you will continue to see him quietly move on that front along with more sanctions on Russia, along with more assertive position and also be more outspoken in the New Year, but he clearly doesn't want to try to compete with the star in this show on the main stage.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: All right. We're going to see how long we can extend this metaphor. David, let me ask you about North Korea. Where does that stand at the end of this year?\u00a0DAVID MARTIN: Three hundred and sixty-five days further down the road of a collision course. The U.S. is making a demand of North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program, the North Korea is not going to accept. North Korea is developing a weapon, an intercontinental ballistic missile as the Trump administration says it cannot accept. Something's got to give and it's probably going to take some major decisions by somebody in the year 2018 to get us off this-- this collision course.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Jeff, what's the state of Homeland Security at the end of this year?\u00a0JEFF PEGUES:\u00a0 Well, the-- the main focus, John, right now is on these lone wolf actors. You know, law enforcement doesn't like to call them lone wolves because they feel it glorifies the act. But these are people that are harder to spot because they are sitting in a basement somewhere being radicalized online, and with the array of information available online they can be radicalized within weeks and then carry out an attack. The FBI does about a thousand investigations, ISIS related in the U.S. and really that's been the consistent number over the last couple of years. But spotting these people is so difficult because they blend in, you-- you don't really have a history of law enforcement with them. And so trying to wrap them up and get them arrested is a problem for law enforcement. And it's something that will continue into 2018.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Ed, I want to end this round by talking about Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, their relationship with the President now. It was a rocky year. Is everybody on the same team now or are things coming in 2018 that you think will create more potential conflict?\u00a0ED O'KEEFE: Well, this is by far their-- their best week. And I think you saw that in-- in their public praise of each other, the body language, and fact that they all understood this was a significant win not only for them but for the Republican Party and its existence. But I think you're going to see some more disagreements about what to do next year, both officially and politically. There are competing priorities obviously in the House and the Senate. McConnell doesn't really want to rock the boat. I think Ryan is eager to-- to try to take another step in terms of looking at sort of domestic policy and-- and what could possibly be reshaped in a more conservative image. Both of them struggle every day with the fact that the President does not grasp, care about or really, you know, talk to anyone about details of this stuff.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Major, I want to ask you about the underreported story from the year. What would you put in that category?\u00a0MAJOR GARRETT: I'd say one overseas and one at home. Overseas, it's this relationship with Saudi Arabia. When I covered the Trump campaign, I did not imagine the very first stop he would make overseas would be Riyadh, considering his orientation to the Muslim world in general and the possible restoration in the words of the Saudi kingdom about Islam and taking on terrorism in a way that it didn't before could be a potential far-reaching story. At home, I would say its energy. This administration has a twentieth century point of view on energy, extraction, and exploitation. It does not have an embracive renewable or twenty-first century energy concepts the Obama administration does that will radically change where we drill, where we don't drill, and the environmental implications of that.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Margaret, what's your-- your candidate for under covered story?\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: One thing I would highlight is what we're seeing in terms of the lost generation, this refugee crisis that was so focused on Syria has now continued, worsened, become a health epidemic whether you're talking about conflict in Yemen, outbreak of cholera, hitting thousands, whether you're looking at the Democratic Republic of the Congo where UNICEF is predicting four hundred thousand children under the age of five could die because of these health risks, because of refugee crisis issues of displacement and starvation. So, whether its Syria, Africa, you know, throughout the Middle East, these issues, the United States isn't talking about as much, isn't leading on, and is really only articulating in purely a homeland security point of view. But these things have consequences in years to come in terms of radicalization, in terms of risks, and in terms of simply health risk.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: David, what's been under covered story?\u00a0DAVID MARTIN: Well, you heard the Vice President Pence say we are rebuilding our military. Not so much. There's a big new defense spending bill, but it's just a wish list until you get a-- a deal in Congress. And so the fact is that the Pentagon along with the rest of the governors is going to continue to operate on these continuing resolutions, which keeps you going along the same path. And the-- the heads of all of the services just say that their readiness is-- is falling apart. And when you listen to the-- the details of what an aircraft carrier has to go through these days to get underway, when we saw those three carriers operating off the Korean Peninsula awhile back, the machination that it took to get one of those carriers, the Teddy Roosevelt underway, I mean, they were stealing planes from all over the United States stealing parts just so that they have air wing to go on there. The secretary of the Air Force says that when she saw on her first briefing on the new readiness rates when she came into office, she said, \"There must be some mistake. This has got to be wrong.\" And, of course, it wasn't wrong. And nobody should conclude from that that we're about to be inferior to anybody. We're still number one. But as secretary of the Air Force said these decreased readiness rates don't mean we're not going, but it does mean fewer are going to come back.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Ed, your candidate for this.\u00a0ED O'KEEFE: Two quick ones. First off, let's remember, there was an assassination attempt on a top House Republican this year. And this was the most threatening year for lawmakers in history. There were at least one thousand six hundred fifty threats against lawmakers as of late July. I couldn't get updated stats in time for this, but it's safe to surmise it was at least doubled last year. The other, there's an internal displacement crisis in this country. At least two hundred thirty thousand people have left Puerto Rico since Hurricane Maria. They are in Florida, Georgia, Texas, North Carolina, New York. They're going to reshape the politics of those states. But there's an island that needs to be rebuilt and the United States didn't do it this year.\u00a0JEFF PEGUES: I would agree. I think, you know, Puerto Rico is just-- what has-- what has happened there and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the lack of focus on those issues there is big. That's not exactly my beat, but it's-- it's something that I'm interested in. But also if you look at overseas, European officials were saying that they're not getting the outflow of ISIS fighters back in Europe that they were anticipating. I talked to top counterterrorism officials here in the U.S. who agreed with that.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Prediction time. Jeff, I'm going to start with you. What are you going to predict in 2018?\u00a0JEFF PEGUES: Well, you might recall that last year I predicted that James Comey was going to stick around. Maybe--\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: You're a humble and honest man.\u00a0JEFF PEGUES: Maybe you can give me a break on that one. Well, I mean, who knew what would happen? So this year, I won't be as bold, but I will say that I think the Mueller investigation is going to, one way or another, give members of Congress a big decision in 2018. I think it's going to-- it-- it will end up in their lap.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: David, what's your prediction?\u00a0DAVID MARTIN: Well, as long as we're confessing. Last year, I predicted that President Trump and Kim Jong-un would have a face-to-face meeting. I was brilliant, but dead wrong. So, I'm not going to touch North Korea. I'm going to predict that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS will meet his end in 2018.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Ed.\u00a0ED O'KEEFE: One of the big four congressional leaders, Nancy Pelosi, Paul Ryan, Chuck Schumer, and Mitch McConnell will either be gone or on their way out of their position by this time next year.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Major.\u00a0MAJOR GARRETT: The President is going to have to come to terms with what the resistance means. You talk to Ed Gillespie, who ran in Virginia, got more votes than any-- anyone ever run for governor in Virginia, but lost by nine points.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Mm-Hm.\u00a0MAJOR GARRETT: So the victor got even more, says \"I met the resistance and it's real.\" In the mid-term elections, everything that's on the agenda will have to require democratic votes. And that's going to mean larger compromises than this President has shown any inclination to achieve. So, 2018 for this White House and this President if it has any accomplishments at all will have to be through and over or around the resistance. And that will be a fascinating story.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson does not resign in January as had been predicted and asked many, many times. He'll stick around. I think he will be engaging more and more assertive, as I said. But I think one of the areas that is going to really take up a lot of his time is trying to save whatever chance of diplomacy there maybe with North Korea, but we may see also more immediate crisis with Iran.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Thank you, Margaret.\u00a0And I want to thank everybody on our panel today for today, but also for all the work you do for CBS and for FACE THE NATION--your reporting, your insights, and your curiosity about the news and what's going on in Washington and around the world, help us inform and make sense of what's been a very unusual year. And we'll be back in a moment.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: If you can't watch the entire show live, the full hour of FACE THE NATION is rebroadcast every Sunday at 11:00 AM and 6:00 PM Eastern Time on our digital streaming network CBSN. Available through our website, the CBS News app or your favorite TV device.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: And we'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.\u00a0The big political question for 2018 is whether Republicans will build on their single-party control of Congress or whether Democrats will flip control of the Senate, the House or both. For a look at where things stand as we move into 2018, we turn to Dan Balz who is the chief correspondent at the Washington Post. His colleague, Karen Tumulty, is the national political correspondent. And our own Anthony Salvanto is the CBS News director of elections. All right. First, we're going to get to the House and the Senate and break those down. But I want to just start with the very broad question for all three of you. Dan, I'll start with you. What is the landscape look like here at the end of 2017 for next year's elections?\u00a0DAN BALZ (Washington Post/@danbalz): Everything we see at this point, John, is-- is a very, very difficult landscape for the Republicans, almost every measure or every event that has happened so far this year politically has been bad for the Republicans and good for the Democrats. You can look at it in terms of the President's approval rating, which is historically low for a first-term President. You can look at it in the nature of the current preference for how the House should break. The Democrats have a significant advantage on that, at this point. And we know that from the recent elections through the enthusiasm is much greater or appears to be much greater among Democrats than Republicans to turn out and that's often the key indicator in mid-term elections.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Karen. Yes.\u00a0KAREN TUMULTY (Washington Post/@ktumulty): It's true. Mid-term elections, especially in a president's first term are almost never good news for the President. In fact, only twice since 1934 has the President's party picked up seats in the first mid-term of his first term in office. But it really does seem like the Republicans are, in fact, heading into some-- some really tough weather here. And it's true, the generic ballot, this-- you know, would you rather see a Democrat or a Republican in office. The Democrats are ahead in that by double digits, but I-- I agree. I think this enthusiasm gap is really the biggest thing the Republicans ought to be worried about right now.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: I want to get at the roots of that enthusiasm where it comes from. But, Anthony, where do you put the needle down on the record here?\u00a0ANTHONY SALVANTO (CBS News Elections Director/@SalvantoCBS): Well, let me tamper that a little bit. The math is still a little bit in the advantage of the Republicans, at least on the Senate side. And the reason for that is that the-- the Democrats are defending more seats and any time that happens, you have a harder hill to climb. And, look, on the House side, it's true that we see a national polling that more people are now saying that they'd like to see the Democrats in control. But remember that those polls are talking to people in very heavy democratic districts as well as heavy Republican ones. And so that generic ballot can sort of overstate the case, right? Which you really want to focus on is how many specific House seats could be competitive. And on that side, there may be just enough for the Democrats to put the House in play. The real question going forward is, can they expand that math, can they make more seats than we wouldn't ordinarily think are in play, sort of come into view.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: On that generic ballot, though, isn't it the case, this-- this question of would you vote for Republican or Democrat even though it's an imprecise number when it's that big, when people are favoring the Democrats that much, isn't that sort of, well, a blunt indicator when the number is that big? It still does tell you something, though, doesn't it?\u00a0ANTHONY SALVANTO: Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. It gives you a general sense of the direction. And there's no question that that direction is pointing towards Democrats. It-- it's maybe about half as many. So if you see a national ballot, you know, national generic ballot, you say, \"Well, they might win maybe half that much in the-- in the actual elections.\" But there again, the interesting is going to be where they can start to try to persuade people. And as you look around the country, a lot of these suburban districts, a lot of wealthier districts that had gone Republican, Republican on economic issues particularly are places that they're targeting. And if they can start to put those in play, then we start to see a really competitive House-- House election.\u00a0KAREN TUMULTY: I think the first place to look will be there are twenty-three House districts and the Democrats have to pick up twenty-four. There are twenty-three House districts where there is a Republican incumbent sitting in a district that was won by Hillary Clinton. And-- and these districts are all over the country. They're in California, Texas, Florida. And they-- there are big range. A lot of them were suburban, but a lot of them are rural and a lot of them have large numbers of Hispanics.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah.\u00a0DAN BALZ: John, there's one other element in terms of the-- the tempering of where we are. We have a-- we have a odd situation, which is a President with very low approval ratings at a time when you have historically over the last seventeen years, the lowest unemployment rate, a stock market that is the President says constantly is breaking records weekly and steady economic growth. So for the Republicans if they can, in one way or another, force people to think about the state of the economy rather than their view of the President, they-- they could hope to do better than a lot of this polling suggests at this point. History says that-- well, there have been two other times in the last half century, where you've had this anomaly of low presidential approval and low unemployment. In both those cases, the presidential approval turned out to be the more significant and the party in power lost a lot of seats.\u00a0ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yeah. In the last three midterms, most people have said that the midterm vote is about the President. So there's no question that he's a factor and there's no question that approval rating looked like it (INDISTINCT).\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: And that's where the enthusiasm you're talking about, Karen, comes from. Explain that for people a little bit about. It's linked to the President, right?\u00a0KAREN TUMULTY: And-- and what-- what pollsters ask voters is, you know, how excited are you about this election? How-- they-- they look for other measures of-- of how engaged people are with the fact that there even is an election this year. And just this week, the Wall Street Journal, Peter Hart, their pollster, found a ten-point enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans.\u00a0ANTHONY SALVANTO: You know, that's really important, too. Because remember, in midterms, turnout is lower. And the folks who tend to vote are a little disproportionately older and often disproportionately Republican, at least recently. What the Democrats have taken out of these last couple of elections, Virginia and Alabama, is that they can motivate their base. That people who don't ordinarily come out except for in presidential years have been willing to come out. And if they can do that, then that changes the dynamic because there are folks sitting in these districts who normally sit out midterms, where turnout goes under forty percent a lot of times, they reshape that and the whole electorate changes.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Dan, let me ask you about the Senate. Karen sketched out the situation in the House. In the Senate, after Doug Jones of Alabama is seated as the Democrat next year after that exciting race this year, there will be a two-seat majority for Republicans. That means the Democrats need to just pick up two seats to gain control of the Senate. Now ten Democrats are up for re-election in states Donald Trump won. And in recent history, states have tended to vote for senator the way they have for Presidents, so that's one factor there. There's only one Republican running in a state where Hillary Clinton won. That's in Nevada, Dean Heller. And then there are some other interesting states, Nevada-- sorry, Tennessee and then Minnesota are-- are on and those are-- so where do you see the Senate shaking out?\u00a0DAN BALZ: Well, I'd-- I'd make two points. First of all, if we were having this conversation a year ago we would be talking about the likelihood of potentially significant losses for the Democrats in the Senate because as you say they're defending so many seats and they're defending them in states that Trump won. Now, of those ten that Trump won, five are truly red, and five are what I would call more swing states.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah.\u00a0DAN BALZ: But what's happened over the course of the year is because of the turbulence that the Republicans have run into. There is now at least the possibility of Democrats being able to take control of the Senate. I think it's still very, very difficult. But they have three opportunities--Arizona, Nevada and possibly Tennessee because they have a candidate there, the former democratic governor who may be the only Democrat who could win state-wide. But I'm-- I'm not predicting at this point that he will. And-- and many of their incumbents are in reasonably good shape or better shape than you might have thought six or eight or ten months ago. I think it's still a heavy lift for the Democrats to take over, but they at least have an opportunity which they wouldn't have dreamed of at the beginning of the Trump presidency.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Karen, when Dan talks about some of those Senate seats being in kind of more swingy areas than-- so you've got the class of seats that are up where Democrats are trying to defend territory in West Virginia where--\u00a0KAREN TUMULTY: Right.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: --I think Trump won by forty-five points. Then others are in Michigan, Wisconsin, which were-- which were closer. So how do you think-- is that the distinction, another one we should be watching for those Rust Belt states that flipped and went for Trump in the-- in the presidential where people were surprised? How do you think that will play out in the Senate elections?\u00a0KAREN TUMULTY: Well, as it turns out I spent some time this week in Michigan and actually looking at the governors' race there. What I found is that Democrats act-- sort of activist base, the kind of people who are engaged now, are so traumatized by seeing what they thought were going to be easy wins for Hillary Clinton last time around that-- that also contributes to the-- the enthusiasm factor. They-- they were caught napping in 2016. And there is a determination, I think, not to have that happen again.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: And, Anthony, we have-- another thing we should talk about with respect to the Senate is there are primaries to come. We saw in Alabama some extraordinary inter-party Republican fighting, comments, people even saying they were no longer Republicans after the Republican National Committee supported Roy Moore. How do you think the primary process plays out in terms of-- well, just how do you think it plays out?\u00a0ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yeah, definitely the thing to watch this spring. We could be sitting here a year from now and the landscape will be very different because, look, behind all of this is which direction does each party go, right? And the Republicans are still having that conversation. We talked a lot about the sort of more populist wing of the party, the part that is, you know, voting against anything seen as the establishment, anything seen as the elites versus the more traditional conservative wing. And if you start to see primary challenges to sitting incumbent Republican senators, in otherwise safe states, then you start to get a dynamic like you saw, like many people think you saw in Alabama where the Republicans could potentially nominate someone who can't appeal to a broader electorate. And then you get a potentially safe red seat that becomes in play. Look, it's the same thing on the democratic side. I mean, they're still going to have a conversation about which direction their party goes and so both-- both parties are going to have to set that.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Dan, is that democratic conservation delayed, though, by Democrats thinking, \"Look, if we just run kind of against the President we take advantage of this enthusiasm from our base, let's postpone the question about what exactly the Democratic Party means because we got a chance to playoff of this.\" Or is there going to be a real conversation?\u00a0DAN BALZ: I think there will be partial conversation, but I think at this point for most Democrats the view is the-- the harder they can go after the President and tie their Republican opponent to the President, the better off they're going to do. And they will-- they will defer that conversation about who they are as a party for the 2020 democratic nomination battle. They may-- they may pay some price for that. I'm not-- I'm not understating how significant that challenge will be for them. But I think for the midterm, focusing on the President, I mean, one of the problems that Republican candidates potentially face is how much do they identify with President Trump in order to energize their base and the cost of that in a general election if they become so identified that people think, \"Well, it's just another Trumpian.\"\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Right, the challenge that Ed Gillespie favor ran into-- in the Virginia gubernatorial, right?\u00a0KAREN TUMULTY: And there's also, though, you're finding that a lot of these Republicans who are running for the Senate are not willing, for instance, to commit to voting for Mitch McConnell to continue as their leader as well. I mean, on the on hand, they don't want to be too, too close to-- to, you know, to-- to the establishment. On the other, they-- they don't want to offend the-- the base. So it's really-- it's-- it's really a delicate act for a lot of them.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Anthony, how much do you think it's a danger for Democrats to not have something to run or to just focus on-- on the President because obviously they focus on the President that-- that-- that encourages the Republican base to turn out.\u00a0ANTHONY SALVANTO: One of the things it was so interesting in 2016 whereas you mentioned the Democrats didn't win as many seats as some thought they might is that voters said Donald Trump was a different kind of Republican. He was kind of a brand unto himself. And they had a hard time tying the Republican Senate candidate to Donald Trump. The question to watch is whether or not they can do that now because so many people have seen the President as sort of different-- different brand all together.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: And the Washington Post, paper you're familiar with, wrote a piece about how the President's dying to get out there and campaign, but we know all Presidents love to get out back in campaign. It's so much more fun than what they have to do in Washington. But how does that work out, Dan? Is this going to be a situation where people think, go campaign somewhere else, Mister President? Or, you know, he just spends his time in those safe districts and-- how do you think that plays out, his active participation?\u00a0DAN BALZ: Well, we know that he loves to get out. And we know that those big rallies energize him and that-- that he loves to do that, and that-- you know, that he-- you know, he creates enthusiasm as well as receives the energy back from it. He's going to want to be out there a fair amount. I think it will be difficult for a lot of these candidates to embrace him too closely in some of these competitive races. And so I think individually all of those candidates are going to have to decide how close do I want the President to be. You know, Ed Gillespie talking about Virginia wanted to keep him somewhat at arm's length. It didn't-- it didn't matter in the end. He still got beat pretty badly.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Karen, how do you think the policy landscape is going to show up here? You know, are we going to have a bunch of fights that are going to be all about kind of value issues, cultural issues, the things that get voters excited or is there any way in which some policy might actually be a part of the conversation?\u00a0KAREN TUMULTY: Well, the big policy issue right now especially coming on the heels of the tax-- the tax bill is whether they are going to be brave enough to begin the real conversation on entitlements. That is an absolutely treacherous issue to-- to bring up in an election year, and Mitch McConnell in the Senate has already said it ain't happening here unless there's some democratic buy in, which there won't be.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Right. All right.\u00a0ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well--\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Go ahead quickly.\u00a0ANTHONY SALVANTO: Oh, I was going to say, remember, the Republicans rely on older voters very heavily. And so that does certainly put things into a different context.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Thanks all of you. And we'll be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: It's time now to take a look at perfect timing. We spoke earlier with bestselling author Daniel Pink, his new book is out in early January. It's called \"When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing.\"\u00a0You say this is not a how-to book but a when-to book. Tell people what that means.\u00a0DANIEL PINK (\"When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing\"): Well, we tend to think that timing is an art. We make our decisions about when to do things based on gut instincts and intuition. But timing is actually a science. Across multiple disciplines, there's a huge body of research showing us how to make systematically better evidence-based decisions about when to do things. And it turns out they have a material effect on our well being, on our productivity, on our performance, on our creativity, on our health, many, many domains of life.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: What I love is also the way in which it's not just, you know, are you a morning person or an evening person although you have a great explanation and description and-- and a little test on how you can figure out who you are in that group. But it's also when you choose to do certain kinds of thinking, like creative thinking versus-- explain that for folks.\u00a0DANIEL PINK: Absolutely. Well, what a whole range of scientists have found is that the day has a hidden pattern. It's basically a peak, a trough, and a rebound. Now most of us proceed through the day in that order. Peak, trough, rebound. And it turns out we're better off doing analytic work during the peak which for most of us is the morning. The trough is not good for anything. It's actually a danger zone in many ways. We're better off doing our administrative stuff during the trough. But then during the recovery, it turns out we're better at more creative tasks, tasks that require a little bit more looseness rather than that heads down, locked in approach.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: And is that-- that's when it flashes of insight come.\u00a0DANIEL PINK: Often. Because when we're at our peak, we're very vigilant. All right. We're-- we're able to keep up distraction, that's a feature when you're doing the analytic work. But when you're doing creative work, you actually want a little bit more looseness, you want let a few distractions in so to-- to mix up the soup a little bit. And so during the recovery period, which again for most of us is the late afternoon, early evening, we do better on what are called insight tasks.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Has human history fouled us up by which is to say, do we-- you know, we needed to create time.\u00a0DANIEL PINK: Yeah.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: And watches and hours so we--\u00a0DANIEL PINK: Yeah.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: --know when the bus arrives.\u00a0DANIEL PINK: Yeah.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: But did we figure out a system that's basically always fighting with our own natural rhythm?\u00a0DANIEL PINK: It's a really, really interesting question because, I mean, one of the things that-- what I discovered researching time itself is that a lot of things we think of as natural are completely human inventions designed to corral time. So an hour has no natural substance to it. A minute doesn't have any natural substance to it. Certainly a year does because the planet goes around, a day does because the planet spins on its axis. But beyond that we're always trying to corral time and it's very hard to do and time is a very illusive subject. And one of the thing that's happened is that, I think as a consequence, when we think about our own performance. We focus on what we're going to do. We focus on often how we're going to do it. We're focus on who we're going to do it with. But we put when questions over there at the kids' table saying that it's not that important. And the science is telling us that it's actually demonstrably important.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Right. So the thing you should put at the front. One of the things I love about the book is there's a lot of practical--\u00a0DANIEL PINK: Yeah.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: --news you can use.\u00a0DANIEL PINK: Absolutely.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: So give people a little sense of that, both in your-- in your day-to-day, but also, you know, you talk for example about mid life and the guidance that-- that-- so give us a sense of those how to--\u00a0DANIEL PINK: There-- there are all kinds of things. Number one is that, think about the science of breaks. Not too many years ago people who stayed up all night were kind of heroes in the workplace because they were tougher than the rest of us. Then the science of sleep began emerging, we said no, those-- those people are fools. I think the science of breaks is where the science of-- of sleep was a decade ago about to breaks through the surface is a really, really instructive about how we can work better. So, we need to take more breaks, period. And one of the best things that I've done myself is that every day I have a break list. I write down two breaks I'm going to take during the day. We also know from the science that breaks are better taken with other people rather than solo even for introverts like me. They're better taken fully detached, rather than semi detached that is, don't bring your phone. We're better off moving during our breaks than being stationary. We're also better off being near nature. And so what the science is telling us is that if we take these regular breaks, ten, fifteen minutes, we're going to feel better, we're going to perform higher. So make a break list, that's one of my favorite tips.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: And go outside while you're--\u00a0(Cross talk)\u00a0DANIEL PINK: If you can, if you can. But there's even evidence that-- that just looking at a window and seeing a tree is better than being in a windowless room.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Let me also ask you about teams because you--\u00a0DANIEL PINK: Yeah.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: How timing works when you're working with lots of other people as well.\u00a0DANIEL PINK: Yeah. Well, there's some really, really interesting research on how teams synchronize things like choirs, rowing teams, delivery services. And one of the things that is so interesting about our nature is that it seems that coordinating with other people, being in sync and in time with other people is something fundamentally human about that. And-- and we have a propensity for it. And one of the things that's so interesting about that, if you look at, let's take exercise as an example. Exercise is absolutely good for you, right? It makes you-- it boosts your mood, it's a prophylactic against depression, it reduces-- it helps controls your weight, it's all good. Well, there's kind of new exercise out there and it's choral singing of all things. Choral singing has benefits that are just extraordinary at the physiological level and the psychological level. It is useful for cancer patients, it improves your immune response, it boosts your mood, so there's something about synchronizing with other people that makes us feel good. It also helps-- when kids do synchronous activities, they actually afterwards are a little bit more, what social psychologists call pro-social, that is they will-- will play with kids who aren't like them, they're more likely to cooperate, they're more likely to help.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: So we all should join roving bands of walking singers?\u00a0DANIEL PINK: Well-- (INDISTINCT).\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah. Right. Exactly.\u00a0DANIEL PINK: Well, I mean, I think there's-- I think there's some good evidence for-- like-- like in schools, that choir-- choir choral groups, not only as kind of an ancillary activity but as something that actually boosts the moods of kids, improves their social and emotional learning and could conceivably make them better citizens of the school.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Daniel Pink, thanks so much for being with us.\u00a0DANIEL PINK: Thanks, John.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Daniel Pink's book is \"When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing.\" We'll be back in a moment.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: That's it for us today. Thanks for watching. We here at FACE THE NATION want to wish everyone watching a Merry Christmas, visions of sugar plums and a very happy holiday season. I'm John Dickerson.",

But will this Republican unity last into the New Year? We'll take a look at the political landscape heading into the 2018 midterms and in our annual CBS Correspondents' panel we'll reflect on this year and look ahead to next.\u00a0It's all coming up on FACE THE NATION.\u00a0Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I'm John Dickerson. On this Christmas Eve morning with all the newsmakers out of town we begin with a sixty-seven-year tradition, the annual CBS News Correspondent roundtable. Joining us this year, White House and senior foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan. Ed O'Keefe covers Capitol Hill and politics for the Washington Post and is a CBS News contributor. We've asked him to fill in or congressional correspondent Nancy Cordes, who we hope is enjoying her well-deserved break with her family. Chief White House correspondent Major Garrett. Justice and Homeland Security correspondent Jeff Pegues. And national security correspondent David Martin is also here. We begin with a portion of an interview Margaret did with Vice President Pence late last week on a surprise trip to Afghanistan. She talked to him about the accomplishments of the first year of the Trump administration and what's ahead for 2018.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0MIKE PENCE: First and foremost, this President has rolled back federal red tape in record numbers, unleashed American energy, appointed conservative jurists to our courts including Justice Neil Gorsuch. But to arrive at the end of the year, and thanks to President Trump's leadership to see the Congress of the United States come together, pass the largest tax cut in American history was deeply inspiring.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN (CBS News White House Correspondent/CBS News Senior Foreign Affairs Correspondent/@margbrennan): You see a toehold to get more done?\u00a0MIKE PENCE: As much as we've accomplished this year, rebuilding our military, unleashing the full potential of the American economy. And passing the largest tax cut in American history and-- and other-- and-- and other initiatives that this President has advanced, it's clear we're just getting started. And next year I think you're going to see this administering move on vigorously to an agenda, which will include infrastructure and welfare reform. The progress that we've made in the war against ISIS, where we've virtually crushed the ISIS, caliphate and taken back its-- its-- the capital of Raqqa, the fight here in Afghanistan, taking the fight directly to the enemy. The investment that we're making in our military, the growth and optimism in the American economy I think-- I think sets the stage for tremendous growth and opportunity in security and prosperity in 2018.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you explain to the American people how they should understand what just happened this month with Mike Flynn pleading guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador, which the President said he lied not only to you about but to the FBI and that's why the President fired him.\u00a0MIKE PENCE: We'll let the special counsel and-- and others do their job. We're going to cooperate but we're going to stay very focused on the job the American people elected us to do.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you just clarify how you understand what happened with Mike Flynn who we'd known had lied to you? Did you know he had lied to the FBI?\u00a0MIKE PENCE: Well, I--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The President said that's what made him fire him.\u00a0MIKE PENCE: I stand by everything I've said with regard to that individual and every other aspect of this. But--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But when he was fired, did you know he lied to the FBI?\u00a0MIKE PENCE: What I can tell you is I knew that he lied to me. And-- and I know the President made the right decision, with regard to him.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Margaret, so the Vice President is a fan of the job his boss is doing. Let me ask you about that trip, though. It was supposed to be part of a larger trip that the Vice President was supposed to take. That part was cancelled.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it was interesting because that-- that trip has been postponed until January. It was supposed to be to Jerusalem and also to Egypt, part of what had initially been planned to sort of a, look, I delivered on this promise to eventually move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and then it became a bit more of a trying to soften the blow that was very much dealt to all of the Arab world and the Palestinians. But as more and more cancelled their planned meetings with the Vice President, that's made that trip tougher, but this-- this bond that was dropped in many ways with this decision on Jerusalem. The administration would say, we didn't see the blowback on the security side, the risks and the threats that some had predicted, but you have to understand that symbolically the decision on Jerusalem will continue to be a sticking point for the Arab world. It may not be the breaking point, because they have broader concerns with Iran right now but it is certainly something that the administration's not going to quickly move beyond.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Major, we heard the Vice President's assessment of the year. Give us your assessment?\u00a0MAJOR GARRETT (CBS News Chief White House Correspondent/@MajorCBS): I think it was very revealing in the last week of this year effectively in Washington that the person who had the year-end wrap up press conference was not Donald Trump, was not Speaker Paul Ryan, it was Mitch McConnell. And if you're going to look at the person singularly most responsible for accomplishments on the domestic side for the Trump agenda, it's not Donald Trump, it's Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader who held with the exception of one issue--health care--Republicans together on every single aspect of what the President tried to accomplish. Tax cuts were passed because McConnell held his conference together. All of the twelve circuit judges, nominated and confirmed, a record for any first year of any American presidency because Mitch McConnell held his conference together. And he got forty-nine votes on health care, closer than anyone probably could have under those similar circumstances. So Mitch McConnell put the bow on this year and quite properly so. The President signs, but without McConnell who for the very first time this last week the President actually praised on Twitter because it has finally gotten through to him through many people inside and outside the White House, Mister President, forget what Steve Bannon says, you can't get anything without Mitch McConnell.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Ed, staying with Congress, you heard Mike Pence talk about him-- about infrastructure, you heard him talk about welfare reform, given what Major has laid out, but also the fact that you got a Democratic Party that doesn't want to help out this President, what-- what do you think Congress is going to look like?\u00a0ED O'KEEFE (CBS News Contributor/Washington Post/@edatpost): More likely of those two is infrastructure for sure. It was quite revealing how very quickly this week Paul Ryan tried to pivot to entitlement reform and very quickly Mitch McConnell and Republican Senators said, no, no way. Because remember the math. Fifty-one to forty-nine is new math starting January 3rd. Doug Jones comes to the Senate as a Democrat from Alabama--\u00a0MAJOR GARRETT: Courtesy of Steve Bannon.\u00a0ED O'KEEFE: Courtesy of Steve Bannon exactly, and cooperation is required. And the only thing that most Senators rights now believe could start the year off in a-- in a good way is working on some kind of plan to fund big construction projects basically in this country. The question of course as it always is seems to be, how will you pay for? And that given that you've just slashed tax cuts, Republicans will probably turn around and suggest that entitlement reform is the way to do that in some respects but a lot of those Republican Senators and a fair number of congressional House members who are from suburban swing districts were going after Medicare, Medicaid, social security, is an unpopular thing to do in an election year are-- are going to resist it.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: David, the vice president said ISIS is decimated. The caliphate is gone. Is that accurate? And if so, why has it been-- why has this come to pass?\u00a0DAVID MARTIN (CBS News National Security Correspondent): I think it's accurate to say that the caliphate as it existed in Iraq and Syria is crushed. They used to control all of northern Syria, northern Iraq, western Iraq, they're now down to a few pieces of territory along the u-- Euphrates River in-- in Syria. And I think the trump administration deserves some credit for that. The weight of American airstrikes and the capabilities of American Special Operations Forces would sooner or later crush the ISIS caliphate no matter who was in the White House. But the way that General Mattis, the Secretary of Defense went about it, was to give his commanders more authorities to make decisions in the field. So when they saw a target of opportunity, they didn't have to come all the way back through the chain of command to the White House to get approval. They just did it. And now, the ISIS that once existed is almost dead. But as Secretary Mattis says over and over, they're not-- they're not defeated. ISIS, the caliphate is going to become ISIS the movement. And its followers, we-- we already see them in-- in Afghanistan, Somalia, Yemen, name almost any country in-- in North Africa. These aren't fighters who for the most part escaped from Iraq and Syria, these are just angry young men looking for a cause to serve.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Jeff, the vice president talked about Michael Flynn. Michael Flynn is at the heart of both the relationship with the Russians among Trump advisors but then also the obstruction question about whether the President told the FBI director to go easy on the Flynn investigation. Where are we at the end of the year with this cluster of investigations?\u00a0JEFF PEGUES (CBS News Justice & Homeland Security Correspondent/@jeffpeguesCBS): Well, they're-- they're ongoing. And the questions I know the White House is interested in this went will it all wrap up and it-- it doesn't seem like there is an end in sight right now. I mean you have Mike Flynn who was given this plea deal. He is a figure that straddles, you know, the transition, the campaign and the first few weeks of the White House. So if he's cooperating with the investigators, you get a clearer sense of what the investigators may be looking at. At least according to some of the people that I know who have worked with Mueller in the past, they know how he builds his cases. He tries to get some cooperating witnesses which he-- he has now with Flynn and Papadopoulos, the foreign policy advisor who also took a plea deal. So, you wrap up these witnesses, but you don't tip your hand according to these people who work with Mueller to what the main charges are going to be at the end. So that's the question--when will this end and what are investigators trying to get out of Mike Flynn?\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Well we're going to take a short break now, but we'll be back in a minute with more from our panel.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: And we're back with our panel. Major, I want to start with you. There have been a lot of management changes at the White House.\u00a0MAJOR GARRETT: Yeah.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Where are we at the end of the year on that?\u00a0MAJOR GARRETT: John Kelly has brought order and discipline and functionality to not only the way decisions are brought to the President but who is allowed to bring them to the President. And they go through John Kelly. But that doesn't change the fundamental truth about the Trump approach to the presidency. And I've been trying to think of a metaphor. So you go to a rock concert to-- it's Make America Great, again rock concert. There are two songs Forgotten Americans and America First and fifteen solos. Fifteen solos by the same soloist on different instruments. That soloist is Donald Trump, okay. When he says in interviews, I'm the only one that matters, he fundamentally means that. And everything about this administration pivots off of that truth. He is the central actor, the central soloist in everything. And imagine yourself at this rock concert and you hear fifteen solos. You're probably going to be a little tired by the end of the show, because you get the soloist and very little else. If you talk to cabinet secretaries, which I have the luxury of doing it sometime, they're like we're doing all this things but it's hard to sort of get people aware of it because the soloist is on the flute then he's on the drums then he's on the electric guitar then he's on every other instrument and that is both the kind of reality draw of the Trump presidency, the management reality and the exhausting reality.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Right. By the time he gets to the glockenspiel, it's really-- Margaret, I want to just pivot right from that to the question of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Give us the sense of that powerful job, is Rex Tillerson going to stay in and what's his legacy?\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Major is right, there's only one star in this show and everyone in that administration is keenly aware of it. In the past few weeks in particular you've seen Secretary Tillerson be a bit more assertive, particularly you see this in this newly assertive position perhaps in Ukraine, to open up this idea that we could express more support and actually provide lethal weaponry to the Ukrainians, which is a shot across the bow at Russia which you've heard Tillerson say, time and again this is the one issue of Ukraine where we can't get past this to broker that broader deal with Russia. So I think you will continue to see him quietly move on that front along with more sanctions on Russia, along with more assertive position and also be more outspoken in the New Year, but he clearly doesn't want to try to compete with the star in this show on the main stage.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: All right. We're going to see how long we can extend this metaphor. David, let me ask you about North Korea. Where does that stand at the end of this year?\u00a0DAVID MARTIN: Three hundred and sixty-five days further down the road of a collision course. The U.S. is making a demand of North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program, the North Korea is not going to accept. North Korea is developing a weapon, an intercontinental ballistic missile as the Trump administration says it cannot accept. Something's got to give and it's probably going to take some major decisions by somebody in the year 2018 to get us off this-- this collision course.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Jeff, what's the state of Homeland Security at the end of this year?\u00a0JEFF PEGUES:\u00a0 Well, the-- the main focus, John, right now is on these lone wolf actors. You know, law enforcement doesn't like to call them lone wolves because they feel it glorifies the act. But these are people that are harder to spot because they are sitting in a basement somewhere being radicalized online, and with the array of information available online they can be radicalized within weeks and then carry out an attack. The FBI does about a thousand investigations, ISIS related in the U.S. and really that's been the consistent number over the last couple of years. But spotting these people is so difficult because they blend in, you-- you don't really have a history of law enforcement with them. And so trying to wrap them up and get them arrested is a problem for law enforcement. And it's something that will continue into 2018.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Ed, I want to end this round by talking about Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, their relationship with the President now. It was a rocky year. Is everybody on the same team now or are things coming in 2018 that you think will create more potential conflict?\u00a0ED O'KEEFE: Well, this is by far their-- their best week. And I think you saw that in-- in their public praise of each other, the body language, and fact that they all understood this was a significant win not only for them but for the Republican Party and its existence. But I think you're going to see some more disagreements about what to do next year, both officially and politically. There are competing priorities obviously in the House and the Senate. McConnell doesn't really want to rock the boat. I think Ryan is eager to-- to try to take another step in terms of looking at sort of domestic policy and-- and what could possibly be reshaped in a more conservative image. Both of them struggle every day with the fact that the President does not grasp, care about or really, you know, talk to anyone about details of this stuff.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Major, I want to ask you about the underreported story from the year. What would you put in that category?\u00a0MAJOR GARRETT: I'd say one overseas and one at home. Overseas, it's this relationship with Saudi Arabia. When I covered the Trump campaign, I did not imagine the very first stop he would make overseas would be Riyadh, considering his orientation to the Muslim world in general and the possible restoration in the words of the Saudi kingdom about Islam and taking on terrorism in a way that it didn't before could be a potential far-reaching story. At home, I would say its energy. This administration has a twentieth century point of view on energy, extraction, and exploitation. It does not have an embracive renewable or twenty-first century energy concepts the Obama administration does that will radically change where we drill, where we don't drill, and the environmental implications of that.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Margaret, what's your-- your candidate for under covered story?\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: One thing I would highlight is what we're seeing in terms of the lost generation, this refugee crisis that was so focused on Syria has now continued, worsened, become a health epidemic whether you're talking about conflict in Yemen, outbreak of cholera, hitting thousands, whether you're looking at the Democratic Republic of the Congo where UNICEF is predicting four hundred thousand children under the age of five could die because of these health risks, because of refugee crisis issues of displacement and starvation. So, whether its Syria, Africa, you know, throughout the Middle East, these issues, the United States isn't talking about as much, isn't leading on, and is really only articulating in purely a homeland security point of view. But these things have consequences in years to come in terms of radicalization, in terms of risks, and in terms of simply health risk.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: David, what's been under covered story?\u00a0DAVID MARTIN: Well, you heard the Vice President Pence say we are rebuilding our military. Not so much. There's a big new defense spending bill, but it's just a wish list until you get a-- a deal in Congress. And so the fact is that the Pentagon along with the rest of the governors is going to continue to operate on these continuing resolutions, which keeps you going along the same path. And the-- the heads of all of the services just say that their readiness is-- is falling apart. And when you listen to the-- the details of what an aircraft carrier has to go through these days to get underway, when we saw those three carriers operating off the Korean Peninsula awhile back, the machination that it took to get one of those carriers, the Teddy Roosevelt underway, I mean, they were stealing planes from all over the United States stealing parts just so that they have air wing to go on there. The secretary of the Air Force says that when she saw on her first briefing on the new readiness rates when she came into office, she said, \"There must be some mistake. This has got to be wrong.\" And, of course, it wasn't wrong. And nobody should conclude from that that we're about to be inferior to anybody. We're still number one. But as secretary of the Air Force said these decreased readiness rates don't mean we're not going, but it does mean fewer are going to come back.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Ed, your candidate for this.\u00a0ED O'KEEFE: Two quick ones. First off, let's remember, there was an assassination attempt on a top House Republican this year. And this was the most threatening year for lawmakers in history. There were at least one thousand six hundred fifty threats against lawmakers as of late July. I couldn't get updated stats in time for this, but it's safe to surmise it was at least doubled last year. The other, there's an internal displacement crisis in this country. At least two hundred thirty thousand people have left Puerto Rico since Hurricane Maria. They are in Florida, Georgia, Texas, North Carolina, New York. They're going to reshape the politics of those states. But there's an island that needs to be rebuilt and the United States didn't do it this year.\u00a0JEFF PEGUES: I would agree. I think, you know, Puerto Rico is just-- what has-- what has happened there and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the lack of focus on those issues there is big. That's not exactly my beat, but it's-- it's something that I'm interested in. But also if you look at overseas, European officials were saying that they're not getting the outflow of ISIS fighters back in Europe that they were anticipating. I talked to top counterterrorism officials here in the U.S. who agreed with that.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Prediction time. Jeff, I'm going to start with you. What are you going to predict in 2018?\u00a0JEFF PEGUES: Well, you might recall that last year I predicted that James Comey was going to stick around. Maybe--\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: You're a humble and honest man.\u00a0JEFF PEGUES: Maybe you can give me a break on that one. Well, I mean, who knew what would happen? So this year, I won't be as bold, but I will say that I think the Mueller investigation is going to, one way or another, give members of Congress a big decision in 2018. I think it's going to-- it-- it will end up in their lap.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: David, what's your prediction?\u00a0DAVID MARTIN: Well, as long as we're confessing. Last year, I predicted that President Trump and Kim Jong-un would have a face-to-face meeting. I was brilliant, but dead wrong. So, I'm not going to touch North Korea. I'm going to predict that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS will meet his end in 2018.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Ed.\u00a0ED O'KEEFE: One of the big four congressional leaders, Nancy Pelosi, Paul Ryan, Chuck Schumer, and Mitch McConnell will either be gone or on their way out of their position by this time next year.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Major.\u00a0MAJOR GARRETT: The President is going to have to come to terms with what the resistance means. You talk to Ed Gillespie, who ran in Virginia, got more votes than any-- anyone ever run for governor in Virginia, but lost by nine points.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Mm-Hm.\u00a0MAJOR GARRETT: So the victor got even more, says \"I met the resistance and it's real.\" In the mid-term elections, everything that's on the agenda will have to require democratic votes. And that's going to mean larger compromises than this President has shown any inclination to achieve. So, 2018 for this White House and this President if it has any accomplishments at all will have to be through and over or around the resistance. And that will be a fascinating story.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson does not resign in January as had been predicted and asked many, many times. He'll stick around. I think he will be engaging more and more assertive, as I said. But I think one of the areas that is going to really take up a lot of his time is trying to save whatever chance of diplomacy there maybe with North Korea, but we may see also more immediate crisis with Iran.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Thank you, Margaret.\u00a0And I want to thank everybody on our panel today for today, but also for all the work you do for CBS and for FACE THE NATION--your reporting, your insights, and your curiosity about the news and what's going on in Washington and around the world, help us inform and make sense of what's been a very unusual year. And we'll be back in a moment.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: If you can't watch the entire show live, the full hour of FACE THE NATION is rebroadcast every Sunday at 11:00 AM and 6:00 PM Eastern Time on our digital streaming network CBSN. Available through our website, the CBS News app or your favorite TV device.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: And we'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.\u00a0The big political question for 2018 is whether Republicans will build on their single-party control of Congress or whether Democrats will flip control of the Senate, the House or both. For a look at where things stand as we move into 2018, we turn to Dan Balz who is the chief correspondent at the Washington Post. His colleague, Karen Tumulty, is the national political correspondent. And our own Anthony Salvanto is the CBS News director of elections. All right. First, we're going to get to the House and the Senate and break those down. But I want to just start with the very broad question for all three of you. Dan, I'll start with you. What is the landscape look like here at the end of 2017 for next year's elections?\u00a0DAN BALZ (Washington Post/@danbalz): Everything we see at this point, John, is-- is a very, very difficult landscape for the Republicans, almost every measure or every event that has happened so far this year politically has been bad for the Republicans and good for the Democrats. You can look at it in terms of the President's approval rating, which is historically low for a first-term President. You can look at it in the nature of the current preference for how the House should break. The Democrats have a significant advantage on that, at this point. And we know that from the recent elections through the enthusiasm is much greater or appears to be much greater among Democrats than Republicans to turn out and that's often the key indicator in mid-term elections.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Karen. Yes.\u00a0KAREN TUMULTY (Washington Post/@ktumulty): It's true. Mid-term elections, especially in a president's first term are almost never good news for the President. In fact, only twice since 1934 has the President's party picked up seats in the first mid-term of his first term in office. But it really does seem like the Republicans are, in fact, heading into some-- some really tough weather here. And it's true, the generic ballot, this-- you know, would you rather see a Democrat or a Republican in office. The Democrats are ahead in that by double digits, but I-- I agree. I think this enthusiasm gap is really the biggest thing the Republicans ought to be worried about right now.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: I want to get at the roots of that enthusiasm where it comes from. But, Anthony, where do you put the needle down on the record here?\u00a0ANTHONY SALVANTO (CBS News Elections Director/@SalvantoCBS): Well, let me tamper that a little bit. The math is still a little bit in the advantage of the Republicans, at least on the Senate side. And the reason for that is that the-- the Democrats are defending more seats and any time that happens, you have a harder hill to climb. And, look, on the House side, it's true that we see a national polling that more people are now saying that they'd like to see the Democrats in control. But remember that those polls are talking to people in very heavy democratic districts as well as heavy Republican ones. And so that generic ballot can sort of overstate the case, right? Which you really want to focus on is how many specific House seats could be competitive. And on that side, there may be just enough for the Democrats to put the House in play. The real question going forward is, can they expand that math, can they make more seats than we wouldn't ordinarily think are in play, sort of come into view.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: On that generic ballot, though, isn't it the case, this-- this question of would you vote for Republican or Democrat even though it's an imprecise number when it's that big, when people are favoring the Democrats that much, isn't that sort of, well, a blunt indicator when the number is that big? It still does tell you something, though, doesn't it?\u00a0ANTHONY SALVANTO: Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. It gives you a general sense of the direction. And there's no question that that direction is pointing towards Democrats. It-- it's maybe about half as many. So if you see a national ballot, you know, national generic ballot, you say, \"Well, they might win maybe half that much in the-- in the actual elections.\" But there again, the interesting is going to be where they can start to try to persuade people. And as you look around the country, a lot of these suburban districts, a lot of wealthier districts that had gone Republican, Republican on economic issues particularly are places that they're targeting. And if they can start to put those in play, then we start to see a really competitive House-- House election.\u00a0KAREN TUMULTY: I think the first place to look will be there are twenty-three House districts and the Democrats have to pick up twenty-four. There are twenty-three House districts where there is a Republican incumbent sitting in a district that was won by Hillary Clinton. And-- and these districts are all over the country. They're in California, Texas, Florida. And they-- there are big range. A lot of them were suburban, but a lot of them are rural and a lot of them have large numbers of Hispanics.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah.\u00a0DAN BALZ: John, there's one other element in terms of the-- the tempering of where we are. We have a-- we have a odd situation, which is a President with very low approval ratings at a time when you have historically over the last seventeen years, the lowest unemployment rate, a stock market that is the President says constantly is breaking records weekly and steady economic growth. So for the Republicans if they can, in one way or another, force people to think about the state of the economy rather than their view of the President, they-- they could hope to do better than a lot of this polling suggests at this point. History says that-- well, there have been two other times in the last half century, where you've had this anomaly of low presidential approval and low unemployment. In both those cases, the presidential approval turned out to be the more significant and the party in power lost a lot of seats.\u00a0ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yeah. In the last three midterms, most people have said that the midterm vote is about the President. So there's no question that he's a factor and there's no question that approval rating looked like it (INDISTINCT).\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: And that's where the enthusiasm you're talking about, Karen, comes from. Explain that for people a little bit about. It's linked to the President, right?\u00a0KAREN TUMULTY: And-- and what-- what pollsters ask voters is, you know, how excited are you about this election? How-- they-- they look for other measures of-- of how engaged people are with the fact that there even is an election this year. And just this week, the Wall Street Journal, Peter Hart, their pollster, found a ten-point enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans.\u00a0ANTHONY SALVANTO: You know, that's really important, too. Because remember, in midterms, turnout is lower. And the folks who tend to vote are a little disproportionately older and often disproportionately Republican, at least recently. What the Democrats have taken out of these last couple of elections, Virginia and Alabama, is that they can motivate their base. That people who don't ordinarily come out except for in presidential years have been willing to come out. And if they can do that, then that changes the dynamic because there are folks sitting in these districts who normally sit out midterms, where turnout goes under forty percent a lot of times, they reshape that and the whole electorate changes.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Dan, let me ask you about the Senate. Karen sketched out the situation in the House. In the Senate, after Doug Jones of Alabama is seated as the Democrat next year after that exciting race this year, there will be a two-seat majority for Republicans. That means the Democrats need to just pick up two seats to gain control of the Senate. Now ten Democrats are up for re-election in states Donald Trump won. And in recent history, states have tended to vote for senator the way they have for Presidents, so that's one factor there. There's only one Republican running in a state where Hillary Clinton won. That's in Nevada, Dean Heller. And then there are some other interesting states, Nevada-- sorry, Tennessee and then Minnesota are-- are on and those are-- so where do you see the Senate shaking out?\u00a0DAN BALZ: Well, I'd-- I'd make two points. First of all, if we were having this conversation a year ago we would be talking about the likelihood of potentially significant losses for the Democrats in the Senate because as you say they're defending so many seats and they're defending them in states that Trump won. Now, of those ten that Trump won, five are truly red, and five are what I would call more swing states.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah.\u00a0DAN BALZ: But what's happened over the course of the year is because of the turbulence that the Republicans have run into. There is now at least the possibility of Democrats being able to take control of the Senate. I think it's still very, very difficult. But they have three opportunities--Arizona, Nevada and possibly Tennessee because they have a candidate there, the former democratic governor who may be the only Democrat who could win state-wide. But I'm-- I'm not predicting at this point that he will. And-- and many of their incumbents are in reasonably good shape or better shape than you might have thought six or eight or ten months ago. I think it's still a heavy lift for the Democrats to take over, but they at least have an opportunity which they wouldn't have dreamed of at the beginning of the Trump presidency.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Karen, when Dan talks about some of those Senate seats being in kind of more swingy areas than-- so you've got the class of seats that are up where Democrats are trying to defend territory in West Virginia where--\u00a0KAREN TUMULTY: Right.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: --I think Trump won by forty-five points. Then others are in Michigan, Wisconsin, which were-- which were closer. So how do you think-- is that the distinction, another one we should be watching for those Rust Belt states that flipped and went for Trump in the-- in the presidential where people were surprised? How do you think that will play out in the Senate elections?\u00a0KAREN TUMULTY: Well, as it turns out I spent some time this week in Michigan and actually looking at the governors' race there. What I found is that Democrats act-- sort of activist base, the kind of people who are engaged now, are so traumatized by seeing what they thought were going to be easy wins for Hillary Clinton last time around that-- that also contributes to the-- the enthusiasm factor. They-- they were caught napping in 2016. And there is a determination, I think, not to have that happen again.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: And, Anthony, we have-- another thing we should talk about with respect to the Senate is there are primaries to come. We saw in Alabama some extraordinary inter-party Republican fighting, comments, people even saying they were no longer Republicans after the Republican National Committee supported Roy Moore. How do you think the primary process plays out in terms of-- well, just how do you think it plays out?\u00a0ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yeah, definitely the thing to watch this spring. We could be sitting here a year from now and the landscape will be very different because, look, behind all of this is which direction does each party go, right? And the Republicans are still having that conversation. We talked a lot about the sort of more populist wing of the party, the part that is, you know, voting against anything seen as the establishment, anything seen as the elites versus the more traditional conservative wing. And if you start to see primary challenges to sitting incumbent Republican senators, in otherwise safe states, then you start to get a dynamic like you saw, like many people think you saw in Alabama where the Republicans could potentially nominate someone who can't appeal to a broader electorate. And then you get a potentially safe red seat that becomes in play. Look, it's the same thing on the democratic side. I mean, they're still going to have a conversation about which direction their party goes and so both-- both parties are going to have to set that.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Dan, is that democratic conservation delayed, though, by Democrats thinking, \"Look, if we just run kind of against the President we take advantage of this enthusiasm from our base, let's postpone the question about what exactly the Democratic Party means because we got a chance to playoff of this.\" Or is there going to be a real conversation?\u00a0DAN BALZ: I think there will be partial conversation, but I think at this point for most Democrats the view is the-- the harder they can go after the President and tie their Republican opponent to the President, the better off they're going to do. And they will-- they will defer that conversation about who they are as a party for the 2020 democratic nomination battle. They may-- they may pay some price for that. I'm not-- I'm not understating how significant that challenge will be for them. But I think for the midterm, focusing on the President, I mean, one of the problems that Republican candidates potentially face is how much do they identify with President Trump in order to energize their base and the cost of that in a general election if they become so identified that people think, \"Well, it's just another Trumpian.\"\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Right, the challenge that Ed Gillespie favor ran into-- in the Virginia gubernatorial, right?\u00a0KAREN TUMULTY: And there's also, though, you're finding that a lot of these Republicans who are running for the Senate are not willing, for instance, to commit to voting for Mitch McConnell to continue as their leader as well. I mean, on the on hand, they don't want to be too, too close to-- to, you know, to-- to the establishment. On the other, they-- they don't want to offend the-- the base. So it's really-- it's-- it's really a delicate act for a lot of them.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Anthony, how much do you think it's a danger for Democrats to not have something to run or to just focus on-- on the President because obviously they focus on the President that-- that-- that encourages the Republican base to turn out.\u00a0ANTHONY SALVANTO: One of the things it was so interesting in 2016 whereas you mentioned the Democrats didn't win as many seats as some thought they might is that voters said Donald Trump was a different kind of Republican. He was kind of a brand unto himself. And they had a hard time tying the Republican Senate candidate to Donald Trump. The question to watch is whether or not they can do that now because so many people have seen the President as sort of different-- different brand all together.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: And the Washington Post, paper you're familiar with, wrote a piece about how the President's dying to get out there and campaign, but we know all Presidents love to get out back in campaign. It's so much more fun than what they have to do in Washington. But how does that work out, Dan? Is this going to be a situation where people think, go campaign somewhere else, Mister President? Or, you know, he just spends his time in those safe districts and-- how do you think that plays out, his active participation?\u00a0DAN BALZ: Well, we know that he loves to get out. And we know that those big rallies energize him and that-- that he loves to do that, and that-- you know, that he-- you know, he creates enthusiasm as well as receives the energy back from it. He's going to want to be out there a fair amount. I think it will be difficult for a lot of these candidates to embrace him too closely in some of these competitive races. And so I think individually all of those candidates are going to have to decide how close do I want the President to be. You know, Ed Gillespie talking about Virginia wanted to keep him somewhat at arm's length. It didn't-- it didn't matter in the end. He still got beat pretty badly.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Karen, how do you think the policy landscape is going to show up here? You know, are we going to have a bunch of fights that are going to be all about kind of value issues, cultural issues, the things that get voters excited or is there any way in which some policy might actually be a part of the conversation?\u00a0KAREN TUMULTY: Well, the big policy issue right now especially coming on the heels of the tax-- the tax bill is whether they are going to be brave enough to begin the real conversation on entitlements. That is an absolutely treacherous issue to-- to bring up in an election year, and Mitch McConnell in the Senate has already said it ain't happening here unless there's some democratic buy in, which there won't be.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Right. All right.\u00a0ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well--\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Go ahead quickly.\u00a0ANTHONY SALVANTO: Oh, I was going to say, remember, the Republicans rely on older voters very heavily. And so that does certainly put things into a different context.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Thanks all of you. And we'll be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: It's time now to take a look at perfect timing. We spoke earlier with bestselling author Daniel Pink, his new book is out in early January. It's called \"When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing.\"\u00a0You say this is not a how-to book but a when-to book. Tell people what that means.\u00a0DANIEL PINK (\"When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing\"): Well, we tend to think that timing is an art. We make our decisions about when to do things based on gut instincts and intuition. But timing is actually a science. Across multiple disciplines, there's a huge body of research showing us how to make systematically better evidence-based decisions about when to do things. And it turns out they have a material effect on our well being, on our productivity, on our performance, on our creativity, on our health, many, many domains of life.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: What I love is also the way in which it's not just, you know, are you a morning person or an evening person although you have a great explanation and description and-- and a little test on how you can figure out who you are in that group. But it's also when you choose to do certain kinds of thinking, like creative thinking versus-- explain that for folks.\u00a0DANIEL PINK: Absolutely. Well, what a whole range of scientists have found is that the day has a hidden pattern. It's basically a peak, a trough, and a rebound. Now most of us proceed through the day in that order. Peak, trough, rebound. And it turns out we're better off doing analytic work during the peak which for most of us is the morning. The trough is not good for anything. It's actually a danger zone in many ways. We're better off doing our administrative stuff during the trough. But then during the recovery, it turns out we're better at more creative tasks, tasks that require a little bit more looseness rather than that heads down, locked in approach.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: And is that-- that's when it flashes of insight come.\u00a0DANIEL PINK: Often. Because when we're at our peak, we're very vigilant. All right. We're-- we're able to keep up distraction, that's a feature when you're doing the analytic work. But when you're doing creative work, you actually want a little bit more looseness, you want let a few distractions in so to-- to mix up the soup a little bit. And so during the recovery period, which again for most of us is the late afternoon, early evening, we do better on what are called insight tasks.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Has human history fouled us up by which is to say, do we-- you know, we needed to create time.\u00a0DANIEL PINK: Yeah.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: And watches and hours so we--\u00a0DANIEL PINK: Yeah.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: --know when the bus arrives.\u00a0DANIEL PINK: Yeah.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: But did we figure out a system that's basically always fighting with our own natural rhythm?\u00a0DANIEL PINK: It's a really, really interesting question because, I mean, one of the things that-- what I discovered researching time itself is that a lot of things we think of as natural are completely human inventions designed to corral time. So an hour has no natural substance to it. A minute doesn't have any natural substance to it. Certainly a year does because the planet goes around, a day does because the planet spins on its axis. But beyond that we're always trying to corral time and it's very hard to do and time is a very illusive subject. And one of the thing that's happened is that, I think as a consequence, when we think about our own performance. We focus on what we're going to do. We focus on often how we're going to do it. We're focus on who we're going to do it with. But we put when questions over there at the kids' table saying that it's not that important. And the science is telling us that it's actually demonstrably important.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Right. So the thing you should put at the front. One of the things I love about the book is there's a lot of practical--\u00a0DANIEL PINK: Yeah.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: --news you can use.\u00a0DANIEL PINK: Absolutely.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: So give people a little sense of that, both in your-- in your day-to-day, but also, you know, you talk for example about mid life and the guidance that-- that-- so give us a sense of those how to--\u00a0DANIEL PINK: There-- there are all kinds of things. Number one is that, think about the science of breaks. Not too many years ago people who stayed up all night were kind of heroes in the workplace because they were tougher than the rest of us. Then the science of sleep began emerging, we said no, those-- those people are fools. I think the science of breaks is where the science of-- of sleep was a decade ago about to breaks through the surface is a really, really instructive about how we can work better. So, we need to take more breaks, period. And one of the best things that I've done myself is that every day I have a break list. I write down two breaks I'm going to take during the day. We also know from the science that breaks are better taken with other people rather than solo even for introverts like me. They're better taken fully detached, rather than semi detached that is, don't bring your phone. We're better off moving during our breaks than being stationary. We're also better off being near nature. And so what the science is telling us is that if we take these regular breaks, ten, fifteen minutes, we're going to feel better, we're going to perform higher. So make a break list, that's one of my favorite tips.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: And go outside while you're--\u00a0(Cross talk)\u00a0DANIEL PINK: If you can, if you can. But there's even evidence that-- that just looking at a window and seeing a tree is better than being in a windowless room.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Let me also ask you about teams because you--\u00a0DANIEL PINK: Yeah.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: How timing works when you're working with lots of other people as well.\u00a0DANIEL PINK: Yeah. Well, there's some really, really interesting research on how teams synchronize things like choirs, rowing teams, delivery services. And one of the things that is so interesting about our nature is that it seems that coordinating with other people, being in sync and in time with other people is something fundamentally human about that. And-- and we have a propensity for it. And one of the things that's so interesting about that, if you look at, let's take exercise as an example. Exercise is absolutely good for you, right? It makes you-- it boosts your mood, it's a prophylactic against depression, it reduces-- it helps controls your weight, it's all good. Well, there's kind of new exercise out there and it's choral singing of all things. Choral singing has benefits that are just extraordinary at the physiological level and the psychological level. It is useful for cancer patients, it improves your immune response, it boosts your mood, so there's something about synchronizing with other people that makes us feel good. It also helps-- when kids do synchronous activities, they actually afterwards are a little bit more, what social psychologists call pro-social, that is they will-- will play with kids who aren't like them, they're more likely to cooperate, they're more likely to help.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: So we all should join roving bands of walking singers?\u00a0DANIEL PINK: Well-- (INDISTINCT).\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah. Right. Exactly.\u00a0DANIEL PINK: Well, I mean, I think there's-- I think there's some good evidence for-- like-- like in schools, that choir-- choir choral groups, not only as kind of an ancillary activity but as something that actually boosts the moods of kids, improves their social and emotional learning and could conceivably make them better citizens of the school.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Daniel Pink, thanks so much for being with us.\u00a0DANIEL PINK: Thanks, John.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Daniel Pink's book is \"When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing.\" We'll be back in a moment.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: That's it for us today. Thanks for watching. We here at FACE THE NATION want to wish everyone watching a Merry Christmas, visions of sugar plums and a very happy holiday season. I'm John Dickerson. ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***",

            "article_content": "Looking back at 50 years of 60 Minutes, it's worth noting that the longest running broadcast in prime time television history was created by a man with a notoriously short attention span. Don Hewitt was bored by hour-long documentaries and thought any story worth telling could be done in ten or 15 minutes. So he dreamed up this broadcast: three different segments, a little something for everyone. A half a century later, we're here to celebrate Don's very big -- and very successful idea. We'll be profiling 60 Minutes itself: inside stories about its history and its greatest moments. From the archives, we'll have some outtakes and backstage footage you've never seen before. And interviews we've done over the years with the 60 Minutes pioneers who are gone now, but whose stamp on the broadcast is still on display, every Sunday night. The formula for a good 60 Minutes story: keep it timely, keep it relevant and never be dull.\u00a0 Some examples, from this 50th season. Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. We surveyed the damage with the island's governor, Ricardo Rossello. Steve Kroft: There was no safe haven. Ricardo Rossello: There was no safe haven. Just a few weeks earlier, it had been Houston's turn. Scott Pelley found widespread dismay that the city's flood control system was no match for Hurricane Harvey. Cynthia Nealy: It's gonna rain, we're gonna have hurricanes and tropical storms, so by golly, do something to protect your people from it. Also this year: an old warrior's last stand. Lesley Stahl with John McCain. Lesley Stahl: I had to ask him about cancer, he didn't want to go there and I was pushing him there. \u00a0 John McCain: I have feelings sometimes of fear of what happens. But as soon as I get that, I say wait a minute. You've been around a long time old man. You've had a great life. \u00a0 Bill Whitaker's recent story with producer Ira Rosen about the opioid crisis got Washington's attention. \u00a0 Joe Rannazzisi: This is an industry that's out of control. \u00a0If they don't follow the law in drug supply, people die. \u00a0 Joe Rannazzisi once ran the DEA's war on the illicit sale of prescription drugs. A war undermined - on Capitol Hill. An investigation by 60 Minutes and the Washington Post found that under heavy lobbying by the drug industry, lawmakers quietly passed a bill last year making it more difficult to stop the sale of addictive pain pills to shady pharmacies and doctors. Bill Whitaker: Congressman Tom Marino, who pushed this legislation through Congress, was tapped by the Trump Administration to be the new drug czar. And two days after the story ran -- Congressman Marino withdraws his name from being considered. And I would like to think that our story had something to do with that. Jeff Fager: We want to be relevant we want to be current we want to be about today's news. Jeff Fager succeeded Don Hewitt in 2004 as executive producer of 60 Minutes. Jeff Fager: And when we cover a story and report it on Sunday night and it has impact on Monday morning, that's what you hope for. Over the years we've landed timely interviews with world leaders. Putin of Russia. Assad of Syria. Saddam Hussein, with Dan Rather in 2003. The Iraqi leader denied having weapons of mass destruction, a key justification for the impending American invasion. Saddam Hussein: I think America and the world also knows that Iraq no longer has the weapons. It was a controversial interview. But events would prove that what Saddam said about the weapons was correct. In 2015 Pope Francis was about to embark on a trip to the United States. A big story and a rare opportunity for a few questions from 60 Minutes. Scott Pelley: What is your goal for America? To meet people, he told us, just to meet with them. Jeff Fager: I think we're more current now than we were in past years but the values and the standards that we live by are the same as they were the very first broadcast that went on the air in 1968. Some behind the scenes footage of the taping of that first broadcast has survived. It began with Harry Reasoner getting rid of a cigarette. It was, after all, the 60's. \u00a0 \u00a0 Harry and Mike Wallace thought the introduction was perfect. Don Hewitt: Mike, I wanna do it again, you're sitting... But in the control room, Don Hewitt wasn't happy with the way Mike was sitting. And as always, Don got what Don wanted. He was a brash and brilliant man, who not only came up the idea for the broadcast, but ran it for 36 years. And on this day they rolled the tape again -- and rolled the dice on Don's grand experiment. Harry Reasoner: This is 60 Minutes. It's a kind of a magazine for television. And the very first story set the tone for what was to come. 60 Minutes had the only camera in the room as Richard Nixon and friends watched the vote at the Republican Convention. It gave him the nomination for president. Interviewed by Mike on the second program, the candidate made a remark that history would note. Richard Nixon: The most important thing about a public man is not whether he's loved or disliked, but by whether he's respected. And I hope to restore respect to the presidency at all levels by my conduct. Virtually all of the presidents of the last half-century have fielded questions on the broadcast. Lesley Stahl: Are you really gonna build a wall? Donald Trump: Yes. Lesley got the first television interview with Donald Trump shortly after he won the 2016 election. Lesley Stahl: Are people gonna be surprised about how you conduct yourself as President? Donald Trump: Ya know, I'll conduct myself, um, in a very good manner. Lesley Stahl: He was thoughtful. He answered all my questions. Lesley Stahl: But are you gonna be tweeting? Donald Trump: I'm gonna do very restrained if I use it at all\u2026 Lesley Stahl: And I thought, ok he's not gonna tweet anymore. \u00a0We're gonna see something completely different. Got that wrong. We interviewed Barack Obama 18 times. Steve Kroft: Very smart man. Always a pleasure to interview. He was always in the moment, thoughtful and, um, relaxed. I don't kid myself. The reason he did so many stories with us was because of 60 Minutes, not because of me. Because of the power and influence of the show. Mike had known Ronald and Nancy Reagan for years. Mike Wallace: Nancy, of course, was an old, dear friend of mine. \u00a0\u00a0 He'd worked with her mother in his early radio days. Even so, Mrs. Reagan gave as good as she got in their interviews. Nancy Reagan: You're putting words in my mouth, Mike Wallace. \u00a0 Mike Wallace: You can take them out right now. And in a 2006 interview, Mike had no use for the idea that Mr. Reagan was a lightweight. Mike Wallace: Baloney. He knew enough to bring an end to the Cold War. \u00a0 An important interview for the Clintons in 1992, when Bill was running for president. 34 million people watched as the couple fielded questions about Gennifer Flowers. Steve Kroft: She's alleging a 12-year affair with you. Bill Clinton: That allegation is false. Hillary Clinton: Ya know I'm not sitting here like some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette. I'm sitting here because I love him. And for added drama, a light fell off the wall and nearly hit them. No one was hurt, but it was a close call. An unusual presidential interview, recalling a dark time. Scott Pelley and George W. Bush on Air Force One -- on the first anniversary of 9-11. \u00a0 George W. Bush: I can remember sitting right here in this office and realizing it was a defining moment in the history of the United States. I knew we were at war. Scott had seen first-hand the horror of that September morning. Scott Pelley: I spent about two weeks at ground zero, reporting continuously. The agony of watching these firefighters digging through, trying to find somebody alive. It was a mountain of misery. For nearly two decades, the most important and dangerous assignments for 60 Minutes correspondents and crews have been covering the seemingly endless cycle of violence in the Middle East. For 15 years Lara Logan has covered Iraq and Afghanistan for 60 Minutes and 60 Minutes II. Most recently, she was in Mosul, during the successful campaign to retake the Iraqi city from ISIS. \u00a0 Lara Logan: I think we were there just a few minutes before you heard \"car bomb, car bomb\". And you know it means suicide car bomb\u2026 And everyone's shooting because the only thing that can stop that vehicle reaching its target is a hail of gunfire. And it's terrifying. The 60 Minutes crew took cover in a house commandeered by Iraqi special forces. The car had exploded just 50 feet away. With war, came refugees. By land and by sea. Thousands landed on the Greek island of Lesbos, after a dangerous trip across the Aegean Sea from Turkey. Anderson Cooper was there. Anderson Cooper: It was an extraordinary thing to witness\u2026 So many of them were just exhausted and afraid. People drown on the way over all the time. They're buried in unmarked graves and to die without your name being known in a foreign land and your family doesn't even know what happened to you, to me, that's - an unspeakable tragedy. Television is, of course, a feast for the eyes. An electronic window on the world. But at the heart of every great 60 Minutes story are the interviews. Scott Pelley with one of the men who shot Osama bin Laden. Scott Pelley: You shot him Mark Owen: A handful of times Pelley: And at that point, his body was still. Mark Owen: Yes. You have to ask the right questions and you have to be fast on your feet. Lara Logan: How many times have you been indicted? Morley Safer: What goes through your mind? Lesley Stahl: What is it with you? Mike Wallace: You demanded special treatment. Steve Kroft: Did you think you were gonna get away with it? Scott Pelley: That's not all that's going on here. Bill Whitaker: It almost seems unbelievable. There are rules for conducting a 60 minutes interview. Number one: do your homework. Mike Wallace: Let's get this straight. Bob Simon: Talk to us for a minute Number two: don't be shy. Bob Simon: The prosecution says you're a con man. A thief. Number three: take your time. Wear them down, if need be. Lesley Stahl: Let me interrupt you. And even when you've mastered all that, it's still not as easy as it looks. Ed Bradley: What kind of person would do that? Those are the facts, they're not in dispute. Does that seem strange? Ed Bradley explained in 2001. Ed Bradley:\u00a0My job is to put someone in the chair and get them to talk and tell their story as if there are no cameras, no lights, not seven people in the room. Just the two of us sitting there talking. Ed found Mick Jagger candid - and funny. Ed Bradley: The clich\u00e9 that was associated with the band for so many years - sex, drugs, and rock n roll is - you're beyond that? Mick Jagger: Some of that's still in there, I think. Bob Dylan was something else. Ed Bradley: You know, Bob Dylan hadn't done a television interview in, I guess, almost 20 years. Ed Bradley, speaking to Bob Dylan: I read somewhere that you wrote Blowin' In The Wind in ten minutes. Is that right? Bob Dylan: Probably. Ed Bradley: Sometimes you'd ask a question and he'd say \"yep.\" You know, you wanna say \"C'mon Bob, give it up, give it up. Mike Wallace, of course, was the very model of the hard-nosed reporter asking point-blank questions. Mike Wallace: When you boil it down to low gravy it's quite apparent that somethin' was goin' on there. There was his famous encounter -- during the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979 -- with Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini. Mike asking him, in essence, if he was nuts. Mike Wallace: President Sadat of Egypt calls you, Imam, -- forgive me, his words, not mine -- a lunatic. Mike remembered getting a non-answer and icy stares from the other Iranians in the room. Mike Wallace: Well the guy that was translating, he looked over at me and said, \"You're the lunatic if you think I'm going to translate that question to the Ayatollah.\" He did and it got the Ayatollah's attention for the first time. One of Mike's finest hours came 42 years ago, talking to Clint Hill, one of the secret service agents protecting John Kennedy in Dallas the day the president was shot. \u00a0 Mike Wallace: Was there anything that the Secret Service or that Clint Hill could have done to keep that from happening? Clint Hill: Clint Hill, yes. Hill was on the running board of the car just behind the president. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Clint Hill: If I had reacted about maybe a second faster, I wouldn't be here today. Mike Wallace: You mean, you would have gotten there and you would have taken the shot? Clint Hill: The third shot, yes sir. As it was, he'd made it to the car in five seconds, just as the fatal shot rang out. The guilt consumed him for years. Clint Hill: It's my fault. Mike Wallace: Oh, no one has ever suggested that for an instant. What you did was show great bravery and great presence of mind. Clint Hill: Mike, I don't care about that. If I had reacted just a little bit quicker -- and I could have, I guess. And I'll live with that to my grave. Jeff Fager: It's not always easy to get people to talk, and to open up the way Clint Hill did. That took a long time and Mike Wallace was very patient and sometimes, and Ed Bradley used to say this, sometimes you just have to wait for them to talk. In Washington, a very talkative town, there's one group that's long been camera-shy: the justices of the U.S. Supreme Court. But in recent years, several of them have appeared on 60 Minutes. The late Antonin Scalia in 2008. Lesley took him back to his grade school. Lesley Stahl: Straight \"A's\"? \u00a0The whole time? \u00a0Come on. Antonin Scalia: Would I lie? Lesley Stahl: No. Antonin Scalia: If you can't trust me, who can you trust, right? Scalia's fellow conservative, Justice Clarence Thomas, grew up poor in Georgia. Steve Kroft: Indoor plumbing? \u00a0 Clarence Thomas: No, goodness, no. There was an outhouse that we shared with some other families. Justice Sonia Sotomayor's parents immigrated from Puerto Rico. She grew up in a public housing project in New York. Scott Pelley: You know, your brother told us that more than once in this neighborhood he got beaten up. Sonia Sotomayor: Yep. And more than once I beat up the person who beat him up. 60 Minutes has done its fair share of exposes, large and small. \u00a0 We blew the whistle on insider trading in Congress and the never-ending parade of small-time cons. Like turning back the odometers on used cars to get a better price. Steve Kroft: This is not exactly legal, right? Bill Whitlow: This is not exactly legal, no. Bill Whitlow told us how it's done and we showed him how we do it. Steve Kroft: See that picture? There's a TV camera back there. Bill Whitlow: Yep. Steve Kroft: The good news is we're not cops. Bill Whitlow: Well, I didn't think so. Steve Kroft: The bad news is, we're 60 Minutes. Steve Kroft: Sometimes you have to ruin somebody's day. \u00a0But it's always somebody who deserves to have their day ruined\u2026 He did six years in prison for that. But it was Mike, of course, who pioneered the art of confronting the bad guys. Mike Wallace: Track 'em down, follow them into the office or into a barroom or whatever. It became a trademark for the broadcast and got to the point that just a glimpse of anyone from 60 Minutes produced panic in the streets. Gradually, the broadcast backed away from ambushes and hidden cameras except when it's the only way to get the story. Like this one: an especially cruel scam, selling phony stem cell cures to people with devastating illnesses. \u00a0 Steve Watters: If I opt for the permanent fix, will it keep me out of the wheelchair? Larry Stowe: Oh yeah. \u00a0 Scott Pelley: You know, Mister Stowe, the trouble is that you're a con man. Larry Stowe: Really? Scott Pelley: [Larry Stowe] was just selling biochemical garbage that he was putting in these people's veins. And he was taking their money from them, 100 thousand dollars, cash only. \u00a0 Because of the story, Stowe is serving a six-year sentence in federal prison. Over the years we've tackled some tough investigative reports. In 2006, Ed Bradley examined the racially charged case involving three Duke University lacrosse players falsely accused of rape. Ed Bradley: The evidence we've seen reveals disturbing facts about the conduct of the police and the district attorney and raises serious concerns about whether or not a rape even occurred. Ed and the 60 Minutes producers spent six months going over the records of the case, the timeline, photos, medical tests on the accuser -- and concluded there had been a rush to judgment. The charges were dropped, and the district attorney was disbarred. The story Mike and producer Lowell Bergman did in 1996 with whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand told how the tobacco industry lied about the dangers of smoking. A story so controversial that CBS corporate lawyers blocked its broadcast for months, fearing a huge lawsuit. \u00a0 \u00a0 Jeff Fager: The company said, \"You can't air it.\" It's the only time that ever happened in the 50 years of 60 Minutes. After Wigand's disclosures were published elsewhere, the report finally ran. Jeffery Wigand: It's a delivery device for nicotine. Mike Wallace: A delivery device for nicotine? Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix? Jeffery Wigand: You'll get your fix. Jeff Fager: It's incredible in retrospect because the story itself about tobacco was as important as stories get. \u00a0 From the start, the 60 Minutes reporting on the tobacco story was rock solid. But there have been some other cases where stories we've broadcast were on shaky ground, containing serious flaws. There was 'The Mule', a 1997 story about smuggling heroin from Colombia to London. The footage came from an award-winning British documentary which turned out to be fake, with paid actors playing the drug dealers. \u00a0\u00a0 A 2004 report on 60 Minutes II suggested George W. Bush got preferential treatment in the Texas Air National Guard. It was based in part on documents that came into question and could not be verified. And a 2013 story about the attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya was built around an interview with a supposed eyewitness who, as it turned out, had lied. Fortunately, the mistakes have been few and far between. Jeff Fager: I think the most important thing is to own up to it, to help the viewer understand how we made the mistake, and to move on, one story at a time, earning our credibility back. The first few seasons of 60 Minutes were a period of trial and error: trying to figure out what worked and what didn't. The stories were sometimes vague, sometimes ponderous -- and despite Don Hewitt's best efforts -- sometimes boring. The audience was small, but CBS stuck with the broadcast, often scheduling it in sacrificial time slots when most of America was watching a hit show somewhere else. As the broadcast evolved, one thing that did work -- and works to this day -- is the travelogue. Trips to exotic places, foreign and domestic. You'd think that, after half a century, we'd run out of destinations. But there's always something new under the sun. Just about every day of the year, somewhere on earth, there's a 60 Minutes crew at work. Documenting the beauties of nature and the landmarks of ancient history. Our cameras have been to the top of the world and the bottom of the sea. In the waters off Capetown, South Africa, Anderson Cooper went swimming with the sharks. Anderson Cooper: Diving with great white sharks is among the stupidest things you can do. \u00a0 But shark expert Mike Rutzen believes they're smart, curious and not as threatening as you'd think. Rutzen studies the great whites with no cage, no protection. \u00a0Anderson did the same. Anderson Cooper: I would do it again, but it was really scary. Yeah. I don't know if I'd do it again, actually. In 2010 we hiked to the edge of an active volcano in Iceland. The eruption sent a huge cloud of ash and rocks the size of cars a thousand feet into the air. Scott Pelley: Look at the earth just erupting up into the sky. In 2007, Bob Simon and producer Draggan Mihailovich landed in a remote village in New Guinea, to a hero's welcome. But the original pathfinder for 60 Minutes was Morley Safer. The most prolific -- and entertaining -- tour guide of all. One of his first journeys was sailing the Indian Ocean. Morley Safer: It is on rare days like this that you must ask, \"Do they really pay me to do this?\" Yes! In Finland, Morley and producer John Tiffin found that, for some reason, the tango was all the rage. But they found the Argentinian dance didn't quite translate. Morley Safer: It's a sad shuffle in a minor key. With lyrics to reaffirm a couple's instinctive sense of hopelessness. Morley loved art and knew his way around the galleries and museums. There was no better companion for viewing the sublime -- and what he considered the ridiculous. He'd take a shot every once in awhile at the pretensions of the modern art establishment. \u00a0\u00a0 And then he'd move on, to the next airplane. And, as he later recalled, to the next adventure. Morley Safer: You get to travel the world, you get to meet some of the world's most atrocious people and some of the world's most interesting ones and somebody else is paying for it. Is there a better job than that? Bob Simon felt the same way. Six years ago, he traveled into the past for one of his favorite stories. Visiting Mount Athos -- home to ancient Greek monasteries seldom seen by outsiders. During his long career at CBS News, Bob covered dozens of wars and rebellions, from Vietnam to the West Bank to Tiananmen Square. But in his later years, he was ready for something more peaceful. And carved out a role for himself as the Doctor Doolittle of 60 Minutes. The wildlife editor. Bob talked about it in 2011. Bob Simon: An animal is never duplicitous. An animal will never get involved in gratuitous cruelty. And, uh, it's very refreshing to go see them after you've spent a lot of time interviewing politicians. He went to Central Africa, where scientists are beginning to understand how elephants communicate. He went to a remote corner of Brazil in search of jaguars in the wild. Bob Simon: We happened to be there as a jaguar swam from one side of the river to the other. It was a once-in-a-lifetime shot in the dark. He traveled to the edge of the north pole with filmmaker John Downer, whose remote cameras record life among the polar bears. But elephants were his favorite. He and producers Michael Gavshon and Harry Radliffe did three stories on them. Bob Simon: You fall in love with them, and you don't want anyone to hurt them. But as 60 Minutes has reported over the years, African elephants and giraffes are slaughtered by poachers. Other species are affected by climate change and encroaching civilization. Their numbers are dwindling. Bob Simon: We would like to see wild animals survive. That's one of the few editorial positions we can take and get away with. And anyone who disagrees with us, feel free to write a letter. Don Hewitt's model for 60 Minutes was Life magazine. Back in the day, Life did serious stories and picture essays each week -- as well as interviews with movie stars, athletes, and other celebrities. Don figured the mix would work well on television -- and he was right. Many of the best profiles we've broadcast feature the big names from the studios, the stadiums and the playing fields of America. Tiger Woods, at the top of his game. Lebron James, self-proclaimed king of the basketball court, showing Steve why. Tom Brady. You would think that being called the greatest quarterback ever -- as he often is -- would be the ultimate, but... Tom Brady: Me, I think, \"God, there's gotta be more than this.\" \u00a0 Steve Kroft: What's the answer? Tom Brady: I wish I knew. I wish I knew. In 2005, Mike did an interview that turned the spotlight on the darker side of sports. Mike Wallace: What you are saying is that the national pastime, is juiced. Jose Canseco: Yeah. It is. \u00a0 Former baseball star Jose Canseco said he and many other players had used performance-enhancing drugs, PEDs. And soon, other athletes came under suspicion. In 2007, Katie Couric asked Alex Rodriguez about it directly. Katie Couric: Have you ever used steroids or any other performance-enhancing substance? Alex Rodriguez: No. But Rodriguez later admitted he did -- after Anthony Bosch, who ran a Miami drug clinic, told 60 Minutes in 2014 about the drugs he supplied to Rodriguez and other athletes. \u00a0 Scott Pelley: All of them banned? Anthony Bosch: All of them banned. Though he'd denied it many times, cycling champion Lance Armstrong finally admitted using banned drugs -- after his former teammate, Tyler Hamilton came clean on 60 Minutes in 2011. \u00a0 Tyler Hamilton: There was EPO, there was testosterone. Scott Pelley: You saw Lance Armstrong inject EPO? Tyler Hamilton: Yeah, like we all did. And rounding out our sports report: Ed's encounter with Muhammad Ali in 1996. Ali's Parkinson's disease had worsened and at lunch, he appeared to nod off. Ed Bradley: Somebody told me, sometimes when he sleeps, he punches in his sleep. \u00a0 As Ali appeared to sleep he started punching towards Ed. Ed Bradley: Ya know, I'm sorta looking at him and all the sudden he just went... And suddenly Ali sprang awake and scared Ed. Ed Bradley: I almost jumped outa my chair. It was all a prank, a put-on, engineered by the greatest. Muhammad Ali: Yeaaahhh. Ed Bradley: You got me. As for the movies, our star interviews go back 47 years -- to Elizabeth Taylor. Elizabeth Taylor: You've got to be kidding. Old Hollywood. Woody Allen: It's so insane. New Hollywood. Denzel Washington: I'm the man for the job. And some -- Al Pacino: Who-ah! Who are timeless. Meryl Streep: I'm doing me. In 2011, Morley interviewed 3-time Oscar winner Meryl Streep. Morley Safer: And then there's the Streep enigma, that hint of a Mona Lisa smile, or as the Italians call the painting, La Giaconda. Meryl Streep: Is that a snake? What is a giaconda? Morley Safer: No, you're thinking of an anaconda. It's the Mona Lisa. Meryl Streep: Okay. Fine. Sorry. \u00a0 Growing up, Streep watched old movies and fell in love with actress Katharine Hepburn. Meryl Streep: I like girls with attitude, you know, moxie. There's an old word. And naturally, Morley had interviewed Hepburn 32 years earlier. Morley Safer: Do you feel like a legend? Katharine Hepburn: I don't think you ever feel like anything. You feel like a bore. Many of Mike's showbiz interviews were in his trademark take-no-prisoners style. Mike Wallace: You'd love to control this piece. Barbra Streisand: Absolutely. Are you kidding? Barbra Streisand. Mike Wallace: How many years have you been in psychotherapy off and on? Barbra Streisand: Why do you sound so accusatory? \u00a0 Shirley MacLaine and her somewhat unconventional ideas. Mike Wallace: You really believe that you lived lives before? Shirley MacLaine: Oh, yes Mike. There is no doubt in my mind about it. Mike Wallace: And you really believe in extraterrestrials? Do they come visit you on the porch? Shirley MacLaine: [gives Mike a mean look] Mike Wallace: Now you're being unpleasant Wallace is what you're saying. Shirley MacLaine: Yes this is what I was afraid of. But you don't have to be that unpleasant it doesn't become you, you know? Mike was equally direct with the king of late night television, Johnny Carson, about his past troubles with drinking. Mike Wallace: There was a time -- when uh -- Johnny Carson: I used to have a little pop, I sure did. I don't handle it well. Mike Wallace: You and -- really you don't? Johnny Carson: I don't handle alcohol well at all. No. Steve interviewed Carson's successor, Jay Leno... Steve Kroft: Do you uh -- \u2026and had a senior moment. Steve Kroft: I just lost my train of thought. And I was trying to remember this question I wanted to ask him. Jay Leno: He's had a stroke! Can we stop!? I was ready to jump in with the paddles. Morley hung out with television icon Jackie Gleason and played some pool, nearly beating the great one. \u00a0 Morley Safer: Gleason looked at me. Eyes narrowed. Ready to kill. And he thought he'd been hustled. Jackie Gleason: Hey. \u00a0Hey. Morley Safer: Goodnight Mr. Gleason. Jackie Gleason: That little snide remark will cost you. Morley Safer: Of course at that point, he just cleaned the table. Jackie Gleason: Did you like that one, pal? Morley Safer: Please. For whatever reason -- musicians often make the best profiles. Most of them, like Lady Gaga, are smart, talented, and -- gaga. Anderson Cooper: What are you wearing today? Lady Gaga: I just didn't want to wear clothes today. Backstage moments: Mick Jagger insisted Ed try a more rock and roll look. Bono gave Lesley Stahl a back rub. Lesley Stahl: Oh my God, I'm getting a Bono massage! Are you rolling? There's a 60 minutes playlist for all sorts of music. \u00a0 Chris Martin sings: Oh Christmas lights\u2026 Steve with Chris Martin of Coldplay. Steve Kroft: You wrote that yesterday? Chris Martin: Yeah, yeah. That's gonna be good though. Johnny Cash and his wife June, 35 years ago, with Harry Reasoner. The story Ed and producer Ruth Streeter did about comedian George Burns featured Bradley and Burns, the Harmony Boys. George Burns: You sing harmony? Ed Bradley: No, I can't carry a tune. And Anderson with Adele - and the song that put her on the map. And we're indebted to Beyonce and company for a backstage interpretation of the 60 Minutes theme song, otherwise known as the stopwatch \u2013 to accompany the line \"we'll be back with some final thoughts in a moment\". Here at 60 Minutes, we stand on the shoulders of giants. A few thoughts from this relative newcomer on those who came before. First and foremost: Don Hewitt. Without his drive, his enthusiasm, his uncanny ability to shape an everyday story into something truly memorable, the broadcast would have folded long ago. Mike Wallace: tough, funny, difficult - the beating heart of 60 Minutes. It made his day to walk through an airport and hear people say -- as they often did -- \"give 'em hell, Mike.\" Morley Safer spent 46 years here, longer than anyone. \u00a0A sophisticate right down to his pocket squares, he was a great writer and a gentleman in a business populated by a fair number of maniacs. Ed Bradley. Versatile. Compassionate. Always the coolest guy in the room. When I was growing up, there was hardly anybody who looked like me on television news. And along came Ed, paving the way for me and many others. Bob Simon was proud of the fact that in nearly a half-century traveling the world for CBS News, he never missed a single flight. He did his last story with the same curiosity and energy as the first. \u00a0 And finally, Andy Rooney, who spent 33 years here as the resident grouch. Since this was his spot in the broadcast, we cede the floor and let Andy speak for himself. Andy Rooney: I don't like to complain all the time but that's what I do for a living and I'm lucky 'cause there's so much to complain about. Public toilets... car mufflers... faucets... fences... cookbooks... the doorknob... Christmas catalogs, gloves... cardboard... cats... It wouldn't hurt if we could improve certain parts of what we're like and how we behave.\u00a0 Maybe the drug companies can come up with a pill that would cure us of the evil in our nature. Things like hate, jealousy, dishonesty, selfishness. And one more thing, but this may be asking too much, I wish there was something we could all take to cure us of stupidity. We close tonight with thanks, to the many people who have made 60 Minutes tick over 50 years -- to all the producers, editors, studio personnel, camera and sound people and others who contribute to the broadcast each week. \u00a0 We especially thank you, our viewers for joining us all these years. Produced by David Browning, Warren Lustig and Michelle St. John. Associate producer, Tadd J. Lascari. Ed Bradley's interview courtesy the\u00a0Television Academy Interviews.",

            "article_content": "Looking back at 50 years of 60 Minutes, it's worth noting that the longest running broadcast in prime time television history was created by a man with a notoriously short attention span. Don Hewitt was bored by hour-long documentaries and thought any story worth telling could be done in ten or 15 minutes. So he dreamed up this broadcast: three different segments, a little something for everyone. A half a century later, we're here to celebrate Don's very big -- and very successful idea. We'll be profiling 60 Minutes itself: inside stories about its history and its greatest moments. From the archives, we'll have some outtakes and backstage footage you've never seen before. And interviews we've done over the years with the 60 Minutes pioneers who are gone now, but whose stamp on the broadcast is still on display, every Sunday night. The formula for a good 60 Minutes story: keep it timely, keep it relevant and never be dull.\u00a0 Some examples, from this 50th season. Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. We surveyed the damage with the island's governor, Ricardo Rossello. Steve Kroft: There was no safe haven. Ricardo Rossello: There was no safe haven. Just a few weeks earlier, it had been Houston's turn. Scott Pelley found widespread dismay that the city's flood control system was no match for Hurricane Harvey. Cynthia Nealy: It's gonna rain, we're gonna have hurricanes and tropical storms, so by golly, do something to protect your people from it. Also this year: an old warrior's last stand. Lesley Stahl with John McCain. Lesley Stahl: I had to ask him about cancer, he didn't want to go there and I was pushing him there. \u00a0 John McCain: I have feelings sometimes of fear of what happens. But as soon as I get that, I say wait a minute. You've been around a long time old man. You've had a great life. \u00a0 Bill Whitaker's recent story with producer Ira Rosen about the opioid crisis got Washington's attention. \u00a0 Joe Rannazzisi: This is an industry that's out of control. \u00a0If they don't follow the law in drug supply, people die. \u00a0 Joe Rannazzisi once ran the DEA's war on the illicit sale of prescription drugs. A war undermined - on Capitol Hill. An investigation by 60 Minutes and the Washington Post found that under heavy lobbying by the drug industry, lawmakers quietly passed a bill last year making it more difficult to stop the sale of addictive pain pills to shady pharmacies and doctors. Bill Whitaker: Congressman Tom Marino, who pushed this legislation through Congress, was tapped by the Trump Administration to be the new drug czar. And two days after the story ran -- Congressman Marino withdraws his name from being considered. And I would like to think that our story had something to do with that. Jeff Fager: We want to be relevant we want to be current we want to be about today's news. Jeff Fager succeeded Don Hewitt in 2004 as executive producer of 60 Minutes. Jeff Fager: And when we cover a story and report it on Sunday night and it has impact on Monday morning, that's what you hope for. Over the years we've landed timely interviews with world leaders. Putin of Russia. Assad of Syria. Saddam Hussein, with Dan Rather in 2003. The Iraqi leader denied having weapons of mass destruction, a key justification for the impending American invasion. Saddam Hussein: I think America and the world also knows that Iraq no longer has the weapons. It was a controversial interview. But events would prove that what Saddam said about the weapons was correct. In 2015 Pope Francis was about to embark on a trip to the United States. A big story and a rare opportunity for a few questions from 60 Minutes. Scott Pelley: What is your goal for America? To meet people, he told us, just to meet with them. Jeff Fager: I think we're more current now than we were in past years but the values and the standards that we live by are the same as they were the very first broadcast that went on the air in 1968. Some behind the scenes footage of the taping of that first broadcast has survived. It began with Harry Reasoner getting rid of a cigarette. It was, after all, the 60's. \u00a0 \u00a0 Harry and Mike Wallace thought the introduction was perfect. Don Hewitt: Mike, I wanna do it again, you're sitting... But in the control room, Don Hewitt wasn't happy with the way Mike was sitting. And as always, Don got what Don wanted. He was a brash and brilliant man, who not only came up the idea for the broadcast, but ran it for 36 years. And on this day they rolled the tape again -- and rolled the dice on Don's grand experiment. Harry Reasoner: This is 60 Minutes. It's a kind of a magazine for television. And the very first story set the tone for what was to come. 60 Minutes had the only camera in the room as Richard Nixon and friends watched the vote at the Republican Convention. It gave him the nomination for president. Interviewed by Mike on the second program, the candidate made a remark that history would note. Richard Nixon: The most important thing about a public man is not whether he's loved or disliked, but by whether he's respected. And I hope to restore respect to the presidency at all levels by my conduct. Virtually all of the presidents of the last half-century have fielded questions on the broadcast. Lesley Stahl: Are you really gonna build a wall? Donald Trump: Yes. Lesley got the first television interview with Donald Trump shortly after he won the 2016 election. Lesley Stahl: Are people gonna be surprised about how you conduct yourself as President? Donald Trump: Ya know, I'll conduct myself, um, in a very good manner. Lesley Stahl: He was thoughtful. He answered all my questions. Lesley Stahl: But are you gonna be tweeting? Donald Trump: I'm gonna do very restrained if I use it at all\u2026 Lesley Stahl: And I thought, ok he's not gonna tweet anymore. \u00a0We're gonna see something completely different. Got that wrong. We interviewed Barack Obama 18 times. Steve Kroft: Very smart man. Always a pleasure to interview. He was always in the moment, thoughtful and, um, relaxed. I don't kid myself. The reason he did so many stories with us was because of 60 Minutes, not because of me. Because of the power and influence of the show. Mike had known Ronald and Nancy Reagan for years. Mike Wallace: Nancy, of course, was an old, dear friend of mine. \u00a0\u00a0 He'd worked with her mother in his early radio days. Even so, Mrs. Reagan gave as good as she got in their interviews. Nancy Reagan: You're putting words in my mouth, Mike Wallace. \u00a0 Mike Wallace: You can take them out right now. And in a 2006 interview, Mike had no use for the idea that Mr. Reagan was a lightweight. Mike Wallace: Baloney. He knew enough to bring an end to the Cold War. \u00a0 An important interview for the Clintons in 1992, when Bill was running for president. 34 million people watched as the couple fielded questions about Gennifer Flowers. Steve Kroft: She's alleging a 12-year affair with you. Bill Clinton: That allegation is false. Hillary Clinton: Ya know I'm not sitting here like some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette. I'm sitting here because I love him. And for added drama, a light fell off the wall and nearly hit them. No one was hurt, but it was a close call. An unusual presidential interview, recalling a dark time. Scott Pelley and George W. Bush on Air Force One -- on the first anniversary of 9-11. \u00a0 George W. Bush: I can remember sitting right here in this office and realizing it was a defining moment in the history of the United States. I knew we were at war. Scott had seen first-hand the horror of that September morning. Scott Pelley: I spent about two weeks at ground zero, reporting continuously. The agony of watching these firefighters digging through, trying to find somebody alive. It was a mountain of misery. For nearly two decades, the most important and dangerous assignments for 60 Minutes correspondents and crews have been covering the seemingly endless cycle of violence in the Middle East. For 15 years Lara Logan has covered Iraq and Afghanistan for 60 Minutes and 60 Minutes II. Most recently, she was in Mosul, during the successful campaign to retake the Iraqi city from ISIS. \u00a0 Lara Logan: I think we were there just a few minutes before you heard \"car bomb, car bomb\". And you know it means suicide car bomb\u2026 And everyone's shooting because the only thing that can stop that vehicle reaching its target is a hail of gunfire. And it's terrifying. The 60 Minutes crew took cover in a house commandeered by Iraqi special forces. The car had exploded just 50 feet away. With war, came refugees. By land and by sea. Thousands landed on the Greek island of Lesbos, after a dangerous trip across the Aegean Sea from Turkey. Anderson Cooper was there. Anderson Cooper: It was an extraordinary thing to witness\u2026 So many of them were just exhausted and afraid. People drown on the way over all the time. They're buried in unmarked graves and to die without your name being known in a foreign land and your family doesn't even know what happened to you, to me, that's - an unspeakable tragedy. Television is, of course, a feast for the eyes. An electronic window on the world. But at the heart of every great 60 Minutes story are the interviews. Scott Pelley with one of the men who shot Osama bin Laden. Scott Pelley: You shot him Mark Owen: A handful of times Pelley: And at that point, his body was still. Mark Owen: Yes. You have to ask the right questions and you have to be fast on your feet. Lara Logan: How many times have you been indicted? Morley Safer: What goes through your mind? Lesley Stahl: What is it with you? Mike Wallace: You demanded special treatment. Steve Kroft: Did you think you were gonna get away with it? Scott Pelley: That's not all that's going on here. Bill Whitaker: It almost seems unbelievable. There are rules for conducting a 60 minutes interview. Number one: do your homework. Mike Wallace: Let's get this straight. Bob Simon: Talk to us for a minute Number two: don't be shy. Bob Simon: The prosecution says you're a con man. A thief. Number three: take your time. Wear them down, if need be. Lesley Stahl: Let me interrupt you. And even when you've mastered all that, it's still not as easy as it looks. Ed Bradley: What kind of person would do that? Those are the facts, they're not in dispute. Does that seem strange? Ed Bradley explained in 2001. Ed Bradley: My job is to put someone in the chair and get them to talk and tell their story as if there are no cameras, no lights, not seven people in the room. Just the two of us sitting there talking. Ed found Mick Jagger candid - and funny. Ed Bradley: The clich\u00e9 that was associated with the band for so many years - sex, drugs, and rock n roll is - you're beyond that? Mick Jagger: Some of that's still in there, I think. Bob Dylan was something else. Ed Bradley: You know, Bob Dylan hadn't done a television interview in, I guess, almost 20 years. Ed Bradley, speaking to Bob Dylan: I read somewhere that you wrote Blowin' In The Wind in ten minutes. Is that right? Bob Dylan: Probably. Ed Bradley: Sometimes you'd ask a question and he'd say \"yep.\" You know, you wanna say \"C'mon Bob, give it up, give it up. Mike Wallace, of course, was the very model of the hard-nosed reporter asking point-blank questions. Mike Wallace: When you boil it down to low gravy it's quite apparent that somethin' was goin' on there. There was his famous encounter -- during the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979 -- with Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini. Mike asking him, in essence, if he was nuts. Mike Wallace: President Sadat of Egypt calls you, Imam, -- forgive me, his words, not mine -- a lunatic. Mike remembered getting a non-answer and icy stares from the other Iranians in the room. Mike Wallace: Well the guy that was translating, he looked over at me and said, \"You're the lunatic if you think I'm going to translate that question to the Ayatollah.\" He did and it got the Ayatollah's attention for the first time. One of Mike's finest hours came 42 years ago, talking to Clint Hill, one of the secret service agents protecting John Kennedy in Dallas the day the president was shot. \u00a0 Mike Wallace: Was there anything that the Secret Service or that Clint Hill could have done to keep that from happening? Clint Hill: Clint Hill, yes. Hill was on the running board of the car just behind the president. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Clint Hill: If I had reacted about maybe a second faster, I wouldn't be here today. Mike Wallace: You mean, you would have gotten there and you would have taken the shot? Clint Hill: The third shot, yes sir. As it was, he'd made it to the car in five seconds, just as the fatal shot rang out. The guilt consumed him for years. Clint Hill: It's my fault. Mike Wallace: Oh, no one has ever suggested that for an instant. What you did was show great bravery and great presence of mind. Clint Hill: Mike, I don't care about that. If I had reacted just a little bit quicker -- and I could have, I guess. And I'll live with that to my grave. Jeff Fager: It's not always easy to get people to talk, and to open up the way Clint Hill did. That took a long time and Mike Wallace was very patient and sometimes, and Ed Bradley used to say this, sometimes you just have to wait for them to talk. In Washington, a very talkative town, there's one group that's long been camera-shy: the justices of the U.S. Supreme Court. But in recent years, several of them have appeared on 60 Minutes. The late Antonin Scalia in 2008. Lesley took him back to his grade school. Lesley Stahl: Straight \"A's\"? \u00a0The whole time? \u00a0Come on. Antonin Scalia: Would I lie? Lesley Stahl: No. Antonin Scalia: If you can't trust me, who can you trust, right? Scalia's fellow conservative, Justice Clarence Thomas, grew up poor in Georgia. Steve Kroft: Indoor plumbing? \u00a0 Clarence Thomas: No, goodness, no. There was an outhouse that we shared with some other families. Justice Sonia Sotomayor's parents immigrated from Puerto Rico. She grew up in a public housing project in New York. Scott Pelley: You know, your brother told us that more than once in this neighborhood he got beaten up. Sonia Sotomayor: Yep. And more than once I beat up the person who beat him up. 60 Minutes has done its fair share of exposes, large and small. \u00a0 We blew the whistle on insider trading in Congress and the never-ending parade of small-time cons. Like turning back the odometers on used cars to get a better price. Steve Kroft: This is not exactly legal, right? Bill Whitlow: This is not exactly legal, no. Bill Whitlow told us how it's done and we showed him how we do it. Steve Kroft: See that picture? There's a TV camera back there. Bill Whitlow: Yep. Steve Kroft: The good news is we're not cops. Bill Whitlow: Well, I didn't think so. Steve Kroft: The bad news is, we're 60 Minutes. Steve Kroft: Sometimes you have to ruin somebody's day. \u00a0But it's always somebody who deserves to have their day ruined\u2026 He did six years in prison for that. But it was Mike, of course, who pioneered the art of confronting the bad guys. Mike Wallace: Track 'em down, follow them into the office or into a barroom or whatever. It became a trademark for the broadcast and got to the point that just a glimpse of anyone from 60 Minutes produced panic in the streets. Gradually, the broadcast backed away from ambushes and hidden cameras except when it's the only way to get the story. Like this one: an especially cruel scam, selling phony stem cell cures to people with devastating illnesses. \u00a0 Steve Watters: If I opt for the permanent fix, will it keep me out of the wheelchair? Larry Stowe: Oh yeah. \u00a0 Scott Pelley: You know, Mister Stowe, the trouble is that you're a con man. Larry Stowe: Really? Scott Pelley: [Larry Stowe] was just selling biochemical garbage that he was putting in these people's veins. And he was taking their money from them, 100 thousand dollars, cash only. \u00a0 Because of the story, Stowe is serving a six-year sentence in federal prison. Over the years we've tackled some tough investigative reports. In 2006, Ed Bradley examined the racially charged case involving three Duke University lacrosse players falsely accused of rape. Ed Bradley: The evidence we've seen reveals disturbing facts about the conduct of the police and the district attorney and raises serious concerns about whether or not a rape even occurred. Ed and the 60 Minutes producers spent six months going over the records of the case, the timeline, photos, medical tests on the accuser -- and concluded there had been a rush to judgment. The charges were dropped, and the district attorney was disbarred. The story Mike and producer Lowell Bergman did in 1996 with whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand told how the tobacco industry lied about the dangers of smoking. A story so controversial that CBS corporate lawyers blocked its broadcast for months, fearing a huge lawsuit. \u00a0 \u00a0 Jeff Fager: The company said, \"You can't air it.\" It's the only time that ever happened in the 50 years of 60 Minutes. After Wigand's disclosures were published elsewhere, the report finally ran. Jeffery Wigand: It's a delivery device for nicotine. Mike Wallace: A delivery device for nicotine? Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix? Jeffery Wigand: You'll get your fix. Jeff Fager: It's incredible in retrospect because the story itself about tobacco was as important as stories get. \u00a0 From the start, the 60 Minutes reporting on the tobacco story was rock solid. But there have been some other cases where stories we've broadcast were on shaky ground, containing serious flaws. There was 'The Mule', a 1997 story about smuggling heroin from Colombia to London. The footage came from an award-winning British documentary which turned out to be fake, with paid actors playing the drug dealers. \u00a0\u00a0 A 2004 report on 60 Minutes II suggested George W. Bush got preferential treatment in the Texas Air National Guard. It was based in part on documents that came into question and could not be verified. And a 2013 story about the attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya was built around an interview with a supposed eyewitness who, as it turned out, had lied. Fortunately, the mistakes have been few and far between. Jeff Fager: I think the most important thing is to own up to it, to help the viewer understand how we made the mistake, and to move on, one story at a time, earning our credibility back.

            "article_content": "Authors Robert Dallek, Ron Chernow, Nancy Koehn and Mark Updegrove joined \"Face the Nation\" Sunday for a conversation examining leadership in times of crisis. What follows is a transcript of the discussion, which aired Sunday, Nov. 26, 2017, on \"Face the Nation.\" DICKERSON: We turn now to a conversation with four authors whose new books examine leadership in times of crisis. Robert Dallek is the author of \"Franklin D. Roosevelt: A Political Life.\" Ron Chernow is author of \"Grant,\" a new biography of the Civil War Union general and 18th president. Nancy Koehn is the author of \"Forged in Crisis,\" which looks at five historical figures who demonstrated steady leadership in times of upheaval. And Mark Updegrove's new book, \"The Last Republicans,\" examines the presidencies of George W. Bush and George Herbert Walker Bush and the relationship between father and son. Welcome to all of you. I'm so glad you're here. Ron, let me start with you. You are all historians, but you are also storytellers, too. So, put General Grant, President Grant on stage for us. Give us your favorite story. RON CHERNOW, AUTHOR, \"GRANT\": My favorite story. OK. It's Virginia 1864. It's Spotsylvania. Grant is standing on the edge of the wood when a lethal shell comes whizzing by him. It passes within three inches of his ears. Grant doesn't blink. He doesn't flinch. His facial expression doesn't change. He turns to his adjutant and said: \"Hudson, go get that shell. Let's see what the enemy is firing at us.\" (LAUGHTER) CHERNOW: And the reason I love this story is it that shows Grant's literally coolness under fire. And his metabolism was such that, at moments where the rest of us would be fearful or anxious, he gets very cool and focused. DICKERSON: Yes, he was more cool on the battlefield almost maybe than in the barracks. And we will talk about that later. Nancy, you have five to choose from. NANCY KOEHN, AUTHOR, \"FORGED IN CRISIS: THE POWER OF COURAGEOUS LEADERSHIP IN TURBULENT TIMES\": Yes. (LAUGHTER) DICKERSON: But which one story do you want to tell? KOEHN: Well, it's October 1915. Ernest Shackleton is marooned with 27 crew members on iceberg off the coast of Antarctic. His ship is being crushed by the ice. And the men are intense on the berg. And he's pacing at night. He can't sleep. He doesn't know how he's going to get them all home alive. And he records later in his diary, I had no idea, but I had to get them home alive. May I be made into what I need to be in order to do that. The next morning, he awakes each of the men by coming to their tent with a cup of hot tea and says, \"Ship and stores gone now, lads. We will go home.\" And, again, the coolness under pressure, the commitment, right, in the perfect storm to do something very worthy, and his own uncertainty, right, which was very important, but not evident to his men. Forged in crisis. DICKERSON: Right. That's great. Robert Dallek, how about you? What is FDR going to... (CROSSTALK) ROBERT DALLEK, AUTHOR, \"FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT: A POLITICAL LIFE\": Well, he had a great sense of humor. And Ben Cohen came in the Oval Office one morning, and Roosevelt was chuckling. And Cohen to him, \"Would you mind sharing the joke with me, Mr. President?\" And Roosevelt said: \"All right, Ben. Eleanor was just in here. She had been to her doctor this morning for her annual physical. And I say to her, so, Eleanor, what did the doctor have to say about that big ass of yours? And she says, oh, Franklin, he had nothing wrong to say about you.\" (LAUGHTER) DICKERSON: Mark, you tell the story of father and a son. Which moment from that do you want to tee up for us? MARK UPDEGROVE, AUTHOR, \"THE LAST REPUBLICANS\": There are two moments, John. One is in 1990. The Christmas holidays, the extended Bush family convenes at Camp David. And it's on the eve of Desert Storm, and George H.W. Bush has a decision to make as to whether to send ground troops into Kuwait to drive out the Iraqi invaders. And it's a big decision. And he has a dream that night, that his father is alive again, his father who had died in the 1970s is alive. And he finds out he's at a hotel room near a golf course. And he goes to that hotel room, and there's his dad. And he recalls him big, strong, highly respected. And he hugs him and says, \"I miss you very much.\" Flash forward a dozen years, and, improbably, the Bush family is once again at Camp David celebrating the Christmas holiday, with George W. Bush as president confronted with the same enemy, and trying to figure out whether he should wage war against Saddam Hussein. But his father is there, big, strong, highly respected. And he can draw on him for his counsel, which he does, the one and only time he talks to his father about Iraq, asks him what he should do. Saddam Hussein at that point is flaunting U.N. sanctions and rattling sabers. And his father says, \"If he's not complying, you have to go to war.\" And you have to -- for sake of history, you have got to understand this dynamic between father and son, whose presidencies were just eight years apart. DICKERSON: Yes. We will get back to that. Robert, let me ask you. Let's step back now look at each of your books. You write about -- in your book, you write, \"It seems well to remind Americans that the system has been capable of generating candidates for high office whose commitment to the national interests exceeds their flaws and ambitions.\" Is that it is goal of your book? DALLEK: Yes. And Roosevelt had an extraordinary hold of the public's imagination. For 12 years, his approval rating never went below 50 percent. Even in 1937-'38, when he was struggling over court packing and purging the party of conservative Democrats from the staff, he still had a 50, 55, even 60 percent approval rating. And I love those two stories about the man who stopped Eleanor on the street after Franklin died and said, \"I miss the way your husband used to speak to me about my government,\" or the man who stood by the railway track as the train from Warm Springs carrying the body went back to Hyde Park. A man was sobbing and somebody said to him, \"Did you know the president?\" He said, \"No, but he knew me.\" (LAUGHTER) DALLEK: And can anyone imagine that, somebody saying that about the current incumbent? DICKERSON: Nancy, you chose five people. Why these five? KOEHN: A combination of reasons, John. One, they -- I was very, very interested, for personal and professional reasons -- I have been teaching leadership for a long time at Harvard Business School -- in how -- in the emotional experience of leadership. What is it like for the leader, him or her self, to be in the center, right, of the waves and the winds? And I wanted -- I wanted a selection of people that could -- that could -- that were made, leaders that were made, not born. Each of these people was made, Rachel Carson, the environmentalist, Frederick Douglass, and the others, Lincoln, Shackleton, and Bonhoeffer. And I also wanted -- so, I needed to be able to reconstruct the making. And then, last but not least, each of these people, like the people in all of your books, stumbled into a worthy mission. Either like -- like Douglass, Frederick Douglass, they found it early on, in slavery, or they bumped into it. And so I wanted to reconstruct, again, to your point where your book, Bob, how -- what is it like to move the boulder of goodness forward on something big and good? DICKERSON: Let me interrupt you there. KOEHN: Yes. DICKERSON: We're going to take a quick break. We will have a lot more from our book panel when we come back. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: You can keep up with the news of the week by subscribing to the FACE THE NATION Diary podcast available every Friday \u00a0evening. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: We will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION, more from our authors' panel, plus Walter Isaacson on Leonardo da Vinci. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We continue our conversation with authors whose new books explore leadership amid crisis. Robert Dallek is the author of \"franklin D. Roosevelt: A Political Life.\" Ron Chernow is the author of \"Grant.\" Nancy Koehn is the author of \"Forged in Crisis.\" And Mark Updegrove is the author of \"The Last Republicans.\" Mark, I'll start with you on this question of, what is your -- you call your book \"The Last Republicans,\" not the Bush family or something. Why that title? MARK UPDEGROVE, \"THE LAST REPUBLICANS\": Well, because it was clear that the Bush represent -- Bushs, rather, represent a last -- the establishment Republican Party. Right now we see a party at war with itself. You still have establishment members of that party, but there are insurgents who have taken over. And the party really doesn't stand for anything specific. There is no binding platform or principles. It's really what it -- standard bearer, the very capricious and unpredictable Donald Trump decides it wants to be. So in some manner the Bushes, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush represent the end to a type of Republicanism. DICKERSON: Ron, why Grant and was it the Grant when you went into the book as the same one as when you were finally done? RON CHERNOW, \"GRANT\": Well, yes. You know, I have a contrarian streak to my nature. So whenever I feel that the stereotype of a particular historical figure is hardened into a caricature, I'm attacked to it. You know, so with Grant I was interested really in retiring three chief myths about him, one that he was a crude and brutal butcher as a general. In fact, he was a dazzling strategist. I wanted to retire the idea that he had somehow stumbled through the entire Civil War in an alcoholic haze. He did have a drinking problem, but he never drank during, much less before a battle. And I also, most importantly, wanted to change the image of his presidency from one that was completely dominated by corruption and cronyism to one that, in fact, had many elements of courage in terms of his effort to protect the four million former slaves, now full- fledged American citizens. And Grant hires a crusading attorney general named Amos Akerman, uses newly created Justice Department and really crushes the Ku Klux Klan, which had taken over the south. DICKERSON: Robert, I want to -- as we talk about presidential characteristics, one strikes me about FDR was that sense of guile and his lack of transparency. We talk about must be constantly truthful. He was pretty good at not always being truthful with everybody. Was that a key skill of his? ROBERT DALLEK, \"FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT: A POLITICAL LIFE\": It was indeed. And, in fact, you know, he would never say in public the kinds of things that he would say in private. For example, after he won 1944, he disliked Tom Dewey, the opponent, and privately called him a son of a bitch, but he would never say that in public because he was someone who was very mindful of -- he would be a half a step ahead of public opinion. And it gave him a sense of the country, a sense of leadership. And, you know, he was an extraordinary character. After all, he was a man who couldn't walk. He -- and he only made one reference to his disability once in his entire presidency of 12 years. When he came back (INAUDIBLE), he said, I know you will excuse me for sitting down for I carrying ten pounds of steel around each of my lower limbs. It's the only time he ever made reference to the fact that he was -- but, what a story. Here's a man who was immobilized, couldn't walk, and he wrote a letter to another -- to a congressman saying, when you get frustrated, you can get up and walk around. He said, I'm stuck in this chair. And -- but privately he was always, you know, much more candid than he was publicly. DICKERSON: I'm struck by the picture in your book of the last one of him where he looks like a man who has had to carry around a lot of weight in his entire life. Mark, let me ask you about the Bush code. We were just talking about a letter that FDR wrote. I was struck by letter that George Herbert Walker bush wrote to his sons during Watergate. Tell us about that letter. And also, the father was always kind of taking whatever moment was happening and using it as a lesson for his sons, it felt like, about this Bush code. UPDEGROVE: It was a primer of sorts. So George H.W. Bush, while he is the chairman of the Republican Party in the -- at the height of Watergate, two weeks before Richard Nixon resigns, writes a letter to his boys. He calls them his lads, talking about that moment and why it's important, how you stick by a friend in need, you don't -- you don't go with the crowd, you don't join the mob if you don't have to. You stick by your principles and you reserve your judgment. One of the things he says in that is, understand that power accompanied by arrogance is very dangerous. It is particularly dangerous when men with no experience have it for they can abuse our great institution. I mean that's amazing because the first part of that is clearly about Richard Nixon. The arrogance and power. The last part of that is a hypothetical. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. UPDEGROVE: Somebody with no experience. Nixon clearly had experience. He had been a congressman, he had been a senator, he had been vice president. And so that's a hypothetical. And so it wasn't hard to infer what the Bush family felt about Donald Trump as he emerged as the clear man to beat in 2016. DICKERSON: Nancy, in your book you talk about something called the gathering, which I want you to explain. But you also have -- when you talk about leadership, people are grabbing it. In other words, they are not -- there's this question always of greatness, is it thrust upon you or do you seize it. What's your take on that and explain what you mean by gathering? NANCY KOEHN, \"FORGED IN CRISIS\": So I think that the man or the leader makes the moment, as well as the moment making the leader. So Grant is transformed as a general over the course of the Civil War. FDR, right, is changed and developed through the course of his four terms. CHERNOW: Yes. KOEHN: I'm sure this is true of both 41 and 43. So -- so greatness is not thrust upon us in some kind of divine strike of lightning, right? Great is something that I think proceeds very significantly from one person's willingness to say, I want to get better, and to FDR, I'm going to show up in service to my mission with dignity, right, and humanity and compassion and a sense of the larger national interest. But that -- that development, the ability of FDR to do that, the ability of Grant, right, to do such important things toward ensuring that the transformation of American in the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendment actually happened, that wasn't something that they downloaded an app for, John, right? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, but they had it (ph). KOEHN: They -- they had to -- they had to work at it. They had to -- and they all had -- all these people had mileage with failure, right, which I maintain is an important part of the making of resilient, courageous leaders. DICKERSON: Well, Ron, tell -- pick up exactly on that feeling with Grant and failure. I mean I can think of so many instances where there was a failure and not only does he say, lickem (ph) again at Shiloh after he loses. I think it's Shiloh. But also if he hadn't had his failure out west, he maybe never would have come back east and been in the position to be a hero. CHERNOW: Absolutely. And I think that happens, you know, he feels that one business after another, before the Civil War, by the time the Civil War breaks out, he's almost 40. He's been reduced to working as a clerk in his father's leather goods store in Galina (ph), where he's a clerk, junior to his two younger brothers, then the war breaks out. Two months later he's a colonel. Four months later he's a brigadier general. Ten months later he's a major general. And then four years later , he has a million soldiers under his command. But I think that that pre-work (ph) experience of failure was extremely important because he learned how to weather adversity. It gave him a kind of toughness and perseverance that would be extremely important in a war that was very long, bloody and protracted. And also gave him an audacity. He had nothing to lose and everything to gain. You see there the trial (ph), again and again, takes colossal risks that no other union general would have dared to take. DICKERSON: Yes. Robert, we, obviously with FDR, there was the polio. And I was struck the -- when you point out about him becoming an actor as a result of that. A key skill for a president. DALLEK: Yes. He said to Orson Welles once, Orson, you and I are the two greatest actors in America. But, you know, he had a kind of self-confidence. And I think it develops -- KOEHN: Absolutely. DALLEK: As you suggested Nancy, as they go through the presidency and struggle with these crises. But Roosevelt's idea of the presidency was said was FDR in the White House. See, that -- he was the man to do the job. And, plus, he had the example of his distant cousin Theodore. KOEHN: Absolutely. DALLEK: Who had been a -- KOEHN: Talk about confidence, right? DALLEK: That's right. That's right. KOEHN: And (INAUDIBLE) and public interest. DALLEK: And he came from a distinguished family. They were partitions (ph) and it served him brilliantly. UPDEGROVE: But it's just very clear that great leadership grows from deeply held values, right? DALLEK: Yes. Exactly. UPDEGROVE: And that's still obvious in the case of both Grant and FDR. CHERNOW: And also I think one thing important to emphasize at the moment is, you know, honesty. Grant, as president, was such a stickler for honesty that one day a visitor came to his officer. You could just walk into the White House at that point. And Grant, in his office, hears the White House usher telling someone that the president is out of the office. Well, when the stranger leaves, Grant pops out of the office and says to the usher, he said, you should have said that I was otherwise engaged. He said, I don't lie for myself and I don't like people lying for me. KOEHN: You know, and Lincoln had the same sense of, you know, this kind of very high bar, right, on this (INAUDIBLE). There's a wonderful line that he says to one of the quarter masters, you can't -- when they're (INAUDIBLE) the White House, providing beef (ph) to the White House. He said, you can't give me and my family the best choice of cuts of meat when my soldiers, right, don't have socks and enough muskets. UPDEGROVE: Yes. KOEHN: So the sense that the leader sets a standard, right, of honesty of comportment, of dignity, and that people -- the understanding on FDR's part, on Grant's part, on both the Bush presidents' part, that people take their cues from leaders, right, not just kids, all kinds of people, look to leaders for examples, for courage under pressure, for a sense of direction. So I think another element of leading in turbulent times, John, is the element of how leaders show up and in response to what values, Mark. DALLEK: Yes. KOEHN: It's really important. DALLEK: And expression of that mansity (ph) was in the fact that Franklin Roosevelt never stepped forward to support African-Americans. He never worked to support an anti-lynching law. But the irony is that at the end of his administration, after 12 years, black voters had moved from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party and have remained there ever since. And Roosevelt, because of the new deal programs, those alphabet agencies, they went down to the lowest levels, so to speak, of the economy and black voters felt that he was on their side. And, you know, that wonderful anecdote about industrial worker who said, Franklin Roosevelt was the only man in the White House would ever would have understood that my boss is a son of a bitch. DICKERSON: Mark, you mentioned earlier that the Iraq War was the one instance in which the son talked to the father. Incredibly close and yet he didn't turn to him that much. Talk a little bit about that, the tightness of their bond, what that was founded on, but then also the fact that the -- they kind of -- he wasn't calling his father all the time for advice. UPDEGROVE: Nor was his father imposing his point of view on his son. And that goes back to the inherent humility of George H.W. Bush. He didn't want to be an added burden to his son. He didn't want to say, hey, junior, here's how you can do things. He would also concede, as would George W. Bush say, that the world had changed since his father was president. I think he harbored some reservations about his son's policy in Iraq, but he didn't want to do anything to jeopardize the presidency. If I could make one point, though, John, Nancy talked about comportment. You can't under emphasize the importance of civility in times of great division. And one of the things that George W. Bush says in his inaugural address in 2001, when we were very divided after that election of 2000 was contested. He said, civility is not a tactic, it is a determined choice of trust over cynicism, community over chaos. We could live by that adage today. CHERNOW: You said it. DICKERSON: Ron, let me ask you about -- these were solitary figures that we're all talking about, but they also had deep connections with other people. In the case of Grant, was it Sherman -- I was basically struck by their relationship, but then he also had -- was it Rollins? Talk about that interplay with other people. They were -- these weren't just totally solitary people. CHERNOW: There always has to be kind of a fearless truth teller on the staff. And what happens when Grant becomes brigadier general, he invites a young lawyer from Galina (ph) named John Rollins (ph) on to his staff. And Rollins takes his position as agitant (ph), really chief of staff, on one condition, that Grant not touch a drop of liquor for the reset of the war or he, Rollins, would call him on it. Well, alas, Grant fell off the wagon, you know, many times, and Rollins privately called him on it but not publicly because he really felt that the fate of the union rested on the shoulders of Ulysses S. Grant. So I think we owe a tremendous dealt to John Rollins, who later became secretary of war for always having the courage to tell Grant what he needed to know. DICKERSON: Robert, of course there's Eleanor Roosevelt. CHERNOW: That's right. DALLEK: Yes. But he owed a great debt to Eleanor and to Harold Dickey (ph), who was also a voice for the liberal side of his administration. He was a very careful politician, you know, when it came to the Holocaust, for example. He saw the anti-Semitism in the country, the anti-immigrant sentiments, but Eleanor was so angry when Breckinridge Long, the assistant secretary of state, wouldn't let 80 Jewish refugees from Portugal into the country. And she went to Franklin and she said, this guy is a fascist. And Franklin said, you must not say that, Eleanor. And she said, but, Franklin, it's true. And she was tough. And direct. DICKERSON: Nancy, finally to you. Rachel Carson is different than all these others. KOEHN: She sure is. DICKERSON: And explain why -- she had -- she had to do kind of two jobs. KOEHN: Right. So Rachel Carson is the only woman in my book, the environmentalists, whose environmental really builder, right, who did more than any one person to found the modern environmental movement by publishing \"Silent Spring\" in 1962. So the fascinating thing about her story in the context of these other five -- other four very interesting driven men, is that she's -- she's the primary caretaker for her birth family all her life. For her parents, for her sisters and brothers -- her sister and brother, then for her sister's kids, then for her sister's kids' kids. She's doing all that. She has a government job. She's trying to write a book. And in the late 1950s, she's battling breast cancer while she's adopted her grand-nephew at the age of 50. And not sure if she can beat the clock to finish a book that she knows is both dangerous and potentially really will rock the world. And so her story, a particularly female story, is a story of a very, very powerful kind of courage and grace in pursuit of something really important and decent. DICKERSON: All right. Well, these are all wonderful books. (INAUDIBLE) have to end our conversation there.",

            "article_content": "JOHN DICKERSON: Today on FACE THE NATION: On this Thanksgiving weekend broadcast, we'll explore what history teaches us about leadership and times of crisis. With historians including Robert Dallek, his new book is \"Franklin D. Roosevelt: A Political Life.\" Ron Chernow's latest work is \"Grant,\" a biography of our eighteenth President Ulysses Grant. Mark Updegrove has written about the forty-first and forty-third Presidents Bush. His new book is called \"The Last Republicans.\" And we'll also be joined by Nancy Koehn, author of \"Forged in Crisis: The Power of Courageous Leadership in Turbulent Times.\" Do leaders share common traits? What does the past tell us about the present? We'll also talk about genius and creativity with Walter Isaacson, author of \"Leonardo Da Vinci.\" And back in the present, our analysts will catch you up on what you missed this week and look ahead to the end of the year's sprint in Congress. It's all ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I'm John Dickerson. Most of our post-Thanksgiving broadcasts will be devoted to a discussion on leadership in times of crisis. But we begin with the news. President Trump is winding up a five-day trip to his Palm Beach club, Mar-a-Lago, where he played golf with Tiger Woods and Dustin Johnson and also wished U.S. troops overseas a happy Thanksgiving. Before he left, he spoke with reporters and said that he is supporting Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore. WOMAN: Is an accused child molester better than a Democrat? Is an accused child molester better than a Democrat? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, he denies it. Look, he denies it. He says it didn't happen. And, you know, you have to listen to him also. You're talking about-- he said forty years ago this did not happen. JOHN DICKERSON: Minnesota Democrat Al Franken responded to new allegations that he touched women while taking photographs with them. \"I feel terribly that I've made some women feel badly and for that I am so sorry, and I want to make sure that never happens again.\" We will hear more from Senator Franken later today. His office tells us that he will be doing interviews with WCCO-TV, our CBS affiliate in Minneapolis, as well as Minnesota Public Radio and the Minneapolis Star Tribune. Congress returns to Washington this week in addition to dealing with new claims of sexual harassment against House Democrat John Conyers, they face a daunting to-do list with three weeks left before the holiday break. Government funding expires on December 8th, so the government will shut down unless an agreement is made. The Senate must decide by December 14th whether to reinstitute sanctions against Iran, lifted under the Iranian nuclear deal. Funding has expired for the Children's Health Insurance Program and the money to cover nine million children will effectively run out by the end of the year so will the authority for a key surveillance program used to combat terrorism. Then there's that enormous tax cut package that the President wants passed by Christmas. And Congress needs also to pass a hurricane relief bill to help those affected by this year's storms. And with all of that on the table, we turn to our panel. Susan Page is Washington bureau chief of USA Today. Reihan Salam is executive editor of the National Review. And Jamelle Bouie is the chief political correspondent for Slate and a CBS News contributor. Susan, I'll start with you. Roy Moore, the White House distanced themselves at first but now the President is all in. He tweeted this morning against Roy Moore's opponent. What changed? SUSAN PAGE (USA Today/@SusanPage): Well, I think the President sees some parallels perhaps with his own situation. He was accused of sexual misconduct. He won the election anyway. I think he would also very much prefer to have a Republican vote in the Senate rather than a Democratic vote. And this will be a big test for voters in Alabama above-- of the-- of the personal versus the political, the politics of Alabama say any Republican will beat any Democrat but we're at a moment in our country's history where there is an attention to the personal behavior of powerful men and that might turn this election. We just don't know. JOHN DICKERSON: Jamelle, there is maybe a split, maybe there's not a split but there appears to be a split between the President who would-- who doesn't believe the Roy Moore's excusers and Senate Republicans-- JAMELLE BOUIE (Slate Magazine/@jbouie): Right. JOHN DICKERSON: --including McConnell and Mike Lee, other senators who've looked at the evidence, looked at responses from Roy Moore and said, we believe the accusers. Do you think that split matters? What do you think happens with that split?  JAMELLE BOUIE: I think that's what matters in terms of what happens if Roy Moore wins. If Moore ends up prevailing in this Senate contest, then Senate Republicans who have-- as you said-- as you said stated that they believe the accusers have in-- in both harsh words, not so harsh words, condemned Moore will have to deal with the fact that they now have an accused child molester in their caucus. And there will-- I think there will be serious pressure to expel him from the Senate as a result. And that-- that is a direct blow to their attempt to get through this busy December to-- to advance their agenda and it's a major political weight for the entire party. And I'm not sure that President Trump is necessarily looking at it-- looking at this a couple steps down the road. I think he's very much focused on, I got to get a win, I got to get a win. But once you just back away a little bit, having Moore win and then come to the Senate presents just a whole host of political problems that will not be easy to deal with. JOHN DICKERSON: And cultural ones because if this moment is one in which we're trying to figure out whether the culture enables, the question is Reihan, whether-- whether the voters of Alabama are enabling this kind of behavior which is to say somebody gets accused and then their party rallies around them and it kind of covers over the accusation. REIHAN SALAM (National Review/@reihan): It's very important to keep in mind that in the case of Roy Moore, this was also the case for Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. There are many reluctant voters. Votes who vote for their candidate on the basis pretty much of negative partisanship. The thought that the opposing candidate would be such a disaster, so if you look at Doug Jones, it's very striking that here you have a candidate who is not a classic conservative southern Democrat. He is a very mainstream Democrat who has all of the mainstream Democratic positions on, for example, abortion rights and much else. So the fact that he is as competitive as he is right now, actually tells you quite a lot about the state of the Republican brand, particularly the state of the Republican brand among middle class, upper middle class, college educated Alabamian voters. The fact that it's quite possible that he will win this election speaks to the general weakness of the party, because you think that the party membership alone would be enough to carry even someone like Roy Moore through given the climate of extreme negative partisanship. JOHN DICKERSON: What are the Democrats looking like in Alabama, Susan? I mean, are they going to rally or are they undone by this-- these allegations or is that-- or might they not turn out and Roy Moore will make it? SUSAN PAGE: It is-- it is not clear that Democrats are going to be energized especially African-Americans in Alabama. And this is, I think, a bit of a dilemma for Doug Jones, because if you brought in Barack Obama to kind of rally African-American voters, do you then repel some of those Republicans voters who don't want to vote for Roy Moore, but have been long opposed to Barack Obama. I think that is one of the complicating factors here. JOHN DICKERSON: Jamelle, Democrats have their own issues. So, Al Franken is going to speak later today, new accusations against him. The question being whether Democrats lose standing to speak on this issue if they don't deal with their own as harshly as they like to see Republicans deal with Roy Moore. We also have John Conyers, a long-time Democrat in the House who's had an accusation come out. So how do they manage this issue? JAMELLE BOUIE: In my-- it's clear right now that Democrats are trying hard not to manage this issue, not to putting pressure on either Conyers or Franken. My sense is that you're-- you're right that their credibility on this issue depends on being able to take a strong stance on it, even if the details of, say, Franken's incidents are-- are sort of-- I think in order of magnitude different than what Roy Moore's accused of. But even still it requires I think decisive action to show the public that the party is taking these things seriously. And in the case of-- of Franken, it's not as if-- if there were pressure for him to resign that they would be endangering his Senate seat, right. Like, politically this doesn't-- this doesn't seem-- this doesn't-- isn't a direct threat to their minority or future majority. So my view is that Democrats really should take the lead on this and that it does not reflect well to be so hesitant to put pressure on Senator Franken. SUSAN PAGE: You know, his-- his offenses aren't as serious as Roy Moore, but they're just so stupid, you know. He's a U.S. Senator and he's groping women at the state fair. JOHN DICKERSON: Right. SUSAN PAGE: What was he thinking? He was no longer a comic at-- at that point. And in-- in a way, it's-- as you say, it's easy for Democrats if Roy-- if Al Franken is forced to resign, which I think is not likely but is still possible. Not only would he be-- likely be replaced by a Democrat, he would probably be replaced by a Democratic woman given the very strong ranks of women in Minnesota politics. JOHN DICKERSON: Right. REIHAN SALAM: It's also true, however, that Minnesota is a state trending Republican over time. When you see a state like Virginia become more Democratic, that's partly because of domestic migration. It's the same reason why states like Minnesota, Pennsylvania and what have you are becoming more winnable for Republicans. So, you know, the next election there-- for his seat is going to be in 2020. That's a fair bit of time. The question is does the party matter more than Al Franken's own survival and success? In Roy Moore's case, it's very clear that he has at-- not the best relationship with the Republican Party and the Republican establishment, right? So there-- it kind of makes sense that he's quite happy to wage war on all the Republicans who are calling for him to step down. Al Franken presumably is someone who cares about the health of a larger progressive movement and the Democratic Party and it's very clear that he is a lot less popular than the next at-bat Democrat in that state. JOHN DICKERSON: Let's move on now to policy and all the business that Congress has in front of it. Jamelle, when they return tax cuts to the central question, how-- where do you think that conversation stands on the race to get this passed before the end of the year? JAMELLE BOUIE: Well, at the moment, I think the Republican tax bills coming in for a fair amount of criticism for its-- its expense, its sheer cost, that these tax cuts will end up adding huge amounts to the federal debt, the federal budget deficit. And I think that there are some Republicans who are-- have begun to voice their concern about that fact. Susan Collins has stated that she's not happy with where the bill-- where the Senate bill stands right now. So I think if-- if there's a path to this happening, it's going to revolve around sort of finding ways to-- I mean much frankly like the-- like the health care battles earlier this year. Finding ways to assuage those handful of Senate Republicans who are not entirely comfortable with either the policy consequences or the potential political consequences of the bill at hand. JOHN DICKERSON: Susan, what do you think is going to-- are these real blockage to getting this passed in the Senate or can they be dealt with these (INDISTINCT) Republicans? SUSAN PAGE: I think what-- the amazing thing is that this tax bill is still alive in the face of like twenty-five percent public support and no actual coherent tax plan of the two-- of the House and the Senate to agree on. And yet there has not really been a stated opposition by any Republican senator. Ron Johnson expressed some concerns but it was more like a bid to buy him off with something. So think it is possible that they pass the tax bill. And I think that is remarkable. JOHN DICKERSON: Ideologically, Reihan, how does this bill match between the Trump view of the world and the sort of traditional Republican view of the world? REIHAN SALAM: Well, it's a very awkward marriage of the two. One could argue that Republicans learned one lesson, kind of half of a lesson from the populous moment. That lessons is, well, it's okay if we tax affluent blue state professionals. But with that revenue that you gain from taxing those folks, they've wound up giving it in the form of corporate tax cuts rather than in the form of tax cuts for lower middle class and working class households. That is a very odd lesson to draw from the populous moment. However, there's another side of this. Which is that a lot of people have argued that, hey, you could you've done this in a bipartisan way. I think that is very, very unlikely. Speaker of House and Nancy Pelosi knows that you need complete clarity on this. If you'd had some Democrats cooperating, that would have muddied the issue for Democrats, so this is always going to be something owned by Republicans and that's why they shouldn't have gone so far in my view on the corporate rate cuts, because they're still going to offer a better deal to those constituencies, to put it crudely than the Democrats. And really this was way of winning over Trump and it's not clear that Trump has a good sense of how the politics of this ought to work. It's not clear to me that anyone has a real appetite for a twenty percent corporate tax rate that they're actually going to go to the polls on the basis of a twenty percent corporate tax rate. JOHN DICKERSON: I'm going to end with a philosophical question. Susan, I'll start with you. Which is-- there's a lot of things that get covered but there stuff that doesn't get covered in these periods. And I wondered if each of you have an idea-- something that-- that you've noticed that's been happening that-- that deserves more attention that's out there, Susan? SUSAN PAGE: You know, one of the things we've talked about on this roundtable is how the Republicans have been unsuccessful in delivering anything since winning unified control of the Washington capital. If you look at state capitals, that's not the case. Big Republican gains there. If you look at even a hot button issue like abortion, Republican state legislators have managed to pass bans on abortion in some circumstances in-- just in the last six months since the last election in five states bans on abortion in certain circumstances. Eleven states major restrictions on abortion, in three states new restrictions on funding for Planned Parenthood. So the gridlock that has affected Washington has not affected state capitals and the Republicans who have made the gains there. And that shows the importance of the midterms next year not just for Congress, for the state legislators too. JOHN DICKERSON: State legislators. JAMELLE BOUIE: So in the-- the conversation about Alabama we talked about black voters in the state and their enthusiasm. Before the Virginia election, there's a lot of talk about black voters and their enthusiasm, but I think lost in these conversations about African-American voters is the very real fact that efforts at voter suppression is ongoing in this state, efforts to sort of restrict access to the ballot. And then on the federal level, it is simply the case of President Trump's cabinet members-- Attorney General Jeff Sessions has been remarkably successful at turning the Justice Department's mission away from its-- its charge of defending the civil rights of Americans. And I-- I think that's going completely under the radar in our-- in our sort of focus on whatever the President is saying on any given day. JOHN DICKERSON: Reihan? REIHAN SALAM: One of President Trump's unique contributions to the debate has been this idea that the United States ought to take more strategic approach to trade. That's something he's been arguing for, you know, over thirty years. Yet there's a real possibility that his tax reform, the one that he's endorsed will actually widen U.S. trade deficits and will actually put the U.S. tradable sector in more vulnerable position that moving to a territorial tax system is something that will actually facilitate the off-shoring of production and much else. So there are two elements of the Trump message that seem to really be contradicting each other, and the question is whether those elements in the administration who care about trade, who care about a more strategic approach will eventually gain the upper hand because right now, they're not. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Thanks to all of you. We'll be right back in a moment with our book panel. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: We turn now to conversation with four authors whose new books examine leadership in times of crisis. Robert Dallek is the author of \"Franklin D. Roosevelt: A Political Life.\" Ron Chernow is author of \"Grant,\" a new biography as the Civil War Union general and the eighteenth President. Nancy Koehn is the author of \"Forged in Crisis,\" which looks at five historical figures who demonstrated steady leadership in times of-- of upheaval. And Mark Updegrove's new book \"The Last Republicans\" examines the presidencies of George W. Bush and George Herbert Walker Bush and the relationship between the father and son. Welcome to all of you. I'm so glad you're here. Ron, let me start with you. You are all historians but you are all storytellers, too. So, put General Grant, President Grant on stage for us, give us your favorite story. RON CHERNOW (\"Grant\"): My favorite story. Okay, it's Virginia 1864, its Spotsylvania. Grant is standing on the edge of a wood when the lethal shell comes whizzing by him. It passes within three inches of his ears. Grant doesn't blink, he doesn't flinch, his facial expression doesn't change. He turns to his edged and then said, \"Hudson, go get that shell. Let's see what the enemy is firing at us.\" The reason I love this story is that shows Grant's literally coolness under fire. And his metabolism was such that at moments where, you know, the rest of us would be fearful or anxious he gets very cool and focused. JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah. He was more cool on the battlefield almost maybe than in the barracks. And we'll talk-- talk about that-- that later. Nancy, you have five to choose from. NANCY KOEHN (\"Forged in Crisis\"/@nancykoehn): Yeah. JOHN DICKERSON: But which one-- which one story do you want to tell? NANCY KOEHN: Well, it's October 1915, Ernest Shackleton is marooned with twenty-seven crew members on an iceberg off the coast of Antarctica. His ship is being crushed by the ice and the men are intense. You know, it's on the berg and he's pacing at night. He can't sleep. He doesn't know how he's going to get them all home alive. And-- and he records later in his diary, \"I had no idea but I-- I had to get them home alive. May I be made into what I need to be in order to do that.\" The next morning, he awakes each of the men by coming to their tent with a cup of hot tea and says, \"Ship and stores now gone, lads, we'll go home.\" And again, the coolness under pressure, the commitment, right, in the-- you know, in the perfect storm to do something very worthy and his own uncertainty, right, which was very important but not evident to his men. JOHN DICKERSON: Right. NANCY KOEHN: Forged in crisis. JOHN DICKERSON: Right. That's great. Robert Dallek, how about you? What's FDR-- what moments from-- ROBERT DALLEK (\"Franklin D. Roosevelt: A Political Life\"): Well, he had a great sense of humor. And Ben Cohen came in the Oval Office one morning and Roosevelt was chuckling. And Cohen said to him, \"Would you mind sharing the joke with me, Mister President?\" And Roosevelt said \"All right, Ben. Eleanor was just in here. She had been to her doctor this morning for her annual physical.\" And I said to her, \"So, Eleanor, what did the doctor have to say about that big ass of yours?\" And she said, \"Oh, Franklin, he had nothing at all to say about you.\" JOHN DICKERSON: Mark, you tell the story of a father and a son. What moment from-- from that do you want to tee up for us? MARK UPDEGROVE (\"The Last Republicans\"/@MarkKUpdegrove): There are two moments, John. One is in 1990. The-- the Christmas holidays, the extended Bush family convenes at Camp David. And it's on the eve of Desert Storm and George H.W. Bush has a decision to make as to whether to send ground troops into Kuwait to drive out the Iraqi invaders. It's a big decision. And he has a dream that night that his father is alive again. His father who died in the 1970s is alive. And-- and he finds out he's at a hotel room near a golf course and he goes to that hotel room and there's his dad and he recalls him big, strong, highly respected. And he hugs him and says \"I miss you very much.\" JOHN DICKERSON: Hmm. MARK UPDEGROVE: Flash forward a dozen years and improbably the Bush family is once again at Camp David-- David, celebrating the Christmas holiday with George W. Bush as President, confronted with the same enemy and-- and trying to figure out whether he should wage war against Saddam Hussein. But his father is there, big, strong, highly respected. And he can draw on him for his counsel, which he does. The one and only time he talks to his father about Iraq, asks him what she do. Saddam Hussein at that point is flaunting U.N. sanctions and rattling sabers and his father says, \"If he's not complying, you have to go to war.\" And-- and you have to-- for-- for the sake of history you've got to understand this dynamic between father and son whose presidencies were just eight years apart. JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah. I want to get back to that. Robert, let me ask you-- let's step back now and-- and look at each of your books. You write about your-- in-- in your book, you write, \"It seems well to remind Americans that the system has been capable of generating candidates for high office whose commitment to the national interests exceeds their flaws and ambitions.\" Is that that goal of your book? ROBERT DALLEK: Yes. And, you know, Roosevelt had an extraordinary hold on the public's imagination. For twelve years, his approval rating never went below fifty percent, even in 1937-38 when he was struggling over court-packing and purging the party of conservative Democrats from the South. He still had a fifty, fifty-five, even sixty percent approval rating. And I love those two stories about the man who stopped Eleanor on the street after Franklin died and said, \"I miss the way your husband used to speak to me about my government or the man who stood by the railway track as the train from Warm Springs carrying the body went back to Hyde Park.\" A man was sobbing and somebody said to him, \"Did you know the President?\" He said, \"No. But he knew me.\" Can anyone imagine that? Somebody saying that about the current incumbent? JOHN DICKERSON: Nancy, you chose five people, why these five? NANCY KOEHN: A combination of reasons, John. One, they-- I was very, very interested for personal and professional reason. I've been teaching leadership for a long time at Harvard Business School in how-- and the emotional experience of leadership. What's it like for the leader, him or herself to be in the center, right, of the-- the waves and the winds. And I wanted-- I wanted a selection of people that-- that would-- that could-- that could-- that were made. Leaders that were made not born, each of these people was made, Rachel Carson, the environmentalist, Frederick Douglass and the others, Lincoln, Shackleton and Bonhoeffer. And I also want-- so that's why I needed to be able to reconstruct the making. And then last but not least, each of these people like the people in all of your books stumbled into a worthy mission. Either they, you know, like Douglas-- Frederick Douglass, they founded early on and slavery or they-- they bumped into it. And so I wanted to reconstruct again to-- to your point with your book, Bob, how-- what-- what is it like to-- to move the boulder of goodness forth on something big and good? JOHN DICKERSON: Let me interrupt you there. NANCY KOEHN: Yeah. JOHN DICKERSON: We're going to take a quick break. We'll have a lot more from our book panel when we come back. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: You can keep up with the news of the week by subscribing to the FACE THE NATION Diary podcast available every Friday evening. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: And we'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. More from our authors' panel. Plus, Walter Isaacson on \"Leonardo Da Vinci\". Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We continue our conversation with authors whose new books explore leadership amid crisis. Robert Dallek is the author of \"Franklin D. Roosevelt: A Political Life,\" Ron Chernow is author of \"Grant,\" Nancy Koehn is the author of \"Forged in Crisis,\" and Mark Updegrove is the author of \"The Last Republicans.\" Mark, I'll start with you on this question of what is your-- you-- you call your book \"The Last Republicans,\" not the Bush family or something, why that title?  MARK UPDEGROVE: Well, because it was clear that the Bush represents-- Bushes, rather, represent a last-- the establishment Republican Party. Right now we see a party at war with itself. You still have establishment members of that party, but there are insurgents who have taken over. And the party really doesn't stand for anything specific. There is no binding platform or principles. It's really what-- it's standard-bearer, the very capricious and unpredictable Donald Trump decides it wants to be. So in some manner, the-- the Bushes, George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush, represent the end to a type of Republicanism. JOHN DICKERSON: Ron, why \"Grant\" and was it the Grant when you went into the book is the same one as when you were finally done? RON CHERNOW: Oh, yeah. You know, I have a contrarian streak. And it's just so whenever I feel that the stereotype of a particular historical figure is hardened into a caricature I'm attacked to it. You know, so with Grant I was interested really in retiring three chief myths about him. One that he was a crude and brutal, but truth is he's a general, in fact, he was a dazzling strategist. I wanted to retire the idea that he had somehow stumbled through the entire Civil War in an alcoholic haze, he did have a drinking problem but he never drank during much less before a-- a battle. And I also most importantly wanted to change the image of his presidency from one that was completely dominated by corruption and cronyism to one that, in fact, had many elements of courage in terms of his effort to protect the four million former slaves, now full-fledged American citizens. And Grant, I was crusading attorney general named Amos Akerman uses the newly created Justice Department and really crashes the Ku Klux Klan which had taken over the South. JOHN DICKERSON: Robert, I want to-- as we talk about presidential characteristics, one that strikes me about FDR was that sense of guile and his lack of transparency. We talk about must be constantly truthful, he was pretty good at not always being truthful with everybody. Was that a key skill of his? ROBERT DALLEK: It was, indeed. And, in fact, you know, he would never say in public the kinds of things that he would say in private. For example, after he won in 1944, he disliked Tom Dewey, the opponent, and privately called him \"a son of a bitch.\" But he would never say that in public because he was someone who was very mindful of-- he would be half a step ahead of public opinion. And it gave him a sense of-- of the country, a sense of-- of leadership. And, you know, he was an extraordinary character. After all, he was a man who couldn't walk. He-- and he only made one reference to his disability once in his entire presidency of twelve years. When he came back to Yalta, he said, \"I know you will excuse me for sitting down for I carry ten pounds of steel around each of my lower limbs.\" So the only time he ever made reference to the fact that he was-- but what a story. Here's a man who is immobilized, couldn't walk, and he wrote a letter to another-- to a congressman, saying \"When you get frustrated, you can get up and walk around.\" He said, \"I'm stuck in this chair.\" JOHN DICKERSON: Hmm. ROBERT DALLEK: And-- but privately he was always, you know, much more candid than he was publicly. JOHN DICKERSON: I'm struck by the picture in your book, the last one of him, where he looks like a man who has had to carry around a lot of-- NANCY KOEHN: Yeah. JOHN DICKERSON: --weight in his entire life. Mark, let me ask you about the Bush code. We were just talking about a letter that FDR wrote, \"I was struck by a letter that George Herbert Walker Bush wrote to his sons during Watergate.\" Tell us about that letter, and also the father was always kind of taking whatever moment was happening and using it as a lesson for his sons it felt like about this Bush code. MARK UPDEGROVE: It was a primer of sorts. So George H. W. Bush while he is the chairman of the Republican Party in the-- in the-- at the height of Watergate, two weeks before Richard Nixon resigns, writes a letter to his boys, he calls him his lads, talking about that moment of why it's important, how you stick by a friend in need, you don't-- you don't go with the crowd, you don't join the mob, if you don't have to. You-- you stick by your principles and you-- you reserve your judgment. One of the things he says in that is, \"Understand that power accompanied by arrogance is very dangerous. It is particularly dangerous when men with no experience have it for they can abuse our great institutions.\" That's amazing because the first part of that is clearly about Richard Nixon, the-- the arrogance and power. The last part of that is a hypothetical. RON CHERNOW: Yeah. MARK UPDEGROVE: Somebody with no experience. Nixon clearly had experience since he had been a congressman, he had been a senator, he had been vice president. And so this is a hypothetical and so it wasn't hard to infer what the Bush family felt about Donald Trump as he emerged as the-- the clear man to beat in 2016. ROBERT DALLEK: Yeah. JOHN DICKERSON: Nancy, in-- in your book you talk about something called \"the gathering,\" which I want you to explain. But you also have-- when you talk about leadership, people are grabbing it. In other words, they are not-- there's this question always of greatness, is it thrust upon you or do you seize it? What's your take on that? And explain what you mean by gathering. NANCY KOEHN: So I-- I-- I think that-- that-- that the man or the leader makes the moment as well as the moment making a leader. So Grant is transformed as a general over the course of the Civil War. FDR, right, is changed and developed through the course of his four terms. MARK UPDEGROVE: Yeah. NANCY KOEHN: I'm sure this is true of both forty-one and forty-three. So-- so greatness is not thrust upon us in some kind of divine strike of lightning. Like, greatness is something that I think proceeds very significantly from one person's willingness to say, \"I want to get better.\" And-- and to FDR, I'm going to show up in service to my mission with dignity, right, and humanity and compassion and a sense of the larger national interest. But that-- that development, the ability of FDR to do that, the ability of Grant, right, to-- to do such important things toward ensuring that the transformation of American the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendment actually happened. That wasn't something they-- they-- that they downloaded an app for, John, right? MARK UPDEGROVE: Yeah, but they had-- NANCY KOEHN: They-- they had to-- they had to work at it. MARK UPDEGROVE: Mm-Hm. NANCY KOEHN: They had to-- and they all had mile-- all these people had mileage with failure, right, which I maintain is important part-- RON CHERNOW: Yes. NANCY KOEHN: --of the making of resilient, courageous leaders. JOHN DICKERSON: Well, Ron, tell-- pick-- pick up exactly on that feeling with-- with Grant and failure, I mean, I can think of so many instances where there was a failure and not only does he say, like I'm again at (INDISTINCT). But also if he hadn't had his failure out West, he maybe never would have come back East and be in a position to be hero. RON CHERNOW: Absolutely. And I think what happens, you know, he feels that one business after another before the Civil War. By the time the Civil War breaks out, he's almost forty. He's been reduced to working as a clerk in his father's leather goods store in Galena where he's a clerk junior to his two younger brothers, and the war breaks out two months later. He's a colonel four months later. He's a brigadier general ten months later. He's a major general. And then four years later, he has a million soldiers under his command. But I think that that pre-war experience of failure was extremely important because he learned how to wider adversity. It gave him a kind of toughness and perseverance that would be extremely important in a war that was very long, bloody, and protect-- protracted. MARK UPDEGROVE: Yeah. RON CHERNOW: And also gave him an audacity, he had nothing to lose and everything to gain. You see that it's Shiloh again and again. He takes colossal risks that no other union general would have dared to take. JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah. Robert, we-- we, obviously, with FDR there was the-- the polio. And I was struck when you point out about him becoming an actor as a result of that. ROBERT DALLEK: Oh, yeah. JOHN DICKERSON: A key skill for a President. ROBERT DALLEK: Yes. He said to Orson Welles once, \"Orson, you and I are the two greatest actors in America.\" But, you know, he had a kind of self-confidence and I think developed as you suggested, Nancy-- NANCY KOEHN: Absolutely. ROBERT DALLEK: --as they go through the presidency and struggle with these crises, but Roosevelt's idea of the presidency was said-- was FDR in the White House. See, that he was the man to do the job. And, of course, he had the example of his distant cousin Theodore-- NANCY KOEHN: Absolutely. ROBERT DALLEK: --who had been a-- NANCY KOEHN: Talk about confidence, right? ROBERT DALLEK: That's right. RON CHERNOW: Yeah. NANCY KOEHN: (INDISTINCT). ROBERT DALLEK: Right. And he came from a distinguished family. They were patricians and it served him brilliantly. MARK UPDEGROVE: But it's very clear that great leadership grows from deeply-held values. RON CHERNOW: Yes. ROBERT DALLEK: Exactly. MARK UPDEGROVE: That's-- that's so obvious in the case of both Grant and-- and-- and FDR. RON CHERNOW: And also I think one of the important to emphasize at the moment is, you know, honesty. Grant is President with such a stickler for honesty that one day a visitor came to his office who could just walk into the White House at that point. And Grant in his office hears the White House, usher telling someone that the President is out of the office. Well, when the stranger leaves, Grant pops out of the office and says to the-- the ushers that, \"You should have said that I was otherwise engaged.\" He said, \"I don't lie for myself and I don't like people lying for me.\" NANCY KOEHN: You know, and Lincoln had the same sense of, you know, this kind of very high bar, right, on-- on the stair. There's a wonderful line that he-- he-- he says to one of the quarter masters, you can't-- when-- when-- when they're victualling the White House providing beef to the White House, he said, \"You can't give me and my family the best choice cuts of meat when my soldiers, right, don't have socks and enough muskets.\" So the sense that the leader sets a standard, right, of honesty, of comportment, of dignity and that people, the understanding on FDR's part on Grant's, part on both the Bush President's part, that people take their cues from leaders, right, not just kids, all kinds of people. Look to leaders for examples, of courage under pressure, for a sense of direction. So I think another element of leading in turbulent times, John, is the element of how leaders show up and in response to what values, Mark. ROBERT DALLEK: Yeah. NANCY KOEHN: It's really important. ROBERT DALLEK: And-- and expression of that, Nancy, was in the fact that Franklin Roosevelt never stepped forward to support African-Americans. He never worked to support an anti-lynching law. But the irony is that at the end of his administration after twelve years, black voters had moved from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party and have remained there ever since. And Roosevelt because of the new deal programs, those alphabet agencies, they went down to the lowest levels so to speak of the economy and black voters felt that he was on their side. And, you know, that wonderful anecdote about the industrial work who said, \"Franklin Roosevelt was the only man in the White House who ever would have understood that my boss is a son of a bitch.\" JOHN DICKERSON: Mark-- Mark, you mentioned earlier that the Iraq war was the one instance in which the son talked to the father. Incredibly close and yet he didn't turn to him that much. Talk a little bit about that, the-- the tightness of their bond, what that was founded on but then also the fact that they kind of -- he wasn't calling his father all the time for advice. MARK UPDEGROVE: Nor was his father imposing his point of view on his son. And that goes back to the inherent humility of George H. W. Bush. He didn't want to be an added burden to his son. He didn't want to say, hey, junior, here's how you can do things. He would also concede as-- as would George W. Bush say that the world had changed since his father was President. I think he harbored some reservations about his son's policy in Iraq, but he didn't want to do anything to jeopardize the presidency. If I could make one point, though, John, Nancy talked about comportment. You can't underemphasize the importance of civility in times of great division. And one of the things that-- that George W. Bush says in his inaugural address in 2001 when we were very divided after that election of 2000 was-- JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah. MARK UPDEGROVE: --was contested. He said, \"Civility is not a tactic, it is a determined choice of trust over cynicism, community over chaos.\" RON CHERNOW: Yeah. MARK UPDEGROVE: We could live by that-- that adage today. ROBERT DALLEK: You said it. JOHN DICKERSON: Ron, let me ask you about-- these were solitary figures that we're all talking about, but that also had deep connections with other people. In the case of Grant, was it Sherman, I was basically struck by their relationship, but then he also had-- was it Rawlins, talk about that interplay with other people. These weren't just totally solitary figures. RON CHERNOW: There always has to be kind of a fearless truth teller on the-- the staff. And what happens when Grant becomes brigadier general, he invites a young lawyer from Galena named John Rawlins on to his staff. And Rawlins takes his position, his adjutant, really chief of staff on one condition that Grant not touch a drop of liquor for the rest of the-- the war, he, Rawlins would call him on it. Well, at last Grant fell off the wagon, you know, many times, and Rawlins privately called him on it but not publicly, because he felt that the fate of the Union rested on the shoulders of Ulysses S. Grant. So I think we owe tremendous debt to John Rawlins who let it became secretary of-- of war for always having the courage to tell Grant what he needed to know. JOHN DICKERSON: Robert, of course, there's Eleanor Roosevelt. ROBERT DALLEK: That's right. Yeah. But he-- he owed a great debt to Eleanor and to Harold Ickes who was also a voice for liberal side of his administration. He was a very careful politician, you know, when it came to the Holocaust, for example. He saw the anti-Semitism in the country, the anti-immigrant sentiments, but Eleanor was so angry when Brajkovic along with the secretary of state would let eighty Jewish refugees from Portugal into the country and she went to Franklin and she said, \"This guy is a fascist.\" And Franklin said, \"You must not say that, Eleanor.\" And she said, \"But Franklin, it's true.\" And she was tough and direct. JOHN DICKERSON: Nancy, finally to you, Rachel Carson is different than all these others. NANCY KOEHN: She sure is. JOHN DICKERSON: And-- and explain why she had-- she had to do kind of two jobs. NANCY KOEHN: Right. So Rachel Carson is the only woman in my book, the environmentalist who's environmental, really, builder, right, who did more than any one person to found the modern environmental movement by publishing \"Silent Spring\" in 1962. So the fascinating thing about her story in the context of these other five-- other four very interesting driven men is that she is-- she is the primary caretaker for her birth family all her life. For her parents, for her sisters and brother-- her sister and brother then for her sister's kids then for her sister's kid's kids. She's doing all that, she has a government job, she's trying to write a book. And in the late 1950s, she's battling breast cancer while she's adopted her grand nephew at the age of fifty. And not sure she can beat the clock to finish a book that she knows is both dangerous and potentially really will rock the world. And so her story, particularly female story, is a story of a very, very powerful kind of courage and grace in pursuit of something really important and decent. JOHN DICKERSON: Right. Well, these are all wonderful books. Unfortunately we'll have to end our conversation there. We'll be right back with another author and another book, Walter Isaacson. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: We're joined now by Walter Isaacson, the author of new book \"Leonardo Da Vinci\" which explores the life and work of the original renaissance man. All right. Walter, you were my boss, you always said that stories are at the heart of these things. So what story for you starts it with Leonardo? WALTER ISAACSON (\"Leonardo Da Vinci\"/@Walterisaacson): I think when he turns that unnerving milestone of becoming thirty years old and he's been, yeah you and I remember that a bit. And he's been a painter-- moderately successful in Florence but he has trouble finishing his painting. And it's kind of worse because his father is a notary and has notarized some of the contracts of those paintings. So Leonardo decides it's time to seek new horizons, and so he's part of a delegation this goes from Florence to Milan, a cultural delegation because that's how Florence had its influence. You know it was-- it didn't have a great military, kept losing to Pisa, but, you know, they would send its architects and artists to other cities, and so Florence became, you know, what I would call soft power. And so he goes there and he goes as a musician because he's invented a lot of musical instruments. But when he gets to Milan, he doesn't want to go home. So he writes the coolest job application letter in history. The eleven paragraphs, and the first ten are all about what he can do in engineering, in anatomy, in art and science and controlling the flows of waters and building castles. Only in the eleventh paragraph in the end that he says, I can also paint as well as anyone. And so you see Leonardo loving everything in nature and just wanting to be, you know, jack of all trades. JOHN DICKERSON: Is that his key quality that he had this rapacious-- just the hunger for everything? WALTER ISAACSON: Yeah, his key quality-- what makes him a creative genius, I think, is that he was curious about everything. Sometimes it was a curiosity that could be useful like he would dissect the neck and figure how do I do Saint Jerome in the wilderness. But then he'd keep dissecting and he would dissect the heart and the liver and he would do layered anatomical drawings. It was a curiosity that was passionate, that was playful and ends up being curiosity for its own sake which is what makes him feel the patterns of nature. JOHN DICKERSON: Right. This is what something Nancy-- Nancy calls the gathering. You just gather everything up and then it expresses itself in various different times in your life. WALTER ISAACSON: Right. Some-- some people who have written about Leonardo in the past century, they approach him as an art critic. And they say it's such a shame that he squandered so much time doing anatomy and the flight of birds and squaring the circle and mathematics. Otherwise he could've finished one of those paintings. That's true. But he wouldn't have been Leonardo and you wouldn't have the Mona Lisa. It was that gathering of-- and that's what we have to understand today is that being curious about everything not only makes you more creative, it enriches your life. JOHN DICKERSON: And-- and makes you better dinner table conversationalists. WALTER ISAACSON: He would've been a great-- you know, he would've been great at this table. Sorry. JOHN DICKERSON: You mentioned Saint Jerome. Is that the one-- he went back to it later, right? WALTER ISAACSON: Yeah. JOHN DICKERSON: Was that the one-- he keeps working and working-- WALTER ISAACSON: People say he abandoned his paintings. But one of the things I discovered is like with Saint Jerome, young painter in Florence, Saint Jerome in the wilderness, very skeletal because Saint Jerome's in the wilderness. And he gets the neck muscles wrong early on and puts the painting aside, gives it to (INDISTINCT) family, the guy who's about to go discover America. But he comes back twenty-five years later, after he's done more anatomy drawings and he redoes the neck muscles. So I've discovered it wasn't so much that he abandoned paintings, he thought sometimes a perfect has to be the enemy of the good, there's always a brush stroke I can make it better. And it reminded me of Steve Jobs who holds up shipping the original Macintosh, I wrote a book about him earlier, and there's a lot of similarities. Because Steve wanted the circuit board inside the Mac to look beautiful. And so they hold up shipping it. So that notion of sometimes you hold on to something until you can make it perfect. It's not a good recipe for business. But it is a good recipe to do every now and then in life. JOHN DICKERSON: The Mona Lisa. So I-- explain why, because I think this-- why is this such a great painting? WALTER ISAACSON: Yeah, you know, I think people come to it and you see huge crowds and you wonder, okay. You know, when you look at the Mona Lisa, it's the culmination of somebody who spent a life looking at science, anatomy, geology, but also philosophy and spirituality. And so like even his early paintings but culminating with Mona Lisa you have the river, that curves from the ancient mountains and curves into the roads and then curves into the human body as our veins do. He always made an analogy between the earth and between us. So that's his fundamental philosophy. JOHN DICKERSON: Mm-Hm. WALTER ISAACSON: And just to give you one example of the science doing it. He had dissected the human eye and knew that the center of the retina is where you see black and white detail but the edges of the retina you see shadows and color. And so over sixteen years he keeps painting the lip, he had dissected the human face and done every muscle and every nerve that touches the lip, but sixteen years he's painting it but he does the tiniest black and white details at the edge of the lips drawing straight or turning down but the shadows and colors turning up. So it becomes an interactive painting. Every time you see her, she seems to have a different emotion. And you have a different emotion in your eyes change a bit and the smile flickers back on. This is magical. It's showing inner emotion reflected on a face. JOHN DICKERSON: Last question. We have thirty seconds. You mention what he'd be like at a dinner party. What-- what kind of a person was he? WALTER ISAACSON: He was very collegial, very friendly. He had everybody at the time, Luca Pacioli the-- the mathematician, Donato Bramante the-- I'll refer to him as his best friend. And what he kind of does is, he makes everybody feel that the way to be more creative is not to specialize, not to silo yourself as we sometimes do to our kids but to be curious about everything for curiosity's sake. JOHN DICKERSON: Walter Isaacson, thank you so much. WALTER ISAACSON: Thank you, John. JOHN DICKERSON: And we'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: And the CBS EVENING NEWS begins a new chapter next Monday December 4th, when Jeff Glor takes over as the ninth anchor of the broadcast.

            "article_content": "BERLIN --\u00a0Helmut Kohl, the physically imposing German chancellor whose reunification of a nation divided by the Cold War put Germany at the heart of a united Europe, has died at 87.  Kohl's Christian Democratic Union party posted on Twitter: \"We are in sorrow. #RIP #HelmutKohl.\"  The daily newspaper Bild reported that Kohl died Friday at his home in Ludwigshafen.  \t \tOver his 16 years at the country's helm from 1982 to 1998 - first for West Germany and then for all of a united Germany - Kohl combined a dogged pursuit of European unity with a keen instinct for history. Less than a year after the November 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall, he spearheaded the end of Germany's decades-long division into East and West, ushering in a new era in European politics. It was the close friendships that Kohl built up with other world leaders that helped him persuade both anti-communist Western allies and the leaders of the collapsing Soviet Union that a strong, united Germany could finally live at peace with its neighbors. \"Helmut Kohl was the most important European statesman since World War II,\" Bill Clinton, the former U.S. president, said in 2011, adding that Kohl answered the big questions of his time \"correctly for Germany, correctly for Europe, correctly for the United States, correctly for the future of the world.\" \"The 21st century in Europe really began on his watch,\" Clinton said, describing Kohl as \"a man who was big in more than physical stature.\" Famed for a massive girth on his 6-foot-4 frame, Kohl still moved nimbly in domestic politics and among rivals in his conservative Christian Democratic Union, holding power for 16 years until his defeat by center-left rival Gerhard Schroeder in 1998. That was followed by the eruption of a party financing scandal which threatened to tarnish his legacy and for a time plunged the CDU into crisis. For foreigners, the bulky conservative with a fondness for heavy local food and white wine came to symbolize a benign, steady -- even dull -- Germany. Kohl's legacy includes the common euro currency that bound Europe more closely together than ever before. Kohl lobbied heavily for the euro, introduced in 1999, as a pillar of peace - and when it hit trouble more than a decade later, he insisted there was no alternative to Germany helping out debt-strapped countries like Greece. Once viewed as a provincial bumbler, Kohl combined an understanding of the worries of ordinary Germans with a hunger for power, getting elected four times. Kohl served longer than Konrad Adenauer, West Germany's first post-World War II chancellor and his political idol. Only Otto von Bismarck, who first unified Germany in the 1870s, was chancellor longer, for 19 years. \"Voters do not like Kohl, but they trust him,\" Rita Suessmuth, a former speaker of parliament, once said. Often harsh and thin-skinned, Kohl also could display a quick wit and jovial earthiness that served him well in building up German clout. He ate pasta with Clinton and took saunas with Russia's Boris Yeltsin. Kohl linked his dedication to a united Europe to his roots in a part of Germany close to France and his memories of a wartime boyhood. He celebrated the European Union's eastward expansion in 2004 with a speech declaring that \"the most important rule of the new Europe is: There must never again be violence in Europe.\" Still, the \"blooming landscapes\" that Kohl promised East German voters during reunification were slow to come after the collapse of its communist economy, and massive aid to the east pushed up German government debt. He also drew criticism for failing to embark on economic reforms. Born on April 3, 1930, in Ludwigshafen, a western industrial city on the Rhine, Kohl joined the Hitler Youth but missed service in the Nazi army. As a 15-year-old, he was about to be pressed into service in a German anti-aircraft gun unit when World War II ended. His oldest brother, Walter, was killed in action a few months earlier. A Roman Catholic, Kohl joined the CDU in his teens shortly after its postwar founding. He earned his doctorate in 1958 at the University of Heidelberg with a dissertation on the politics of Rhineland-Palatinate and became governor of that western state in 1969. His first attempt to unseat Social Democratic Chancellor Helmut Schmidt failed in 1976, but Kohl seized his chance six years later, taking power on Oct. 1, 1982 when a junior coalition party switched sides. He won elections in 1983 and 1987, then rode to an election triumph in 1990 on a wave of post-unity euphoria. Kohl was reluctant to view united Germany as a major power because of the Nazi past. Still, he slowly edged his country toward greater responsibilities in the 1990s, as Germany sent troops for U.N. humanitarian missions in Cambodia, Somalia and elsewhere, and deployed peacekeepers to Bosnia. He pursued reconciliation with Germany's eastern neighbors, though some critics said he moved too slowly after the fall of the Iron Curtain. Kohl was helped in securing German unity by his friendships with French President Francois Mitterrand and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who approved NATO membership for a united Germany and agreed to pull Soviet troops out of East Germany. Kohl's earlier bridge-building with the U.S. also paid off. The stationing of U.S. Pershing II missiles starting in 1983, despite huge domestic protests, had established trust in Washington that was crucial to creating a single German state. \"It was a stroke of luck that there were about four to six leaders in power in the mid-80s who really trusted one another and could really make things happen,\" Kohl later recalled. In his memoirs, he described former U.S. President George H.W. Bush as \"the most important ally on the road to German unity.\" He praised former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for her honesty, even as he recalled a confrontation with her just a few days after the fall of the Berlin Wall. \"I cited a 1970s-era NATO statement and said that NATO supported reunification. ... Thatcher stamped her feet in anger and screamed at me, 'That's how you see it! That's how you see it!'\" he wrote. In a poignant gesture of reconciliation in 1984, Kohl held hands with Mitterrand during a ceremony at a World War I cemetery in Verdun, France. Another gesture of friendship and reconciliation the following year turned into a public relations fiasco. Kohl's trip with then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan to a war cemetery in Bitburg where SS troops were buried alongside ordinary German soldiers generated international indignation. Kohl's relationship with Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, also had to overcome early turbulence. In a 1986 interview, Kohl was quoted as comparing Gorbachev's public relations skills with those of Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. The Soviet Union protested. Elation over German reunification ebbed amid the harsh realities of its cost and the difficulties of integrating east and west, but Kohl's coalition squeaked by again in 1994. Yet high unemployment and Germans' yearning for change gradually sapped his authority, provoking a humiliating loss to the younger Schroeder's center-left Social Democrats in 1998. The following year, Kohl plunged his party into crisis when he admitted accepting undeclared --\u00a0and therefore illegal -- donations during his time as chancellor. Kohl refused to identify the donors, to whom he said he had given his word. His silence helped trigger a parliamentary inquiry and was condemned by many, both inside and outside his party, but Kohl vehemently denied that any decisions by his government were bought. When Bonn prosecutors launched an investigation into possible breach-of-trust charges in January 2000, Kohl was pressured to give up his party's symbolic honorary chairmanship - notably by Angela Merkel, a longtime Kohl protegee who served for seven years in his Cabinet and followed him into the chancellery in 2005. In a 2001 deal with Bonn prosecutors, the probe was dropped in exchange for about $140,000 at the time giving Kohl the legal stamp of innocence. That was a common German practice, not considered special treatment, but judicial investigations into other figures in the murky financing scandal continued. In another battle after his departure from power, Kohl fought and won a lengthy legal fight to prevent the release of most of the files held on him by East Germany's secret police. Journalists and historians had asked to see the material, prompting speculation it could shed light on the financing scandal. Kohl, however, argued successfully that the wiretaps used by the Stasi to spy on him were illegal and that he deserved protection from damage to his \"human dignity.\" Kohl's estrangement from his party lasted until 2002, when its new leaders invited him to speak at a convention as they sought to regain power. The former chancellor was married for 41 years to Hannelore Renner, an interpreter of English and French who stood firmly but discreetly by his side throughout his political life. They had two sons, Peter and Walter. In July 2001, Hannelore killed herself at age 68 in despair over an incurable allergy to light. In 2005, Kohl introduced his new partner Maike Richter, an economist some 35 years his junior. The couple married in May 2008. Though slowed by illness in his later years, Kohl still made occasional eye-catching interventions on the political stage. As Merkel struggled to convince center-right lawmakers in 2011 of the wisdom of having Germany finance further bailouts of other eurozone nations, Kohl weighed in firmly. \"There must be no question for us that we in the European Union and the eurozone stand by Greece in solidarity,\" he declared. He also appeared to question Merkel's approach at a time when conservatives were unsettled by her decision to speed up Germany's exit from nuclear energy and by Germany's abstention in a U.N. vote on a no-fly zone over Libya. \"I ask myself where Germany stands today and where it wants to go,\" he said. In April 2016, Kohl welcomed Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban - who had clashed with Merkel over Europe's approach to a large influx of refugees -- to his home. That coincided with the publication of a new foreword to a Kohl essay in which the ex-chancellor stated that \"Europe cannot become the new home for millions of people in need worldwide.\" Kohl and Orban said, however, that they saw no conflict with Merkel's efforts to solve Europe's migrant crisis.",

            "article_content": "JOHN DICKERSON, CBS HOST: Today on FACE THE NATION: House Speaker Paul Ryan leads the charge to repeal Obamacare, but faces a revolt from within his own party.  We will go one-on-one with the speaker in an interview you will see only on FACE THE NATION.  Republicans launch the long-promised push to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, but were hammered right out of the gate by critics from the right, the left and the center.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: You are a governing party getting a consensus among your wide, big-tent party. Everybody doesn\u2019t get what they want.  But we are getting much better policy here.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: But it is the impact of the policy that has Americans worried and gives critics ammunition.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: How many people are going to lose coverage under this new...  RYAN: I can\u2019t answer that question.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: Another unanswered question in Washington, what evidence did the president have for his bombshell charge that President Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower during the campaign?  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: You are the member of the Gang -- the so-called Gang of 8, the top leaders who get this information. Have you seen anything to suggest there are wiretaps?  RYAN: No.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: We will also talk this morning to two of the most vocal critics of the health care replacement bill in the Senate, one from either side of the aisle, Republican Rand Paul of Kentucky and Democrat Bernie Sanders of the Vermont.  And we will have plenty of political analysis of all the week\u2019s news. It is coming right up on FACE THE NATION.  Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I\u2019m John Dickerson.  For the most part this past week, President Trump has been working behind the scenes to fulfill one of his biggest campaign promises, repealing and replacing Obamacare.  That left the public spotlight to House Speaker Paul Ryan, who went as far as rolling up his sleeves and making his case with charts and graphs.  We sat down with the speaker yesterday, and he told us he was excited about the reaction to the bill.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  DICKERSON: You have conservative governors, you have conservative members of the House, you have AARP, the American Medical Association, American Hospital Association, the health insurance lobby all coming out against this.  You are pleased with the reaction. The reaction has been awful.  RYAN: I wouldn\u2019t say the reaction has been awful.  I think the reaction is, everybody wants to compare this to Obamacare, as if they can keep these guarantees going, as if we are going to have Obamacare plans, and we are just going to finance it a different way.  This is repealing and replacing Obamacare. So, this first part is very, very important. It repeals the entire fiscal pieces of the law and replaces it with a patient-centered system.  And the point is, a lot of people who you just mentioned, I think they would like to see us continue to make Americans buy what we say they should buy. We don\u2019t agree with that.  DICKERSON: But these are critics of yours coming from the conservative side.  RYAN: Look, when you are a governing party getting consensus among your wide, big-tent party, not -- everybody doesn\u2019t get what they want, but we are getting much better policy here.  Let me put it this way. Obamacare is collapsing. If we just did nothing, washed our hands of the situation, we would see a further collapse of the health insurance markets. So we feel an obligation to step in front of that collapse and replace this law with one that works, that has more freedom.  Some people would like it to be done a little bit differently. And the point here, though, is, we have an obligation. We made a promise to the people who elected us we would repeal and replace this law. And we basically said, this is what we would replace it with. And now we are keeping our word.  DICKERSON: There have been so many people picking at different pieces who have issues about it, on your side, on the other side.  Tom Cotton, senator from Arkansas, Lindsey Graham, senator from South Carolina, have both said, let\u2019s slow down. Why go so fast?  RYAN: That is actually really puzzling to me. Why go so fast?  Let me see. We ran for repeal and replace in 2010. We ran on repeal and replace in 2012, in 2014, in 2016. Oh, by the way, we spent six months last year developing a replacement plan. We ran on that replacement plan.  DICKERSON: But these senators know that. They\u2019re not unfamiliar.  RYAN: This has been a long and deliberative process.  Suggesting that this is moving fast, going through four committees, going through regular order, saying we are going to do this for seven years, and now come to the point where we are actually on the cusp of keeping our word, I hardly think that that is rushing things.  The point I would say is, this is historic. This is historic. And it\u2019s significant. And if we don\u2019t act, the system is going to collapse. And the beautiful thing about this plan that we\u2019re proposing, it is more freedom, it is more choices, it is more markets, it\u2019s lower prices, which gets us better access.  DICKERSON: Let me -- but you said you ran on this. But that\u2019s like saying, some day, we are going to buy a car. Now we are talking about the actual car. You\u2019re talking about the actual legislation.  RYAN: Not only did we say, someday, we\u2019re going to buy a car. We said, this is what the car is going to look like.  DICKERSON: But you -- but all these analyses that are coming out now are based on actual legislation. Those were not coming out while you were campaigning on it. There\u2019s actual details that are at issue here on everything from tax credits to the individual mandate.  (CROSSTALK)  RYAN: Right.  DICKERSON: All of that stuff is being debated afresh now, in a way that...  (CROSSTALK)  RYAN: We want this kind of debate. This is a good debate to have.  DICKERSON: If you pass a bill out of the House and it can\u2019t get 51 votes in the Senate, will you have accomplished something?  RYAN: Well, I believe we can get 51 votes out of the Senate.  Look, this is what the legislative process looks like, when you are going through a deliberative legislative process, not ramming and jamming things, but going through all the committees, going through the entire process.  People are going to try and negotiate. People are going to say, I wish we could do this, let\u2019s do that. That\u2019s how legislation works. Negotiations and compromises occur when you are writing law. And what we are seeing and hearing is just that.  DICKERSON: The president is one of the -- he is our first marketer president.  How helpful has he been in this, applying the marketer skill to selling this? There\u2019s no...  RYAN: He\u2019s been tremendously helpful actually. He has been very helpful. He has been extremely engaged with various members of Congress. I talk to him constantly on this.  DICKERSON: Has he given you advice on how to sell this?  RYAN: Sure. Sure. And he\u2019s -- we talk. It is a very good collaboration.  Everybody has been working on the same page, not rival plans, working together. So I am actually really excited that we have a president fully engaged and fully committed to keeping his promise, the same promise we made to the people that elected us and getting this done.  DICKERSON: You say keeping his promise. He has promised a lot for this legislation.  He said everybody will be covered. He said costs will go down, you will be able to pick your doctor. Even in company insurance plans, you can\u2019t pick your doctor. There are limits on that.  He said that you will be able to pick whatever plan you want. He is overpromising. You can\u2019t do all that.  RYAN: Look, here is our point.  DICKERSON: But you agree he is overpromising?  RYAN: Well, I can\u2019t speak to all of those. I don\u2019t know exactly all that all that he said.  He had said we will repeal and replace Obamacare with a better system, one that gives people better access to more affordable choices. And you pick what you want. We are not going to have -- read his speech that he gave to Congress just a few weeks ago.  That speech perfectly encapsulized what we are achieving here. And I think people are missing the historic nature of this. We are taking one entitlement that is going bankrupt, Medicaid, where more and more low-income people don\u2019t even get access to a doctor, and we\u2019re giving it back to the states, so that they can experiment and innovate and make it work better for low-income citizens.  And we are taking another entitlement, Obamacare, which is crashing and blowing up our fiscal problem, and repealing it, and replacing it with good tax policy that equalizes the tax treatment of health care and gives people more choice and more freedom. That means lower costs across the board, so you can improve access.  DICKERSON: I want to get to that, some of that in a minute.  The president has said there will be a bloodbath in 2018 if this isn\u2019t passed through the House and Senate. Do you agree?  RYAN: I do believe that if we don\u2019t keep our word to the people who sent us here, yes.  Look, the most important thing for a person like myself, who runs for office and tells the people we are asking to hire us, this is what I will do if I get elected. And then, if you don\u2019t do that, you are breaking your word.  DICKERSON: You said you are working hand in glove with the president on selling this new health care plan.  But over the weekend, before you were going to launch this sales campaign, the president sends out four tweets about his predecessor wiretapping him. Did that help or hurt...  (CROSSTALK)  RYAN: Yes, that wasn\u2019t really part of the health care marketing campaign.  (LAUGHTER)  DICKERSON: Yes.  How much off-course did that take you?  RYAN: Like I said, this is going to be an unconventional presidency. And I think he was just upset about -- I\u2019m not really sure.  DICKERSON: But there\u2019s unconventional, and then there is really off into new territory.  RYAN: Look, this is part of what the Intelligence Committee is investigating.  Both the House Intelligence Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee are going through all of this. That is the proper place for this. And, by the way, we have been presented with no evidence that anybody, any American was in collusion with the Russians on meddling with our election.  We know the Russians meddled with our election. We said so before the election.  DICKERSON: Here\u2019s a question I have for you, though.  You and I have talked about the importance of public figures making a case -- you are doing it right now with health care -- to the public based on a set of facts. You make your argument about your facts. The other person makes their argument. And the people make a decision.  How can that happen in a situation where you have a president who is saying things that -- where you have got the director of the FBI, you have got the former DNI...  RYAN: Well, there has been a lot of reporting about this.  There has been a lot of reporting about -- remember, there was an investigation by the Intelligence Committee.  DICKERSON: But not that Barack Obama wiretapped Donald Trump.  RYAN: Well, that\u2019s what the Intelligence Committee is going to investigate. That\u2019s what the intelligence -- there has been a lot of reporting about this all over the place.  So, the key is, get to the bottom of it. Make sure the Intelligence Committee investigates these things. And I think when we get through all of this investigation, I think we will discover that they didn\u2019t do those things, but Russia did try to meddle with our elections.  DICKERSON: But this is a serious charge. The president is saying his predecessor put illegal wiretaps on him. That is not the basket of charges and things that have been discussed in the papers before. That is a new thing  And I wonder if you feel the way Senator Sasse does, the way Senator Graham does, which is, when a president makes this kind of a bombshell charge, that you can\u2019t just wait for the committees to kind of get to the work. This isn\u2019t the kind of thing you want to just linger out there.  Do you -- what do you feel about that?  RYAN: Well, that is outside of my control what is tweeted or what isn\u2019t tweeted.  We are focused on health care. The president is focused on health care. I think he is frustrated with this whole thing about Russia. I think he is frustrated with selective leaks coming from parts of government that malign his campaign. The reason why we think the Intelligence Committees are the ones who should do this is, the last thing we want to do is compromise the sources and methods of our intelligence gathering, so that we get to the bottom of all of this.  But, yes, there has been a lot of selective leaking, I think, in many ways meant to malign the presidency, meant to get him off to a bad start. And he is expressing that frustration.  DICKERSON: You are the member of the Gang -- the so-called Gang of 8, the top leaders who get this information. Have you seen anything to suggest there are wiretaps?  RYAN: No.  DICKERSON: Could you clear up this question of wiretaps?  RYAN: Well, again, let\u2019s -- I don\u2019t want to get ahead of the Intelligence Committees. I don\u2019t want to get ahead of the Intelligence Committees and their thorough investigation.  (END VIDEOTAPE)  DICKERSON: And we may get some answers soon, as the House Intelligence Committee has asked the Justice Department to turn over any specific evidence they have related to any possible wiretaps at Trump Tower by Monday.  And we will have more questions and get some more answers from Speaker Ryan later in our broadcast.  Right now, we turn to the critics of the new plan.  Yesterday, Vice President Pence traveled to Kentucky, perhaps to put a little pressure on one of the bill\u2019s most vocal opponents, Republican Senator Rand Paul, who is with us now.  Welcome, Senator.  What is wrong with this bill?  SEN. RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY: I think it is basically Obamacare- lite. Keeps the subsidies, keeps the taxes for a year, then keeps the Cadillac tax forever, the tax on good insurance.  Keeps the individual mandate, interestingly. You know, Republicans have complained for years, saying we didn\u2019t like the government was going to make you pay a penalty. Well, now instead of paying the penalty to the government, you pay the penalty to the insurance industry.  There\u2019s also bailouts for the insurance industries. The one primary thing that is wrong with Obamacare that is most visible to everybody is that premiums are rising through the roof, soaring in the individual market. That will happen under the Ryan plan as well, because they do nothing to fix the fundamental problem.  DICKERSON: What Paul Ryan would say is, you are missing the forest for the trees, which is to say you are missing that this is changing Medicaid fundamentally, making it a block grant that goes back to the states, that it\u2019s getting rid of the Obamacare entitlement, that it\u2019s getting health savings accounts, which Republicans have long asked for.  PAUL: Let\u2019s start just with the Medicaid expansion.  It may be fundamentally changing it or it may not. Built into Medicaid, they are going to block-grant it, but not with a fixed amount of money. It\u2019s going to go up at about 5 percent a year. It goes up at CPI, an indicator of inflation in the medical community, which is going up at about 4 percent, plus 1.  So it is going to go up at about 5 percent a year. The question, is that a lot slower than what Medicaid is going up now? Is it quicker? I think it is still building in the growth of an entitlement program that really isn\u2019t paid for.  So, for example, under Obamacare, I think it was dishonest accounting. They said the federal government will pay for Medicaid, 100 percent of it. But we have no money. We borrow a million dollars a minute and have a $20 trillion debt, so it is dishonest.  It sounds good. Give somebody stuff for free. Give them free health care. But it is not really free. We are borrowing it from China, which really threatens our country from within.  DICKERSON: You said it retains the individual mandate.  The argument is that if you don\u2019t have something to get healthy people into the insurance market, that it ends up just being sicker and older people, and that\u2019s why premiums go up.  PAUL: Well, exactly right.  The fundamental premise of Obamacare was, we have to have healthy people buy it, so we\u2019re going to give them a mandate. So, here is the interesting thing that left and right, people who are really looking at this, agree on. It\u2019s going to get worse.  The individual market will get worse when you get rid of the individual mandate and make it an insurance mandate, which is a slightly lesser penalty. And so more and more sick people will be in the pool. And let\u2019s say you have lost your job and you have lost your insurance.  Do you have any incentive to get back in and pay the penalty? No, the penalty will look at -- people are writing now that it\u2019s a disincentive to buy insurance. Why don\u2019t you wait until you are sick? So, really, you can\u2019t have an insurance model where people wait until they are sick to get insurance.  It doesn\u2019t work. And here is the problem with Ryan\u2019s plan. He keeps that fundamental aspect of Obamacare. He doesn\u2019t change it.  DICKERSON: You say that Speaker Ryan is pulling the wool over the eyes of the president. Really, pulling the wool?  PAUL: I think there is a separation between the two.  I have talked to the president, I think, three times on Obamacare. And I hear from him that he is willing to negotiate. You know what I hear from Paul Ryan? It is a binary choice, young man.  And -- but what does a binary choice mean? His way or the highway. There are two choices, according to him.  DICKERSON: Well, I think his argument would be, the binary choice, you do this now through reconciliation, a Senate process that is kind of a pain, and then you have a second piece of legislation that does the rest.  PAUL: Well, what we are hearing is a binary choice is, it is the Ryan plan or the status quo.  And what he has rammed through his committee is his, without any amendments. And that\u2019s a question. If we get what we have got from Ryan, Obamacare-lite, he will not have the votes. And we have to get to that point before true negotiations begin.  Right now, I think there is a charm offensive going on. Everybody is being nice to everybody, because they want us to vote for this. But we are not going to vote for it.  DICKERSON: You talked to the -- I\u2019m going to get to the Senate in a second. But you said you spoke with the president. Where do you think he is willing to negotiate on these issues that you have highlighted?  PAUL: I don\u2019t think the president is rigid in support of the House bill. I think he is open to seeing how we can get consensus.  And what I have told the president is what I am telling everybody. We are united on repeal, not so much on replacement. We do not agree with the fundamental three or four things that Ryan has, subsidies, taxes, mandates, and insurance bailout.  That is Obamacare. We don\u2019t want that. If you take that off, what do you have? You have got repeal. Now, what do you do help people...  DICKERSON: Can you do just repeal by itself?  PAUL: Well, no, I would do replacement in a separate bill, because what I would do through replacement is, there are two things you have to do to fix the individual market.  You have to tell people that they can buy any kind of insurance they want. So, you get rid of the mandates on what goes into insurance. But you also have to allow for people to join a buying group. If people join a health care association or a co-op, that...  DICKERSON: Right. That\u2019s part of Ryan\u2019s plan, though.  PAUL: That drives down -- it is not in the Obamacare-lite proposal.  DICKERSON: It\u2019s in the second set of legislation.  PAUL: He\u2019s talking about it -- but the reason they have to be discussed at the same time is, CBO is going to come out and say a lot of people are not covered.  DICKERSON: Right.  PAUL: so how are we going to cover them?  I would cover them with something much better than Obamacare. And that would be joining a co-op to drive down prices, but also to get guaranteed issue, where you won\u2019t be dropped.  DICKERSON: Let me ask you a question.  You have said that there is a room perhaps for negotiation with the president. But Mike Pence was in your state. And he said, \u201cFor us to seize this opportunity to repeal and replace Obamacare once and for all, we need every Republican in Congress.\u201d  That sounds like he is talking to you.  PAUL: I think that is the pre-negotiation. We are still in the pre-negotiation period.  The real negotiation period comes -- and I promise this is the way it\u2019s going to work. We will get Obamacare-lite, Ryan\u2019s plan, unless there\u2019s enough conservatives in the House to say no. If there\u2019s enough to say no, when they start voting on the rules of debate, if they bring down the rule, if they stop him in the tracks, then a true negotiation begins.  No negotiation right now counts, until they determine to have enough votes to stop Obamacare-lite.  DICKERSON: Let me ask you a question on wiretapping, because I know that is an issue you care a lot about.  There are your colleagues -- Lindsey Graham and Senator Sasse have said this claim the president made about being wiretapped as a candidate by President Obama, they say this is too incendiary to wait for the committees to adjudicate it, that the president should bring forward whatever evidence he has.  Does that bother you, matter to you?  PAUL: Well, I think the first thing to realize is that I think everybody has been getting the story wrong. I doubt that Trump was a target directly of any kind of eavesdropping, but I am not saying it didn\u2019t happen. I think there\u2019s a very good chance it does. I don\u2019t have any special information.  But the way it works is, the FISA court, through Section 702, wiretaps foreigners and then listens to Americans. It is a backdoor search of Americans. And because they have so much data, they can tap -- type Donald Trump into their vast resources of people they are tapping overseas, and they get all of his phone calls.  And so they did this to President Obama. They -- 1,227 times eavesdrops on President Obama\u2019s phone calls. Then they mask him. But here is the problem. And General Hayden said this the other day. He said even low-level employees can unmask the caller. That is probably what happened to Flynn.  They are not targeting Americans. They are targeting foreigners. But they are doing it purposefully to get to Americans.  DICKERSON: OK.  So, your point is, the president would have been caught in a net -- or -- excuse me -- candidate Trump caught in a net, but not targeted directly.  PAUL: Or his associates.  But it is very dangerous, because they are revealing that now to the public.  (CROSSTALK)  DICKERSON: All right, thank you, Senator. We ran out of time.  Next up, a senator with a different take on why the Republican effort to overturn Obamacare won\u2019t work.  We will be back in a minute with Bernie Sanders .  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: We are joined by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who is in Burlington this morning.  Senator Sanders, House Speaker Paul Ryan thinks that his legislation can get 51 votes in the Senate. What do you think?  SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT: Well, I sure hope not, John. It is an absolute disaster. It is a disgrace.  And, by the way, this really has nothing to do with health care. What this has everything to do with is a massive shift of wealth from working people and middle-income people to the very richest people in this country.  It is a $275 billion tax break for the top 2 percent. Millionaires will get about $50,000 a year in tax breaks, while at the same time, some five to 10 million people are going to lose their health insurance, premiums are going to soar.  The AARP says that if you\u2019re 64 years of age, and you\u2019re making about $25,000 a year, you are going to pay up to $7,000 more for your health insurance. They are going to defund Planned Parenthood. Deny over two million women the right to choose the health care that they need.  They\u2019re going to decimate Medicaid, which is why the American Medical Association, the AMA, and the American Hospital Association oppose it, in addition to the AARP.  This is a disgrace. And, by the way, they are so cowardly that they want to go forward before the CBO even gives an estimate as to what it will cost and how many people will lose their insurance.  DICKERSON: Well, a lot of charges there.  The speaker says the CBO will be giving, the accountants in Congress will be giving their score on Monday, so it will be able to be a part of the debate.  But let me ask you this question about how many people will lose coverage. What Speaker Ryan says is, it is an unfair comparison, because the people who have coverage now have coverage in a rickety system that is getting worse, premiums are going up, insurance companies are dropping out of the system, so it is unfair to compare the people who have it now, because the system is falling apart.  SANDERS: Oh, really? Well, five to 10 million people are going to have no health insurance at all.  Nobody has ever suggested that the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, was perfect, but it did put 20 million people into the ranks of the insured. In my view, and what the American people want is an improvement on Obamacare, not the decimation of Obamacare, and throwing so many people off of health insurance and raising premiums substantially.  It is very hard for Ryan or anybody else not to deny that what they are bringing forth is far, far, far worse than Obamacare, and that its primary purpose is massive tax breaks for the very wealthiest people in this country.  DICKERSON: There has been a lot of criticism from some senators about what the House is putting together.  I wonder if you see an opportunity to use the opposition against the House bill to do something that is closer to what you want.  SANDERS: Well, John, that is a very fair question.  But, as I understand it, this bill is so outrageous that not only have the Republicans moved forward in the House without the CBO score; they want to move forward in the Senate without any hearings whatsoever, if you realize this bill is going to impact tens and tens of millions of people, and to the best of my knowledge, they want to bring it right to the floor of the Senate.  I am a member of the Health Education Committee. When Obamacare was being debated, we had hearing after hearing, meeting after meeting. It never ended. And these guys want to take a bill so significant to so many people and just shove it through because they don\u2019t have the guts to hold hearings. They don\u2019t want the American people to know what is going on.  DICKERSON: They say that there will be a multistep process here, this is one step, and then there will be future legislation, so the -- what you might want would be in that future legislation, which would also have a 60-vote threshold.  This one has only a 50-vote threshold because of the way it is going through.  SANDERS: Well, they can say what they want, John, but it is impossible for any serious legislator to defend a process by which a bill is coming through the Senate without one hearing before the vote takes place.  And I think it\u2019s clear to everybody. They want to move as quickly as they can. They are embarrassed about the product. And let\u2019s not forget that President Trump, who now, I guess, today at least supports it -- we don\u2019t know what he will say tomorrow -- but Trump was the guy who said to the American people when he ran for president, oh, don\u2019t worry, we have got a terrific idea. We are going to provide health care to all people.  Well, this is far from it. This is throwing five to 10 million people off of the health insurance they currently have.  DICKERSON: All right, Senator Sanders, we\u2019re going to have to leave it there. Thanks so much for being with us.  SANDERS: Thank you.  DICKERSON: And we will be back in a moment.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. I\u2019m John Dickerson.  Among the biggest criticisms of the debate so far on health care is that it has happened without an official accounting from the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO. Among the big questions that remain unanswered about the Republican health care bill are how much will it cost and how many people might lose coverage if enacted in its current form? We ask Speaker Ryan why the House has started work on the bill without this information.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  RYAN: The score, we believe, will come out probably Monday or Tuesday, well before we go to the floor. Well before we go to the floor we\u2019ll have the score. The one thing I\u2019m certain will happen is CBO will say, well, gosh, not as many people will get coverage. You know why? Because this isn\u2019t a government mandate. This is not the government makes you buy what we say you should buy, and therefore the government thinks you\u2019re all going to buy it. So there\u2019s no way we can -- you can compete with on paper a government mandate with coverage.  What we are trying to achieve here is bringing down the cost of care, bringing down the cost of insurance, not through government mandates and monopolies, but by having more choice and competition. And by lowering the cost of health care, you improve the access to health care. And by having the things that we\u2019re talking about, tax credits, risk pools, health savings accounts, you dramatically increase the access to health care, but we\u2019re not going to make an American do what they don\u2019t want to do. You get it if you want it. That\u2019s freedom.  DICKERSON: How many people are going to lose coverage under this new --  RYAN: I can\u2019t answer that question. It\u2019s up to people. Here -- here\u2019s the premise of your question. Are you going to stop mandating people buy health insurance? People are going to do what they want to do with their lives because we believe in individual freedom in this country. So the question is, are we providing a system where people have access to health insurance if they choose to do so? And the answer is yes. But are we going to have some nice looking spreadsheet that says we, the government of the American -- of the United States are going to make people buy something and, therefore, they\u2019re all going to buy it? No. That\u2019s the fatal conceit of Obamacare in the first place.  So it\u2019s not our job to make people do something that they don\u2019t want to do. It is our job to have a system where people can get universal access to affordable coverage if they choose to do so or not. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to be accomplishing.  DICKERSON: But there have been promises made from -- and President Trump ran on this and you have talked about how promises you make in your campaign set the table for things you are going to do. He has promised everyone will be covered. Cathy McMorris Rodgers has said, quote, no one who has coverage because of Obamacare today will lose that coverage.  RYAN: Yes, so that\u2019s talking about the transition. I can\u2019t speak what Cathy -- with respect to Cathy. We don\u2019t want to pull the rug out from under people. We -- here\u2019s what I\u2019m concerned that some people in America are thinking, the day we pass this bill, the day after, everybody loses their coverage. That\u2019s just not the case. There\u2019s going to be --  DICKERSON: But they\u2019re also concerned they might lose it in two months.  RYAN: They won\u2019t in two months either, or two months later. So the point we\u2019re trying to make there is, there will be a smooth transition, a stable transition, so that people who are covered today don\u2019t have the rug pulled out from under them. But let\u2019s remember where we are when I started this conversation, the system is collapsing. One hundred and sixteen percent increase in premiums in Arizona alone. Five states, one plan, over 1,000 counties, one plan, Humana --  DICKERSON: Will premiums now go up now? Because there are lots of people who are saying that premiums will go up in -- under this plan.  RYAN: Premiums -- if we do nothing, premiums will go far, far, far higher than they would otherwise go up.  DICKERSON: But they\u2019re going to go up?  RYAN: I -- I think they\u2019ll go down once this system coms into place. So that point would --  DICKERSON: And when\u2019s that going to happen?  RYAN: Look at the bill. In two years -- that\u2019s the point, there\u2019s a transition -- it takes a little while to get the states back in the game to regulate health insurance. It takes a little while for risk pools to be set up in the states to cover people with preexisting conditions. It takes a little while for tax credits to be deployed so the guy waiting tables getting $12 an hour can get health insurance. It takes some time to do that.  And in the meantime, there will be a stable transition so people don\u2019t -- don\u2019t have the rug pulled out from under them. That\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about when we say a stable transition from the system that is creaky and collapsing to one that is better and more endurable.  DICKERSON: Why not use just plain terms, though? Rugs pulled out from under them is -- why not just say, if you have Obamacare and you\u2019re being covered, you\u2019ll be still covered.  RYAN: Because private insurance companies and non-profit insurance companies are pulling out of markets left and right. The government doesn\u2019t control the decision Humana made, which is, I\u2019m pulling out of this market and therefore Tennessee and counties in Tennessee don\u2019t have health insurance. That\u2019s not a promise a politician can keep because it\u2019s outside of that person\u2019s control.  DICKERSON: But that\u2019s the old promise. There is a new bill with new promise and the president has said, everyone is going to be covered.  RYAN: The point I\u2019m trying to make is, Obamacare is crashing and collapsing --  DICKERSON: No, I get that.  RYAN: No, but -- but you can\u2019t say and the next -- what the actuaries and the insurers are telling me, you guys do nothing, there\u2019s going to be even bigger premium increases next year and even more pullouts. So we can\u2019t --  DICKERSON: I guess the question for -- RYAN: We can\u2019t promise that that\u2019s not going to happen.  DICKERSON: I -- for --  RYAN: But what we can promise is, we\u2019re going to replace it with a better system so we have more insurers, more choices, more competition, prices go down and we give people the ability to go access affordable coverage.  DICKERSON: If I\u2019m getting coverage through the individual market now, though, I\u2019m nervous. There\u2019s a lot of changes that you\u2019re talking -- you\u2019re -- you\u2019re saying it\u2019s all going to work out wonderfully, but essentially this is -- it\u2019s a theory about how markets will work and the competition will -- it\u2019s a theory you believe in passionately.  RYAN: It\u2019s not a theory that I just believe in passionately. It\u2019s a theory that, when tested, has worked very, very well. And, by the way --  DICKERSON: In what -- in what instance with health care? This is an -- this is the first time this is being done.  RYAN: When you increase -- when you increase choice and you increase competition, you bring more players to the marketplace who complete against each other for our business. What we\u2019ve never had in the individual market is equal tax treatment so that a person who doesn\u2019t get health care from their job but is out there working gets a tax benefit to go buy health insurance. That\u2019s what health savings accounts and tax credits are.  Risk pools work very, very well. We had them in Wisconsin. It was a -- the -- I think the best way of getting people with pre-existing conditions affordable coverage. Obamacare destroyed that system. Obamacare federalized the entire system and blew up the American health care system. So it\u2019s going to take us more than a few months to stop that damage and replace it with a better system.  DICKERSON: Let me ask you a question about the -- the -- the tax credits in the bill. You\u2019ve gotten a lot of criticism from conservatives who the -- Freedom Works has called this an individual mandate by another name, an individual mandate, that part of Obamacare they don\u2019t like. The Republican Study Group said that this credit is, in principle, Obamacare. So why are they wrong?  RYAN: I think they\u2019re wrong because this has been longstanding conservative reform for decades. Heritage Foundation --  DICKERSON: But the individual mandate -- the individual mandate came out of the -- that came out of --  RYAN: No, not the -- nobody -- nobody -- this doesn\u2019t have an individual mandate.  DICKERSON: No, no, but the individual mandate came out of Heritage. So to say that it\u2019s longstanding principle is --  RYAN: Oh, oh, I see. OK, well -- well, but it -- tax credits. So, look, here\u2019s what we\u2019re -- we\u2019ve always said as conservatives, which is, we should equalize the tax treatment of health care. Everybody who gets healthcare from their job has a tax benefit (ph) for that health care plan. But if you don\u2019t get health care from your job, there\u2019s no tax benefit. So the only way to make sure that that working core person, that working low and middle income person can actually get something off of their taxes is through a tax credit.  We think equalizing the tax treatment of health care, giving people more freedom in the individual market is the best way to replace Obamacare with a patient centered system. And so it\u2019s been longstanding conservative reforms that we do this. Is it frustrating that some conservatives are now changing their tune and mischaracterizing these things? Of course it is. But that\u2019s how the legislative process works.  DICKERSON: In Medicaid you\u2019ve got conservatives saying that you\u2019re phase out of the expansion is happening too slowly. 2020, the target date, is too slow. Then you\u2019ve got Republicans in the Senate saying, it\u2019s happening too fast, the poor and the mentally ill will be hurt.  RYAN: So we\u2019re probably right in the -- in the sweet spot. I think what\u2019s happening here --  DICKERSON: Is it going to stick? Is it not going to move or change?  RYAN: Yes, so this is a carefully balanced consensus among all of our Republicans in consultation with our governors about how to have a smooth transition as we get Medicaid back to the states. The concern about ending the Medicaid -- changing Medicaid too soon is there will be a gap in coverage before the tax credits kick in. And so that\u2019s the concern about doing this too soon.  Here\u2019s what I would say -- this is what I mean when I say, people are losing the forest through the trees. We are sending Medicaid through a per capita block grant to the state and capping its growth rate. This is the most historic entitlement reform we have ever had. This is bigger entitlement reform than welfare reform in 1996. So if the transition takes three years or two years, that\u2019s missing the forest through the trees. So that\u2019s the point I keep trying to make, which is, look at the totality of this, look at the historic achievement this is and -- and this, I think, this at the end of the day, is going to win this argument among people on my side of the aisle.  DICKERSON: All right, Mr. Speaker, thanks so much with being with us.  RYAN: You bet. Thank you, John.  (END VIDEOTAPE)  DICKERSON: We\u2019ll be right back with our political panel. Don\u2019t go away.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: And we\u2019re back with our political panel.  Avik Roy is the president of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, and a former policy advisor to the Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio. Ezra Klein is the editor in chief at vox.com, and we welcome Indira Lakshmanan of \u201cThe Boston Globe.\u201d Indira has also been named the Newmark Chair of Journalism Ethics at The Poynter Institution. And chief White House correspondent for \u201cThe New York Times,\u201d Peter Baker, is also with us today.  Peter Baker, I\u2019m going to start with you.  Give me your assessment of where things stand here after the first week of the rollout of the alternative to the Affordable Care Act.  PETER BAKER, \u201cTHE NEW YORK TIMES\u201d: Well, as you -- you have very aptly demonstrated on your program today, we\u2019ve got the left and the right with very different critiques of this plan and you\u2019ve got a president who isn\u2019t quite sure which way forward. He\u2019s -- he\u2019s subcontracting, in effect, the policy to Paul Ryan, which is, as you demonstrated very aptly, very wonky and very smart, you know, subject on this -- or master of the subject. But President Trump is not. And I think the question is, what investment is he going to put into passing this bill. He doesn\u2019t really care, I think, about some of the specific details. What he wants is a winner. That\u2019s -- he\u2019s always been of this philosophy, you have to have a win. He has to have something that he can call repeal and replace. Whether this is going to be it, it\u2019s not -- it\u2019s unclear. Rand Paul says that -- to you that President Trump is open for negotiations. Sean Spicer said on Friday he\u2019s not. And so we\u2019re waiting to hear from the president.  DICKERSON: That\u2019s right. Avik, what do you make of the legislation put forward by Paul Ryan? Is it the best he could get?  AVIK ROY, FOUNDATION FOR RESEARCH ON EQUAL OPPORTUNITY: Well, I think he\u2019s tried to split the difference between the people who -- the more pragmatic Republicans who want to make sure that their replacement is competitive with the ACA on covering the uninsured.  DICKERSON: Right.  ROY: And the people like Rand Paul who say that anything that attempts to provide financial assistance to the uninsured is Obamacare-lite. And I thought your interview with him today was really interesting because Rand Paul, in 2012, introduced a bill to provide private coverage to seniors as an alternative to Medicare that would be heavily subsidized with richer benefits than Medicare, it would protect people against pre-existing conditions, require insurers to charge the same prices to the healthy and the sick and cap out-of- pocket costs and lifetime limits, all the things that are theoretically unique to Obamacare. So he\u2019s for Obamacare-lite when it comes to seniors, not when it comes to the uninsured.  And I think this is operationally the challenge Republicans have. They say that they are for limited government and against subsidies to provide health insurance. The federal government\u2019s involvement. But what they\u2019re operationally against is assistance for the uninsured and the low-income populations. For Republican voters, the older, the employed, they\u2019re totally in favor of and comfortable with subsidizing coverage.  DICKERSON: Ezra, how do you see the winners and losers of this plan?  EZRA KLEIN, VOX.COM: This is a bad bill. This is a bad bill and that is why it has received a very bad reception. And -- and I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t be more positive about it than that. You have a $6 billion tax cut, you have a sharp lowering of subsidies for people and you have the betrayal of promise after promise made by Donald Trump and made by Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell. Donald Trump promised during the campaign no cuts to Medicaid. This is a sharp, sharp cut over time to Medicaid.  Mitch McConnell -- I was sitting here on this program when he said, the problem with Obamacare is the deductibles are too high, the co-pays are too high, people are buying insurance and they can\u2019t afford to use it. The way this bill works is you push people into insurance when they could afford it that had higher deductibles, that had higher co-pays.  They seem to have defined the problem extremely narrowly. How do we pass something, anything, that we can call repeal and replace of Obamacare. But when they actually tried to put this into law, which they have brought out a bill, they just -- it\u2019s shoddy in its construction. They\u2019re not waiting long enough to even figure out how to amend it. If they tried to put this into law, it would create tremendous adverse selection in these markets, skyrocketing premiums, a lot less competition in a -- in a context where we already don\u2019t have enough competition, and tens -- and about 10 million people, depending on which estimate you want to look at, who would lose insurance. I don\u2019t know who they think is going to be happy with that.  DICKERSON: Right, adverse election, meaning sicker picker take insurance --  ROY: Yes.  DICKERSON: Healthy stay out and you end up having the -- the risk is too high and expensive.  Sorry, you wanted to just --  ROY: Yes. No, I was going to say, one -- one big constraint that Republicans have is, because they\u2019re insisting on doing this in a party line approach, using the Senate reconciliation process --  DICKERSON: Where you only need a majority and not the 60 votes?  ROY: Where you only -- right, exactly. The problem there is, you can address tax against spending to the reconciliation process, but you can\u2019t really do anything about regulation. And so much of the Affordable Care Act is regulations. All the complaints that Paul Ryan made in your interview about rising premiums, those are driven by regulations. And if you can\u2019t reform those regulations through this bill, you\u2019re not actually solving the problems you think that Obamacare has.  DICKERSON: And that\u2019s why he says it\u2019s a multistage approach, but the fact is everybody\u2019s focused on this first stage not the second and third.  Indira, what do you make, if President Trump were watching this discussion, it would sound like a lot of noise probably to him.  INDIRA LAKSHMANAN, \u201cTHE BOSTON GLOBE\u201d: That\u2019s right.  DICKERSON: He is a great salesman, you know --  LAKSHMANAN: But -- well, that\u2019s exactly what I was going to say, John. I think that we really need to look at this also from a political point of view. It\u2019s great to hear all of the details of the plan, but President Trump sold himself on the campaign trail as deal maker in chief. He said to the American people, I am going to be able to get you a better deal. I am going to be able to fix health care because I\u2019m going to be able to negotiate better drug prices. I\u2019m going to be able to negotiate better with the health care companies. I\u2019m going to be able to do everything better. So this is his first big test. He\u2019s coming into Washington. I don\u2019t think he cares so much about the details. That\u2019s what we talked about. He kind of subcontracted this out to Speaker Ryan and said, you know, you do it, that\u2019s OK. We know we have to repeal and replace all in one step, so just do it. That\u2019s fine.  Now he\u2019s going to have to go out to Kentucky, he\u2019s going to have to go out to Tennessee, he\u2019s going to do the salesmanship. He\u2019s got people coming -- he\u2019s got members of Congress coming to his bowling alley in the White House and by all accounts he is, you know, making friends, influencing people. Even Senator Lindsey Graham, who\u2019s no big fan of Donald Trump\u2019s, I was amazed to hear his interview yesterday coming out of the White House saying, well, I had a pretty good time and, boy, he\u2019s a charming guy. And at the same time, Donald Trump is putting pressure on the Republicans, saying, it\u2019s going to be a bloodbath in 2018 if you don\u2019t pass this.  DICKERSON: And Paul Ryan also saying that everything else can only come -- tax reform --  LAKSHMANAN: That\u2019s right.  DICKERSON: All -- all the other things they want to pass can only happen if this happens.  Peter, is it -- is the big hurdle for Donald Trump the fact that he said everyone would be covered and we have estimates of 10 million, maybe 15 million, the CBO score, the official accounting, might be quite bad. Is that the big thing that the president will have the hardest time reconciling or --  BAKER: Yes, I do -- I think that -- as you pointed out in the interview with Speaker Ryan, he promised so many things that seem untenable if you put them together into a plan unless you\u2019re wanting to spend lots and lots of money and do things in a different way than Paul Ryan wants to do them. And ultimately he can\u2019t live up to some of those -- those specific expectations that he created. And they\u2019re his voters.  What\u2019s striking, of course, is that some of the people who are probably most affected by some of the changes we\u2019re talking about here are less wealthy, rural, white, you know, working class Americans who love Donald Trump, who voted for him, who put him into office, and he owes them and he wants to keep them on his side. So I think that\u2019s going to be a real tricky, you know, circle square or square circle.  DICKERSON: We will return with this geometry lesson in a moment.  We\u2019re going to take a break here quickly and then we\u2019ll come back to continue this conversation. Stick with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Panel.  Avik, I want to ask you a question about something Bernie Sanders said about the tax cuts that are -- or the windfall he says is going to the top one percent. Remind people why we\u2019re talking about tax cuts and why this is a part of healthcare.  ROY: Well, it had to fund the ACA\u2019s coverage expansion. So roughly speaking, on a back of the envelope basis, over a 10 year period, the ACA spends $2 trillion trying to cover the uninsured and it funds that through about 1.2 trillion in tax increases and about $850 billion in Medicare cuts. And what the House Republican bill does, it actually preserves the Medicare cuts in the ACA because you can\u2019t touch Medicare through reconciliation. But they repeal nearly all of the tax hikes, and then have their own coverage expansion in this new structure that you talked about with Paul Ryan.  DICKERSON: Ezra, is one of the challenges here that there has been a bit of a success for our -- for the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, which is that it\u2019s created expectations that you\u2019re going to cover pre-existing conditions, you\u2019ll have minimum coverage requirements and then also that -- that kids till the age of 26 stay on their parent\u2019s plan. If you keep all of those, which this does, that makes it expensive.  KLEIN: You are -- it -- it makes it expensive, but it also means you\u2019re working within the -- the broad framework of -- of Obamacare, which they are still doing. And if you\u2019re doing that, then you actually have to retain important parts of that framework. You can\u2019t -- they are splitting the difference between so many different arguments that they have stopped being able to make sense of any of them in particular. So you\u2019re -- they\u2019re trying to take out the individual mandate, replace it with something that\u2019s not quite an individual mandate, this 30 percent surcharge on health care when you come back into the market. And all of a sudden it may not work quite as well, but it also makes people angry and it\u2019s not really clear what goal you\u2019re trying to achieve.  I think -- at this point about reconciliation, which Avik has brought up, is a really important one. I was stunned, actually, to hear Paul Ryan on the program earlier today say that the ACA was jammed down the country\u2019s throat, but this -- this is a regular order slow process. We did not see this bill until last Monday. This is the first time anybody has seen it. And I saw the stuff Ryan produced before. It was all different. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen this piece of legislation with this constellation of ideas.  There are no serious independent analysis of it out yet. It has already passed two committees before those committees knew how it worked or what it would likely do. And without being able to go through regular order process, where there\u2019s actually information, that there are amendments, you go back and forth, you decide if what you\u2019re going to do is actually going to work, there\u2019s not been time for Republicans, or really for anybody, to ask those very fundamental questions and decide, do they need to change this bill in pretty fundamental ways? The speed with which they\u2019re trying to do there is, I think, a speed born of fear, but the speed that is going to make bad policies.  DICKERSON: And that\u2019s why when I asked him about, you know, you can say you ran on this, but you didn\u2019t run on the particulars that were being debated right now.  ROY: Right.  DICKERSON: Indira, one thing that strikes me is, this White House doesn\u2019t really have a bunch of old legislative hands in it.  LAKSHMANAN: That\u2019s right.  DICKERSON: Usually a White House has some people who have worked on The Hill who know how to figure this stuff out. So this is a -- this is a kind of operational challenge for them over there.  LAKSHMANAN: That\u2019s right. And as a comparison, you know, the Republicans, of course, were saying that the Obama administration shoved healthcare down the throat of the American people, but, in fact, it was 15 months that there was open debate over the -- you know, the Affordable Care Act.  KLEIN: They want to do this in one month.  LAKSHMANAN: They want to do it in one month, and 15 months is a huge difference, where everybody was looking at it, debating it, talking about it. So that is a very important difference. And you -- you know, you make a point, it\u2019s operationally different. If you don\u2019t have the expert on, you know, the liaisons with the legislature, then you don\u2019t really know how to do it. But we see that in so many ways. I mean it\u2019s -- it\u2019s sort of akin to putting in charge of cabinets, you know, putting cabinet secretaries in charge of agencies that those people want to abolish those agencies. So it\u2019s kind of a similar thing that, you know, it\u2019s the sort of disruptive factor in government.  ROY: You know what\u2019s going to be interesting is, when that Congressional Budget Office score comes out for this bill, and it says something like, the bill will cover 20 million fewer people than the Affordable Care Act, does Donald Trump, does the president, who\u2019s promised insurance for everybody, say the CBO is fake news? Does he say, Republicans, go back to work and fix this? Because there are certain things about the CBO -- the CBO really, really believes in the individual mandate, much more so than actually the insurers do. So there may be part of the CBO report that are uncharitable in perhaps a way that you could dispute, but there are aspects of the bill that are going to result in fewer people having health insurance. And it\u2019s going to be interesting to see how the president himself reacts to that.  DICKERSON: They already started lowering the view of CBO in the -- in the White House briefing, trying to -- maybe anticipating a bad ruling.  Let me ask you a question, Peter, about another piece of news, which is the travel ban the president\u2019s changed this week.  BAKER: Right.  DICKERSON: There wasn\u2019t as much coverage as the first one.  BAKER: Yes.  DICKERSON: How did it change?  BAKER: Well, it did some important things differently. One, it took out Iraq, our ally in this war against ISIS. Another thing it did was it made clear and explicit that green card holders and people who have visas already are not included, and it took out a preference meant for Christian minorities in some of these Muslim countries. So those -- those things are important in -- in minimizing some of the disruption that we saw the first time around. You didn\u2019t have people on airplanes literally blocked at the border when they got here.  Beyond that, it\u2019s still pretty similar. Still, you know, stopping all refugees and all visitors from these six countries, Muslim majority, for a time. And you -- now back in court. You now have lawsuits already. And I think that the issue is going to be, will these courts look at this as basically a dressed-up version of the same thing, or will they see those changes as being substantive enough to give it, you know, a constitutional veneer.  LAKSHMANAN: They did reverse engineer this second travel ban in a way. I mean it\u2019s clear from looking at it, I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve spoken with many legal scholars about this, that the -- the Trump administration kind of looked at the bill, looked at what the complaints were from the judges, from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and sort of created the new travel ban kind of backwards from that. So a lot of legal scholars think that this will, you know, stand up in court, although there are a lot of problems that predate anything that\u2019s written down, which is that Donald Trump himself said on the campaign trail back in December 2015, I want a Muslim ban, keep them all out.  DICKERSON: Right.  LAKSHMANAN: So there are so many things that he said in the public record that courts can look at, they can say, hey, this is really a Muslim ban dressed up as something else.  DICKERSON: Right.  LAKSHMANAN: And so that\u2019s sort of irrespective on what\u2019s on the piece of paper.  DICKERSON: Ezra, can I get a last thought from you on the job numbers we had Friday. The president took credit for the strong February. Put that in context. It has to be a relatively brief context.  KLEIN: I don\u2019t think he deserves much credit for it just because we\u2019re in the context of a long running labor market expansion now. But these are good job numbers. It\u2019s a buoy to his administration. He\u2019s not done anything yet to interrupt them and presidents can do a lot to mess up a good economy. So right now I think we should be thankful. We have a tightening labor market. We\u2019re seeing wages go up. That is good and we should be careful to try to preserve it.  DICKERSON: All right, thanks all of you for being here.  Thanks for watching. And we\u2019ll be back in just a moment.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: I\u2019ll see you tomorrow when we welcome back our friend and colleague Charlie Rose on \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I\u2019m John Dickerson.",

            "article_content": "CHICAGO -- So many people turned out for the Women\u2019s March on Chicago that organizers canceled their plans to march through the city\u2019s downtown and instead planned to extend the ongoing rally on the city\u2019s lakefront.\u00a0   \tBut people who turned out for the event spilled into downtown streets anyway. After the event concluded in Grant Park, people began flooding nearby streets, chanting and waving signs protesting President Donald Trump.\u00a0  There were estimates of 150,000 people at the park early Saturday afternoon, and more were still arriving. The march portion through downtown Chicago had originally been canceled due to safety concerns. \u00a0  The rally took place the same day as the Woman\u2019s March on Washington and similar events in 200 cities, including Springfield and Carbondale in Illinois. Activists are talking about health care, immigrant rights and gun violence. Organizers also want to send a message to Mr. Trump that women will defend their rights.   \tDorothy DeCarlo of Chicago said she burned her bra for women\u2019s rights 50 years ago. The 69-year-old says she can\u2019t believe she\u2019s protesting over the same things.  In Washington, a massive turnout also forced a change of plans. So many people packed the original route along the south side of the National Mall that organizers couldn\u2019t lead a formal trek toward White House.  Interim D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham said on Independence Avenue, \u201cThe crowd stretches so far that there\u2019s no room left to march.\u201d  Instead, march organizers directed the crowd to take a new route to meet up at the Ellipse, a grassy area between the Washington Monument and the White House.  Seventy-one-year-old Allan Parachini, who traveled from Hawaii to the Washington march, called it \u201cthe most impressive crowd I\u2019ve seen since Woodstock.\u201d  By mid-afternoon, the scene in Washington was getting chaotic as some protesters proceeded toward the White House and the Ellipse. Instead of trekking en masse, protesters were told to head there by way of other streets. And with that, throngs surged in the direction of the White House in a chaotic scene that snarled downtown Washington.\u00a0  \u201cHey, hey, ho, ho, Donald trump has got to go,\u201d some marchers chanted.   \tWomen brandished signs with slogans such as \u201cWomen won\u2019t back down\u201d and \u201cLess fear more love\u201d and decried Mr. Trump\u2019s stand on such issues as abortion, health care, gay rights, diversity and climate change. In a five-hour-plus program, speaker after speaker branded Mr. Trump a sexist, a bully, a bigot and more.\u00a0  Seas of people blocked traffic as they walked from the National Mall. On one street, a police car trying to move got stuck in the crowd. Marchers surrounded a float that had several supporters of Mr. Trump on board and chanted, \u201cshame.\u201d Other marchers were shouting \u201cblack lives matter\u201d and \u201cmy body, my choice\u201d as they moved along Pennsylvania Avenue toward the White House.\u00a0  On the other side of the Mall, rally-goers were heading home. The line to get on the escalator at the Judiciary Square Metro station was half a city block long.  Officials said the crowd in Washington could be more than half a million people, more than double expectations.  There were early signs that the crowd could top those that gathered for Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration on Friday. City officials said march organizers had more than doubled their turnout estimate to 500,000 as crowds began swelling and subways into the city became clogged with participants.    \tFigures from transportation officials in Washington also suggested more people may be on the National Mall for the women\u2019s march than came for the inauguration. As of 11 a.m. Saturday, 275,000 people had taken trips on the city\u2019s subway system.   \tOn Inauguration Day, 193,000 trips had been taken as of that time, and the rail system opened an hour earlier that day, at 4 a.m.\u00a0  Saturday\u2019s ridership figures were more than eight times a normal Saturday and busier than most weekdays.\u00a0  In addition, some 1,800 buses were registered to park in the city. Greyhound reported adding more buses from New York. And a commuter rail system in Washington added five times its normal capacity to help deal with the crowds.\u00a0  The event featured a bevy of celebrities who spoke and performed for the march. It also stacked up support from some prominent politicians, including Mr. Trump\u2019s general election opponent, Hillary Clinton. She tweeted a message of thanks to participants.  More than 600 \u201csister marches\u201d were planned across the U.S. and abroad in conjunction with the Women\u2019s March on Washington, which is described on its website as \u201ca grassroots effort comprised of dozens of independent coordinators at the state level.\u201d  Here\u2019s a look at some of the rallies:  Thousands of women gathered in downtown Los Angeles and other cities throughout California, carrying signs and wearing pink knit hats in solidarity with the Women\u2019s March on Washington.\u00a0  Demonstrators packed Los Angeles metro trains to reach the rallying site under clear blue skies Saturday morning, a day after about 2,000 people marched through a rare, ferocious rainstorm to protest Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration in front of City Hall.   Saturday\u2019s demonstrations were expected to draw much higher numbers: 94,000 people had pledged to attend the Los Angeles event online, and organizers said a roster of Hollywood celebrities including Jane Fonda and Natalie Portman were expected to participate.\u00a0  Demonstrators who crammed near Trump World Tower for the Women\u2019s March on New York City say the new president may be from there -- but he\u2019s no New Yorker.   \u201cNew York is a community in itself, and people care about each other, and it\u2019s diverse,\u201d said Ashia Badi, 44, who brought her two daughters to Midtown Manhattan to march in protest of Mr. Trump. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t feel like he has those New York values I see.\u201d   New York City and state overwhelmingly voted for Clinton.   On Saturday, thousands of people donning pink knit hats held signs that read \u201cWomen\u2019s rights are human rights\u201d and \u201cPutin\u2019s puppet.\u201d   Patricia Palermo, one of six women wearing surgical masks that say \u201csave the ACA\u201d (Affordable Care Act) said she would fight Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to eviscerate the law.  She said she met the president once doing real estate.   New Yorkers know Mr. Trump, she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why most New Yorkers are against him. We\u2019ve seen him in person.\u201d\u00a0  Samantha Moyo looked out at the tens of thousands of marchers sardined into London\u2019s Trafalgar Square with a look of contentment, even bliss.\u00a0  The 30-year-old Londoner, originally from Zimbabwe, was overwhelmed by the size of the crowd, and its determination to challenge Mr. Trump\u2019s world view.   \u201cI\u2019m a black, immigrant bisexual woman, and the fact that women all over the world are standing up for what they believe in, and that I was invited to be on the front line, feels like a huge privilege,\u201d she said after helping to lead the march that snaked through central London, stopping traffic at times in the metropolis.   \u201cI have a feeling of love and excitement in my heart, thinking of how far we\u2019ve come.\u201d   Moyo said she was initially worried about Mr. Trump\u2019s policies but has come to believe he will inspire resistance.   \u201cI just feel a huge amount of celebration and optimism for the future,\u201d she said.\u00a0  Police described the event as entirely peaceful with no arrests.   Protesters, including many men, displayed a grab-bag of grievances about the new president\u2019s policies. Some criticized his view on climate change and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Others cited his treatment of women and minorities.  Several thousand people, including many American workers and students living in France, gathered in the Eiffel Tower neighborhood in a joyful atmosphere.\u00a0  They sang and carried posters with slogans such as \u201cWe have our eyes on you Mr. Trump\u201d and \u201cWith our sisters in Washington.\u201d   Anne Tiracchia, from Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, was on vacation in France where her son lives. In French, she wrote \u201cLet us resist the catastrophe\u201d on a U.S. flag.   \u201cIt\u2019s important because Trump wants to destroy 50 years of progress, he wants to go back to smoke coming out of factories and women staying home and having babies,\u201d Tiracchia said. \u201cHe won\u2019t change. He doesn\u2019t care. But we have to show we don\u2019t agree with him.\u201d   More than 40 feminist and anti-racist groups organized the Paris march.  Thousands of people converged on Boston Common on Saturday to march in protest of Mr. Trump and stand in solidarity with society\u2019s most vulnerable people. The Boston Women\u2019s March for America was part of the nationwide series of post-inauguration marches and rallies. Organizers expected as many as 80,000 participants.\u00a0  Among the crowd were scores of women wearing pink, cat-eared, knit hats and others holding signs including one that said, \u201cLove Not Hate Makes America Great.\u201d\u00a0  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren called for challenging any Republican efforts to overturn abortion rights, take away health care from millions of Americans and tear apart immigrant families through deportation.\u00a0  \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s campaign was about attacks on women, attacks on African-Americans, attacks on Latinos, attacks on religious groups, attacks on immigrants,\u201d the Massachusetts Democrat told the crowd. \u201cWe come here to stand shoulder-to-shoulder to make clear we are here, we will not be silent, we will not play dead, we will fight for what we believe in.\u201d\u00a0  A mile-long procession was to follow several speeches. Police said the rally has been peaceful with no incidents.\u00a0  Leah Cathers, of Lowell, attended the march with her sister. She told The Boston Globe she believes the country is going in the wrong direction.\u00a0  \u201cI\u2019m horrified by the fact that people have forgotten that these issues are about human beings, whether it\u2019s the Muslim population or refugees,\u201d she said.\u00a0  Rebecca Munnerlyn had never marched at the South Carolina Capitol before. But when she listened to Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural speech she knew she had to join thousands of other women marching Saturday.\u00a0  \u201cHis words are against women. His actions have been against women,\u201d Munnerlyn said. \u201cI had to come out.\u201d   Several thousand women filled the Statehouse steps with signs like \u201cMake America Think Again\u201d and \u201cYou Can\u2019t Comb Over Sexism.\u201d They chanted \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d and \u201cHealth Care For All\u201d before walking around the capitol grounds and to a nearby business to plan for more protests.   Mr. Trump\u2019s speech rekindled Munnerlyn\u2019s worst fears about the next four years.   \u201cThe next war won\u2019t be started by sinking a ship. I fear it will be started by a bad tweet,\u201d Munnerlyn said.  Sarah Gospodar likened the chilly, damp rally at Trenton\u2019s War Memorial to the civil rights marches of the 1960s, when people came together peacefully to effect change.   \u201cAs a middle-aged black woman, I\u2019ve seen a lot in my life - things that divided this country and things that united it,\u201d the 53-year-old Ewing woman said. \u201cAnd these issues we address today are things that should unite us. How can anyone be against equal pay and fair and equal rights for all Americans?\u201d   Gospodar acknowledged she\u2019s no fan of Mr. Trump but said she will give him the chance to \u201cshow he really does want to make America great.\u201d She said if Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents want respect for their views, they must show the president and his backers the same respect.   Mary Morrisey, 35, of Trenton, said she didn\u2019t mind standing in the cold because the demonstration was an opportunity to make things better for people across the nation, especially LGBT people and minorities. She held a handmade sign that read \u201cGirls just want to have fundamental rights.\u201d   \u201cWe may go about things differently, but we all want the same thing: life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,\u201d Morrisey said.  Demonstrators flooded a popular central Sydney park carrying placards with slogans including \u201cWomen of the world resist,\u201d \u2018\u2019Feminism is my trump card\u201d and \u201cFight like a girl.\u201d\u00a0  Organizer Mindy Freiband told the crowd hatred, bigotry and racism are not only America\u2019s problems.   \u201cThis is the beginning of something, not the end,\u201d she said.   Protester Alyssa Smith, who came with her husband and 2-year-old daughter, said she worried about the future after Mr. Trump\u2019s election. She said she didn\u2019t want her daughter growing up in the world \u201cwhere hatred is commonplace.\u201d   Charlotte Wilde said she shed tears watching Mr. Trump get sworn in. The 33-year-old said the businessman\u2019s rise to the presidency left her in a state of horror, and attending Saturday\u2019s rally was a way to feel empowered.   A plane was seen skywriting \u201cTRUMP\u201d over the rally.   Skywriting Australia owner Rob Vance said the sign was commissioned by Trump fans who wanted to remain anonymous.  Charlize Theron led crowd in a chant of \u201cLove, not hate, makes America great\u201d on Main Street in Park City, Utah.   Marchers there included many celebrities gathered for the Sundance Film Festival, including Chelsea Handler and Benjamin Bratt. A steady snow fell as marchers headed past one of the festival\u2019s theatres.\u00a0  At a rally in Concord, author Jodi Picoult told the crowd, \u201cWe in New Hampshire are not in the habit of going in reverse. We have the backs of those who are less fortunate - who may be struggling for health care, for environmental rights, for racial equality, for a fair wage, for justice.\u00a0  \u201cWe are in this together. And we know that change does not come from the top down, but from the bottom up.\u201d\u00a0  Dozens attended a \u201csolidarity picnic\u201d in Yangon, also known as Rangoon, organized by Alyssa Paylor of Colorado and other U.S. expats.\u00a0  \u201cWe\u2019re not able to have a march in this climate, so we wanted to just gather together in solidarity with our sisters and brothers marching in Washington and all across the world because of what we believe in,\u201d said Paylor, 26. She is in Myanmar, also known as Burma, working for an organization called Mote Oo Education for Curriculum Development.   Paylor said Mr. Trump\u2019s election and the United Kingdom\u2019s Brexit vote motivated people to get involved.   \u201cI think these things have energized a lot of people and made many people, especially women, very angry about what they may have to deal with in the coming years,\u201d she said.  Hundreds gathered in freezing weather in a busy city square in the Czech capital of Prague, waving portraits of Mr. Trump and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and holding banners that read \u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d \u2018\u2019Kindness\u201d and \u201cLove.\u201d   \u201cWe are worried about the way some politicians talk, especially during the American elections,\u201d organizer Johanna Nejedlova said.\u00a0  Tens of thousands of women from across Colorado gathered in Civic Center Park in Denver Saturday for a solidarity march, CBS Denver reports.\u00a0  The \u201cWomen\u2019s March on Denver\u201d got going before 10 a.m. and continued into the afternoon. \u00a0  At Colfax Avenue and Broadway women, girls \u2014 and many males, too \u2014 were filling the streets, many carrying signs. No traffic was getting through in that intersection and many others along the march route due to the large turnout of people. \u00a0 Some signs had messages about racial equality, environment, health care and unification. Others made direct references to President Donald Trump\u2019s statements. \u00a0 ",

            "article_content": " CBS News\u2019 Emily Schultheis, Jillian Hughes and Charlie Brooks contributed to this live blog. 9:55 p.m. ET Mr. Obama concluded by quoting the slogan for his first campaign, \u201cYes We Can.\u201d \u201cI am asking you to hold fast to that faith written into our founding documents, that idea whispered by slaves and abolitionists, that spirit sung by immigrants and homesteaders and those who marched for justice, that creed reaffirmed by those who planted flags from foreign battlefields to the surface of the moon, a creed at the core of every American whose story is not yet written,\u201d he said. \u201cYes we can. Yes we did. Yes we can.\u201d 9:52 p.m. ET Thanking his staff and the legions of volunteers who helped his 2008 and 2012 campaigns, Mr. Obama said: \u201cYou did change the world.\u201d \u201cTo all of you out there \u2013 every organizer who moved to an unfamiliar town and kind family who welcomed them in, every volunteer who knocked on doors, every young person who cast a ballot for the first time, every American who lived and breathed the hard work of change \u2013 you are the best supporters and organizers anybody could hope for, and I will be forever grateful,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause you did change the world. You did.\u201d 9:50 p.m. ET Mr. Obama next thanked Vice President Joe Biden, saying he has become like a \u201cbrother\u201d to him. Biden, \u201cthe scrappy kid from Scranton who became Delaware\u2019s favorite son: you were the first decision I made as a nominee, and it was the best,\u201d he said. \u201cNot just because you have been a great Vice President, but because in the bargain, I gained a brother.\u201d 9:47 p.m. ET Wiping back tears, Mr. Obama thanked his wife and two daughters. \u201cFor the past twenty-five years, you have been not only my wife and mother of my children, you have been my best friend,\u201d he said to Michelle Obama, sitting in the audience. \u201cYou took on a role you didn\u2019t ask for and made it your own with grace and with grit and with style and with humor. \u00a0You made the White House a place that belongs to everybody. And a new generation sets its sights higher because it has you as a role model.\u201d To his daughters, Sasha and Malia, Mr. Obama said he has watched them become \u201camazing young women.\u201d \u201cMalia and Sasha, under the strangest of circumstances, you have become two amazing young women, smart and beautiful, but more importantly, kind and thoughtful and full of passion,\u201d he said. \u201cYou wore the burden of years in the spotlight so easily. \u00a0Of all that I\u2019ve done in my life, I\u2019m most proud to be your dad.\u201d 9:43 p.m. ET\u00a0Mr. Obama said the most important title in a democracy is that of a \u201ccitizen\u201d -- and laid a blueprint for how people can continue to be involved in safeguarding American democracy. \u201cIf you\u2019re tired of arguing with strangers on the internet, try talking with one of them in real life,\u201d he said. \u201cIf something needs fixing, then lace up your shoes and do some organizing. If you\u2019re disappointed by your elected officials, grab a clipboard, get some signatures, and run for office yourself. Show up. Dive in. Persevere.\u201d He acknowledged there are ups and downs for those involved in politics and the business of democracy. \u201cSometimes you\u2019ll win. Sometimes you\u2019ll lose. Presuming a reservoir of goodness in others can be a risk, and there will be times when the process will disappoint you,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for those of us fortunate enough to have been a part of this work, to see it up close, let me tell you, it can energize and inspire. And more often than not, your faith in America \u2013 and in Americans \u2013 will be confirmed. Mine sure has been.\u201d 9:38 p.m. ET Americans cannot and should not take democracy for granted, Mr. Obama said. \u201cOur democracy is threatened whenever we take it for granted,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of us, regardless of party, should throw ourselves into the task of rebuilding our democratic institutions.\u201d Among the issues he raised were expanding voting rights, increasing transparency in government and reversing electoral gerrymandering that\u2019s contributed to increasing polarization in Congress. 9:36 p.m. ET\u00a0Mr. Obama said democracy is most challenged when people \u201cgive in to fear,\u201d urging the country to avoid \u201ca weakening of the values that make us who we are.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why, for the past eight years, I\u2019ve worked to put the fight against terrorism on a firmer legal footing,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve ended torture, worked to close Gitmo, and reform our laws governing surveillance to protect privacy and civil liberties.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why I reject discrimination against Muslim Americans,\u201d he continued, to applause. \u201cThat\u2019s why we cannot withdraw from big global fights \u2013 to expand democracy, and human rights, and women\u2019s rights, and LGBT rights \u2013 no matter how imperfect our efforts, no matter how expedient ignoring such values may seem. That\u2019s part of defending America. For the fight against extremism and intolerance and sectarianism and chauvinism are of a piece with the fight against authoritarianism and nationalist aggression.\u201d 9:33 p.m. ET Next, Mr. Obama turned to the issue of terrorism -- both at home and abroad. \u201cBecause of the extraordinary courage of our men and women in uniform, and the intelligence officers, law enforcement, and diplomats who support them, no foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland these past eight years,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd although Boston and Orlando remind us of how dangerous radicalization can be, our law enforcement agencies are more effective and vigilant than ever. We\u2019ve taken out tens of thousands of terrorists \u2013 including Osama bin Laden.\u00a0 \u201cThe global coalition we\u2019re leading against ISIL has taken out their leaders, and taken away about half their territory,\u201d he continued. \u201cISIL will be destroyed, and no one who threatens America will ever be safe.\u201d 9:31 p.m. ET Nodding to the issue of climate change -- on which Mr. Trump is a self-described skeptic -- Mr. Obama said it is essential that the U.S. continue its progress. \u201cIn just eight years, we\u2019ve halved our dependence on foreign oil, doubled our renewable energy, and led the world to an agreement that has the promise to save this planet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut without bolder action, our children won\u2019t have time to debate the existence of climate change; they\u2019ll be busy dealing with its effects: environmental disasters, economic disruptions, and waves of climate refugees seeking sanctuary.\u201d Pretending the problem doesn\u2019t exist \u201cnot only betrays future generations, it betrays the essential spirit of this country,\u201d Mr. Obama continued. 9:28 p.m. ET Mr. Obama urged people to find ways to keep from \u201ctalking past each other.\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t that part of what so often makes politics so dispiriting?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow can elected officials rage about deficits when we propose to spend money on preschool for kids, but not when we\u2019re cutting taxes for corporations? How do we excuse ethical lapses in our own party, but pounce when the other party does the same thing?\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s not just dishonest, this selective sorting of the facts; it\u2019s self-defeating,\u201d he continued. \u201cBecause as my mom used to tell me, reality has a way of catching up with you.\u201d 9:26 p.m. ET Another threat to American democracy, Mr. Obama said, is people\u2019s collective retreat into their own \u201cbubbles.\u201d \u201cThe rise of naked partisanship, increasing economic and regional stratification, the splintering of our media into a channel for every taste \u2013 all this makes this great sorting seem natural, even inevitable,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd increasingly, we become so secure in our bubbles that we accept only information, whether true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that\u2019s out there.\u201d 9:23 p.m. ET Mr. Obama also spoke about the racial tensions still plaguing the country, which have been put on display in recent months with clashes between the police and the African American community. \u201cAfter my election, there was talk of a post-racial America,\u201d he said. \u201cSuch a vision, however well-intended, was never realistic. For race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society.\u201d While progress has been made, he continued, \u201cwe\u2019re not where we need to be.\u201d \u00a0 \u201cAll of us have more work to do,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAfter all, if every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and undeserving minorities, then workers of all shades will be left fighting for scraps while the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclaves.\u201d 9:21 p.m. ET As congressional Republicans debate their options for repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obama noted the progress that\u2019s been made on health care -- and challenged Republicans to come up with something better. \u201cHealth care costs are rising at the slowest rate in fifty years,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if anyone can put together a plan that is demonstrably better than the improvements we\u2019ve made to our health care system \u2013 that covers as many people at less cost \u2013 I will publicly support it.\u201d 9:19 p.m. ET Mr. Obama framed his remarks as a look at the \u201cstate of our democracy,\u201d outlining the challenges the country will face going forward. \u201cA shrinking world, growing inequality; demographic change and the specter of terrorism \u2013 these forces haven\u2019t just tested our security and prosperity, but they\u2019re testing our democracy as well,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd how we meet these challenges to our democracy will determine our ability to educate our kids, and create good jobs, and protect our homeland.\u201d 9:14 p.m. ET Acknowledging the tradition of a peaceful transition of power, Mr. Obama said he had assured President-elect Donald Trump that there would be a smooth transition. \u201cIn ten days, the world will witness a hallmark of our democracy: the peaceful transfer of power from one freely-elected president to the next,\u201d he said, to boos from the audience. \u201cI committed to President-Elect Trump that my administration would ensure the smoothest possible transition, just as President Bush did for me.\u201d 9:13 p.m. ET In a nod to his legacy, Mr. Obama said the U.S. is \u201ca better, stronger place\u201d than it was when he took office. \u201cIf I had told you eight years ago that America would reverse a great recession, reboot our auto industry, and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our history\u2026if I had told you that we would open up a new chapter with the Cuban people, shut down Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program without firing a shot, and take out the mastermind of 9/11\u2026if I had told you that we would win marriage equality, and secure the right to health insurance for another 20 million of our fellow citizens \u2013 you might have said our sights were set a little too high,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s what we did. That\u2019s what you did.\u201d 9:09 p.m. ET Mr. Obama acknowledged democracy is not always easy, and said progress is sometimes \u201cuneven.\u201d \u201cYes, our progress has been uneven,\u201d he said. \u201cThe work of democracy has always been hard, contentious and sometimes bloody. For every two steps forward, it often feels we take one step back. But the long sweep of America has been defined by forward motion, a constant widening of our founding creed to embrace all, and not just some.\u201d 9:04 p.m ET Mr. Obama was met with loud, sustained cheers when he took the stage. After telling the crowd to quiet down -- \u201cwe\u2019re on live TV here, I\u2019ve got to move,\u201d he said -- Mr. Obama quipped: \u201cYou can tell that I\u2019m a lame duck because nobody\u2019s following instructions.\u201d 9:02 p.m. ET President Obama takes the stage at McCormack Place in Chicago. \u201cHello Chicago,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be home.\u201d 6:35 p.m. ET When he takes the stage tonight, President Obama will talk about how his youth in Chicago helped show him the way to effect real change in the United States, according to speech excerpts released by the White House. \u201cI first came to Chicago when I was in my early twenties, still trying to figure out who I was; still searching for a purpose to my life,\u201d he will say. \u201cIt was in neighborhoods not far from here where I began working with church groups in the shadows of closed steel mills. It was on these streets where I witnessed the power of faith, and the quiet dignity of working people in the face of struggle and loss.\u00a0 \u201cThis is where I learned that change only happens when ordinary people get involved, get engaged, and come together to demand it,\u201d Mr. Obama will continue. \u201cAfter eight years as your President, I still believe that.\u00a0 And it\u2019s not just my belief.\u00a0 It\u2019s the beating heart of our American idea \u2013 our bold experiment in self-government.\u201d 1 p.m. ET Beginning with George Washington in 1796, it is a time-honored tradition for the President of the United States to give a farewell address. President Obama will continue that tradition on Tuesday when he speaks in Chicago at McCormack Place at 9 p.m. ET. According to Mr. Obama\u2019s chief of staff, Dennis McDonough, he chose Chicago because \u201cthis is a place where working on the South Side of Chicago and the neighborhoods \u2026 in the shadows of the abandoned steel mills, as a community organizer with people who had been knocked out of jobs that theretofore had been real paths to the middle class, that he recognized that he had a gift for organizing.\u201d His message to Americans, McDonough told CBS News\u2019 Charlie Rose, is to keep fighting for what you believe in.\u00a0 \u201cHe had a gift for getting people working together towards the same goal. And I think that\u2019s what you\u2019ll hear a lot about from the president tomorrow, the importance of sticking together, working together, standing up for what you believe in, and then fighting like hell for it.\u201d \u00a0 Vice President Joe Biden and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who was Mr. Obama\u2019s first White House chief of staff, are among the Democratic officials who plan to attend.\u00a0 Mr. Obama\u2019s address also has some heavyweight musical talent in the lineup -- Pearl Jam lead singer Eddie Vedder will be be performing with Voice of Chicago, according to a tweet. Eddie Vedder, joined by members of the @VoiceOfChicago, will perform at @POTUS's Farewell Address tonight: https://t.co/grUhDvblKx pic.twitter.com/91Qs6BkJQH You can watch the speech at 9 p.m. on CBSN\u00a0and CBS, among other broadcast and cable news channels.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "President Trump signed a new executive order Monday that will impose a 90-day ban on the issuance of new visas to people from six predominantly Muslim nations and will suspend the U.S. refugee program for all countries for 120 days, a senior Department of Homeland Security official said Monday. Unlike\u00a0the original executive order from Jan. 27\u00a0that now sits in legal limbo, Iraq is the one country excluded from the 90-day ban, the official said, because the Iraqi government has made \u201cfirm commitments\u201d to the U.S. to work toward increased cooperation in terms of information-sharing. The revised order will not indefinitely block Syrian refugees from the U.S., as the original ban had directed, and the 120-day halt to the refugee program will apply to all countries. Like the original order, the administration is lowering the previous administration\u2019s cap for refugees admitted to the U.S. from 110,000 to 50,000 for the current fiscal year. House Republicans\u00a0have released their long-awaited bill dismantling much of former President Barack Obama\u2019s health care overhaul. The measure would roll back the government\u2019s health care role and is expected to result in fewer people having insurance coverage.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0House committees planned votes on the legislation Wednesday. That will launch perhaps the year\u2019s defining battle in Congress, and GOP success is by no means assured because of internal divisions. The plan would repeal the law\u2019s fines on people who don\u2019t purchase health insurance. Instead of the statute\u2019s income-based premium subsidies, people would get tax credits based on age. The subsidies would phase out for higher-earning people. Republican Senators are asking for evidence of President Trump\u2019s assertion that former President Obama had ordered the wiretapping of Trump tower.\u00a0\u201cI think the President should tell the American people what evidence he has that indicates his predecessor wiretapped Trump Tower,\u201d Senator John McCain (R-AZ) told reporters on Monday evening. \u201cIt was a very serious charge and one that needs corroboration,\u201d noted McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. \u201cIf it\u2019s true it\u2019s earth-shattering,\u201d commented Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC). When asked if Mr. Trump\u2019s claims were a distraction, he responded, \u201cit\u2019s not a distraction as much as it is unnerving if it\u2019s true.\u201d During the announcement of the new travel ban executive order, Attorney General Jeff Sessions attempted to make the case for the pause in allowing refugees into the U.S. with a statement warning of the potential national security danger they pose. \u201c[M]ore than 300 people who came here as refugees are under FBI investigation for potential terrorism-related activities,\u201d Sessions said Monday morning. He also said that those who are \u201cseeking to support or commit terrorist attacks here will try to enter through our refugee program.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 The line also appears in the text of the executive order: \u201cThe Attorney General has reported to me that more than 300 persons who entered the United States as refugees are currently the subjects of counterterrorism investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\u201d President Donald Trump\u00a0has offered to maintain federal funding for\u00a0Planned Parenthood\u00a0if the group stops providing abortions. Its president spurned the proposal and noted that federal money already is not allowed to be used for abortion.\u00a0 Trump confirmed Monday there had been discussions after The New York Times inquired about what it described as an informal proposal.\u00a0 In a statement, Mr. Trump said polling shows most Americans oppose public funding for abortion.\u00a0 Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Attorney General Jeff Sessions unveiled the new travel ban executive order Monday morning. There are a number of things that are different\u00a0in this version of the travel ban.\u00a0 Tillerson told reporters that after the signing of the first order, there was an intensive review of Iraq\u2019s vetting policies, and as a result, the two countries would implement \u201cmultiple security measures\u201d to help prevent people with \u201ccriminal or terroristic intent\u201d from reaching the U.S. Kelly pointed out that nothing in the new executive order affects \u201cexisting, lawful permanent residents or persons with current authorization to enter our homeland.\u201d President Trump on Saturday\u00a0accused former President Obama of wiretapping his phones\u00a0at Trump Tower during the election. The unsubstantiated and unprecedented claim is raising eyebrows. Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), hundreds of warrants are issued each year to allow eavesdropping on a \u201cforeign power or agent of a foreign power.\u201d But according to the Justice Department, the president cannot order a wiretap if the surveillance involves \u201ccommunication to which a U.S. person is a party.\u201d Two-thirds of Americans believe a special prosecutor should be appointed to investigate potential ties between\u00a0Trump campaign aides and Russia, according to a new poll out Monday. In the poll,\u00a0from CNN/ORC, 65 percent of those surveyed said they thought an independent special prosecutor should handle the investigation, compared with 32 percent who said Congress is capable of looking into the allegations against the president and his top aides. These numbers come the week after reports that Attorney General Jeff Sessions met twice with the Russian ambassador during the campaign, a revelation that resulted in Sessions\u00a0recusing himself\u00a0from future investigations involving the Trump campaign. On Saturday,\u00a0senior FBI officials called Justice Department officials and asked that they publicly reject President Trump\u2019s assertion\u00a0that then-President Obama ordered the wiretapping of then-candidate Trump\u2019s phones, CBS News\u2019 Jeff Pegues reported, citing law enforcement sources. The message to the Justice Department came from FBI Director James Comey, who disputed the claim because it falsely suggests that the FBI broke the law. Key members of Congress say they will honor President Donald Trump\u2019s request to investigate\u00a0his unsubstantiated claim that Barack Obama overstepped his authority as president and had Trump\u2019s telephones tapped during the election campaign. A U.S. official said the FBI has asked the Justice Department to dispute Trump\u2019s allegation, though no such statement has been issued. Obama\u2019s intelligence director also said no such action was ever carried out. The start of a new administration is never a clean slate, even when parties flip. Day One is just another day for military operations, a budget that is still in place from the old crowd and a vast array of economic, social and law enforcement initiatives left over from the last president. You would not know this from President Donald Trump. He proudly takes credit for any positive development that has bloomed since he took office Jan. 20, even when the roots and buds of it were from President Barack Obama\u2019s time.\u00a0 Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of the long-running conservative website Newsmax, says he talked to President Trump over the weekend and hasn\u2019t \u201cseen him this p---ed off in a long time.\u201d \u201cI spoke with the president twice yesterday about the wiretap story. I haven\u2019t seen him this p---ed off in a long time,\u201d Ruddy wrote in a Sunday column. On Saturday, Mr. Trump claimed, without evidence, that\u00a0former President Obama had wiretapped his phones before the election. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper stated for part of the national security apparatus he oversaw as DNI, that to his knowledge, there was no FISA court order for Trump\u2019s offices. Clapper, who made the comments on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d added that while he can\u2019t speak for other Title 3 entities or local or state law enforcement, he would know if the FBI ordered some sort of surveillance. \u201cI can deny it,\u201d he said definitively. President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0explosive accusations\u00a0about his White House predecessor\u2019s wiretapping activities during the 2016 election have dominated headlines since he first tweeted them Saturday morning -- and two top members of the Senate Intelligence Committee discussed their implications on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d Sen. Mark Warner (D-Virginia), the committee\u2019s vice chair, said Mr. Trump\u2019s Saturday morning tweets -- in which he accused former President Barack Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower for political reasons -- were \u201creckless.\u201d Mr. Trump did not cite any evidence in his tweets, though similar claims had been\u00a0circulating in the conservative media\u00a0in recent days. After another weekend in which\u00a0a tweet from President Donald Trump\u00a0upended the political world, former Defense Secretary and CIA Director\u00a0Leon Panetta said the the White House is \u201cpaying a price\u201d for its lack of \u201cdiscipline.\u201d \u201cWhen the president goes off and does what he did in the last few days of just going ahead and tweeting without checking on things, there\u2019s something wrong,\u201d he told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong in terms of the discipline within the White House and how you operate.\u201d President Trump is calling on Congress to investigate whether Obama abused his executive power\u00a0during the presidential election. The White House issued a statement Sunday morning \u201crequesting that as part of their investigation into Russian activity, the congressional intelligence committees exercise their oversight authority to determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016.\u201d The statement went on to say, \u201cNeither the White House nor the President will comment further until such oversight is conducted.\u201d On Saturday morning, without citing any evidence, the president issued a series of tweets\u00a0accusing Obama of tapping the phones\u00a0in Trump Tower.\u00a0 As President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans debate the future of Medicare, Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Dr. Tom Price said Sunday that Republicans \u201cbelieve in the guarantee of Medicare for our seniors.\u201d His comments come after President Donald Trump reiterated\u00a0during his address to a joint session of Congress\u00a0last week that he doesn\u2019t want to change Medicare benefits. Meanwhile, House Speaker Paul Ryan has said he still thinks the future of Medicare is an \u201copen question.\u201d Last Sunday, Kellyanne Conway wasn\u2019t defending her boss, President Donald J. Trump, on TV. She was at church, attending mass with her husband, attorney George T. Conway, and their four children, along with some friends. Breakfast at a diner came next, followed by some quality family time at their northern New Jersey home -- a brief return to what life used to be like. But these days, her Sunday routine is far from normal. The new normal includes full Secret Service protection. \u201cWhy? Have there been threats?\u201d asked O\u2019Donnell. \u201cYes,\u201d Conway replied. \u201cI have 24/7 Secret Service protection.\u201d Vice Chairman of the Sen. Select Committee on Intelligence Mark Warner, Maine Sen. Susan Collins, HHS Secretary Tom Price and former Defense Secretary and former CIA Director Leon Panetta are the guests on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d this week. Supreme Court nominee\u00a0Neil Gorsuch has shown a willingness to limit the participation of environmental groups\u00a0in lawsuits involving public lands, writing in one case that allowing conservationists to intervene could complicate and slow down the judicial process, according to an Associated Press review of his rulings as a federal appeals court judge. Gorsuch has spent a decade on the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which hears disputes about public lands ranging from energy companies\u2019 drilling rights to the use of off-road vehicles in national forests across six Western states. Republican leaders in Maine and Utah are asking President Donald Trump to step into uncharted territory and rescind national monument designations made by his predecessor. The Antiquities Act of 1906 doesn\u2019t give the president power to undo a designation, and no president has ever taken such a step. But Trump isn\u2019t like other presidents. Former President Barack Obama used his power under the act to permanently preserve more land and water using national monument designations than any other president. The land is generally off limits to timber harvesting, mining and pipelines, and commercial development.",

            "article_content": "YANGON, Myanmar -- Aung San Suu Kyi made her first visit as Myanmar's leader Thursday to the conflict-torn region where more than half a million Rohingya Muslims have fled state-led violence that has spiraled into Asia's worst refugee crisis in decades. Her visit to Rakhine state comes as Suu Kyi is under intense international scrutiny for her response to the exodus, which the U.N. has called \"ethnic cleansing,\" and as her government said it is working on a plan to repatriate those who fled to Bangladesh. Suu Kyi arrived in the state capital, Sittwe, in the morning and headed to restive northern Rakhine where many Rohingya villages were located. During a 2015 election campaign, she visited southern Rakhine, where there hasn't been much conflict. \"The state counselor just arrived but she is heading to Maungdaw, northern Rakhine, with the state officials,\" said Tin Maung Swe, a deputy director of the Rakhine government, using Suu Kyi's official title. Government spokesman Zaw Htay would not release Suu Kyi's plans for the trip until later because of security concerns. More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh since Aug. 25, when security forces in Buddhist-majority Myanmar began what they called \"clearance operations\" in response to deadly attacks on police outposts by insurgents. The campaign has included the burning of Rohingya villages and alleged widespread rights violations. Fleeing Rohingya have described arson, rape and shootings by Myanmar soldiers and Buddhist mobs that left them no option but to make the dangerous and sometimes deadly journey through jungles and by sea to Bangladesh. The exodus has slowed at some points but has not stopped. On Thursday morning, at least 2,000 terrified and starving Rohingya huddled in rice paddy fields near one border crossing on the Naf river. They had waited for more than 24 hours for permission to enter Bangladesh and spent the night in the muddy fields. The global image of Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace laureate, has been damaged by the crisis and she has come under intense criticism to do more to end the violence and condemn those responsible. Several fellow peace prize winners have publicly condemned Suu Kyi for what they see as her apparent indifference to the plight of the Rohingya. Though Suu Kyi has been the de facto head of Myanmar's civilian government since her party swept elections in 2015, the former political prisoner is limited in her control of the country by a constitution written by the military junta that ruled Myanmar for decades. The military has effective veto power over all legislation and controls key ministries including those overseeing security and defense. The military is in charge of operations in northern Rakhine, and ending them is not up to Suu Kyi. Even when Suu Kyi has spoken on the issue, she has drawn criticism. In a September speech, her first public comments after the current crisis began, she asked for patience from the international community and suggested the refugees were partly responsible, saying more than half of the Rohingya villages had not been destroyed by the violence. Suu Kyi faces a potential domestic backlash if she speaks on behalf of the Rohingya, who have been the target of anti-Muslim rhetoric. Many people agree with the official government stance that there is no such ethnicity as Rohingya and that those in the country have illegally migrated from Bangladesh. Though Rohingya first arrived generations ago, they were stripped of their citizenship in 1982, denying them almost all rights and rendering them stateless. They cannot travel freely, practice their religion, or work as teachers or doctors, and they have little access to medical care, food or education. Myanmar's backers globally have also had to tread carefully, not wanting to undermine Suu Kyi's weak civilian government at a time when the country is just emerging from decades of authoritarian rule. Still, counties such as the U.S. have warned Myanmar about potential repercussions if it doesn't address the crisis, including the risk of attracting international terrorists, scaring off investment, and ultimately stunting its transition to democracy. The government said Tuesday that it is ready to repatriate Rohingya who had fled, but blamed Bangladesh for slowing the process. \"We are ready to accept the refugees and to start a verification and scrutiny process, but we have not reached an agreement with the Bangladeshi authorities for repatriation,\" said Zaw Htay, the government spokesman. He said those who could prove they were residents of Myanmar would be allowed to return. Many Rohingya have no identity documents. Ali Hossain, a top government administrator in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar district, said Wednesday that Bangladesh is doing \"more than enough\" to help the refugees, and placed the blame for delays in the repatriation process on Myanmar. \"Myanmar is talking about repatriation but more and more people are still being forced to come to Bangladesh,\" he said. \"There is a situation in Myanmar. We know that, the whole world knows that.\" \"Bangladesh is not playing any tricks here. We are doing our best,\" he said.",

            "article_content": "Most of President Trump\u2019s critics voice their ire on TV, write in newspapers or online, or vent on Twitter or Facebook. Pete Souza, however, posts his commentaries on Mr. Trump in pictures. It\u2019s probably no exaggeration to say that for anything Mr. Trump does, Souza has a photo that shows how Obama did it differently. The former chief White House photographer snapped pictures of former President Obama every day -- as many as 2,000 photos on some days.\u00a0 Souza chronicled all eight years of the Obama administration, and lately, he has been turning to his archives to compare the actions of the new and old commanders-in-chief. \u00a0 On Monday, as the White House communications staff was fielding questions about photos that purported to show Mr. Trump at dinner at Mar-a-Lago looking at documents and talking on the phone\u00a0as the news of a North Korean missile test was breaking. The White House said that the the matter was dealt with privately before he dined with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Still, the president drew criticism for what some Democrats and former national security officials perceived to be a security risk. They wondered why Mr. Trump didn\u2019t move to a secure location. \u00a0Souza also seemed to wonder. He posted a photo on Instagram showing the kind of secure location Mr. Obama used on the road, with a caption that explained that \u201cnational security discussions and head of state phone calls were conducted in a private, secure location.\u201d This photo was taken in El Salvador in Mar. 2011\u00a0  When we were on the road, national security discussions and head of state phone calls were conducted in a private, secure location set up onsite. Everyone had to leave their Blackberry outside the area. In this photo, which was taken in March 2011 and subsequently released, the President holds a discussion in El Salvador following a conference call with his full national security team. A post shared by Pete Souza (@petesouza) on Feb 13, 2017 at 1:39pm PST In the wake of some rough foreign leader phone conversations between President Trump with, among others, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, this photo went up on Instagram of happier times.  Talking with then Prime Minister John Key of New Zealand, left, and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia last September at the ASEAN gala dinner.

This one is for Grover. President Obama sampling some tequila with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico in 2013. @heygrover A post shared by Pete Souza (@petesouza) on Jan 31, 2017 at 6:18pm PST Souza has also posted photos from the Obama administration related to refugees in the wake of the Trump travel ban. The ban would temporarily suspend entry into the U.S. by all refugees and indefinitely suspend entry by Syrian refugees. It would also temporarily ban individuals from seven countries. For now, however, the ban is not in effect, because of a nationwide preliminary injunction that will keep the ban from being implemented until the courts rule on its merits. Here\u2019s a 2015 photo of Obama with a refugee in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  Talking with a young refugee at a Dignity for Children Foundation classroom in 2015. A post shared by Pete Souza (@petesouza) on Jan 29, 2017 at 5:16am PST And this one shows Obama\u2019s visit from a boy named Alex who volunteered his family to adopt a Syrian boy whose home was bombed.  Remember Alex, the six-year-old boy who wrote President Obama a letter about the Syrian boy photographed in the ambulance. Alex visited the Oval Office with his family the day after the election. \"Dear President Obama,  Remember the boy who was picked up by the ambulance in Syria? Can you please go get him and bring him to [my home]? Park in the driveway or on the street and we will be waiting for you guys with flags, flowers, and balloons. We will give him a family and he will be our brother. Catherine, my little sister, will be collecting butterflies and fireflies for him. In my school, I have a friend from Syria, Omar, and I will introduce him to Omar. We can all play together. We can invite him to birthday parties and he will teach us another language. We can teach him English too, just like my friend Aoto from Japan. Please tell him that his brother will be Alex who is a very kind boy, just like him. Since he won't bring toys and doesn't have toys Catherine will share her big blue stripy white bunny. And I will share my bike and I will teach him how to ride it. I will teach him additions and subtractions in math. And he [can] smell Catherine's lip gloss penguin which is green. She doesn't let anyone touch it.  Thank you very much! I can't wait for you to come! Alex 6 years old \" A post shared by Pete Souza (@petesouza) on Jan 30, 2017 at 2:37pm PST Around the time that Mr. Trump named his Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, Souza posted former nominee Merrick Garland\u2019s meeting with Obama. \u201cJust saying,\u201d Souza wrote. Garland, who was nominated early last year by Obama, did not get a confirmation hearing from the GOP-controlled Senate.  Merrick Garland. Just saying. A post shared by Pete Souza (@petesouza) on Jan 31, 2017 at 5:28pm PST In an interview that ran in January on CBS \u201cSunday Morning,\u201d Obama told CBS News\u2019 Bill Plante that he found Souza\u2019s photos \u201cevocative, accurate, creative.\u201d And he said of Souza that he was \u201ca great friend and someone I trust.\u201d \u00a0 Souza, who was also the White House photographer during Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency, declined to be interviewed for this story. For now, it\u2019s apparent that he thinks his pictures provide commentary enough.",

            "article_content": "When Maysoon Khatib first moved to Murray, Kentucky, with her husband back in 2012, it was a big change. The 44-year-old grew up in Southern California and was used to seeing people of all different races and religions, but in a town of about 18,000 people she felt like she stood out as a Muslim woman.  Khatib teaches English literature at Murray State University, and since the election of President Trump she\u2019s noticed some of her students have been more politically outspoken. \u201cI had a student who wore a Trump t-shirt to every single class,\u201d she said. \u00a0\u201cAnd another girl came to me in class and said, \u2018You know, she\u2019s doing that deliberately.\u2019\u201d  Khatib replied that it was OK. \u201cShe was like, \u2018how can you be so calm and positive?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018because people like you are speaking up for me,\u2019\u201d she said.  Khatib is also the managing editor of MuslimGirl.com, a website dedicated to \u201craising the place of Muslim women in mainstream society.\u201d The site\u2019s founder, Amani Al-Khatahtbeh, and other activists are pushing to make March 27\u00a0Muslim Women\u2019s Day.\u00a0 CBS News spoke with several Muslim women about their lives in America today, and why they are feeling empowered about their identity and religion in recent months. \u00a0 \u201cI never felt more free to speak my mind without feeling that I\u2019m insulting people by accident,\u201d Khatib said, adding that before the election, she was worried about talking too much about being Muslim for fear of isolating herself. \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI feel like I can see more people supporting me, and recognizing individuality,\u201d Khatib said. \u201cWe\u2019re all on the same page for the first time. Sometimes I want to write a letter to Trump saying thanks for showing us we need to unified.\u201d During the Women\u2019s March, an event that saw nationwide protests\u00a0in January, her small town also held a rally and asked Khatib to speak about her experiences as a Muslim American woman. More than a thousand people from around the town came out to show their support for the rally.\u00a0 \u201cWhen the election happened, and the results came in, my heart sank. But I saw right afterwards people coming together\u2026 Maybe we needed this change to happen for the resistance,\u201d Khatib said.  In Rochester, New York, many of the Muslims you\u2019ll come across are refugees, Iman Abid said. \u00a0 The 25-year-old is an ACLU organizer who works directly with Rochester community members, especially the refugee community following the announcement of President Trump\u2019s travel ban. Working on the grassroots level, Abid has found herself wanting to redefine what it means to be a Muslim woman.  Nowadays, she feels eager to tell people that she\u2019s Muslim, and that her family is originally from the Middle East.  \u201cA lot of people have a lot of assumptions about Muslims,\u201d Abid said. \u201cWhen I tell people I\u2019m Muslim they are surprised that I don\u2019t wear a hijab. It\u2019s like an ongoing conversation. I want to show there\u2019s a lot of different looks to Muslim women.\u201d Since President Trump stepped into the Oval Office, Abid feels like there\u2019s been a sharper focus on her religion, but she sees this moment as an opportunity -- and she doesn\u2019t want this moment to slip away for Muslim women \u201cMuslim women didn\u2019t have to wait for President Trump to speak up, but there\u2019s more focus on us, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s time to show people what we do and who we are,\u201d she said.  Although Zarina Iman was too young to vote in the 2016 election, the 16-year-old has become increasingly politically active.  \u201cOne of the good things from this election is I feel there\u2019s a sense of unity,\u201d the New York City resident said.  About a month ago, Iman and a friend organized a vigil at her high school for the South Asian people who were targeted in recent attacks, like the death of a 32-year-old Indian engineer who was killed in an apparently racially-motivated shooting in a crowded Kansas bar.\u00a0 However, on the day of the vigil, Iman was worried that no one would show up. It was snowing heavily and it was a frigid day. To her surprise, about 30 people from all different faiths and races came out to show their support. \u201cI\u2019ve never experienced that sort of unity,\u201d Iman said. That support has amplified her voice as a Muslim woman, she explained.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s been tiring since President Trump took office, but it has also been empowering,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of people stepping up and becoming allies to the Muslim community.\u201d Iman believes that this is just the beginning for young Muslim women and she anticipates that more will start to become active, especially if policy changes like the travel ban continue. \u201cI think there\u2019s going to be more catering to Muslim women. We are showing that we exist as a group,\u201d she said. ",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0-- Scrappy as ever, Donald Trump dismisses polls showing low approval ratings as \u201cfake news.\u201d But whatever his opinion, active opposition to his go-it-alone presidency appears to be widening. From corporate boardrooms to the halls of Congress, Trump is facing an unprecedented effort to disrupt even the most basic of his presidential functions. It\u2019s an evolving, largely grass-roots effort that aims to follow Trump and his potential supporters everywhere they go - and there are early signs that it\u2019s having an impact. The Trump name alone is enough to spark outrage. There are plans for a mass \u201cmooning\u201d of Trump Tower in Chicago. Boycotts are underway of companies that sell Ivanka Trump\u2019s clothing line or advertise on NBC\u2019s \u201cCelebrity Apprentice,\u201d where Trump has remained an executive producer. Congressional offices are being flooded with emails, social media messages and calls jamming phone lines. Hundreds of protesters are flocking to town halls and local congressional offices, some in strongly Republican districts, to voice their opposition to Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks, health care plans and refugee restrictions. The goal, say organizers of some of the efforts, is nothing short of complete resistance. It\u2019s a strategy Democrats say they learned from the success of the tea party movement, which stymied President Barack Obama\u2019s agenda through protests, door-to-door political action campaigns and online activism. \u201cThe lesson from the last eight years is, sadly, that implacable resistance works,\u201d said Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va. \u201cBecause it\u2019s all about your base, and I will simply point out that our base is bigger than theirs, and it\u2019s riled up.\u201d Trump and some Republicans shrug it off as sore losers unwilling to accept the results of the election. The president\u2019s core supporters, in states like Iowa and Wisconsin, applaud him as a man of action, delivering on his campaign promises to move quickly and shake up Washington. Although recent polls show his approval ratings in the 40s, a historic low for a new president, Trump rejects the surveys as false. \u201cAny negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting,\u201d he tweeted on Monday. \u201cI call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it.\u201d Later Monday, Trump renewed his Twitter attacks on The New York Times, slamming the paper \u201cfor the poor reporting it did on my election win. Now they are worse!\u201d Trump\u2019s base is likely to reward him for his actions, say former White House aides, who note that all presidents face opposition and public demonstrations. It\u2019s only a problem if it lets them stop him from \u201cdoing what he seeks to do,\u201d said former George W. Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer, who recalled a travel stop in Portland, Oregon, when protesters threw rocks at the president\u2019s motorcade. \u201cWhen it comes to policy full speed ahead, the people screaming at you can\u2019t be convinced to be for you in any case.\u201d But recent presidents never faced the kind of multi-front opposition that Trump is now experiencing so early in their terms. Last week, he canceled a trip to the Harley-Davidson factory in Milwaukee, where local groups planned to protest his event. The White House said the protests weren\u2019t the cause. And on Saturday, more than 1,000 protesters beat drums, sang and chanted outside the gates of Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where the president was attending a Red Cross benefit. The displays of public outrage have been aimed not only at Trump but at lawmakers, world leaders and corporate executives who might be tempted to work with him to pass key parts of his agenda, like replacing the health care law or rewriting trade agreements. The White House claims to be unimpressed by the protests. In fact, a lot of the demonstrators are simply paid to show up and shout, says Trump Press Secretary Sean Spicer. But that\u2019s just a fantasy, foes say. \u201cThe level of mobilization against Trump is almost like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen before,\u201d said Joe Dinkin, spokesman for the Working Families Party, which coordinates weekly anti-Trump events across the country. \u201cCollaboration with Trump is a path that will bring well-deserved ire.\u201d Already, there are some signs that the early efforts may be having an impact on his ability to promote his agenda across the globe. On Monday, the speaker of Britain\u2019s House of Commons said he strongly opposes Trump addressing Parliament, making it unlikely he\u2019ll be given the honor during a state visit later this year. Technology executive Elon Musk spent hours on Twitter over the weekend defending his decision to serve on Trump\u2019s business council. So far, one CEO- Uber\u2019s Travis Kalanick - has quit the group after facing a weeklong rider boycott. The ACLU saw donations pour in after it sued the government over the refugee ban. And Republican lawmakers are bracing themselves for an onslaught of rowdy town hall meetings, after congressmen in California and Florida faced raucous crowds last weekend. \u201cThe situation was rapidly escalating into a riot,\u201d said California Rep. Tom McClintock, who had to be extracted by police from an event in downtown Roseville, the population center of his sprawling congressional district. \u201cOne thing came through loud and clear: They were not angry at President Trump for breaking any of his promises - they were angry at him for keeping them.\u201d",

A website called Your Newswire, which was responsible for spreading the \u201cPizzagate\u201d conspiracy about Hillary Clinton and a pizzeria in Washington, D.C., claimed Merkel took a selfie with one of the terrorists in the Brussels attack, the report said, when it was actually a refugee.  Another website, Anonymousnews.ru, published recent fake stories about German NATO officers arrested in Aleppo for collaborating with members of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), reported BuzzFeed, which also said the website contained pro-Kremlin propaganda and has also made claims about the CIA being behind 9/11.  The report said some of the other websites posting fake news include Junge Freiheit, which is a weekly newspaper that has been endorsed by the country\u2019s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. BuzzFeed\u2019s analysis found that some of these fake stories were the top-performing about Merkel on social networks last year and that they often would mix conspiracies about refugees and Islam with legitimate information. The report noted that some English-language outlets are also promoting anti-Merkel stories including Breitbart, which was previously headed by Trump\u2019s incoming White House chief strategist.  Merkel, who has served as chancellor of Germany since 2005, is running for for her leadership position again, with the election expected this fall.

            "article_content": "YANGON, Myanmar -- When Aung San Suu Kyi led the fight for democracy against Myanmar's despotic military rulers two decades ago, she bristled at the collective reluctance of Southeast Asian governments to intervene in her nation's plight. In a newspaper editorial published in 1999, the former opposition leader slammed the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, saying its \"policy of non-interference is just an excuse for not helping.\" \"In this day and age,\" she wrote in an editorial in Thailand's The Nation newspaper on July 13 of that year, \"you cannot avoid interference in the matters of other countries.\" Today, Suu Kyi leads Myanmar. And at the ASEAN summit in Manila on Monday, she was likely counting on the bloc to keep silent while her government engages in a crackdown on Rohingya Muslims using tactics the U.N. has described as ethnic cleansing to force them to leave the Buddhist-majority country. It's unclear whether the crisis was on ASEAN's official agenda, although two countries -- likely Malaysia and Indonesia -- did bring it up in talks on the meeting's sidelines. Bangladesh, where more than 600,000 Rohingya have arrived since late August, is not part of ASEAN. Harry Roque, spokesman for the summit's host, Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte, said \"the Rohingya people's plight was discussed in the plenary. It was specifically brought up by two member states, and Myanmar specifically addressed the Rohingya issue.\" According to Roque, the delegation from Myanmar said Suu Kyi's government was \"in the process of attending to\" a report compiled by former U.N. chief Kofi Annan, laying out a series of steps to end the violence and repatriate the Rohingya. Roque said the officials from Myanmar had assured their neighbors that \"the process of repatriation for IDPs (displaced people) will conclude within three weeks after signing of a memorandum agreement, we're understanding, with Bangladesh.\" But there was never much hope that anything would actually be done about the crisis at the gathering in Manila. \"ASEAN summits are not designed to actually construct policy responses to major human rights issues that affect the whole region,\" said David Mathieson, a former human rights researcher who is now an independent analyst based in Myanmar. \"Right now, Suu Kyi's government is benefiting from ASEAN's culture of inac-tion.\" The refugee crisis began Aug. 25 after Rohingya insurgents attacked several Myanmar police posts in northern Rakhine state. Security forces responded with brutal \"clearance operations\" that human rights groups say killed hundreds of people and left hundreds of Rohingya villages burned to the ground. Survivors have described arson, rape and shootings by Myanmar soldiers and Buddhist mobs for the purpose of forcing Rohinya to leave. Myanmar has long denied them citizenship and most people insist the Rohingya are illegal immigrants though they've lived in Myanmar for generations. Suu Kyi was awarded the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize for her \"non-violent struggle for democracy and human rights,\" in the words of the Nobel committee, but has been reluctant to defend the Rohingya. In a September speech, Suu Kyi asked for patience from the international community and suggested the refugees were partly responsible for the crisis. She also tried to play down the gravity of the exodus, saying more than half of the Rohingya villages in Myanmar had not been destroyed. Though Suu Kyi has been the de facto head of Myanmar's civilian government since her party swept elections in 2015, she is limited in her control of the country by a constitution written by the military junta that ruled Myanmar for decades. The military is in charge of the operations in northern Rakhine, and ending them is not up to Suu Kyi. Still, her government has staunchly defended the army's actions. When the U.N. Security Council last week called for Myanmar to \"end the excessive military force and intercommunal violence that had devastated the Rohingya community,\" Suu Kyi's office responded that it regretted the council's statement. In an apparent reference to China, which has backed Myanmar, the government praised Security Council members who \"upheld the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign countries.\" Non-interference has long been a bedrock of ASEAN, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this year. Myanmar presidential spokesman Zaw Htay said he did not know what would be discussed at the summit this week, so \"we can't say how we are going to respond to it.\" Chandra Widya Yudha, director of the ASEAN Political and Security Cooperation at Indonesia's Foreign Ministry, told The Associated Press that his government would address the Rohingya crisis at the meeting. \"We cannot keep silent because we have to help them,\" Yudha said. Malaysia in particular has been critical of Myanmar's disproportionate use of force. Earlier this month, the predominantly Muslim country dissociated itself from an ASEAN statement expressing concern over the crisis because it said the statement misrepresented the reality of the situation, omitted reference to Rohingya Muslims as one of the affected communities and was not based on consensus. Khin Zaw Win, a Yangon-based political analyst, said that both Myanmar's previous military junta and Suu Kyi's government have benefited from ASEAN's reticence, but that the bloc should \"take a firmer position\" on the Rohingya issue. \"It has to be taken up if ASEAN is to remain credible,\" he said. Writing in The Nation in 1999, Suu Kyi said that when ASEAN invokes the principle of non-interference, it does so \"not with a clear conscience.\" \"They are afraid that there may be some aspects of their countries that might invite criticism,\" she said. \"Our position is that if they have problems that invite legitimate criticism, let there be criticism. If not, they have nothing to fear.\"",

            "article_content": "VATICAN CITY -- President Donald Trump has met Pope Francis, the famously humble pontiff with whom he has publicly clashed, concluding his tour of the ancestral homes of the world's three largest monotheistic religions. Mr. Trump, midway through his grueling nine-day maiden international journey, called upon the pontiff at the Vatican early Wednesday where the two had a private 30-minute meeting laden with religious symbolism and ancient protocol.\u00a0 The president, accompanied by his wife and several aides, arrived at the Vatican just after 8 a.m. local time. The president greeted Francis in Sala del Tronetto, the room of the little throne, on the second floor of Apostolic Palace Wednesday morning. The men shook hands and Mr. Trump could be heard thanking the pope and saying it was \"a great honor\" to be there. They posed for photographs and then sat down at the papal desk, the pope unsmiling, as their private meeting began. It ended a half hour later when Francis rang the bell in his private study. The pontiff was then introduced to members of Mr. Trump's delegation, including his wife Melania, his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as aides Hope Hicks and Dan Scavino.\u00a0 As is tradition, the pope and president then exchanged gifts. Mr. Trump later told Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni that his meeting with the Pope was \"fantastic\" adding, \"He is something. He is really great.\" The meeting could provide powerful imagery to Catholic voters back in the United States as well as the possibility for conflict between a president and a pope who have not often seen eye-to-eye. The two men's often opposite worldviews collided head-on early last year, when Francis was sharply critical of Mr. Trump's campaign pledge to build an impenetrable wall on the Mexican border and his declaration that the United States should turn away Muslim immigrants and refugees. \"A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,\" Francis said then. The pontiff has been a vocal advocate for aiding refugees, particularly those fleeing the violence in Syria, deeming it both a \"moral imperative\" and \"Christian duty\" to help. President Trump has never been one to let an insult, perceived or real, go by without a response, and he made no exception for the world's best-known religious leader. He called Francis \"disgraceful\" for doubting his faith. And even the pontiff's congratulatory message sent to mark Mr. Trump's inauguration contained a sly reference to their disagreement, as the pope wrote that he hoped the United States' international stature would \"continue to be measured above all by its concern for the poor, the outcast and those in need.\" Mr. Trump arrived in Rome Tuesday evening, his motorcade closing a busy Italian highway just after rush hour and prompting hundreds of onlookers to briefly step out of their gridlocked cars to gawk at the fleet of armored vehicles. He spent the night at the U.S. ambassador to Italy's residence. Though both Mr. Trump and Francis are known for their unpredictability, papal visits with heads of state are carefully arranged bits of political and religious theater that follow a specific program, with little room for deviation or unwanted surprises. The president was expected to be given a tour of the Vatican after he arrived and then meet with the pontiff in his library. The two men were to be left alone with a translator to hold a private discussion before emerging again to exchange gifts and farewells. Mr. Trump was the 13th president to visit the Vatican and, as part of his tour, he viewed the Sistine Chapel. In recent days, Francis and Mr. Trump have been in agreement on a need for Muslim leaders to do more against extremists in their own communities. But there are few other areas where their views align. Following his meeting with the Pope on Wednesday however, Mr. Trump tweeted after having the \"honor of a lifetime\" he left the Vatican more determined than ever to pursue peace.\" Honor of a lifetime to meet His Holiness Pope Francis. I leave the Vatican more determined than ever to pursue PEACE in our world. pic.twitter.com/JzJDy7pllI The president's prior anti-Muslim rhetoric -- including his musing that Islam \"hates\" the West -- is the antithesis of what the pope has been preaching about a need for dialogue with Muslims.\u00a0 Francis also differs sharply with Mr. Trump on the need to combat climate change and economic inequality, a point he quietly made during their visit. The pope gave the president a copy of his famous 2015 letter on the environment and sustainable development. The letter marked the first time a pope has made such a public call for environmental care and climate change awareness.\u00a0 Mr. Trump's visit to the Eternal City came after two stops in the Middle East where he visited the cradles of Islam and Judaism. In Saudi Arabia, he addressed dozens of Arab leaders and urged them to fight extremists at home and isolate Iran, which he depicted as a menace to the region.\u00a0 In Israel, Mr. Trump reaffirmed his commitment to strong ties with the nation's longtime ally and urged both the Israelis and the Palestinians to begin the process of reaching a peace deal. No details or timetable have yet to be established for negotiations. But while President Trump received extravagantly warm welcomes in Riyadh and Jerusalem, the reception could grow much cooler now that he's reached Europe, where there were widespread protests after his election.\u00a0 Climate change activists projected the words \"Planet Earth First\" on the massive dome of St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican on Tuesday night, and protests are expected Wednesday in Rome and later in the week during Mr. Trump's visit to Brussels for a NATO meeting and to Sicily for a G7 gathering.",

            "article_content": "Organizers caution that you should not take the name \u201cA Day Without a Woman\u201d literally. In fact, during a weekend brainstorm in January, what leaders behind the Women\u2019s March first envisioned was quite the opposite: downtown streets from Portland to Phoenix flooded with red t-shirt clad women and their allies. \u201cThere is going to be a sea of red, all over the country and all over the world,\u201d says Tabitha St. Bernard, an organizer behind the strike, who reports 50 states and 40 countries will participate in Wednesday\u2019s boycott of work and shopping, with exceptions made for emergency workers and female-owned small businesses.\u00a0 St. Bernard credits the visual impact of thousands of pink woolen caps for amplifying the cause in marches following the inauguration of President Donald Trump. \u201cWomen were really able to\u00a0see\u00a0each other,\u201d the self-described \u201cfashion activist\u201d emphasizes. Now they want women wearing red on Wednesday, a color reminiscent of the labor movement.  \u201cIt is a sign of revolutionary love,\u201d says co-Founder and Global Coordinator of the Women\u2019s March, Breanne Butler. \u201cRed, red, red,\u201d says Nell Walton, the Women\u2019s March organizer from Knoxville, Tennessee. \u201cThis is about as red as you can get.\u201d  The color of love took on a different hue last November, when Walton witnessed 92 of her town\u2019s 95 voting districts go red for Trump. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a red, red state like this you have to be careful about bold statements. You really, really do.\u201d \u201cWe have seriously been called extremist kooks and radicals,\u201d Walton stresses, referencing a letter signed last month by neighboring second district\u2019s Representative John Duncan.  Wednesday will see a \u201clow-key\u201d women\u2019s strike for downtown Knoxville, Walton reports, commemorated with music and poetry readings. A local falafel house will raise funds for refugee families. In addition to donning revolutionary red, inclined women may follow national guidelines: take off \u201cfrom paid and unpaid labor\u201d and \u201cavoid shopping for one day\u201d to demonstrate visible economic impact. Marchers in New York plan to saturate the streets, gathering on 5th Ave & 59th St., just two blocks north of Trump Tower. In Spartanburg, South Carolina, a local progressive group will partner with a homeless project to collect tampons and feminine pads for women lacking access to menstrual hygiene care. Meanwhile, women in West Palm Beach, Florida plan a litter clean-up just ten miles south of President Trump\u2019s \u201cWinter White House\u201d in Mar-A-Lago.\u00a0 \u201cEven on a day\u00a0without\u00a0women,\u201d Emma Collum says, \u201cWomen can\u2019t help but give back to the community.\u201d Collum, who also serves as Florida State Director for the Women\u2019s March, commends city-supported business shutdowns in places like St. Petersburg. \u201cThe whole town is taking the day off,\u201d she says, outlining a full itinerary of events that culminates in a joint candlelight vigil and tree planting with farm workers.\u00a0 Citing security and not politics, schools have given students a day off in Chapel Hill, North Carolina and Alexandria, Virginia. The director of communications for Alexandria schools, Helen Lloyd, likens the inconvenience to that of a snow day, but notes, \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a request that 300 take staff leave at the same time.\u201d In an effort to avoid rounding up 15,200 students in 16 schools gyms all day, the superintendent decided Monday to shut down Wednesday. Overseas participants from Buenos Aires to Berlin will join in the strike, which also falls on International Women\u2019s Day. In London, organizers say January\u2019s March on London is \u201cinspired a new wave of activism in the U.K.\u201d with scores of people writing to parliament to lobby on behalf of refugees and migrants.  Though the Women\u2019s March makes no official estimate on numbers, a national spokesperson reports over 20,000 have signed up to participate online with 6,000 downloading the \u201cemployer letter\u201d, a template informing supervisors of their planned strike. \u00a0 Critics of \u201cA Day Without Women\u201d have labeled the \u201csanctioned skip-day\u201d a \u201cprivileged strike.\u201d But organizer Tabitha St. Bernard insists such critiques run counter to the history of labor movements. Breanne Butler, the co-founder of the Women\u2019s March, adds that protesters can choose to wear read in solidarity or participate in the #GrabYourWallet campaign if opting out of work is simply not an option.\u00a0 \u201cThere is nothing privileged about a strike,\u201d Butler says.  Texas Steering Committee Chair Melissa Fiero says her state has made a \u201cconscious decision to take another approach.\u201d The leader of \u201cMarch On! Texas,\u201d a statewide movement grown out of the Women\u2019s March On Austin, instead calls for a \u201cDay WITH Women.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cTo ask those who are the most impacted by a day with lost wages\u2014or worse lost employment\u2014to strike we feel is counter to that mission,\u201d Fiero explains. Her team says they have created an interactive online database mapping women-owned businesses across the state and plans to host a women-run marketplace in downtown Austin.\u00a0 Despite the mixed methods, the Women\u2019s March provides a clear message: \u201cAct Now.\u201d  \u201cOur reproductive rights are in jeopardy,\u201d Butler pleads. \u201cSo many women rely on Planned Parenthood.\u201d The women\u2019s health organization is not eligible for Medicaid reimbursements or federal family planning grants under the GOP\u2019s newly proposed alternative to the Affordable Care Act.\u00a0 Emma Collum, the Women\u2019s March Florida director, says she recalls her post-election fear vividly, but credits November 8 with \u201cthe awakening of collective sisterhood.\u201d  \u201cThis International Women\u2019s Day is a coming out party,\u201d she declares. \u201cThis is our first birthday. This is \u2018hello, womanhood!\u2019\u201d\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Antonio Guterres was elected the ninth United Nations secretary general by consensus of 193 nations, and with unusual agreement by the United States and Russia. He began work January 1, vowing a \u201csurge for peace\u201d and much-needed reform of the bloated bureaucracy at the U.N, a body that\u2019s seen as doing much good, but that\u2019s failed in recent years to resolve the world\u2019s most intractable conflicts. On Tuesday, in his first formal appearance as the U.N.\u2019s CEO, he told a packed Security Council chamber, \u201cWe must rebalance our approach to peace and security. For decades, this has been dominated by responding to conflict.\u201d  The former refugee chief and Portuguese prime minister said the reforms he\u2019s setting in motion will be able to \u201cprevent war and sustain peace.\u201d And, he said, nations must \u201cstrengthen the credibility and authority of the United Nations.\u201d At the same time, because of a December Security Council resolution condemning Israeli West Bank settlements, made possible by the abstention of the outgoing Obama administration, a bipartisan group in Congress is considering cutting the U.S. financial contribution to the U.N. Both the House of Representatives and Senate voted to condemn the Council vote.  Complaints about the U.N., including those by President-elect Trump, are not new, but divisions between Moscow and Washington haven\u2019t been as pronounced since the 1970s. That\u2019s created stalemates over some of the largest recent conflicts, including those in Syria and Yemen, and undermined the world body\u2019s credibility.  During his address, Guterres appeared to acknowledge some of the frustration with the U.N. \u201cIf there is something that is shocking in today\u2019s world, it is to see such a multiplication of conflicts with dramatic human suffering and the little capacity of the international community to prevent conflicts and to, timely, solve them,\u201d he said. Guterres also appeared to blame many \u2013 including members of the press -- for not seeing where the U.N. does succeed, such as with poverty eradication, education, or imposing stinging sanctions on North Korea. \u201cTV cameras are not there where a crisis is avoided,\u201d the new Secretary General told reporters on his way into his address. In a wide ranging one-on-one exit interview with CBS News, now former Secretary General Ban Ki-moon talked about the important role of the U.N. and the International Atomic Energy Agency in counterterrorism: \u201cAt a time when we are seeing daily terrorist attacks and the spread of violent extremism, it is important for the international community to make sure that any nuclear material or any weapons should be fully safeguarded so that there will be no smuggling out or smuggling into any country; once nuclear materials are in the hands of a terrorist, it will be extremely difficult and dangerous for international peace and security.\u201d  Outgoing U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power, in one of her last addresses to the body, offered similar observations, saying the Security Council matters because 100,000 troops are deployed worldwide under its auspices, and because it authorizes the use of force and delivers life-saving humanitarian aid. Power said, \u201cWe help set the rules for how states should behave.\u201d The U.N.\u2019s role today is significant: It has a staff of 44,000, not including 104,000 peacekeeping troops, and is responsible, in theory, for issues from world peace and refugees to pandemics and climate change.  The U.S. role is significant, in part because its contribution is the largest of any nation. The U.S. provides 22 percent of the regular budget ($5.4 billion) and 28.5 percent of the peacekeeping budget ($8.27 billion). Despite a bruising election season marked by sharp divisions over trade and foreign policy, a January poll conducted by a bipartisan research group found that 88 percent of Americans believe it\u2019s important for the U.S. to maintain an active role at the U.N.  The President-elect\u2019s ambassador-designate to the U.N. is South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. Her confirmation hearings are tentatively set for January 18.  More to the point, the U.S. gets to take the helm of the Security Council in April, because of a monthly rotation of the council\u2019s presidency, and that may provide an opportunity for the Trump administration to set the U.N. agenda.

            "article_content": "ERIE, Pa. -- For hundreds of thousands of Americans, last year's election was a jobs election. Manufacturing in America reached its peak in the 1950s and has been in steady decline ever since. Big promises were made on the campaign trail that the decline could be reversed -- and fast. Some parts of the country have already started to refocus by optimizing their economies for higher-tech industries, but other areas -- such as Erie, Pennsylvania -- have not fared as well. In \"America | Redefining Hope\" -- a new documentary airing on CBSN Monday June 19 -- CBSN Originals returns to Erie to investigate if the hoped-for turnaround in fortunes, pegged to a changing of the guard in Washington, has materialized.  The town lost more than 30,000 manufacturing jobs as the once-powerful industrial sector shrank -- and the remaining jobs are not as lucrative as they once were, and often snapped up due to a demographic shift. Erie is now home to one of the nation's largest refugee populations, many of whom are more than willing to take whatever jobs remain in the manufacturing sector -- some of which only pay $12 an hour.  General Electric (GE) Transportation has been a part of Erie's firmament for decades. At one point, more than 16,000 area residents were employed by the industrial giant. Now, it's closer to 3,000, and many of those jobs simply aren't an option for people laid off from the production line. Whereas once, GE jobs in Erie only required a high-school diploma, now, industrial giants are more often looking for computer programmers and engineers to fill more advanced roles.  In recent years, town officials in Erie have made a big push towards adding jobs within the tourism sector by promoting its vineyards and waterfront attractions. But locals say this will only last for a portion of the year, perhaps three months at most. And while tourism remains Erie's fastest growing sector, it accounts for less than 10 percent of the workforce.  During the 2016 election, President Donald Trump managed to turn the Rust Belt area red for the first time since Ronald Reagan was in office. Many life-long Democrats believed fresh political thinking would help their struggling manufacturing town turn a corner. In the weeks following Mr. Trump's first 100 days in office, the nation remained as divided as it had been during the election.  CBS News correspondent Jamie Yuccas traveled to Erie to speak with locals about the fight for blue-collar jobs. Here are some of their stories.  Justin Gallagher is a college senior whose family has lived in Erie for five generations -- a long line of Democrats. But in the last election, three generations of his family voted Republican.  \"I think Donald Trump has the vision of following through on a lot of the campaign promises that he made,\" Gallagher said. \"And I think he's trying to do it. He's made it very clear what he wants to do and what he wants to accomplish in the four-year term. He's learned in the first 100 days that sometimes Congress is not going to cooperate.\"  Gallagher ultimately wants to develop his career in his beloved home town but he's been applying for jobs outside of Erie as a back-up plan. He's a determined young man who's shown drive beyond his years in three short years of college -- he became the youngest person ever elected to Erie's school board, winning his seat aged 19.  While the job rejection letters continue to pile up, Gallagher says he still feels confident about his future in Erie, and is considering going back to school for an MBA. \"At some point, somebody has to be the voice,\" he said. \"Somebody has to be a leader and somebody has to take action. Maybe it's possible that I could be the voice for more people.\" Todd Burnett was laid off after working nearly nine years with GE. Now, he works for nearly half of his old salary at an automation company, making parts for machinery. \"I made more money, and I got more for my money, 10 years ago,\" Burnett said. \"We're actually working more for way less right now than we did 10 years ago.\"  According to Burnett, the number of people seeking manufacturing jobs in Erie has increased, but there are limited opportunities in the area. \"You have the same groups of people kind of moving around in groups trying to get these same jobs,\" he explained. \"I'm fortunate I have a good skill set. I can land good jobs, but there's not many of those out there.\" He identified the low wages and those willing to accept them -- in Erie in particular -- as part of the problem. \"When you have people who are willing to accept those wages, you kind of set the standard for what's acceptable,\" Burnett said. \"If you have a lot of these people filling those positions, that's now the new norm. So how do you expect to bring that wage back up again?\"  Overall, he says he feels hopeful about the future of manufacturing in town. After 54 years, Jim Stewart is leaving Erie. He lost his job at GE about a year ago, and entered a training program to become an HVAC repairman. He's preparing to move to New Mexico in search of something he's convinced he can't find in Erie. \"I don't have a job,\" Steward said. \"That's why I have to move so I can find a job. If I don't see the house, eventually, the bank will do a short sale on it, which means they take it over and sell it for whatever they can.\" Stewart put his house up for sale on the market more than four months ago. So far, no prospective buyers have made an offer.\u00a0 The expense of two mortgages is not an option for Stewart as he begins his fresh start in another state.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump's nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court couldn't escape discussion of the president's travel ban \u2014 and even the president \u2014 during an appearance Monday at a judicial conference, where a student essay winner compared the ban to Japanese internment and the producer of the musical \"Hamilton\" said the cast was scared following Trump's election victory. Gorsuch was a late fill-in at the 9th Circuit conference for fellow Supreme Court justice Anthony Kennedy and took over what was supposed to be Kennedy's role of welcoming new U.S. citizens. Gorsuch was among three justices who said in June that Trump's ban on travelers from six mostly Muslim countries should be completely reinstated pending further arguments. He encouraged the new citizens to tolerate different points of view. \"Democracy depends on our willingness to hear and respect even those we disagree with strongly,\" Gorsuch said. \"In a government by and for the people, we have to remember those with whom we disagree, even vehemently, still have the best interests of the country at heart.\" With Gorsuch seated next to her, an Alaska high school student earlier in the day read her winning essay on the topic of Japanese internment \u2014 a topic selected by the 9th Circuit. Olivia Tafs, 15, compared the treatment of Muslims after the Sept. 11 attacks to that of Japanese Americans during World War II. She cited Trump's travel ban as an example of what she said was ethnic profiling. Gorsuch shook her hand following the speech. Tafs later said it was \"awkward\" and a \"little weird\" to air her views about the travel ban before Gorsuch. \"That's just how I saw it,\" she said. Gorsuch's visit came as the Trump administration asked the high court to again weigh in on its ban on travelers from Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Iran and Yemen following a Hawaii judge's ruling that reduced the ban's scope. With Gorsuch in the audience, \"Hamilton\" producer Jeffrey Seller was asked at another panel discussion why the cast felt the need to encourage Vice President-elect Mike Pence to work on behalf of all Americans when he attended the show following the election. Seller said as a candidate, Trump was hostile to Mexicans and other people represented on the cast, and cast members decided they had to address Pence because of his connection to the president. Gorsuch appeared unfazed by the discussion of the president who nominated him, lingering in a hotel banquet hall well after the conference ended for the day to talk to some of the new U.S. citizens, as other judges and conference attendees attended a wine and beer reception outside. Minh Nhat Duong, 30, said he didn't think Gorsuch's views on the travel ban necessarily reflected his attitude about immigrants. Duong, who is from Vietnam, was among 20 immigrants sworn in at a naturalization ceremony at the conference. None of the immigrants was from any of the countries on the travel ban. Gorsuch came to the conference after Kennedy canceled his trip when his wife fractured her hip in Austria. The 9th Circuit \u2014 the nation's largest federal court circuit \u2014 includes the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and district and bankruptcy courts in California and eight other western states. Judges in the circuit have blocked both of Trump's travel bans and halted his attempt to strip funding from so-called sanctuary cities, and the four-day conference is not shying away from topics that have stoked the president's ire, including fake news and meddling in the U.S. election. Gorsuch joined Justice Samuel Alito in a dissent written by Justice Clarence Thomas in June that said the ban, which also blocks refugees, should be completely reinstated pending arguments before the high court scheduled for October. The dissent argued the administration had made a \"strong showing\" that it was likely to succeed in overturning court orders blocking the ban. The administration has argued the ban is needed for national security. Lower court judges have cited Trump's comments on the campaign trail as evidence that it was motivated by anti-Muslim bias.",

            "article_content": "The top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee says she is impressed with President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for the Supreme Court. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein met with Judge Neil Gorsuch on Monday. She said Tuesday that \u201che\u2019s a very caring person and he\u2019s obviously legally very smart.\u201d She added: \u201cI think we are dealing with someone who is impressive, so we\u2019ll see.\u201d She stopped short of saying she would vote for him, noting it\u2019s a lifetime appointment and Gorsuch is only 49. Last week, Feinstein had said she wanted to take time to consider his record. \u201cWe need time to do our work so that we can make a decision and make remarks that will stand the test of time, and not be cheap shots, or bad or rushed,\u201d Feinstein said last week.\u00a0 Because of expected Democratic procedural maneuvers, Republicans will need the support of 60 out of the Senate\u2019s 100 members to move to a confirmation vote on Gorsuch. Republicans have a 52-48 majority, so at least eight Democrats will have to vote with Republicans.\u00a0 In an effort to win those votes, the Senate GOP\u2019s campaign arm, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, is running three ads to pressure certain Democrats to vote for him. Separate ads target Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin and Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly in their home states, asking voters to tell their senators to put state and country ahead of their party. Both are running for re-election next year in states won by Trump. An ad airing in Washington says Democrats are playing politics with the nomination. \u201cTell Democrats the election is over, the people decided,\u201d the ad says. The conservative group Judicial Crisis Network has pledged to spend $10 million to help confirm Gorsuch, and has already released $2 million in ads in Tester\u2019s home state of Montana, Donnelly\u2019s home state of Indiana, and also Missouri and North Dakota, additional states where Trump won and Senate Democrats are running for re-election. They are also running ads in Colorado, Gorsuch\u2019s home state. One of the group\u2019s ads features Jane Nitze, a former Obama administration lawyer who also clerked for Gorsuch. \u201cHe will have a great deal of respect for folks on all sides of the ideological spectrum,\u201d Nitze says in the ad. As Republicans try to pressure Democrats to vote for Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, they also face questions about Trump\u2019s tweets over the weekend criticizing a federal appeals court judge who suspended the president\u2019s travel ban on refugees and travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries. In tweets, Trump dismissed U.S. District Court Judge James Robart as a \u201cso-called judge\u201d and his decision \u201cridiculous.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t have so-called judges,\u201d Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t have so-called senators. We don\u2019t have so-called presidents. We have people from three different branches of government who take an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution,\u201d Sasse said. Gorsuch is meeting with Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer Tuesday.",

As he said at his first post-election press conference last week, Mr. Trump reiterated that he hopes to have a better relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin than his predecessor has -- but was also critical of Russia\u2019s intervention in Syria, calling it a \u201cvery bad thing\u201d that\u2019s caused a \u201cterrible humanitarian situation.\u201d He also told The Times that he plans to appoint his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who will be a senior adviser in the White House, to broker a Middle East peace deal. Mr. Trump, who has cozied up to anti-European Union leaders like Brexit advocate Nigel Farage, predicted other European countries will follow the U.K.\u2019s lead and vote to leave the EU. \u201cI think it\u2019s very tough,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople, countries want their own identity and the U.K. wanted its own identity.\u201d He said he planned to pursue a trade deal with the U.K. early on in his term, noting that he\u2019s already planning to meet with British Prime Minister Theresa May this spring. Mr. Trump was in favor of the U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union, and has frequently compared his election in November to June\u2019s surprise \u201cBrexit\u201d vote. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna work very hard to get it done quickly and done properly. Good for both sides,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI will be meeting with [British Prime Minister Theresa May],\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s requesting a meeting and we\u2019ll have a meeting right after I get into the White House and it\u2019ll be, I think we\u2019re gonna get something done very quickly.\u201d On the topic of Europe, Mr. Trump was highly critical of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, saying her decision to let more than 1 million refugees into Germany was a \u201ccatastrophic mistake.\u201d Merkel is up for reelection this fall, and is facing a challenge from the anti-immigrant Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD) party.  \u201cI think she made one very catastrophic mistake and that was taking all of these illegals, you know, taking all of the people from wherever they come from,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd nobody even knows where they come from.

            "article_content": "\"In all of our years of tracking, we've never seen this many [hate] groups,\" Heidi Beirich told CBS correspondent Tony Dokoupil. Beirich is the director of\u00a0Southern Poverty Law Center's (SPLC) Intelligence Project, which monitors hate group activity online. \"We've never seen their ideas penetrating the mainstream the way they are. I would say most Americans don't realize how much of this there is.\"\u00a0     It's been a little over a week since neo-Nazis marched in the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia, chanting \"Jews will not replace us.\" In the intervening days, debate has raged over just how America's national conversation has become a real-time discussion of white supremacy and its place in the U.S., muddied by President Trump's ambiguity on the matter. The groups in question -- who openly espouse racist views and have felt newly emboldened since the recent presidential campaign -- find themselves firmly back in the mainstream.\u00a0     The nation witnessed what's considered one of the\u00a0largest white supremacy marches\u00a0in decades as hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Charlottesville. During the rally, a car rammed into a crowd of anti-fascist protesters, injuring dozens and killing\u00a032-year-old Heather Heyer. All this against a backdrop of a national debate around the rights and wrongs of maintaining statues that celebrate the Confederacy.     The SPLC estimates that there are currently more than 900 hate groups -- organizations with beliefs that attack an entire group of people -- operating in the country. Many of these hate groups subscribe to the ideals of white supremacy.     In fact, Beirich says the number of hate groups has doubled over the past two decades -- a trend that appears to follow the impact of minorities, financial crisis and political elections have on society.     According to the SPLC, there's a new generation of so-called white nationalism being run by millennials.\u00a0Matt Heimbach, one of the main organizers of the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, is the face of this movement.     \"Well, we have energy, I think, because Donald Trump's election showed that the majority of white American's social, working class America believes in sovereignty,\" Heimbach told \"CBSN: On Assignment.\"     Since 2015, almost all healthcare organizations have reported at least one cyberattack. Dr. Jennifer Pugh runs their emergency room at Erie County Medical Center in Buffalo, New York, the largest U.S. hospital attacked in the U.S. 2017 so far.\u00a0     She was on staff the morning the hackers infiltrated their system, sending a ransomware note demanding bitcoin equivalent to $44,000. They froze staff out of their machines, rendering patient files inaccessible in a now-familiar M.O. for hackers. \"Honestly, I think it's disgusting \u2026 they're attacking some of the most vulnerable members in society by coming after a hospital,\" Pugh says.     The hospital's CEO, Thomas Quatroche, decided not to pay the ransom, but the hack will cost them a lot of money. \"This is a form of terrorism\u2026 we decided not to pay that ransom but make no mistake about it this ... it's going to cost us a lot of money in the long run,\" he says.     Thousands of these attacks, of all scales, take place every day. \"White-hat hackers\" are the good guys -- paid by companies to hack their systems and find flaws before they are exploited by cyber criminals, or \"black-hat hackers\".     White-hat hackers from India report more vulnerabilities to companies from here than hackers anywhere else in the world. One of the world's best white-hat hackers, Sandeep Singh, better known by his online moniker \"Geekboy,\" has hacked companies like Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, Uber and AirBnb -- with good intentions. And he is paid well for it -- companies offer 'bug bounties' to people who find vulnerabilities in their systems which they can then patch. \"How much I make in one day, my friends make in one year,\" Singh says.     Geekboy hopes he can stop the hackers who are exploiting people for money. \"I feel disgusted - what they are doing is very bad,\" Sandeep says. \"From this side I will always try to oppose [them]... everyone and every company should hire good guys.\"     Mexico has become one of the most dangerous places in the world for journalists. Reporting on cartel violence and government corruption has led to 100 journalist killings in the past 25 years, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. This year alone 8 journalists were killed, including Miroslava Breach, one of Mexico's leading investigative reporters. She was gunned down outside her home after reporting on collision between cartels and government.     Luis Chaparro, 28, is a freelance journalist who worked closely with Breach at \"El Norte,\" a newspaper based in Cd. Juarez. CBS News correspondent Manuel Bojorquez met with Chaparro in downtown Juarez, just steps from the United States.     \"Every journalist in Mexico is a target now,\" Chaparro said. \"She was brave. I felt that bullet was too close for me.\"     Oscar Cantu, the owner of \"El Norte,\" where Breach's articles were published, said Breach knew she was publishing dangerous content, but never told him she felt in danger, though \"she must have known.\"     Cantu showed CBS News Breach's final report in which she wrote, \"by either threat or just being complicit, the heads of narcos in all of these regions (Chihuahua State) have infiltrated local governments.\"     Cantu believed it was likely that exact report lead to her death.     Kiribati, the Pacific island nation with a population of 100,000, faces looming threats due to sea level rise and climate change. The archipelago is made up of 33 coral atolls and lies halfway between Hawaii and Australia.     Kiribati native Tearei Tekita's says her home was destroyed by an extremely high tide, known as a \"King Tide,\" when the water surged up from the shoreline without notice as she and her niece lay sleeping. She points to what is now a pool of water, where her home, and many others, once stood.     Scientists have said that the island nation, along with other low-lying Pacific nations, could be uninhabitable within decades. According to Ben Strauss, Vice President for Sea Level and Climate Impacts at Climate Central, \"Sea level is rising 50 percent faster than it was 20 years ago and that is a real cause for alarm, so it is not a future thing we are really seeing that acceleration.\" Kiribati, pronounced \"kir-ah-bahss\" by locals, has an average elevation of just 6 feet above sea level.     For Strauss, and for the people of Kiribati, every increment of sea level rise poses great threat. \"If your maximum elevation is six feet then by the time we get to three feet I think you are in existential stress, you are going to have to have to evacuate\". \u00a0For the remote country's 33 small islands that are scattered across the ocean, spanning an area the size of Alaska, evacuation is not easy. Residents told CBS News correspondent Seth Doane that they would want to leave Kiribati due to the extreme weather they face, however, the UN does not recognize climate change as grounds for refugee status.

            "article_content": "NEW YORK -- U.S. Muslims say they have experienced widespread suspicion about their faith in the first months of Donald Trump's presidency, but also have received more support from individual Americans, and remain hopeful they can eventually be fully accepted in American society, a new survey finds. Nearly three-quarters of U.S. Muslims view Mr. Trump as unfriendly to them, according to a Pew Research Center report released Wednesday. Sixty-two percent say Americans do not view Islam as part of the mainstream after a presidential election that saw a surge in hostility toward Muslims and immigrants. At the same time, nearly half of Muslims said they had received expressions of encouragement from non-Muslims in the past year, an increase over past polls. And Muslims remain optimistic about their future. Seventy percent believe hard work can bring success in America, a figure largely unchanged for a decade. \"There's a sense among the American Muslim population that others are beginning to understand them and beginning to sympathize with them,'\" said Amaney Jamal, a Princeton University political scientist and adviser to Pew researchers. Prejudice against Muslims has \"pushed the average American to say, 'This is really not fair. I'm going to knock on my neighbor's door to see if they're all right,\" Jamal said. The Pew survey is its third on American Muslims since 2007, and its first since Trump took office Jan. 20. He promised to fight terrorism through \"extreme vetting\" of refugees and had a plan to temporarily ban travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. The latest poll of 1,001 adults was conducted by phone, both landline and cellphones, between Jan. 23 and May 2, in English, Arabic, Farsi and Urdu, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 5.8 percentage points. The last several months have seen an uptick in reports of anti-Muslim harassment, including arson and vandalism at mosques and bullying at schools. In the Pew survey, nearly half of U.S. Muslims say they have faced some discrimination in the last year, such as being treated with distrust, threatened or called an offensive name. That percentage is only a slight increase over previous surveys. However, the figure is much higher for respondents who said they were more visibly identified as Muslim, for example by a head covering, or hijab, for women. Sixty-four percent of those with a more distinct Muslim identity said they had recently faced some type of discrimination. Still, the survey found evidence of a growing sense of Muslim belonging in the United States. Eighty-nine percent said they were proud be both Muslim and American and nearly two-thirds said there was no conflict between Islam and democracy. A larger share of American Muslims told Pew they had registered to vote and actually voted. Forty-four percent of Muslims eligible to vote cast ballots in last year's presidential election, compared to 37 percent in 2007. Those numbers on Muslim voting are compared to 60 percent of eligible voters overall who cast ballots in 2016.\" American Muslim leaders, alarmed by anti-Muslim rhetoric in the campaign, made an unprecedented push to register voters in mosques and at community events. Turnout overall was higher after the highly contested 2016 campaign. Muslims overwhelmingly backed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who drew 78 percent of their vote compared to 8 percent for Trump. Following a trend found in other American faith groups, a slight majority of U.S. Muslims now accept homosexuality, a dramatic reversal from a decade ago when 61 percent said same-sex relationships should be discouraged. Pew researchers estimate the number of U.S. Muslims has been growing by 100,000 per year, reaching 3.35 million, or 1 percent of the American population. Just over half of U.S. Muslims identify as Sunni, while 16 percent say they are Shiite. Nearly six in 10 adult American Muslims were born outside the U.S. The largest share of immigrants come from South Asian countries such as Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, while others have come from Iraq, Iran, sub-Saharan Africa and Europe. American-born blacks comprise about 13 percent of all Muslims in America, but their share is shrinking. Overall, eight in 10 are U.S. citizens, according to the survey. Eight in 10 American Muslims said they were concerned about Islamic extremism and more than 70 percent said they were very or somewhat concerned about Islamic extremism in the U.S. However, three of 10 said that most of those arrested recently on suspicion of planning a terrorist attack had been tricked by law enforcement authorities and did not represent a real threat.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u00a0-- President Trump will meet Wednesday with Vladimir Putin's top diplomat at the White House on Wednesday, the White House said, marking the highest level, face-to-face contact with Russia of the American leader's young presidency. It would also signal that the two countries have improved ties that Mr. Trump recently described as being at an \"all-time low.\"\u00a0  Mr. Trump's talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will take place after the Russian's meetings earlier in the day with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.\u00a0  Condoleezza Rice on Russia, Putin and Trump  A Russian plan to stabilize Syria after more than six years of civil war is the most urgent foreign policy topic on the agenda. But the meeting will be impossible to separate from the Trump administration's unfolding political drama in Washington, where FBI and congressional investigations are looking into possible collusion between Mr. Trump campaign associates and the Kremlin related to last year's presidential election. U.S. intelligence agencies accuse Moscow of meddling to help Mr. Trump's chances of victory.\u00a0  The sigma of the Russia probes has been impossible for Mr. Trump to shake. Mr. Trump on Tuesday abruptly fired FBI Director James Comey, dramatically ousting the nation's top law enforcement official in the midst of the bureau's investigation into Mr. Trump's ties with Russia.\u00a0  Less than a month into Mr. Trump's presidency, he fired his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, saying Flynn misled senior administration officials about his pre-inauguration talks with Sergey Kislyak, Russia's ambassador in Washington.   \tIn a Senate hearing Monday, former acting Attorney General Sally Yates said she bluntly warned Mr. Trump's White House in January that Flynn \"essentially could be blackmailed\" by the Russians because he apparently had lied to his bosses about his contacts with Kislyak.   \tMr. Trump has said he has no ties to Russia and isn't aware of any involvement by his aides in any Russian election interference. He calls the various investigations a \"hoax\" driven by Democrats still bitter that their candidate, Hillary Clinton, was defeated last year.  But in the meantime, his hopes for a possible rapprochement with Moscow, so regularly repeated during the campaign, have been derailed. Ties soured further in April after the U.S. blamed a Russian ally, Syrian President Bashar Assad, for a deadly chemical weapons attack on civilians and Mr. Trump fired some 60 cruise missiles at a Syrian air base in response.   \tAfter Tillerson visited Putin and Lavrov in Moscow on April 12, Mr. Trump said flatly, \"Right now we're not getting along with Russia at all.\"   \tStill, Tillerson's meeting provided a blueprint for how the former Cold War foes might go about improving ties.   \tA main focus is Syria, where both governments want to end a civil war that has killed up to 400,000 people, contributed to a global refugee crisis and allowed the Islamic State group to emerge as a global terror threat. The continued fighting between rebels and Assad's military has complicated U.S. efforts to defeat IS.   \tLavrov will be coming to the American capital with a Russian plan to end the violence, after hashing out an agreement with Iran and Turkey last week.   \tIt focuses on the creation of four de-escalation zones. Critical details still need to be finalized and the U.S. response has been cautious, with top officials such as Defense Secretary Jim Mattis saying they're still studying the concept and its various unanswered questions. The would-be safe zones would not cover areas where the U.S.-led coalition is fighting IS.   \tDespite the lack of clarity, the possibility of a meeting between Mr. Trump and Lavrov would in itself be a sign of some progress.   \tThe Russian diplomat hasn't visited Washington at all since 2013, a year before Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and two years before it intervened militarily in Syria to help Assad remain in power.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump reaches his 100th day in office on Saturday, and he likely will go down as one of the least effective presidents in U.S. history at this stage of the first term. One of his major promises on the campaign trail was to repeal Obamacare and yet President Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law is still in place. Blocking Syrian refugees and people from terrorism-prone countries from entering the U.S. was another goal for the administration, but federal courts have halted two versions of his travel ban. The president has relied on his executive power to take action, but he has no significant legislative victories so far.\u00a0 His only major success was the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, which Senate Republicans were able to pull off by invoking the \u201cnuclear option\u201d and eliminating the 60-vote threshold or filibuster for high court nominations. \u201cThat is a genuine accomplishment for him and shouldn\u2019t be minimized,\u201d said Barbara Perry, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center. \u201cOtherwise, I think you\u2019re hard-pressed to find any other major accomplishments.\u201d \u201cIf you look at his legislative record, there is almost nothing to speak of,\u201d said Julian Zelizer, history and public affairs professor at Princeton University. Within Obama\u2019s first 100 days in 2009, he was able to get Congress to approve a $787 billion stimulus package to boost the economy in the midst of the global financial crisis. The Treasury Department unveiled a plan to use $75 billion to $100 billion in bailout money to buy toxic assets from banks. Obama laid out his plan to withdraw most U.S. combat troops from Iraq by August 2010 and all troops by the end of 2011. Comparing the two presidents, however, might not be fair. Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s claims of \u201ccarnage\u201d across the country, he did not come into office facing the series of crises Obama did. \u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s important to realize that all political science research essentially shows that when the economy is essentially in dire straits, there is much more political will to achieve things at that 100-day mark,\u201d said Lara Brown, the interim director of the George Washington University\u2019s Graduate School of Political Management . President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose first 100 days set the standard for a president\u2019s initial period, entered office in 1933 at the height of the Great Depression when there was a 25 percent unemployment rate and a run on the banks. Perry pointed to Roosevelt as the model for the most effective president in modern U.S. history.\u00a0 In those first few days, Roosevelt used his first \u201cfireside chat,\u201d or radio address to the nation, to explain why he had closed the banks. After a week, when he reopened them, Americans had renewed faith in the banks largely because of his assurances. FDR\u2019s administration also helped shepherd multiple pieces of New Deal legislation to protect the industrial sector, the agricultural sector and one that created the Civilian Conservation Corps, which put young unemployed men to work to help build national parks and infrastructure projects. Roosevelt took office with political experience -- he had previously served as governor of New York and in the New York State Senate, as well as Assistant Secretary of the Navy during World War I. Mr. Trump, on the other hand, arrived at the White House with no political experience, having spent his career as a real estate magnate. \u201cThe master dealmakers in American history -- they are not only master politicians, but they are policy wonks,\u201d Brown said, naming Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Bill Clinton as examples. \u201cAll of these people understood how far you could push the negotiation.\u201d The president could also be misreading the electorate as Bush did after the 2004 election and Obama did after the 2008 election, Brown suggested -- and even his own party. \u201cIf you sort of poison the well with all of this kind of full-speed ahead, chest-bumping partisanship -- which I actually think Donald Trump did in his first 30 days -- you\u2019re going to end up with the same result -- with a massive backlash from the other party,\u201d she added.\u00a0 That\u2019s played out in congressional elections -- every president since Clinton has seen his party lose both houses of Congress at some point. Similar to Mr. Trump, President Jimmy Carter entered the White House after being elected in 1976 as an outsider. A former Governor of Georgia at the time, he campaigned on wanting to clean up Washington and its corruption in the wake of President Richard Nixon, and Carter beat a number of members of Congress for the party\u2019s nomination. Carter then arrived in Washington and proposed cutting water and infrastructure projects -- moves that were immediately rebuffed by the Democratic-controlled Congress, despite the fact that Carter was a Democratic president.\u00a0 \u201cThis is where I would just say that Jimmy Carter, as an outsider, didn\u2019t know his party and didn\u2019t know how to work with his party,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd Donald Trump, as an outsider, not only didn\u2019t know politics, but didn\u2019t know any part of his party.\u201d Not all presidents, even great presidents, perform well in their first 100 days. President Abraham Lincoln, who ended slavery with the Emancipation Proclamation after almost two years in the White House, took office in March 1861, just weeks after Southern states seceded from the union leading to the outbreak of the civil war.\u00a0 Some modern presidents, like Ronald Reagan and Clinton, who both had a tough first 100 days, went on to be reelected. \u201cReagan had a lot of trouble in his first few weeks and months as president. His tax bill really stalled and it didn\u2019t get moving until there was an attempted assassination on him. He doesn\u2019t have a lot more to speak of in his first 100 days,\u201d Zelizer said. \u201cBill Clinton had a really rough 100 days. His budget was incredibly controversial, his attorney general picks...the two of them got knocked down, and look, [he later was] reelected and very popular.\u201d Also, even though recent polls have shown Mr. Trump\u2019s approval rating hovering around 40 percent, many of his supporters seem to be satisfied with him so far.\u00a0 \u201cIn other ways, his supporters are probably happy with him. He\u2019s done a lot through executive actions. He\u2019s made some moves on foreign policy, including the [missile] strikes on Syria, that clearly people who are favorable to him, many Republicans think was an accomplishment and setting a new tone for foreign policy,\u201d Zelizer said. I think his base of supporters is generally happy with a lot of the tone of his rhetoric. They\u2019re still seeing the president they voted for.\u201d As for Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to dismantle Obamacare, Republicans failed to secure enough votes last month in the House to pass legislation to repeal and replace the law and their effort to still revive negotiations and strike a deal will likely miss the 100-day deadline. In the end, it might not matter whether it\u2019s done now. \u201cHe can still repeal that program down the line,\u201d Zelizer said. \u201cA hundred years from now, they won\u2019t remember if he repealed it in the first 100 days; they\u2019ll talk about whether he repealed it at all.\u201d Rebecca Shabad is a video reporter for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "ISTANBUL --\u00a0Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared victory in Sunday\u2019s referendum that will grant sweeping powers to the presidency, hailing the result as a \u201chistoric decision.\u201d\u00a0 Speaking to reporters in Istanbul, Erdogan said unofficial results showed the \u201cyes\u201d side had won by a margin of 1.3 million votes.  The president struck a conciliatory tone, thanking all voters regardless of how they cast their ballots and describing the referendum as a \u201chistoric decision.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cApril 16 is the victory of all who said yes or no, of the whole 80 million, of the whole of Turkey of 780,000-square kilometers,\u201d Erdogan said.  Returns carried by the state-run Anadolu news agency showed that with nearly 99 percent of the vote counted, the \u201cyes\u201d vote had  about 51.3 percent compared to 48.7 percent for the \u201cno\u201d vote.  Turkey\u2019s main opposition party vowed to challenge the results reported by Anadolu agency, saying they were skewed.  Erdogan has long sought to broaden his powers, but a previous attempt failed after the governing party that he co-founded fell short of enough votes to pass the reforms without holding a referendum.  Opponents argued the plan concentrate too much power in the hands of a man they allege has shown increasingly autocratic tendencies.\u00a0 The outcome is expected to have a huge effect on Turkey\u2019s long-term political future and its international relations. Although the result, if officially confirmed, would fall short of the sweeping victory Erdogan had sought, but nevertheless cements his hold on the country\u2019s governance.  Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, whose position will be eliminated under the presidential system of government called for in the referendum, also welcomed the results and extended a hand to the opposition.  \u201cWe are all equal citizens of the Republic of Turkey,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth the ones who said \u2018no\u2019 and the ones who said \u2018yes\u2019 are one and are equally valuable.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThere are no losers of this referendum. Turkey won, the beloved people won,\u201d Yildirim said, adding that \u201ca new page has opened in our democratic history with this vote. Be sure that we will use this result for our people\u2019s welfare and peace in the best way.\u201d  Erdogan supporters gathered outside the AK Party headquarters in Istanbul to celebrate, sending fireworks into the night sky.  But the main opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party, or CHP, cast doubt on the results. CHP vice chairman Erdal Aksunger said they would challenge 37 percent of the ballot boxes.  \u201cOur data indicates a manipulation in the range of 3 to 4 percent,\u201d the party said on its Twitter account.\u00a0 The country\u2019s pro-Kurdish opposition party, which also opposed the constitutional changes, said it plans to object to two-thirds of the ballots.\u00a0 An unprecedented decision by Turkey\u2019s Supreme Election board to accept as valid ballot papers that don\u2019t have the official stamp also drew the ire of the CHP, with the party\u2019s deputy chairman, Bulent Tezcan, saying the decision had left the referendum \u201cwith a serious legitimacy problem.\u201d\u00a0 The board made the announcement after many voters complained about being given ballot papers without the official stamp, saying ballots would be considered invalid only if proven to have been fraudulently cast. \u00a0\u00a0 Sunday\u2019s vote approved 18 constitutional changes that will replace Turkey\u2019s parliamentary system of government with a presidential one, abolishing the office of the prime minister and granting sweeping executive powers to the president. The changes will come into effect with the next general election, scheduled for 2019.  The reforms allow the president to appoint ministers, senior government officials and half the members of Turkey\u2019s highest judicial body, as well as to issue decrees and declare states of emergency. They set a limit of two five-year terms for presidents and also allow the president to remain at the helm of a political party.  Erdogan and his supporters had argued the \u201cTurkish-style\u201d presidential system would bring stability and prosperity in a country rattled by a failed coup last year that left more than 200 people dead, and a series of devastating attacks by the Islamic State group and Kurdish militants.  But opponents fear the changes will lead to autocratic one-man rule, ensuring that the 63-year-old Erdogan, who has been accused of repressing rights and freedoms, could govern until 2029 with few checks and balances.  The ballots themselves did not include the referendum question - it was assumed to be understood. Voters used an official stamp to select between \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno.\u201d  At one Istanbul polling station, eager voters lined up outside before it opened at 8 a.m.  \u201cI don\u2019t want to get on a bus with no brake system. A one-man system is like that,\u201d said Istanbul resident Husnu Yahsi, 61, who said he was voting \u201cno.\u201d  In another Istanbul neighborhood, a \u201cyes\u201d voter expressed full support for Erdogan.  \u201cYes, yes, yes! Our leader is the gift of God to us,\u201d said Mualla Sengul. \u201cWe will always support him. He\u2019s governing so well.\u201d  Erdogan first came to power in 2003 as prime minister and served in that role until becoming Turkey\u2019s first directly elected president in 2014.  The referendum campaign was divisive and heavily one-sided, with the \u201cyes\u201d side dominating the airwaves and billboards across the country. Supporters of the \u201cno\u201d vote have complained of intimidation, including beatings, detentions and threats.\u00a0 The vote comes as Turkey has been buffeted by problems. Erdogan survived a coup attempt last July, which he has blamed on his former ally and current nemesis Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic cleric living in the United States. Gulen has denied knowledge of the coup attempt.  Still, a widespread government crackdown has targeted followers of Gulen and other government opponents, branding them terrorists and a state of emergency has been imposed.  Roughly 100,000 people - including judges, teachers, academics, doctors, journalists, military officials and police - have lost their jobs in the government crackdown, and more than 40,000 have been arrested. Hundreds of media outlets and non-governmental organizations have been shut down.  Turkey has also suffered renewed violence between Kurdish militants and security forces in the country\u2019s volatile southeast, as well as a string of bombings, some attributed to the Islamic State group, which is active across the border in Syria.  The war in Syria has led to some 3 million refugees crossing the border into Turkey. Turkey has sent troops into Syria to help opposition Syrian forces clear a border area from the threat posed by Islamic State militants.  Meanwhile, Turkey\u2019s relations with Europe have been increasingly tense, particularly after Erdogan branded Germany and the Netherlands as Nazis for not allowing Turkish ministers to campaign for the \u201cyes\u201d vote among expatriate Turks.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "PARIS -- This year\u2019s Cannes Film Festival is offering up some curve balls, including four chances to see Nicole Kidman onscreen and Adam Sandler in a Noah Baumbach film. But in addition to Hollywood star power, a Civil War film by Sofia Coppola, a Ukrainian road movie and a drama about AIDS activism are among the 18 films competing for top prizes this year at the international cinema extravaganza that organizers hope can help counter rising nationalist sentiment around the world.  Festival director Thierry Fremaux and President Pierre Lescure on Thursday announced a lineup that includes Cannes\u2019 first virtual-reality entry and tackles topics from animal cruelty to the migrant crisis.  Contenders for the top Palme d\u2019Or prize at the 70th Cannes festival include Coppola\u2019s spooky Civil War drama \u201cThe Beguiled,\u201d starring Kidman and Kirsten Dunst; American director Baumbach\u2019s family saga \u201cThe Meyerowitz Stories,\u201d starring Dustin Hoffman, Ben Stiller and Sandler; and fellow American Todd Haynes\u2019 1920s-set drama \u201cWonderstruck.\u201d  Also aiming to impress a competition jury headed by Spanish director Pedro Almodovar are \u201cOkja,\u201da fantasy thriller with an animal-rights theme by South Korea\u2019s Bong Joon-ho starring Tilda Swinton; French director Michel Hazanavicius\u2019 tribute to the French New Wave, \u201cLe Redoutable\u201d; sex-trafficking drama \u201cYou Were Never Really Here\u201d from Britain\u2019s Lynne Ramsay; and \u201cThe Killing of a Sacred Deer,\u201d a thriller from Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos starring Kidman and Colin Farrell.  Kidman also appears at Cannes in John Cameron Mitchell\u2019s out-of-competition entry \u201cHow to Talk to Girls at Parties\u201d and in Jane Campion\u2019s TV crime drama \u201cTop of the Lake.\u201d  Austrian director Michael Haneke, a two-time Palme d\u2019Or winner, returns with \u201cHappy End,\u201d whose title, Fremaux noted, bears little relation to its content.  French filmmaker Robin Campillo\u2019s \u201c120 Beats Per Minute\u201d looks at the rise of AIDS activism, while Fremaux called Ukrainian director Sergei Loznitsa\u2019s \u201cA Gentle Creature\u201d a road movie \u201cabout the situation of Russia.\u201d  In all, 49 films will be shown during the May 17-28 festival, including out-of-competition entries and the sidebar competition \u201cUn Certain Regard.\u201d Twelve of the films are by women -- up from nine last year.  Director Alejandro G. Inarritu will be in Cannes with the virtual reality short film \u201cCarne y Arena\u201d (\u201cMeat and Sand\u201d), reported to be about migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.  Fremaux said it was \u201ca beautiful film, you are shivering when you come out of it.\u201d He compared the wonders of virtual reality to the wonders unleashed by cinema\u2019s founding fathers the Lumiere brothers more than a century ago.  Security will be tight for festival, which is held just down the French coast from Nice, where an Islamic State group-inspired truck attack killed 86 people in July.  Lescure said security was \u201cat its maximum\u201d in 2016 and \u201cthere were no serious incidents.\u201d  \u201cI hope to see the same results this year,\u201d he said.  Global events will cast a shadow over Cannes\u2019 famous Croisette, the town\u2019s picturesque seafront promenade, after a year that has seen Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union and the election of the unpredictable U.S. President Donald Trump.  France will have a new president by the festival\u2019s opening night, with the final stage of the country\u2019s two-round election set for May 7.  In a reflection of changing industry economics, several entries at Cannes this year were funded by Netflix or Amazon. And this hallowed ground of cinema is also making room for television, with previews of David Lynch\u2019s revived \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d and a new series of Campion\u2019s \u201cTop of the Lake.\u201d  Political documentaries include \u201cAn Inconvenient Sequel,\u201d follow-up to Al Gore\u2019s climate-change movie \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth\u201d; Claude Lanzmann\u2019s film about North Korea, \u201cNapalm\u201d; and actress Vanessa Redgrave\u2019s directorial debut \u201cSea Sorrow,\u201d about refugees and those trying to help them.  \u201cSometimes people say the Cannes film festival is very political,\u201d Fremaux said. \u201cIt\u2019s not true. It\u2019s not us, it\u2019s not me -- it\u2019s cinema. The makers are concerned about politics.\u201d  Fremaux said he hopes the festival can \u201clook to the future\u201d and hold \u201cthe promise of living together in harmony.\u201d ",

            "article_content": "SAN FRANCISCO -- A spirited Hillary Clinton took on the Trump administration Tuesday in one of her first public speeches since she lost the presidential election, criticizing the country\u2019s Republican leaders on everything from health care to the shortage of women appointees in top administration positions.  Cracking jokes about her November defeat and her months out of the limelight since, Clinton spoke to thousands of businesswomen in San Francisco, joking there was no place she\u2019d rather be, \u201cother than the White House.\u201d  Without mentioning President Donald Trump by name, Clinton faulted the Republican presidential administration repeatedly, including calling its representation of women in top jobs \u201cthe lowest in a generation.\u201d She rebuked White House press secretary Sean Spicer, again not by name, for hours earlier Tuesday chiding a black woman journalist during a news conference for shaking her head.  \u201cToo many women have had a lifetime of practice taking this kind of indignity in stride,\u201d Clinton said.  \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t know all the nasty things they were saying about me. I thought some of them were kind of creative,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you just have to keep going.\u201d  Clinton declared herself appalled at a much-circulated photo showing an all-male group of Republican lawmakers last month negotiating women\u2019s coverage in health care legislation, noting a social-media parody of it that showed an all-dog panel deciding on feline care.  Last week\u2019s failure of the GOP health care bill, Clinton told a cheering, applauding crowd, was \u201ca victory for all Americans.\u201d  Trump has named four women to his Cabinet, the same number as in former President George W. Bush\u2019s first Cabinet. Trump earlier this week pointed to the work he planned to have his daughter, Ivanka Trump Kushner, do on childcare and other issues involving working women and men in her unsalaried role in his administration.  Clinton has kept a low profile after Trump defeated her for the presidency, except chiefly for sightings while she took walks outdoors with her husband, former President Bill Clinton. She said earlier this month that she intended to start speaking out again on public issues.  On Tuesday, she urged voters to resist Trump policies that she said included suspicion of refugees and voter suppression in some areas.  \u201cThese are bad policies that will hurt people and take our country in the wrong direction,\u201d Clinton said, relaying what she had become one of her mantras since the November election.  \u201cIt\u2019s the kinds of things you think about when you take long walks in the woods,\u201d she said. \u201cResist, insist, persist, enlist.\u201d",

House Speaker Paul Ryan said in an interview airing Sunday that he has not seen anything to suggest former President Obama wiretapped President Donald Trump during the 2016 election -- but that what Mr. Trump tweets is \u201coutside of [his] control\u201d and that the congressional investigation will clear up the truth. \u201cThat\u2019s outside of my control, what is tweeted or what isn\u2019t tweeted. We\u2019re focused on health care. The president\u2019s focused on health care,\u201d Ryan said in an interview with CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cI think he\u2019s frustrated with this whole thing about Russia. I think he\u2019s frustrated with selective leaks coming from parts of government that malign his campaign.\u201d The spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin is expressing frustration with the inconclusive first two months of relations between Moscow and the Trump administration.\u00a0 The election of President Trump, who had spoken admiringly of Putin and called for improved US-Russia relations, had raised hopes in the Kremlin. But Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov says there are no signs of progress yet.\u00a0 House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont; and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, appear on\u00a0\u201cFace the Nation\u201d\u00a0with host John Dickerson Sunday. The House intelligence committee is asking the Trump administration for evidence that the phones at Trump Tower were tapped during the campaign as its\u00a0namesake has charged. President Donald Trump asserted in a tweet last week: \u201cTerrible! Just found out that Obama had my \u2018wires tapped\u2019 in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!\u201d He continued the allegation against former President Barack Obama in other tweets but offered no evidence. The president is at the White House. Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney in New York who earned a reputation for battling corruption and white-collar crime,\u00a0says he has been fired by the Trump administration\u00a0after refusing to tender his resignation. \u201cI did not resign,\u201d Bharara said Saturday afternoon on Twitter. \u201cMoments ago I was fired. Being the US Attorney in SDNY will forever be the greatest honor of my professional life.\u201d Bharara\u2019s departure comes as Attorney General Jeff Sessions looks to secure the resignations of 46 U.S. Attorneys who were holdovers from the Obama administration.\u00a0 President Trump\u2019s\u00a0revised travel ban\u00a0goes into effect Thursday. It bars new visas for people from six predominantly Muslim countries and temporarily shuts down the U.S. refugee program.\u00a0 Just like the\u00a0original travel ban,\u00a0version 2.0 is facing legal challenges. Vice President Mike Pence is\u00a0visiting Louisville to talk about\u00a0the Republican health care plan. The U.S. Secret Service confirms\u00a0an intruder breached the White House perimeter Friday night. According to the Secret Service, \u201can individual scaled the outer perimeter fence by the Treasury Building and East Executive Avenue.\u201d Uniformed Secret Service officers arrested the individual, and the individual\u2019s backpack was screened and \u201cfound to be free of any hazardous materials.\u201d Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly has been briefed on the matter. The Trump Administration is\u00a0planning a meeting this coming week with Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, CBS News has learned. Salman is a powerful force within the royal family, second in line to the throne, and currently serves as defense minister. The White House has not yet announced the visit, as it is still confirming details. The visit comes as the U.S. expands its military mission against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in Yemen, a country on the brink of widespread famine and torn apart by civil war\u00a0involving Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. The U.S. has been providing support and precision training to a Saudi-led military coalition fighting those rebels.\u00a0 The president used the bully pulpit this week to promote what is the first major piece of legislation of his administration - reforming Obamacare. This comes while his administation is still trying to field lingering questions about\u00a0links between Mr. Trump\u2019s associates and foreign entities, CBS News correspondent Errol Barnett reports. The president is at the White House.",

            "article_content": "To his followers and faithful, Robert Mugabe is an African nationalist hero who defied the might of white rule, and won. To his many enemies and detractors, he is a brutal tyrant who ruled by fear and ruined his country.\u00a0 On Wednesday, Zimbabwe's military vehemently denied a coup to topple the Mugabe, but said he and his wife were in custody. From the outside, in spite of the denials, it looked a lot like a coup had toppled Africa's last dictator.\u00a0 \u00a0 Born into poverty, Robert Gabriel Mugabe rose to become a leader of one of the guerrilla groups fighting white rule in what was then Rhodesia. When the vicious bush war ended in 1980, Mugabe swept to power -- and made sure he stayed there. He quickly moved to consolidate his ZANU-PF party's hold on the country, crushing his opponents in a brutal crackdown in which thousands of people were killed. He became President of Zimbabwe in 1987, when the constitution was altered, and turned Zimbabwe in to a personal fiefdom and virtual one-party state. In 2000, Mugabe ordered his followers to begin seizing white-owned farms -- supposedly to re-distribute the land more equitably to blacks. In reality, thugs grandly-titled \"war veterans\" drove off the farm owners, wrecked homes and barns, killed livestock and then left the land fallow. The farming industry that once made Zimbabwe the bread basket of southern Africa collapsed with devastating speed. Within a few years, much of the population was dependent on food aid. A new opposition party gained broad support in elections in 2008, in spite of widespread voter fraud and violence, but Mugabe held onto power in a coalition that was more pretense than political reality.  The economy went into free-fall. Shelves in stores stood empty and unemployment soared. The Zimbabwe dollar was being printed in denominations of billions. Tens of thousands of economic refugees fled to neighboring South Africa. Isolated in his own power clique and guarded by a vicious and all-pervasive security service, Mugabe's rein may come to an unceremonious end thanks to his insistence that he be succeeded by his wife, 52-year-old Grace Mugabe. Last week, Mugabe sacked his vice president, Emmanuel Mnangagwa, who was backed by the country's military to succeed the African dictator.  On Wednesday, Mugabe's own ZANU-PF insisted there had been no coup, but said Mnangagwa had been named interim leader of Zimbabwe's ruling party -- and by extension, presumably, leader of Zimbabwe.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "BEIRUT -- More than 60 people were killed in a ferocious attack on a market in north Syria on Monday that left rescuers and survivors digging late into the evening to search for residents still buried under the rubble. There were at least three airstrikes on the market at Atareb, a town in the Aleppo countryside swollen by the arrival of refugees from nearby battles, in the latest breach of a \"de-escalation\" agreement that has proven largely unenforceable. Aleppo, Syria's largest city, is controlled by the government. The attack tore market-goers apart, according to media published by the activist-run Thiqa news agency. Survivors found limbs in the rubble and corpses with heads ripped apart by the force of the blasts. A police station by the market was also struck, killing an officer, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group. \"A number of people died of their wounds, bringing the toll to 61 people, including five children and three policemen,\" the Observatory said Tuesday morning.  Observatory said it could not determine whether the Syrian government or its chief backer, Russia, was behind the airstrikes. Atareb and the countryside around it remain outside the control of the Damascus-based government which says it wants to retake all of Syria following six years of civil war that has killed at least 400,000 people and displaced 11 million others -- half the country's population. The war began after a violent crackdown against demonstrations calling for reforms in 2011. It has drawn in fighters from across the world. President Bashar Assad says he is fighting a war on terror. Russia's intervention on the side of Assad in 2015 turned the tide in his favor. Atareb and the opposition-held countryside in northwest Syria are meant to be protected by a \"de-escalation agreement\" brokered earlier this year by Russia, Iran, and Turkey, the main backers of the Syrian government and the opposition. The U.S. and Russia have lately renewed efforts to find a settlement for post-war Syria. With their common enemy, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), nearing defeat, the two superpowers find themselves again on opposite sides of the conflict, with Moscow backing Assad and the U.S. offering rhetorical support to armed opposition groups fighting the government. In a joint statement Saturday, the two countries said \"de-escalation areas\" were an \"interim step\" toward restoring peace in Syria and that there could be \"no military solution\" to the war. But on Tuesday Russia made it clear that even on the point of ISIS being a common enemy, Moscow and Washington continue to hold divergent opinions; Russia's Defense Ministry accused the U.S. of directly supporting ISIS in a recent battle for a town on the Iraqi border. \"The operation to regain control of Abu Kamal held by the Syrian government troops late last week exposed instances of direct interaction with and support for Islamic State terrorists by the U.S.-led international coalition,\" the Defense Ministry said, according to Russia's state-run news agency TASS. The Ministry accused U.S. forces of blocking Russian strikes on ISIS militants around the town. The previous joint U.S.-Russian statement, made over the weekend, drew a sarcastic response from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who said the two superpowers could start by withdrawing their own troops from the war and instead support holding elections in Syria. He said there were five Russian and thirteen U.S. bases in Syria, plus a fourteenth under construction in the northern city of Raqqa, now administered by a U.S.-backed Kurdish party that Turkey says is an extension of a separatist group operating within its own borders. Turkey considers the group a terrorist organization. Erdogan ordered Turkey's military into north Syria in 2016 to battle Kurdish militias and ISIS. It maintains a presence along opposition-held areas near the Turkish border. Also Monday, London-based Amnesty International released a report saying that under so-called \"reconciliation\" agreements, government sieges and intense bombardments of some rebel-held areas in Syria have given no choice for residents but to leave or die. The report said that the Syrian government and, to a lesser extent, armed opposition groups \"have unlawfully besieged civilians, depriving them of food, medicine and other basic necessities, and carried out unlawful attacks on densely populated areas.\" Tens of thousands of people have been displaced over the past years as a result of such sieges including areas near the capital Damascus and the northern city of Aleppo, as well as in the central city of Homs. \"While the Syrian government's stated aim has been to vanquish opposition fighters, its cynical use of surrender or starve tactics... have been part of a systematic, as well as widespread, attack on civilians that amounts to crimes against humanity,\" said Philip Luther, research and advocacy director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International. Hours before the report was released, Syria's state news agency SANA said an aid convoy had crossed into the besieged Damascus suburb of Douma under the supervision of the Syrian Arab Red Crescent. It said it consisted of 24 trucks and entered the besieged area late Sunday with the cooperation of the United Nations. Separately, Syrian Transport Minister Ali Hamoud says the civil war in Syria has cost least $4.6 billion in damage to transportation networks and infrastructure. Hamoud, in comments to Al-Watan newspaper published Monday, said 1,800 kilometers of the country's 2,450-kilometer railway network have been destroyed. At least 50 bridges have been destroyed including several vital ones leading to the country's coastal provinces, its largest city Aleppo, and across the Euphrates River to Raqqa and Deir el-Zour, once key strongholds of ISIS fighters. Traffic to Syria's Mediterranean ports has also plummeted. The ports are receiving around 1,500 ships annually, down from 4,500 before the war, trading 9 million tons of goods, down from 24 million.",

            "article_content": "U.S. officials are preparing a recommendation for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to declare that \"ethnic cleansing\" is occurring against Myanmar's Rohingya Muslims. That assessment would raise pressure on the Trump administration and U.S. lawmakers to consider new sanctions on a country that had been lauded for its democratic transition. Tillerson could receive the recommendation as early as this week, said officials familiar with the process. He will then decide whether to adopt the advice of his agency's policy experts and lawyers. A declaration of \"ethnic cleansing\" by the top U.S. diplomat would mark a reversal of fortune in American relations with the country also known as Burma, whose civilian government has been under the leadership of Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi for more than a year. But Suu Kyi and her government allies have little control over Myanmar's still powerful military, which is blamed for a brutal crackdown on Muslims in Rakhine State that has caused more than 600,000 refugees to flee to Bangladesh. The State Department declined to comment. The recommendation is being prepared as U.S. lawmakers urge fresh sanctions on Myanmar's military and are calling on the Trump administration to sever already restricted military ties. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee takes up the issue at a hearing on U.S. policy toward Myanmar on Tuesday. US Ambassador to the Philippines Sung Kim says the US military aided Philippine troops, who recently defeated Islamic State-style militants in the city of Marawi. He said the US shared intelligence and provided technical advice and equipment. (Oct. 24) The U.S. officials, who weren't authorized to speak publicly on the internal process and requested anonymity, said the State Department won't make a call yet on whether crimes against humanity in Myanmar have occurred. Such a determination would be even more detrimental to Myanmar's military, as it could force the U.S. to push for legal accountability. Attacks by Rohingya insurgents on security forces in late August triggered what human rights groups have called a scorched-earth campaign against Rohingya villages. Amnesty International has reported that hundreds of Rohingya men, women and children have been systematically killed. Calls for a U.S. determination of \"ethnic cleansing\" have intensified, as the United Nations and leading Western governments have used the term. Six weeks ago, U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said it \"seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.\" French President Emmanuel Macron echoed that opinion, as have leaders of many in the Muslim world. U.S. officials have been more reticent. Tillerson, who last week said that perpetrators will be held to account for atrocities, has referred to the violence as \"characterized by many as ethnic cleansing.\" U.N. envoy Nikki Haley told the Security Council last month it was \"a brutal, sustained campaign to cleanse the country of an ethnic minority.\" But that's as far as the administration has gone as it prepares for President Donald Trump's first trip to the region next month. U.S. lawmakers have pushed for the administration to use the term without qualification. Earlier this month, Patrick Murphy, a senior U.S. diplomat for Southeast Asia, described it as a \"human tragedy\" as he was grilled by the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He will testify again Tuesday. According to the United Nations Office on Genocide Prevention, \"ethnic cleansing\" isn't recognized as an independent crime under international law, unlike crimes against humanity and genocide. It surfaced in the context of the 1990s conflict in the former Yugoslavia, when a U.N. commission defined it as \"rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or intimidation to remove persons of given groups from the area.\" Before the latest exodus, roughly 1 million Rohingya lived in Myanmar. The Buddhist majority believes they migrated illegally from Bangladesh, although many Rohingya families have lived in Myanmar for generations. They were stripped of their citizenship in 1982. Sarah Margon, Washington director for Human Rights Watch, said a U.S. \"ethnic cleansing\" determination \"is long overdue,\" but should only be a first step. \"Even if the U.S. government does get there, the real question is what concrete response is there going to be?\" she said. Starting in 2012, the Obama administration lifted long-standing sanctions against Myanmar to reward its shift from military rule. The transition culminated in 2015 elections and a civilian government led by Suu Kyi. U.S. officials who are focused on Asia policy remain leery of punishing Myanmar for fear it could undermine Suu Kyi's efforts and push her country away from the United States and closer to rivals such as China. Officials say the recent violence has prompted the U.S. administration to reverse a policy of waiving visa restrictions and allowing members of Myanmar's military and their families to visit here. The State Department also announced Monday that all units and officers involved in the operations in Rakhine were ineligible for U.S. assistance, and it has rescinded invitations for senior Myanmar security forces to attend U.S.-sponsored events. Some lawmakers say that's hardly enough. More than 40 House members wrote to Tillerson last week to seek \"significant actions to stop the ethnic cleansing\" of Rohingya. Twenty-one senators wrote to Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., urging multilateral sanctions against specific senior Myanmar military officials. Sen. Ben Cardin, the Foreign Relations Committee's top Democrat, says the Rohingya are facing not just \"ethnic cleansing,\" but \"genocide.\" The U.N. defines that term as the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group. Already, two years ago, Yale Law School argued there was \"strong evidence that genocide is being committed.\"",

            "article_content": "LONDON -- Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has delivered the toughest condemnation yet from a Trump administration official of the persecution of Myanmar's Rohingya Muslims, likening the violence against them to ethnic cleansing and demanding it stop. On Thursday, Tillerson directed the blame toward Myanmar's powerful military, which is responsible for security operations that have seen nearly 400,000 people flee to neighboring Bangladesh in the past three weeks after Rohingya insurgents launched coordinated attacks on government forces. He reiterated support for civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi who is facing growing pressure to speak out over the military's conduct. Tillerson said the U.S. appreciated the \"difficult and complex situation\" Suu Kyi finds herself in, sharing political power with the military, but he also described the \"horrors\" occurring in the Southeast Asian nation as a \"defining moment\" for its new democracy. \"This violence must stop, this persecution must stop. It has been characterized by many as ethnic cleansing. That must stop,\" Tillerson told a news conference in London after talks with Britain and France. \"We need to support Aung San Suu Kyi and her leadership but also be very clear to the military that are power-sharing in that government that this is unacceptable.\" British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was more strident in criticizing Suu Kyi. He said the suffering of the Rohingya people was an \"abomination,\" and that Suu Kyi must use her authority to halt the violence against them. Johnson said he admired Suu Kyi's fight against Myanmar's former military junta -- she spent about 15 years under house arrest - but \"it is now vital for her to use that moral capital, that moral authority to make the point about the suffering\" of the Rohingya. He said the Nobel laureate needs to \"make clear that this is an abomination and that those people will be allowed back\" to their homes. Britain was the former colonial ruler of the country also known as Burma. It came under military rule little more than a decade after independence in 1948. The United States under President Obama was instrumental in coaxing the generals give up direct rule five decades later and allow a civilian government. Following 2015 elections won by her party, Suu Kyi became its de facto leader. But the transition has been blighted by the tensions between majority Buddhists and the Rohingya, who are widely loathed in Myanmar and regarded as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, although many have lived in Myanmar for generations. In the past few years there have been periodic explosions of violence, culminating in the current crackdown by security forces that began Aug. 25 and which top U.N. officials have also described as ethnic cleansing. On Thursday, Amnesty International said it had turned up evidence of an \"orchestrated campaign of systematic burnings\" by Myanmar security forces. Based on its analysis of video, satellite photos, witness accounts and other data, the human rights group said more than 80 inhabited sites, each at least 1,230 feet in length, have been torched in strife-hit Rakhine State. \"The evidence is irrefutable - the Myanmar security forces are setting northern Rakhine State ablaze in a targeted campaign to push the Rohingya people out of Myanmar,\" said Tirana Hassan, Amnesty's crisis response director said in a statement. \"Security forces surround a village, shoot people fleeing in panic and then torch houses to the ground,\" she said. \"In legal terms, these are crimes against humanity.\" While the Trump administration has been less active on Myanmar than the Obama administration, the current wave of global condemnation has begun to galvanize a response in Washington, where Suu Kyi has long been idolized for her peaceful struggle for democracy. Senior Republican Sen. John McCain this week canned legislative plans to authorize deeper military ties between the U.S. and Myanmar. He noted that the international community has called upon Suu Kyi to stop the violence and hold human rights abusers accountable, \"but there has been no action to-date.\" On Thursday, the Senate's top Republican, Mitch McConnell, who has long been at the forefront of U.S. policy toward Myanmar, came to Suu Kyi's defense. McConnell said he spoke with Suu Kyi by phone on Wednesday and she repeated her call for \"peace and reconciliation\" in strife-torn Rakhine state. She told him she was working toward securing immediate and improved humanitarian access to the region. The Kentucky lawmaker said her civilian government has little control over Myanmar's military and the nation's path to a more democratic government will take time. \"Publicly condemning Aung San Suu Kyi - the best hope for democratic reform in Burma - is not constructive,\" McConnell told the Senate. \"Attacking the single political leader who has worked to further democracy within Burma is likely to hinder that objective in the long run.\"",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump is headed back to Europe hoping to receive a friendly welcome in Poland despite lingering skepticism across the continent over his commitment to NATO, his past praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his decision to pull the U.S. out of a major climate agreement. Mr. Trump arrives in Warsaw, Poland, on Wednesday for a brief visit that will include a speech in Krasinski Square, near the site of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising against the Nazis. He'll also meet with the leaders of Poland and Croatia and hold a joint press conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda. Getting ready to leave for Poland, after which I will travel to Germany for the G-20. Will be back on Saturday. Mr. Trump tweeted he was preparing to leave for Poland Wednesday morning, but shifted tone in a follow up tweet, saying that \"the U.S. has made some of the worst trade deals in world history,\" adding \"Why should we continue these deals with countries that do not help us?\" The United States made some of the worst Trade Deals in world history.Why should we continue these deals with countries that do not help us? Trade, among other topics like climate change, North Korea and Russian interference will be up for discussion as he arrives in Hamburg later this week. \u00a0 Before moving on to an international summit in Germany, the president will also hold meetings with the leaders of a dozen countries located between the Baltic, Adriatic and Black seas at a summit of the Three Seas Initiative, which aims to expand and modernize energy and trade. One of the initiative's goals is to make the region less dependent on Russian energy. \"Even if he doesn't mention Putin or Russia outright, just stepping foot in Poland sends a powerful statement,\" said Jim Carafano, a foreign policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. \"Europe is working for energy independence \u2014 looking for free market solutions \u2014 and Poland is in the middle of that energy corridor, so it makes so much sense that the president would go there and talk about energy policy.\" At the same time, Mr. Trump will have to balance his visit to Europe with escalating tensions with North Korea, after the U.S. concluded Tuesday that North Korea had test-launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile. The U.S., South Korea and Japan responded to the provocation by requesting an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council, scheduled Wednesday afternoon. Mr. Trump returns to Europe after a shaky first trip to the continent in May and signs of unhappiness around the globe with the start of his presidency. A recent Pew Research Center survey of attitudes toward Mr. Trump in more than three dozen countries found fewer than 3 in 10 respondents expressing confidence in his ability to do the right thing on international affairs. Most of those surveyed disapproved of Mr. Trump's major policies, including temporarily halting travel from six mostly Muslim countries. Among the 37 countries Pew surveyed, Mr. Trump scored higher marks than his predecessor, President Barack Obama, in only two: Russia and Israel. Mr. Trump's first trip to Europe as president in May saw a series of awkward encounters, including a tough speech to the leaders of NATO countries urging them to spend more on their armed forces, an uncomfortable handshake with France's new president, and a caught-on-camera moment when Mr. Trump pushed past the prime minister of Montenegro, Europe's newest country, while squeezing his way to the front of a crowd. But Poland may offer Mr. Trump a chance to shine. According to Polish media reports, Poland's government promised the White House a reception of cheering crowds as part of its invitation. To make good on that pledge, ruling party lawmakers and pro-government activists plan to bus in groups from the provinces to hear Mr. Trump's speech. The White House didn't respond to a request for comment on those reports. With Mr. Trump's sights already set on the 2020 election, his visit to Poland could also be seen as a power play for battleground states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which are home to hundreds of thousands of Polish-American voters. Mr. Trump may also seek to use Poland as an exemplar of partnership. A U.S. ally in Iraq and Afghanistan, Poland is one of the five NATO members that spends at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product on the military. That's something that Trump \u2014 and U.S. leaders before him \u2014 have demanded of NATO allies. Trump has scolded other NATO members for falling short on their commitments. Poland is also host to about 1,000 U.S. troops, and is supporting U.S. and NATO forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. It's also a regular customer for U.S. military equipment. Before Mr. Trump's arrival, Poland's government emphasized that Russia's aggression in Ukraine poses a threat to the whole of Europe, something that will inevitably be raised in discussions with Trump as Europeans seek to gauge the president's willingness to confront Putin before their first face-to-face meeting later this week. \"Poland is, in some ways, a poster child for some of the issues that the Trump administration has been stressing,\" said Jeffrey Rathke, deputy director of the Europe Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"They're betting that this relationship with the United States on defense will balance their concerns about the possible directions of U.S.-Russia policy.\" Poland also hopes Mr. Trump's visit will reinforce its position with European partners as it faces allegations of backsliding on democracy. The right-wing government is also one of only three European Union countries \u2014 along with Hungary and Austria \u2014 refusing to accept any relocated refugees, in legal violation of EU quotas. Mr. Trump, too, has been working to curb refugee admissions to the U.S. as part of his travel ban.",

            "article_content": "HAVANA -- Cuba's foreign minister rejected President Donald Trump's new policy toward the island, saying Monday that \"we will never negotiate under pressure or under threat\" and refusing to return U.S. fugitives who have received asylum in Cuba.  In a hard-edged response to the policy announced Friday, Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said from Vienna that Mr. Trump's restrictions on transactions with the Cuban military would not achieve their objective of weakening the government. He said they would instead create unity behind the communist leadership.  He described fugitives such as Joanne Chesimard, a black militant convicted in 1977 of the murder of a New Jersey state trooper, as political refugees who had received asylum from the Cuban government and would not be returned because the U.S. has no \"legal or moral basis\" to demand their return.  Surrounded by Cuban-American exiles and Cuban dissidents, Mr. Trump announced from a theater in Miami that the U.S. would impose new limits on U.S. travelers to the island and ban any payments to the military-linked conglomerate that controls much of the island's tourism industry. Trump also declared that, \"the harboring of criminals and fugitives will end. You have no choice. It will end.\"  He said the U.S. would consider lifting those and other restrictions only after Cuba returned fugitives and made a series of other internal changes including freeing political prisoners, allowing freedom of assembly and holding free elections.  \"When Cuba is ready to take concrete steps to these ends, we will be ready, willing, and able to come to the table to negotiate that much better deal for Cubans, for Americans,\" Mr. Trump said.  Rodriguez' response Monday was a clear signal that there could be very little, if any, high-level U.S.-Cuba negotiation during Mr. Trump's time in office. Already, while working-level meeting on topics such as search-and-rescue have taken place since Mr. Trump took office, no meetings between top diplomats have occurred. It's a sharp contrast to Obama's last year, during which top U.S. and Cuban diplomats met regularly to discuss topics including law-enforcement cooperation and compensation for Americans whose property was taken during the 1959 Cuban revolution.  \"Cuba will not make concessions that harm its sovereignty,\" Rodriguez said. \"We have never done in the history of the revolution.\" ",

            "article_content": "JERUSALEM -- An Israeli Cabinet minister has expressed concern about a $110 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia that President Trump signed Saturday in Riyadh. Yuval Steinitz, a senior Cabinet minister and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confidant, called Saudi Arabia \"a hostile country\" and said the deal was \"definitely something that should trouble us.\" He made the remark as Mr. Trump prepares to head to Israel, on the second leg of his first overseas as president. The trip comes as the dynamics between the United States and the region's players are moving in unexpected directions. \"That was a tremendous day,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Saturday while in Saudi Arabia. \"Tremendous investments in the United States.\"  The agreement he signed -- which signals a strengthening relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia -- will provide fighter jets, tanks, combat ships and anti-missile defense systems, and create defense-sector jobs in the U.S., according to the White House. The deal includes additional private-sector agreements and a joint vision statement with Saudi Arabia, one of the world's largest oil producers. Mr. Trump's trip to Israel set to begin Monday, and include separate meetings with Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Mr. Trump also planned to visit the Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem and the Western Wall, an important key Jewish holy site. Mr. Trump has cast the elusive pursuit of peace between Israelis and Palestinians as the \"ultimate deal.\" But he will step foot in Israel having offered few indications of how he plans to achieve what so many of his predecessors could not. Mr. Trump has handed son-in-law Jared Kushner and longtime business lawyer Jason Greenblatt the assignment of charting the course toward a peace process. The White House-driven effort is a sharp shift from the practice of U.S. previous administrations that typically gave secretaries of state those reins. Kushner and Greenblatt were to accompany Mr. Trump on his two-day visit. White House aides have played expectations for significant progress on the peace process during Mr. Trump's stop, casting it as more symbolic than substantive. Yet Mr. Trump may still need to engage in some delicate diplomacy following revelations that he disclosed highly classified intelligence Israel obtained about the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) with top Russian officials, without Israel's permission.  While Israeli officials cheered Mr. Trump's election, some are now wary of the tougher line he has taken on settlements: urging restraint but not calling for a full halt to construction. Trump has retreated from a campaign pledge to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, bending to the same diplomatic and security concerns as other presidents who have made similar promises.  \t \tPalestinians, who viewed Mr. Trump's victory with some trepidation, are said to have been pleasantly surprised by his openness during a recent meeting with Abbas in Washington. A senior official who was part of the Palestinian delegation said Mr. Trump is planning to try to relaunch peace talks, with a goal of reaching an agreement within a year. The Trump administration rejected a request from the Palestinians to push for an Israeli settlement freeze, but promised to sort out the issue during peace negotiations, according to the official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the private meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity. Jibril Rajoub, a senior Palestinian official close to Abbas, said Mr. Trump was a \"serious president\" who \"seeks to have a real deal, not just managing the conflict.\" David Friedman, the new U.S. ambassador to Israel, told the newspaper Israel Hayom that Trump's goal at the start is simply \"for the parties to meet with each other without preconditions and to begin a discussion that would hopefully lead to peace.\"  \t \tThe last round of peace talks, led by then-President Barack Obama and his Secretary of State John Kerry, fell apart in 2014.  Greenblatt has quietly done much of the heavy work for the U.S. thus far. The low-profile Greenblatt, who spent about two decades as a lawyer at the Trump Organization before joining the White House, has traveled to the region twice since the inauguration and is in weekly contact with pivotal players from both sides.  \t \tPalestinian officials were struck by the fact that Greenblatt, an Orthodox Jew, took off his skullcap for their meetings. He also visited the Jalazoun refugee camp near Ramallah, home to Abbas' West Bank headquarters, and a school at the camp, which sits opposite to the Israeli settlement of Beit El. Senior White House officials, including Friedman, have close ties with Beit El.  \t \t\"That was good gesture by him,\" said Mahmoud Mubarak, head of the local council in Jalazoun.  \t \tAaron David Miller, a Middle East peace adviser to Democratic and Republican secretaries of state, said that despite Greenblatt's positive reviews in the region, there are limits over how much influence he, or any American officials, can have over the process. \"The issue over many years has not been the mediator in the middle -- it's the guys sitting on the other sides of the mediators,\" said Miller, now a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.  \t \tIsraeli officials say they are largely in the dark about what ideas Mr. Trump might present for peace or what concessions he may demand. Hard-liners who dominate Netanyahu's government grew particularly concerned when White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster voiced support last week for Palestinian \"self-determination.\"  \t \tNaftali Bennett, leader of the nationalist Jewish Home Party, lamented \"a kind of change in the spirit\" of Trump's positions since he was elected in November. He urged Netanyahu to reject Palestinian statehood and insist that Jerusalem remain under Israeli sovereignty forever.  \t \tWhile Netanyahu in the past has expressed support for the establishment of a Palestinian state, he has been vague about this goal since Mr. Trump gained power.  \t \tMr. Trump's trip began in Saudi Arabia over the weekend, and after Israel, it takes him to the Vatican for an audience with Pope Francis, to Brussels for a NATO summit and to Sicily for a meeting of leaders of the Group of Seven major industrial nations. On Sunday, Mr. Trump gave a speech in Riyadh. He focused on unifying Muslim nations in the fight against terrorism.  Mr. Trump emphasized that the fight isn't a battle between different faiths, but \"battle between good and evil\" -- and a battle that other Muslim nations must lead. Mr. Trump called on Muslim nations to \"drive them (terrorists) out of your Holy Land, and drive the out of this earth.\"  \"Muslim nations must be willing to take on terrorism and send its wicked ideology into oblivion,\" Mr. Trump said.

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton on Monday launched her anticipated political action group, Onward Together, which will collaborate with and fund political organizations supporting the Democratic Party. In an email announcing the nonprofit's installation, the former Democratic presidential encapsulated her broader mission, saying that a healthy democracy depends upon strong citizen engagement. \"To support this wave of grassroots organizing, we're launching Onward Together, an organization dedicated to advancing the progressive vision that earned nearly 66 million votes in the last election,\" read the statement, which also appears on the group's website. \"Onward Together will work to build a brighter future for generations to come by supporting groups that encourage people to organize and run for office.\" Onward Together will aid Indivisible Guide, a progressive organization adopting strategies from the Tea Party Patriots movement; Swing Left, an action group devising strategies for a Democratic House takeover in 2018; Color Of Change, an online organization for racial justice; Emerge America, an advocacy alliance for involvement of women in politics; and Run for Something, an organization aiding millennials seeking public office. With guidance from former Democratic Chairman and Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, the group hopes to gain support, and donations, from the roughly 66 million voters who cast their ballots for Clinton in November. In the email, Clinton praised political organization efforts such as the Women's March in January and credited them with paving a way forward for Democrats. \"From the Women's March to airports where communities are welcoming immigrants and refugees to town hall meetings in every community, Americans are speaking up and speaking out like never before,\" the statement read. \"The challenges we face as a country are real. But there's no telling what we can achieve if we approach the fights ahead with the passion and determination we feel today, and bring that energy into 2017, 2018, 2020, and beyond.\" Clinton also promoted Onward Together in a series of eight tweets, adding that the group will continue to reach out to additional political organizations in the future and that supporters should \"stay tuned for more to come.\" We're launching Onward Together to encourage people to get involved, organize, and even run for office. https://t.co/8exooosvZ5 .@IndivisibleTeam @swingleft .@ColorOfChange is organizing for criminal justice reform, voter freedom, fairness and accuracy in media, and other racial justice issues. A Clinton quote from March that reads \"resist, insist, persist, enlist\" greets visitors on the website's front page. Arrow graphics, similar to those used in Clinton's presidential campaign, line the bottom half of the page. The website's design features play off of the Clinton campaign's bold, clean aesthetics, but its main difference lies in its renewed message of citizen engagement. CBS News reported earlier in May about reporting and speculation of the group's launch. According to a report by Politico, over the course of her travels and public speaking engagements in previous months, Clinton met with potential donors, strategists and advisers for the nonprofit. Those included Clinton's former campaign finance director Dennis Cheng, former Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs at the U.S. State Department Judith McHale and longtime family adviser Minyon Moore. As the Democratic Party revises its strategy in response to Mr. Trump's unexpected win and Republican control of both the House and the Senate, Clinton's group says it will play a role is assisting progressive groups in the lead up to the 2018 midterms. \"This year hasn't been what I envisioned,\" Clinton's sign-off tweet read, \"but I know what I'm still fighting for: a kinder, big-hearted, inclusive America. Onward!\"",

            "article_content": "White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer dealt with foreign policy blowback\u00a0Friday, over the Trump administration\u2019s decision not to call for Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad to step down. \u201cThere is a political reality that we have to accept in terms of where we are right now,\u201d Spicer said at his briefing Friday. \u201cWe lost a lot of opportunity the last administration, with respect to Assad.\u201d He then reiterated comments made Thursday by U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson that suggested that their comments \u201creflect the reality that it\u2019s now up to the Syrian people.\u201d Spicer went on to say the U.S. must now focus \u201con defeating ISIS.\u201d\u00a0 Lawmakers on Capitol Hill were furious that Tillerson and Haley both said regime change is not U.S. policy, and that Syrians would decide Assad\u2019s fate. Their phrasing was strikingly similar to the lines used by the Russians and the Iranians. \u201cI think the status and the longer-term status of President Assad will be decided by the Syrian people,\u201d Tillerson said during a trip to Turkey Thursday. The secretary of State was not supposed to walk out and announce what appeared to be a Syria policy -- because the White House is still forming one. In short, he accidentally made news. U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley echoed the sentiment Thursday.\u00a0 \u201cYou pick and choose your battles and when we\u2019re looking at this, it\u2019s about changing up priorities and our priority is no longer to sit there and focus on getting Assad out,\u201d Haley told a small group of reporters,\u00a0Reuters\u00a0reported. Sen.\u00a0John McCain, R-Ariz., blasted them both\u00a0in a statement by saying this \u201coverlooks the tragic reality that the Syrian people cannot decide the fate of Assad or the future of their country when they are being slaughtered by Assad\u2019s barrel bombs, Putin\u2019s aircraft, and Iran\u2019s terrorist proxies. U.S. policy must reflect such basic facts.\u201d\u00a0 However, what Tillerson did articulate is the same policy that Obama adopted at the end of his term. That is, to put ISIS first, and let Assad stay for the foreseeable future. In fact, then-Secretary of State John Kerry was working with the Russians to include Assad in an election and to have him stay in power for an indeterminate period of time. In short, no Western power, and certainly no U.S. president, has made taking Assad out of power a priority despite any public hand-wringing about the Syrian president\u2019s industrial-scale killing, starvation, and war crimes against his own people. It\u2019s a lot of talk with no plan of action. The Trump administration is not considering changing that and is already walking back the president\u2019s previous calls for safe zones to protect Syrian civilians and contain refugee flows. Instead, the White House is now calling them \u201cinterim de-escalation areas,\u201d an idea which hasn\u2019t been fleshed out yet but are essentially expected to be areas where there are de facto ceasefires along the border with Jordan and Turkey, and hopefully in Idlib province, so that the coalition can focus on fighting al Qaeda linked terrorists there. As for the reports of chemical attacks by the Assad regime on rebels and civilians in the Hama province Thursday, multiple sources tell CBS News that the U.S. is still trying to determine the type of gas used. The White House said it\u2019s \u201clooking into the issue\u201d and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has been informed.\u00a0 The Trump administration has not announced a policy on use of chlorine gas and other weaponized chemicals. For now, it seems to mirror the Obama administration\u2019s position. Unless the gas used was on the list of chemicals explicitly banned under the U.S.-Russia brokered deal, there is no consequence other than public condemnation.

            "article_content": "BRUSSELS -- U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned NATO allies Friday to boost defense spending or come up with plans to reach the alliance\u2019s budget guidelines within two months. Tillerson, in his first talks with NATO counterparts in Brussels, said that Washington is spending a \u201cdisproportionate share\u201d on defense compared with its 27 partners, and that he expects action by the time President Donald Trump meets with other alliance leaders on May 25. NATO leaders pledged in 2014 to halt defense spending cuts and move toward a guideline target of 2 percent of gross domestic product within a decade. Only four other nations currently meet the target: Britain, Estonia, Greece and Poland. \u201cOur goal should be to agree at the May leaders meeting that by the end of the year all allies will have either met the pledge guidelines or will have developed plans that clearly articulate how, with annual milestone progress commitments, the pledge will be fulfilled,\u201d Tillerson told the ministers. Tillerson did not say what would happen if European allies and Canada fail to respect their pledges.\u00a0 Asked by CBS News\u2019 Elizabeth Palmer after the meetings whether there was any indication how NATO could get all 27 other member nations to meet their 2 percent obligation under the 2014 agreement, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said all members \u201cagree that we have to implement the decision\u2026 and this is not only in words but also in deeds. Allies have started to increase defence spending in one year, 10 billion in 2016. That is a significant step in the right direction.\u201d \u201cWe are working on the plans,\u201d Stoltenberg said. \u201cIt is too early to say how they will be designed and we haven\u2019t made any final decisions on them.\u201d During election campaigning, Mr. Trump suggested that he might not come to the defense of those allies who do not do their fair share, rocking allies near an increasingly aggressive Russia, such as Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Tillerson sought to calm any fears, saying Friday that \u201cwe understand that a threat against one of us is a threat against all of us, and we will respond accordingly. We will uphold the agreements we have made to defend our allies. The United States is by far NATO\u2019s most powerful ally. It spends more on defense than all the others combined; 3.61 percent of GDP in 2016, according to NATO estimates, although U.S. spending, too, has tapered off in recent years. Germany spent 1.19 percent of its overall budget on defense last year. But German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said it would be \u201cunrealistic\u201d for his country to hike spending from 35 billion euros ($37 billion) a year to over 70 billion euros, which would see Berlin allocate more to defense than Russia currently. \u201cI don\u2019t know a politician in Germany who believes that this would be achievable or even desirable,\u201d Gabriel said. He said security is also about crisis prevention, not just combat, and noted that Germany spends a lot of money on refugees who arrive because military interventions have failed. Seven countries - including Canada, Italy and Spain - would have to virtually double their spending to reach the target. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said that beyond money, \u201cit\u2019s also really important to look at capabilities and what countries are actually doing.\u201d \u201cWe really feel that we\u2019re doing our share,\u201d she said, highlighting Canada\u2019s troop deployment to Latvia to help deter Russian aggression. Tillerson also urged NATO to do more to fight the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and other extremists, notably by countering ISIS online messaging and propaganda. NATO has fought insurgents in Afghanistan, and is training Iraqi officers so that local forces can make a strong stand against extremists. There is no appetite to deploy troops in counter-terrorism operations. Allies believe that the international coalition against IS should be leading combat operations, not NATO. Stoltenberg said the lesson learned from operations in Afghanistan, but also in Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina, is that \u201cin the long run it is much better to fight terrorism and project stability by training local forces, building local security institutions, instead of NATO deploying a large number of combat troops.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW YORK - The Trump family is launching a new hotel chain in a bold expansion of a company that critics say is already too big and opaque for an enterprise whose owner sits in the Oval Office. The chain, called Scion, will feature the first Trump-run hotels not to bear the family\u2019s gilded name. The hotels will feature modern, sleek interiors and communal areas, and offer rooms at $200 to $300 a night, about half what it costs at some hotels in Trump\u2019s luxury chain. And they\u2019ll be dozens of them, possibly a hundred, opening across the country in just three years. Or at least that\u2019s the plan. \u201cIt\u2019s full steam ahead. It\u2019s in our DNA. It\u2019s in the Trump boys\u2019 DNA,\u201d said Trump Hotels CEO Eric Danziger. The \u201cboys\u201d are Eric and Donald Jr., who are running their father\u2019s company while he is president. The bold expansion plan raises some thorny ethical questions. The Trump family won\u2019t be putting up any money to build the hotels. Instead, their company, the Trump Organization, plans to get local real estate developers and their investors to foot the bill, as do most major hotel chains. One of the first going up could be in Dallas. A development company there originally planned to raise money from unnamed investors in Kazakhstan, Turkey and Qatar, but recently told the Dallas Morning News that it now will tap only the company\u2019s U.S. partners. ETHICS CONCERNS Government ethics experts say turning to outside money, whether foreign or American, raises the specter of people trying to use their investment to gain favor with the new administration - like contributing to a political campaign, but with no dollar limits or public disclosure. \u201cThis is the new version of pay-to-play, \u2018Get in there and do business with the Trump Organization,\u2019\u201d said Richard Painter, who was the chief White House ethics lawyer to President George W. Bush. The Trump family will have to overcome some political obstacles, too. Already, politicians in a few cities mentioned as possible sites have vowed to fight the first family, raising the prospect of a struggle to get zoning and other permits to start building. The son of German and Polish refugees from World War II, CEO Danziger is no stranger to long odds. He never went to college, instead taking a job as a bellman at a San Francisco hotel at 17. He worked himself up over the decades to CEO spots at several major hospitality companies. When Danziger led Starwood Hotels and Resorts in the 1990s, he expanded the number of hotels from 20 to nearly 600. The 62-year-old executive has similar ambitions for the Trump family. He said he hopes to open 50 to 100 Scions in three years, and already has letters of intent with more than 20 developers, the last three signed in just one week earlier this month. He said he also is planning to add to Trump\u2019s existing line of luxury hotels. Danziger took over Trump\u2019s hotel business in August 2015 with hopes of adding to the company\u2019s string of properties abroad. A review of trademark databases by The Associated Press shows the Trump family has applied for rights to use the Scion name in several countries, including China, Indonesia, Canada and 28 nations in Europe. An application for trademark rights in the Dominican Republic was approved as late as December. Then President Trump held a news conference the next month and basically killed the international plans. A week before he took office, he pledged that his company would strike \u201cno new foreign deals\u201d while he was president to allay concerns that foreigners might try to influence U.S. policy by helping his business abroad. PROJECTS GET NEW LIFE Critics note that hasn\u2019t stopped his company from expanding one of its Scottish resorts, pursuing two Indonesian projects that are largely unbuilt and looking to revive an old deal for a beachfront Dominican Republic resort that appeared dead years ago. The company has said these were already in the works, so they don\u2019t fall under the president\u2019s pledge. At a panel discussion at a recent hotel industry conference, Danziger said the U.S. offers plenty of opportunity for expansion. As possible cities for new hotels, he mentioned Seattle, San Francisco, Denver and Dallas. That didn\u2019t go down well with some local power brokers. Mark Farrell, a San Francisco supervisor who heads the land use committee, scoffed at the idea of a Trump hotel getting permission to build in his city, telling a CBS affiliate \u201cGood luck with that.\u201d In Seattle, councilmember Rob Johnson told the AP he\u2019d be \u201cshocked\u201d if any Trump hotels got built, calling his city \u201cground zero\u201d for Trump resisters. In January, thousands took to the streets there to protest the president\u2019s first attempt at a travel ban and the city council passed a unanimous resolution denouncing it. St. Louis, another possible Scion target, may prove a tough sell, too. A few days after the presidential election, protesters marched in front of a building that had been rumored as the site of a new Trump hotel as they chanted \u201cNo to Trump Tower.\u201d The developer of the St. Louis project, Alterra Worldwide, is also the company behind the possible Scion hotel in Dallas. It announced soon after the St. Louis protest that it would use the building there to open a hotel under the Marriott name. Despite the St. Louis trouble, Alterra President Mukemmel \u201cMike\u201d Sarimsakci said, he expects no trouble with his Dallas project. For starters, he appears to have much of the local approval needed to move forward. Both Sarimsakci and a Dallas city hall spokeswoman said Alterra is not seeking rezoning or tax incentives, which will avoid any need for a vote of the city council to approve the hotel. Sarimsakci doesn\u2019t think anti-Trump sentiment will hurt the Scion chain. \u201cI think it\u2019s passed. I think people had really strong feelings prior to the election,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see that as being an issue moving forward.\u201d Sarimsakci spoke to the AP last month. He did not respond to requests to confirm that he no longer plans to use foreign investors. THE LURE OF TAX REVENUE, JOBS Danziger also shrugs off the danger from anti-Trump folks. Stopping a Scion from opening would hurt a city, he said, just as surely as it would hurt the Trumps. \u201cWhy would a city because of political views, a city councilman\u2019s views, prohibit tax revenue from coming to the city and employment to the people?\u201d Danziger said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d He also expressed confidence Scion will avoid ethical trouble. He said any new investors in Scion go through an \u201cexhaustive, thorough\u201d review to make sure, for instance, they\u2019re not offering sweetheart deals to the Trump family to curry favor with the president. Before Trump took office, he hired an outside lawyer to vet his deals for conflicts. Critics say his company shouldn\u2019t be striking any new deals at all and that he should follow the precedent of modern presidents by selling his interest in the company. He has refused to do so. Politics aside, Trump\u2019s new chain faces stiff business challenges. The U.S. president is a tiny hotel operator, with just 14 properties that he either owns or licenses his name to or manages for others, according to his company\u2019s website. This puts it at a disadvantage compared with, say, Marriott International, which has more than 6,000 hotels and can get deeper discounts when purchasing insurance and food and linens. The bigger companies have powerful loyalty programs to lure travelers, too. \u201cWhy do people stay at Marriotts all the time?\u201d said Bjorn Hanson, professor of hospitality and tourism management at New York University. \u201cThey\u2019re earning points.\u201d Trump\u2019s Scion chain also faces a fight for customers against an array of new chic \u201clifestyle\u201d chains from Marriott, Hilton and other rivals. Furniture retailers West Elm and Restoration Hardware are opening hotels to appeal to young travelers. Even the gym chain Equinox recently announced plans to enter the crowded field. Danziger said he\u2019s not worried. \u201cEvery industry on the planet is crowded.\u201d He won\u2019t name the developers with whom he has letters of intent, or where they hope to build, noting that they\u2019re tentative deals that could easily fall though. Pressed, though, he rattled off a long series of cities seemingly at random, including Cincinnati, Milwaukee and Louisville, Kentucky. \u201cThe list of places Scion can go,\u201d he said, \u201cis virtually limitless.\u201d",

Being the US Attorney in SDNY will forever be the greatest honor of my professional life.\u201d Bharara\u2019s departure comes as Attorney General Jeff Sessions looks to secure the resignations of 46 U.S. Attorneys who were holdovers from the Obama administration.\u00a0 President Trump\u2019s\u00a0revised travel ban\u00a0goes into effect Thursday. It bars new visas for people from six predominantly Muslim countries and temporarily shuts down the U.S. refugee program.\u00a0 Just like the\u00a0original travel ban, version 2.0 is facing legal challenges. Vice President Mike Pence is visiting Louisville to talk about the Republican health care plan. The U.S. Secret Service confirms an intruder breached the White House perimeter Friday night. According to the Secret Service, \u201can individual scaled the outer perimeter fence by the Treasury Building and East Executive Avenue.\u201d Uniformed Secret Service officers arrested the individual, and the individual\u2019s backpack was screened and \u201cfound to be free of any hazardous materials.\u201d Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly has been briefed on the matter. The Trump Administration is planning a meeting this coming week with Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, CBS News has learned. Salman is a powerful force within the royal family, second in line to the throne, and currently serves as defense minister. The White House has not yet announced the visit, as it is still confirming details. The visit comes as the U.S. expands its military mission against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in Yemen, a country on the brink of widespread famine and torn apart by civil war\u00a0involving Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. The U.S. has been providing support and precision training to a Saudi-led military coalition fighting those rebels.\u00a0 The president used the bully pulpit this week to promote what is the first major piece of legislation of his administration - reforming Obamacare. This comes while his administation is still trying to field lingering questions about links between Mr. Trump\u2019s associates and foreign entities, CBS News correspondent Errol Barnett reports. The president is at the White House. \u201c\u201917 would be a disaster for Obamacare, that\u2019s the year it was meant to explode, because Obama won\u2019t be here,\u201d Trump claimed, according to the network pool, in a meeting with conservative leaders. \u201cThat was when it was supposed to be [inaudible]. As bad as it is now, it will get even worse.\u201d \u00a0 The House Budget Committee\u00a0will be the third congressional panel to mark up the legislation\u00a0proposed by House Republicans to repeal and replace Obamacare. The committee is expected to take up the measure next Wednesday, following the\u00a0 two markups this week by the House Ways and Means Committee and House Energy and Commerce Committee, which\u00a0advanced the bill. Civil liberties and human rights groups are urging Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly not to require people applying for U.S. visas\u00a0to provide log-in information to their social media accounts. \u201cWe urge you to reject any proposal to require anyone to provide log-in information to their online accounts as a condition of entry into the United States. Demanding log-in information is a direct assault on fundamental rights and would weaken, rather than promote, national security,\u201d the groups wrote\u00a0in a letter to Kelly\u00a0on Friday. Rep. John Shimkus, R-Illinois, suggested during a markup of the GOP Obamacare replacement bill Thursday that men don\u2019t like the current health care law\u00a0because they have to pay for prenatal care. During the House Energy and Commerce Committee markup, Rep. Michael Doyle, D-Pennsylvania, asked Shimkus what\u00a0 mandate in Obamacare he took issue with. \u201cCertainly not with pre-existing conditions, or caps on benefits or letting your child stay on the policy until 26, so I\u2019m curious what is it we\u2019re mandating?\u201d Doyle said. \u201cWhat about men having to purchase prenatal care? Is that not correct? And should they?\u201d Shimkus said. Most election forecasters found themselves in a social media buzzsaw the day after Donald\u00a0Trump stunned the country\u00a0with his triumph over Hillary Clinton. Major political oddsmakers had predicted a Clinton win, and famed numbers savant\u00a0Nate Silver announced\u00a0the day before the election, \u201cClinton is a 71 percent favorite to win the election.\u201d He wasn\u2019t alone, though, and since then, analysts, academics and number crunchers have been trying to figure out why they were wrong. \u201cFreakonomics\u201d\u00a0co-founder Stephen Dubner brings a different lens to the argument, though, suggesting in this week\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Takeout\u201d podcast that we may all just be looking at this the wrong way.\u00a0 Watch \u201cThe Takeout\u201d with Major Garrett and Steve Chaggaris on CBSN -- Fridays at 9 p.m. -- or on the CBS News app on iPhones and Android devices, as well as Apple TV, Amazon Fire, Roku, Playstation, Xbox and Chromecast.

            "article_content": "Former Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear took a populist tenor in Democrats\u2019 formal response to President Donald Trump\u2019s speech to Congress on Tuesday, accusing him of planning to \u201crip affordable health insurance\u201d from Americans and being \u201cWall Street\u2019s champion.\u201d He addressed President Trump directly in his address at one point, reminding him, \u201cMr. President, as a candidate, you promised to be a champion for people struggling to make ends meet \u2026 and I hope you live up to that promise.\u201d Beshear went on to note, though, that \u201cone of your first executive orders makes it harder for those families to afford a mortgage.\u201d On Mr. Trump\u2019s first day in office, he signed an order that rolled back a discount on the fees for a federal mortgage program that helps middle-class homebuyers.\u00a0 Beshear also criticized Trump\u2019s verbal assaults on \u201cthe loyalty and credibility\u201d of intelligence agencies, federal courts, the press and others. By such attacks, Beshear said in excerpts of his prepared remarks, Trump is \u201ceroding our democracy. And that\u2019s reckless.\u201d Beshear\u2019s words and tone seemed a direct Democratic attempt to recapture the loyalties of some working-class voters who helped power Trump\u2019s election upset last November. His very selection by Democratic party chiefs to deliver their response seemed aimed at the same goal, since the 72-year-old is best known for expanding health care coverage in his deep red state under former President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law. Trump used his first address to Congress as president to urge lawmakers to revamp the nation\u2019s health care system, embracing tax credits, health savings accounts and other elements of a plan being pushed by House GOP leaders. While erasing Obama\u2019s 2010 overhaul and replacing it is a long-time Republican goal, conservatives have rebelled against the developing GOP package and other internal disputes still simmer, though leaders say they will push ahead with legislation in March. Beshear said emerging GOP plans would reduce health care coverage after 20 million Americans gained coverage under Obama\u2019s law. \u201cYou and your Republican allies in Congress seem determined to rip affordable health insurance away from millions of Americans who most need it,\u201d Beshear said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a game, it\u2019s life and death for people,\u201d Beshear said. He said those relying on Obama\u2019s statute for coverage \u201caren\u2019t aliens from a distant planet. They\u2019re our friends and neighbors.\u201d The backdrop for Trump\u2019s speech was an initial five weeks in office that have seen persistent questions about his campaign\u2019s relationship with Russia, a mishandled order barring refugees and the firing of his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn. There have been massive demonstrations against Trump\u2019s policies in cities around the country, and GOP lawmakers have been greeted at town hall meetings by activists angry at his attempt to erase Obama\u2019s health care statute. Trump\u2019s popularity in public opinion polls has set record lows for new presidents. Emboldened by the energy of their party\u2019s voters, Democratic lawmakers were flashing their own brands of rebelliousness. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., was boycotting Trump\u2019s speech, and Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., was ending his near three-decade streak of snagging an aisle seat to clasp the president\u2019s hand as he enters the House chamber for his speech. The visitors\u2019 galleries were stuffed with immigrants and recipients of health benefits under Obama\u2019s law invited by congressional Democrats, and numerous female Democratic lawmakers were wearing white as a symbol of support for women\u2019s suffrage. Beshear said that while Trump campaigned as \u201ca champion for people struggling to make ends meet,\u201d he\u2019s taken executive action as president to roll back consumer protections against giant financial institutions and has stocked his Cabinet with wealthy financial executives. \u201cThat\u2019s not being our champion. That\u2019s being Wall Street\u2019s champion,\u201d Beshear said. Giving the Democrats\u2019 response in Spanish was Astrid Silva, a so-called Dreamer brought to the U.S. illegally as a 4-year-old. In her prepared comments, Silva, now 28, said Trump is \u201ctaking us back to some of the darkest times in our history.\u201d She said Trump is \u201ccriminalizing anyone who is different, pitting us against each other, and sending the wrong message to the rest of the world, helping to breed anger and hate from terrorist groups to our country.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Kellyanne Conway played a crucial role in Donald Trump\u2019s election to the presidency.  And she continues to have a high-profile job in his White House (with the occasional day off). Norah O\u2019Donnell of \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d has a Sunday Profile:\u00a0 Last Sunday, Kellyanne Conway wasn\u2019t defending her boss, President Donald J. Trump, on TV. She was at church, attending mass with her husband, attorney George T. Conway, and their four children, along with some friends. Breakfast at a diner came next, followed by some quality family time at their northern New Jersey home -- a brief return to what life used to be like.  But these days, her Sunday routine is far from normal. The new normal includes full Secret Service protection.  \u201cWhy? Have there been threats?\u201d asked O\u2019Donnell.  \u201cYes,\u201d Conway replied. \u201cI have 24/7 Secret Service protection.\u201d \u201cMost White House staffers do not.\u201d \u201cDo not. I find that to be very unfortunate, and obviously if they didn\u2019t need to be there, they wouldn\u2019t be.\u201d But they do need to be here. The unusual round-the-clock protection was granted to guard President\u2019s Trump\u2019s high-profile, highly controversial White House counselor. O\u2019Donnell said, \u201cYou were going to stay on the outside and make a lot of money. Why did you go inside the White House?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a great question, Norah. Every time I see people say, \u2018She sold her soul,\u2019 I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Wow.\u2019 I was making in one and a half speeches -- a couple hours out of my life -- what I will make this year in the White House as counselor to the president.\u201d Of course, before she counseled President Trump, the 50-year-old attorney and businesswoman, who founded her own polling company, became the first woman to manage and win a presidential race. And it\u2019s because she\u2019s a woman, says Conway, that she finds herself a constant target.  Take wearing that Revolutionary-style coat at the inauguration\u00a0(left). She responded to critics by tweeting: \u201cSorry to offend the black-stretch-pants women of America with a little color.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s agree that it was silly to focus on your outfit, that\u2019s fine,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cBut who are the \u2018black stretch pants women\u2019? I\u2019m actually honestly asking, \u2018cause I don\u2019t know what the answer is!\u201d \u201cGoodness, I mean, walk through an airport, look at a lot of America today. They don\u2019t wear anything that snaps, buttons or zippers. And that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s their business. But why criticize what I wear?\u201d  Fast forward to this past Monday, when she was photographed kneeling on a couch in the Oval Office. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly going back to where I sat, the presumptive negativity of what I wore or what I said, and I do think it\u2019s a triple-standard, I hate to tell you,\u201d Conway said.  \u201cAnd what does that mean, a \u2018triple-standard\u2019?\u201d \u201cWell, people talk about the double-standard of what a woman wears, not what she said or what she was doing X, Y and Z. The triple standard is that, you know, conservative women are held to -- you know, are just cast aside many times by traditional feminist outlets and individuals who control a great deal of the media. \u201cI mean, I can\u2019t let the haters get to me or to the president. What he\u2019s doing here is so big.\u201d Then again, for some, it\u2019s not what she\u2019s wearing, or doing; it\u2019s about what she has said. \u201cI bet it\u2019s brand new information to people that President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized, and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green Massacre.\u201d As is now well known, there was never a Bowling Green Massacre. She called it an honest mistake. But there was also this remark on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d about the size of the crowd on Inauguration Day: \u201cYou\u2019re saying it\u2019s a falsehood. And they\u2019re giving -- Sean Spicer, our press secretary -- gave alternative facts to that.\u201d [To which Chuck Todd replied, \u201cLook, alternative facts are not facts; they\u2019re falsehoods.\u201d] O\u2019Donnell asked, \u201cDid you take a credibility hit because of what happened with that, what happened with the Bowling Green Massacre, and what happened when you talked about alternative facts? Did that hurt your credibility?\u201d \u201cWell, I think the question presumes that it did,\u201d she responded. \u201cAnd so, now you\u2019ve got that out in the ether and the one or two -- \u201c \u201cActually, you can say no. I didn\u2019t presume anything.\u201d \u201cNo. What people should do, what I\u2019ve always done with others, is look at the measure of someone\u2019s career. I\u2019ve been a pollster for two decades plus. And I\u2019ve worked very hard to speak candidly and truthfully.\u201d \u201cWhat are \u2018alternative facts\u2019?\u201d \u201cWell, it was \u2018alternative investment and additional facts.\u2019 And that got conflated. But, you know, respectfully, Norah, I see mistakes on TV every single day and people just brush them off. Everybody thinks it\u2019s just so funny that the wrong movie was, you know, heralded as the winner of the Oscars. You say, \u2018Well, that\u2019s just all in good fun, things happen.\u2019 Well, things happen to everyone.\u201d\u00a0 Conway has also taken flack for promoting Ivanka Trump\u2019s fashion line while in the White House. [\u201cI\u2019m gonna give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody! You can buy it online\u201d she said on Fox News.] White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer would later say she was \u201ccounseled\u201d for that. Then this past week, the White House said Conway acted \u201cwithout nefarious motive or intent.\u201d O\u2019Donnell asked, \u201cDid you feel bad about what happened?\u201d \u201cI always feel badly because I\u2019m, you know, Catholic guilt, mother guilt, maternal guilt, counselor guilt,\u201d Conway laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s all there, of course. Of course I felt badly about what happened because I am here to serve the president, who\u2019s here to serve the people.\u201d And she does it from one of the most coveted offices in the West Wing, once occupied by Valerie Jarrett, Karl Rove and former first lady Hillary Clinton. The jacket is hanging up there. \u201cIt may go into my own private museum one day, along with the screen shot of my cellphone, 2:30 a.m. on election night, from Huma Abedin, who was calling on behalf of Secretary Clinton to call and concede to and congratulate Donald Trump on his victory.\u201d O\u2019Donnell visited Conway\u2019s office last Wednesday, the morning after President Trump\u2019s address to Congress, one that seemed to mark a departure from the fiery stump style Americans have grown accustomed to. Was the speech a reset button? \u201cNo. I think the reset button is way overdone,\u201d Conway said. \u201cI mean, this is a progression. The man has been on the job for five weeks.\u201d \u201cWhat went into this speech that changed the way he\u2019s communicating?\u201d O\u2019Donnell asked. \u201cWell, first of all, I was part of the process. Others did the bulk of the work. But I will tell you that it is President Trump who was writing and rewriting entire passages. And he really wanted it to be in his voice. And he works with, predominantly, a brilliant speechwriter, Stephen Miller, who is able to really reflect the president\u2019s tone and content. And then I think you heard much of Ivanka Trump\u2019s voice in that speech.\u201d Conway says her job includes press and communications. And she sees herself as a conduit -- a person who delivers advice and data to the president. She arrives in the morning at 7:30. The time at which she leaves varies. \u201cNot early,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, it really varies. Usually not before 8:00, 9:00.\u00a0 \u201cBut I have a very hermit-like existence here, and part of it is because of the Secret Service detail, part of it is because if I want to go out with a friend for dinner it\u2019s photographed and it\u2019s talked about and it\u2019s, \u2018What did she eat? What did she do? What was she wearing?\u2019 And it\u2019s kind of weird. I mean, I\u2019m not a celebrity. I\u2019m just a pollster who happened to become a campaign manager. And I\u2019ve been trying to keep a much lower profile here.\u201d Which is why, she tells us, we\u2019re seeing less of her these days. She says she\u2019s trying to cut back on screen time. She says, \u201cPeople should not look at me as somebody who \u2018goes on TV.\u2019 That was five percent of what I did. Somebody once wrote a very flattering article and said -- they had to put one negative thing in there, I guess -- \u2018You know, maybe she\u2019s not that involved in everything because she\u2019s on TV.\u2019 It\u2019s like, \u2018No, I\u2019m on TV when they\u2019re all still sleeping or watching me from bed.\u2019 I\u2019m already there. Been up for two hours doing that. Oh, and I\u2019m there late at night.\u201d That may be just as well, because late-night hasn\u2019t been kind to Conway. Not long ago, \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d depicted her as a stalker: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cLook, people really got outraged about that particular skit,\u201d Conway said. \u201cI had people right, left and center coming to my \u2018defense,\u2019 saying it was over the top and it\u2019s all so -- but it\u2019s also untrue.\u201d So who is Kellyanne Conway? She was raised in a blue-collar New Jersey town. Her parents divorced when she was young.  \u201cI grew up in a house of all women. My mother, her mother and two of my mother\u2019s unmarried sisters raised me. So these four Italian Catholic women raised me in this house. And that has benefited me tremendously, because there\u2019s a certain humility that will never go away.\u201d And while President Trump uses social media as an important tool to communicate, and sometimes attack, Conway tells us she considers it a cesspool, in part because of what her children see on it. \u201cBecause it hurts my kids more than anything,\u201d she said. \u201cThey all read. They\u2019re all online reading.\u201d \u201cWhat do your kids say?\u201d \u201c\u2019Mom, why would people say X about you or Y about you or Z about you?\u2019 I say, \u2018Well, that\u2019s their unconsidered opinion. They don\u2019t want Donald Trump to be president. They don\u2019t want me to be there with him. They don\u2019t want any of us to be there.\u2019 I mean, we\u2019re all criticized and they try to pit us against each other, which is completely ridiculous. \u201cBut I tell them, \u2018Say a prayer for those people,\u2019 because something\u2019s got to really bother you that you feel so bent on criticizing someone you hardly know for doing a job that you can\u2019t begin to understand.\u201d Her husband, George Conway, who may also join the Trump administration as the nation\u2019s next Solicitor General, is much more camera-shy.  O\u2019Donnell asked, \u201cAnd what do you think of watching Kellyanne through this whole thing?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s a fighter,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s tough. I, you know, don\u2019t like everything that\u2019s been said about her, to be sure. It makes me a little angry. But it\u2019s part of the fact that she\u2019s out there for the president and they\u2019re going to attack her. They\u2019re going to attack whoever they see standing up for the president.\u201d O\u2019Donnell asked Kellyanne, \u201cYou talk so passionately about public service and the role that you\u2019re crafting in the White House. I mean, that naturally evolves in something -- wanting to run yourself for office.\u201d \u201cBut I feel like I\u2019m in a really good place, Norah, as counselor to the president, to have the type of impact that usually motivates people to run for office. It\u2019s not just the fire in your belly anymore; you have to have the bile in your throat. And this is why I think many women do not run for office. Many good men and women who would -- \u201c \u201c \u2018Bile in your throat\u2019?\u201d \u201cYeah, just to swallow so much, that the country looks at you through this negative lens and corruption and cronyism and you\u2019re lying and you want money and you\u2019re motivated by power and capital and, you know, the money that can come to you, the wealth that can come to you. And it\u2019s just, there are really good men and women out there who truly want to serve. I\u2019ve worked with them in my polling business for decades. And some of them make it and most do not.\u201d For now, the Conways will soon be packing up and heading to Washington. Although not everyone is thrilled about it. Her children joked about signing a petition: \u201cYeah, to not let any of our family move.\u201d \u201cGo sign the petition.\u201d \u201cStop the Conways!\u201d \u201cHashtag stop the move!\u201d Respected by some, denounced by others, Kellyanne Conway says there\u2019s only one thing that could make her rethink her future alongside the man she helped make president.\u00a0 O\u2019Donnell asked, \u201cIs there anything that would cause you to want to leave the White House?\u201d \u201cYes, my children,\u201d she replied. \u201cThey\u2019re having the hardest time with this. This is all new for us. This is not something I\u2019ve sought. I\u2019m not a famous person on TV. It\u2019s just different to not have mom there, but it was a decision we made as a family, and we\u2019re going to move them here either way, because I\u2019m here to support the president.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0For more info:\u00a0",

AP: The government filed a brief notice Friday saying that it would appeal the Maryland ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit. The ruling in Maryland and another in Hawaii earlier this week were victories for civil liberties groups and advocates for immigrants and refugees. They argued that a temporary ban on travel from six predominantly Muslim countries violated the First Amendment. The Trump administration argued the ban was intended to protect the United States from terrorism. A senior Republican Congressman says that former President Obama deserves an apology over President Trump\u2019s unproven allegation that Trump Tower was wiretapped during the 2016 campaign. \u00a0 \u201cFrankly unless you can produce some pretty compelling proof, President Obama is owed an apology,\u201d Rep.

The fate of the\u00a0Republican health care bill\u00a0in the House could well be determined by lawmakers like Rep. Mark Meadows, the congressman from North Carolina who chairs the Freedom Caucus. That\u2019s the group of around 30 of the most conservative congressmen in the House. For now, the caucus hasn\u2019t taken an official position on the American Healthcare Act, but many of the members have made no secret of their opposition to the GOP\u2019s bill, including Meadows.\u00a0 Meadows wants some big changes to the bill put forward by Speaker Paul Ryan and supported by President Trump, he told CBS News\u2019 Chief White House Correspondent Major Garrett in the latest episode of \u201cThe Takeout\u201d podcast. But he also said that he\u2019s willing to compromise, in the interest of moving forward on an ambitious Republican agenda. House Republicans are in a hurry to get this plan passed. \u201cThe pressure cooker is huge.

President Trump will roll out his first budget blueprint Thursday morning that would\u00a0increase defense spending by 10 percent, funding for Homeland Security programs by 6 percent\u00a0and dramatically slash funding to both the State Department and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\u00a0 The proposal, which will go public at 7:00 a.m. ET, will cover both the current fiscal year as well as fiscal 2018, which begins Oct. 1. It does not have the force of law, and is only used as a guideline for congressional appropriators who have the power of the purse. The leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee said on Thursday that they had seen \u201cno indications\u201d that Trump Tower was wiretapped by the United States government during the 2016 campaign as\u00a0claimed by President Trump. \u201cBased on the information available to us, we see no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance by any element of the United States government either before or after Election Day 2016,\u201d said Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., and ranking member Mark Warner, D-Va., in a short joint statement. House Republicans unveiled their\u00a0long-awaited plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act\u00a0earlier this month, and like any plan that would affect roughly one-sixth of the American economy, it contained a lot to digest. Adding to the complexity is the fact that the House bill will almost surely be significantly adjusted by the time it reaches President Trump\u2019s desk -- if it gets to his desk. Republican moderates and conservatives in the House are\u00a0already demanding major changes, some of which seem mutually exclusive, and that\u2019s before the bill even hits the Senate, where a number of key lawmakers have floated their own versions.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are arguably the two most influential leaders in the Western world. They\u2019re also two of the most different -- both in temperament and in their views on a whole host of issues. Friday\u2019s meeting between Mr. Trump and Merkel -- originally scheduled for Tuesday, but postponed because of D.C. weather -- will be watched closely on both sides of the Atlantic, particularly amid concerns that the new president\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d rhetoric will reshape the longstanding close relationship between the United States and Germany. \u201cWe\u2019re still in the phase of trying to figure out how the new administration is going to work in terms of the conflicting messages coming out of the different power centers in the White House and the different agencies,\u201d said Sudha David-Wilp, a senior transatlantic fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin. \u201cSo I think it will certainly be helpful for Chancellor Merkel to hear it from the man at the top, about his feelings on certain transatlantic issues.\u201d The meeting will be an important chance for Mr. Trump to clarify his views on institutions like NATO and the European Union -- and also, experts say, a potential opportunity for him and Merkel to find some common ground, most likely where economic issues are concerned. \u201cI think the perception in Germany is that it\u2019s probably the most difficult and the most important meeting for Merkel in her long career, this meeting with Trump, because it\u2019s so crucial for Germany,\u201d said Jan Philipp Burgard, a political scientist and journalist for the German TV network ARD who has covered politics in the U.S. and Germany. The importance of the meeting is complicated by the fact that the two politicians\u2019 relationship thus far hasn\u2019t been exactly chummy. Mr. Trump has long been critical of Merkel, particularly as it relates to her policy on refugees: during the campaign, he disparagingly referred to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Angela Merkel,\u201d and once suggested Germans \u201care going to end up overthrowing this woman\u201d over her refugee policy. And back in late 2015, when Merkel was named Time Magazine\u2019s \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d over Mr. Trump, he tweeted his frustration by suggesting that Merkel was \u201cruining Germany.\u201d  Merkel, for her part, avoided reacting to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign-trail criticism -- and to any of his social media postings since he took office in January. As a rule, Merkel doesn\u2019t react to the written statements of other foreign leaders, a strategy that has served her well with such a Twitter-inclined president in Washington. \u201cI believe that direct, one-on-one conversations are always much better than talking about each other,\u201d she said in Munich on Monday. \u201cTalking together instead about each other: that\u2019ll be my slogan for this visit, which I\u2019m really looking forward to.\u201d Still, she\u2019s made several pointed comments that express, below the surface, her disapproval of Mr. Trump\u2019s words and actions. After his election in November, Merkel released a statement noting that Germany and the U.S. are \u201cbound by common values -- democracy, freedom, as well as the respect for the rule of law and the dignity of each and every person, regardless of their origin, skin color, creed, gender, sexual orientation, or political views.\u201d She said she offered cooperation to Mr. Trump \u201cbased on these values.\u201d And when Mr. Trump announced his travel ban back in January, she was critical of the policy. At the time, Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert said the German leader is \u201cconvinced that even the necessary, resolute fight against terrorism doesn\u2019t justify putting people of a particular origin or particular faith under general suspicion.\u201d Observers on both sides of the Atlantic say this visit is a good precursor for other meetings they\u2019ll have at other international summits later this year. \u201cThe purpose of this trip is to check a box that says, \u2018I know the guy, we\u2019ve met, and we have three more times we\u2019re going to meet,\u201d said Jack Janes, president of the American Institute for Contemporary Germany Studies, referring to the meetings of the G-7, the G-20 and NATO this year at which Mr. Trump and Merkel will again interact. \u201cShe wanted to make sure nobody was speculating about why she didn\u2019t go see him before these meetings occurred.\u201d As far as the two leaders\u2019 different temperaments, experts stressed that Merkel will be prepared: she\u2019s dealt with all manner of different personalities during her time leading Germany, from Russian President Vladimir Putin to former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to former French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Throughout, she\u2019s earned a reputation as a pragmatic and cautious leader. \u201cShe has a lot of experience in dealing with all kinds of different personalities as leaders over the last 12 years, and I think that is a big advantage,\u201d said Nico Lange, director of the Washington office of Konrad Adenauer Foundation, a German political foundation. \u201cHaving dealt with so many different people in different situations, negotiating in complicated situations -- I think that experience will help her.\u201d Confrontational diplomacy, Lange continued, \u201cis just not her style.\u201d Along those lines, observers hoping Merkel will deliver a pointed message to Mr. Trump -- or that she\u2019ll focus the visit on defending the liberal world order she represents -- are likely to be disappointed. In an effort to seek common ground, economic issues may be the place to find them. Traveling to Washington with Merkel are CEOs of some of the top German companies with workers in the U.S., including car-maker BMW and tech company Siemens. With Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on creating new jobs in America -- and his questions about trade imbalances with other major countries -- these CEOs will be able to discuss the size of their investments in U.S.-based jobs. Also likely to come up is Germany\u2019s apprenticeship program, which could serve as a model for similar programs in the U.S. Trade is \u201ca very big thing on the agenda for her,\u201d said Fran Burwell, vice president at the Atlantic Council.  \u201cI understand she\u2019s coming with a lot of German businesspeople, and [Trump trade adviser] Peter Navarro has said that Germany might be a currency manipulator,\u201d Burwell said. \u201cIt\u2019s true that Germany does have a large surplus with us, which has been a focus of this administration, but what she\u2019s going to do undoubtedly is talk about how many German companies invest in the United States.\u201d Merkel previewed that intended focus in Munich on Monday, talking about the importance of trade between Germany and the U.S. \u201cThe United States of America is a key trading partner for Germany and for the entire European Union,\u201d she said. \u201cTrade is advantageous for both sides and I\u2019m looking forward to the chance to speak to the newly elected American president about these issues.\u201d Emily Schultheis is a reporter/editor for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "COTTONWOOD HEIGHTS, Utah -- U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz was met by frequent, deafening boos at a Thursday town hall as constituents grilled him on everything from investigating President Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns to Planned Parenthood. A young girl asked the Republican about his plans to protect the air and water and the crowd booed when he replied that supports an all-of-the-above energy strategy, which includes mining for coal. \u201cWe have a major problem here in Salt Lake Valley, with the inversion,\u201d Chaffetz said. He told the crowd gathered at a high school in a Salt Lake City suburb that he supports solar energy, but that it can have its own negative impact on animals and wildlife. The chairman of the House Oversight Committee, who has said he voted for Mr. Trump during the 2016 presidential election, repeatedly said, \u201chold on,\u201d and \u201cgive me a second,\u201d as the audience members reacted negatively to nearly all of his statements. Hundreds of people stood outside the auditorium holding signs and chanting, \u201cVote him out,\u201d while one woman was arrested and put into handcuffs. Others repeated chants of \u201cDo your job,\u201d while some held signs that read \u201cAmerica is better than this,\u201d according to the Salt Lake Tribune. Chaffetz said earlier in the day that he hopes Mr. Trump will repeal the newly-named Bears Ears National Monument in southern Utah, something he discussed with the president during a Tuesday meeting at the White House. Chaffetz said Mr. Trump\u2019s Interior Secretary nominee, U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana, wants to see Bears Ears before making any commitments about what, if anything, the Trump administration will do. President Barack Obama named the monument in December after several years of lobbying from a coalition of Native Americans who said the protection was needed for the sacred tribal lands. Holly Cobb Robinson from Salt Lake City said the congressman\u2019s push to repeal the monument would result in more drilling and mining for coal, which would destroy the land. \u201cProtecting your public lands provides a better future for not only communities and people who are visiting, but also habitats and revenue,\u201d she said. The town hall comes as Chaffetz spends time in his home state, speaking to the state\u2019s lawmakers and visiting with Muslim leaders. The congressman spoke with Muslim leaders Wednesday in Salt Lake City, and said that Mr. Trump\u2019s ban was rushed but singled out the \u201cthe right countries.\u201d A federal appeals court ruled late Thursday evening against reinstating the president\u2019s travel ban, after the government had asked for a stay of a temporary restraining order that suspended its implementation. Muslim leaders told the congressman that people stuck in refugee camps aren\u2019t safe and that the ban caused great anxiety among Muslim-Americans. The Mormon congressman said he empathizes and if Mr. Trump imposes a \u201creligious litmus test,\u201d he\u2019ll push back. Thursday, he encouraged lawmakers - mostly fellow Mormons - to visit mosques and reach out to Muslims in their community, noting that those \u201cpeople that have been vetted.\u201d \u201cWe should know a few things about being a religious minority,\u201d he said. Utah lawmakers asked Chaffetz if he\u2019d use his role as the powerful chairman of the House Oversight Committee to investigate Mr. Trump\u2019s business interests. \u201cMy job is not to be a cheerleader for the president,\u201d Chaffetz said.",

            "article_content": "In a first statement since leaving the White House, former President Obama\u2019s office released a statement Monday responding to protests that have erupted across the country in reaction to President Trump.  \u201cPresident Obama is heartened by the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country,\u201d said Kevin Lewis, Obama\u2019s new spokesman. \u201cCitizens exercising their Constitutional right to assemble, organize and have their voices heard by their elected officials is exactly what we expect to see when American values are at stake.\u201d Lewis added that Obama \u201cfundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion.\u201d He noted that in Obama\u2019s farewell address to the nation earlier this month, he spoke about \u201cthe important role of citizen\u201d not just on Election Day, but every day.  The statement comes amid strong backlash to Mr. Trump\u2019s new policy that has blocked all travel to the U.S.\u00a0from seven predominantly Muslim countries -- Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Yemen and Libya -- for at least 90 days. It resulted in more than 100 people being detained at U.S. airports over the weekend. The policy, as part of an executive order he signed Friday, also included the suspension of the U.S. refugee program for Syrian nationals for 120 days. After Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, Obama and the rest of his family left for Palm Springs, California for vacation. The former president and former first lady, Michelle Obama, will live in Washington, D.C. until at least their younger daughter Sasha graduates from high school.\u00a0 CBS News\u2019 Arden Farhi contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "Amid roiling global tensions over a recent executive order halting the U.S. refugee program and travel from certain Muslim countries, President Trump engaged in a series of phone calls with world leaders Saturday, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\u00a0 Gathered with several members of his senior staff around his desk, the president spoke with Putin around noon Saturday, the first known phone conversation Mr. Trump has had with the Russian leader since his inauguration last week. According to a White House readout of the call, the \u201cpositive\u201d conversation lasted approximately one hour and discussed topics ranging from \u201cmutual cooperation in defeating ISIS\u201d to efforts in Syria.\u00a0 \u201cBoth President Trump and President Putin are hopeful that after today\u2019s call the two sides can move quickly to tackle terrorism and other important issues of mutual concern,\u201d the readout said.\u00a0 In a Kremlin statement, Russia also mentioned that the leaders spoke about plans to organize a summit for the two. The White House did not confirm the information in their own readout of the call.\u00a0 Vice President Mike Pence, chief of staff Reince Priebus, chief White House strategist Steve Bannon and National Security Adviser Michael Flynn were in the Oval Office during the call. Rex Tillerson, Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for secretary of state who remains unconfirmed by the Senate, was not present at the meeting. Mr. Trump previewed the talk with the Russian leader during his first joint press conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday.\u00a0 At the White House, the president said \u201cideally\u201d Russia and the U.S. would have \u201ca great relationship,\u201d but said it was still \u201ctoo early\u201d to consider lifting sanctions on the foreign power. (Former President Obama had imposed a new round of sanctions and restrictions against Russia following U.S. intelligence community findings that the country had hacked the 2016 presidential elections with the intent of propping up Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign over rival Hillary Clinton.) Mr. Trump said that he would keep an \u201copen\u201d mind about dealing with Putin, who he said he doesn\u2019t know well. The phone conversation between the two key world leaders comes just as some in Congress have called for further investigation into possible ties between Russia and members of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign staff.

            "article_content": "BERLIN -- Chancellor Angela Merkel's chances of cobbling together a government in Germany's current parliament look slim. But the long-time leader is already signaling that she will run in any new election and it appears far too early to start writing Merkel off. Merkel's trademark calm was on display hours after coalition talks collapsed. She brushed aside suggestions that she was a lame duck, telling ARD television that she was \"a woman who has responsibility and is ready to continue taking responsibility.\" Her pre-election commitment to serve another four years stands, she added. Merkel has good reasons not to be too worried about her future for now, despite recent setbacks. Germany's Sept. 24 election wasn't kind to Merkel's conservative Union bloc, whose vote tally of 32.9 percent was its worst since the first post-World War II election in 1949. But it was still easily the biggest group - far ahead of challenger Martin Schulz's center-left Social Democrats, whose disastrous 20.5-percent showing left them facing an uphill struggle to rebuild support. While hardly helpful, the result hasn't yet triggered any serious questioning of Merkel's position inside the party. After 12 years as chancellor and 17 as her Christian Democratic Union's leader, the 63-year-old still has no obvious successor who could match her broad party support and appeal to a wide public, or indeed who is prepared yet to make a move against her. \"Merkel has not suffered yet,\" because she has \"stayed true to her style of politics,\" said Manfred Guellner, the head of the Forsa polling agency. Over the years, Merkel has won widespread acceptance, though not necessarily enthusiasm, with a combination of ideological flexibility, calm decision-making and personal modesty. She has been able to overcome, or at least muddle through, sticky patches - most recently, the aftermath of her 2015 decision to allow in large numbers of asylum-seekers. While it remains unclear who will get the blame if Germans have to vote for the second time in a few months, it was the pro-business Free Democrats who walked out of coalition talks and the Social Democrats who have refused even to contemplate them. \"She is not really being called into question,\" said Thorsten Faas, a political science professor at Berlin's Free University. The poor election result in part reflected the fact that \"it was clear to voters that Merkel would remain chancellor,\" so many voted for other parties or stayed home, he added. \"The Union knows very well that switching to another person now, in this awkward situation, is not an alternative,\" Faas said. \"What can happen to her? For now, she stays in office (and) she can be comparatively relaxed about new elections.\" The only other option, assuming that other parties can't be persuaded to negotiate a coalition, would be an unprecedented minority government. Merkel says she doesn't want that. \"I don't have a minority government in my plans,\" she said Monday. \"I don't want to say never today, but I am very skeptical and I think that new elections would then be the better way.\" The chancellor could benefit from a wish for stability in a new election. Or more voters could turn against mainstream parties, boosting the nationalist and anti-migrant Alternative for Germany's 12.6-percent vote share from September. Either way, it appears likely that - as in this parliament - no plausible coalition would be possible without Merkel's conservatives. Polls so far have shown little change from the September result. It's hard to tell whether and how that will change; one potential factor is a leadership struggle inside the Christian Social Union, the Bavaria-only sister to Merkel's CDU, which has been simmering since that party performed particularly badly in the election. On Tuesday, parliament speaker Wolfgang Schaeuble added his voice to an appeal by Germany's president, who is holding a round of meetings with party leaders, for politicians to show more readiness to compromise. \"We can be of different opinions as to how we should be governed, but it is clear that we must be governed,\" Schaeuble, a prominent member of Merkel's party, told lawmakers. \"This is a test, but not a crisis of the state,\" he said. \"The task is big, but it can be solved.\"",

            "article_content": "NEW YORK -- The Anti-Defamation League found an increase in cases of anti-Semitic intimidation and vandalism last year, evidence that anti-Jewish bias intensified during the election. The Jewish civil rights group found 1,266 cases of anti-Semitic harassment last year, compared to 941 in 2015 and 912 in 2014. The increase continued into the first three months of this year, with reports of 541 incidents compared to 291 in the same period the year before, according to the ADL data released Monday. The preliminary 2017 numbers include a wave of more than 150 bomb threats that started in January against Jewish community centers and day schools. Authorities arrested an Israeli Jewish hacker who they said was behind the harassment. The ADL insists those threats should still be considered anti-Semitic since Jews were the target. During the same period, a former journalist in St. Louis was also charged with threatening Jewish organizations as part of a bizarre campaign to intimidate his former girlfriend. But authorities believe the Israeli man is primarily responsible. Even without those bomb threats, the number of anti-Jewish incidents this January, February and March in the report would be higher than the year before. The FBI compiles annual hate-crime statistics, but the 2016 numbers aren\u2019t expected to be released until the end of this year. The ADL tally includes a much broader array of incidents, such as distribution of hateful materials, threats, slurs, intimidation and vandalism, along with physical assaults. The organization says its researchers evaluate reports from individuals, community leaders and law enforcement. This latest compilation includes only a few cases of online harassment - incidents that led to \u201con the ground\u201d intimidation - so that the organization can continue making year-to-year comparisons of ADL data going back to the group\u2019s first report in 1979, before the internet and social media were so broadly used, according to Oren Segal, director of the ADL Center on Extremism. Anti-Semitic harassment in the U.S. has been at historic lows in recent years, according to the organization. In some prior years, the number of incidents surpassed 1,500 or 2,000, Segal said. But the recent uptick has fueled anxiety among American Jews during a period of emboldened expressions of white-supremacism and white-nationalism during the presidential election. Last week, a Jewish woman sued the founder of the neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer, accusing the publisher of orchestrating a barrage of anti-Semitic messages from anonymous internet trolls starting last December. \u201cI think the pace in which the incidents are happening, the speed at which the spike is occurring, I think the historic low is a thing of the past,\u201d Segal said. The report linked 34 cases last year to the presidential race, including graffiti found in Denver last May that said \u201cKill the Jews, Vote Trump.\u201d ADL chief executive Jonathan Greenblatt was among the most vocal Jewish leaders pressing Donald Trump, as a candidate and president, to do more to combat anti-Semitism, including among his supporters. Critics, in the Jewish community and elsewhere, said partisanship was behind such pressure on Mr. Trump. In February, Mr. Trump opened his address to Congress with a strong condemnation of recent cases of vandalism at Jewish cemeteries. On college campuses last year, the number of reports of anti-Semitic incidents remained about the same compared to the previous year, the ADL said. Many of the schools have been roiled in recent years by protests over Israeli policies toward Palestinians. However, the organization saw an increase in the number of reports of harassment against Jewish school children from elementary age through high school.",

            "article_content": "Steve Bannon, the former chief strategist for the White House and chairman of President Trump's campaign, sat down with Charlie Rose of CBS News's \"60 Minutes\" for his first-ever television interview, which was long and candid.\u00a0  Since he left the White House in August, Bannon has resumed running the right-wing news site, Breitbart News. During his interview he shared his opinions on the firing of James Comey, working with the Republicacn establishment, the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, and Hillary Clinton, among other topics.  Here are some of the key takeaways from Bannon's \"60 Minutes\" interview:\u00a0  \"The Republican establishment is trying to nullify the 2016 election. That's a brutal fact we have to face,\" Bannon told Rose.  The former chief of staff cited Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, claiming that \"they do not want Donald Trump's populist, economic nationalist agenda to be implemented.\"  \"They're gonna be held accountable if they do not support the president of the United States. Right now there's no accountability,\" he later added.  Bannon expanded on what he sees as a significant failure on the part of GOP leadership: they couldn't repeal and replace Obamacare.  The very first meetings we had with the Republican establishment, here was the plan that was laid out.\u00a0 The plan was to do Obamacare because, remember, Paul Ryan and these guys come in and said, 'We've done this for seven years. We've voted on this 50 times. We understand this issue better than anybody. We know how to repeal and we know how to replace, and this is ours. That's what we're going to start with day one, and we will have something on your desk by Easter. By the Easter break, we'll do repeal and replace. Come back from Easter, and all the way up to the August break, taxes. Come back from the summer break, on Labor Day, and we drive home to the end of the year on infrastructure. We accomplish all three big legislative goals in the first year.'\u00a0 \t As Bannon put it, \"There is wide discrepancy in the Republican party, as we know today, now that we're in it. But I will tell you, leadership didn't know it at the time. They didn't know it 'til the very end.\"  It's now September, and the Affordable Care Act remains in place, after the Senate failed to repeal the bill. Last week, Mr. Trump forged a deal with Democrats for the debt ceiling, funding the government and Harvey aid. It was a move that stunned Republican leadership, but the president wanted to be able to move on to work on the tax code.  In the aftermath of the racially motivated violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, when President Trump seemed to blame white supremacists and counterprotesters equally, Bannon told Rose, \"I was the only guy that came out and tried to defend him,\" saying that he tried \"taking it up to a higher level. He said he wondered, \"Where does this end? Does it end in taking down the Washington Monument?\"\u00a0  While he called neo-Nazis and neo-Confederates and KKK members \"absolutely awful\" and said \"there's no room in American politics for that,\" Bannon declared that his problem was, \"When you side with a man, you side with him.\"  \"If you're going to break, then resign,\" Bannon said, adding, \"If you find it unacceptable, you should resign.\"  Rose asked who he was talking about.\u00a0  \"I'm talking about obviously, about Gary Cohn and some other people,\" Bannon replied, in reference to a\u00a0Financial Times\u00a0interview in which the chief economic adviser expressed concern over the violence. \u00a0\"That if you don't like what he's doing and you don't agree with it, you have an obligation to resign.\"  When asked if he believes Cohn should have resigned, Bannon replied \"Absolutely.\"\u00a0  Rose asked whether it was true that Bannon had described President Trump's termination of former FBI Director James Comey as the biggest mistake in political history.  \"That probably would be too bombastic even for me, but maybe modern political history,\" replied Bannon.   Rose then asked Bannon to confirm what he was suggesting: \"So the firing of James Comey was the biggest mistake in modern political history?\"  \"I think, if you're saying that that's associated with me, then I'll leave it at that,\" Bannon conceded.  He also told Rose that \"I don't think there's any doubt that if James Comey had not been fired, we would not have a special counsel.\" Asked whether he thought Robert Mueller, the special counsel overseeing the Russia probe, should be fired, Bannon replied, \"No, I do not.\"  \"There's nothing to the Russia investigation,\" Bannon said, calling the multiple investigations in the House and Senate as well as the special counsel probe of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election \"a waste of time.\"  \"It's a total and complete farce. Russian collusion is a farce,\" Bannon said.   When asked about specific documents relating to the CIA and FBI intelligence, Bannon replied that he \"would never devolve classified information on this show, but that \"it's far from conclusive that the Russians had any impact on this election.\"  Bannon called the former Democratic presidential candidate \"not very bright.\"   \"She doesn't really have a grasp, she doesn't have a grasp on what's important and what's not,\" Bannon said. \"And that's essential in a leader. Donald Trump has a grasp on what's important and what's marginalia.\"  He alluded to a speech she gave during the campaign about Breitbart, in which she attacked Breitbart for giving white supremacists a platform.  \"That speech of hers is an embarrassment. Breitbart -- alt-right, ethno-nationalism, white supremacist. It landed flat,\" he said.\u00a0 He added, \"Not only is it morally wrong, it's also totally irrelevant. Economic nationalism is what this country was built on.\"\u00a0 Bannon suggested that Clinton had made the mistake of focusing on identity politics, which, he said is not the economic argument embraced by other Democrats. \u00a0\"Sherrod Brown gets this. Tim Ryan gets this....The people around Schumer get this,\" he said. They understand it. They're trying to reverse it. They're trying to get the identity politics out.\"\u00a0  Bannon continued, \"The only question before us is, is it going to be a left-wing populism or a right-wing populism.\"\u00a0  \"And that is the question that will be answered in 2020,\" he told Rose.  \"I think I'm a street fighter. And by the way, I think that's why Donald Trump and I get along so well. Donald Trump's a fighter. Great counter puncher. Great counter puncher. He's a fighter,\" Bannon said, adding that the media's portrayal of him as a \"streetfighter\" is \"pretty accurate.\"  Blair Guild is a politics reporter and video producer for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump went for it on\u00a0inauguration day. He was true to himself and his voters and his promise to blow up Washington. For a man who understands the power of symbols and show, he didn\u2019t offer the expected ones, which was its own act of showmanship. He was not anesthetized by a day made to sooth the feelings of the losers in the election. He gave them little. And he called out the politicians sitting just a few feet away for selling out the people through their venality, even though they had just rested their hands from applauding him. This kind of risk-taking and boldness are ingredients for greatness. President Trump\u2019s approach offers the possibility of undermining his opposition through a series of clarifying fights and building a new coalition.\u00a0 But if that\u2019s Trump\u2019s intent, his choice not to make an appeal beyond his base was illogical. It was out of sync with his revolutionary experiment and denied him a tool in addressing his concerns about being labeled illegitimate. The weakness in president Trump\u2019s approach could be seen immediately. Day One his administration was focused on his legitimacy. Though President Trump has a busy agenda and moved immediately to\u00a0dismantle the Affordable Care Act, his press secretary held his first briefing room event not on any of his revolutionary moves, but to argue (against the facts) about the issue of his inaugural crowd size. The president also diverted to this topic at some length on his first day during his visit to the CIA. The Trump team says the fight they picked over crowd size was about holding the press accountable. In truth, it was about diverting from the opposition marches taking place across the country Saturday. But the crowd size debate was also about legitimacy, which appears to be a fixation of the new president. President Trump refused to believe the\u00a0Russians tried to meddle in the campaign, for fear it would call his victory into question. He is visibly irritated about having lost the popular vote and regularly overstates the nature of his victory. Wednesday at the White House, for example, he was repeating the evidence-free claim that 3 to 5 million illegal votes caused him to lose the popular vote. There are no challenges to his legitimacy. He is the president. Still, he guards this account vigilantly. The risk is that when you relentlessly assert your legitimacy it can backfire. If you have to keep asserting it, perhaps your legitimacy really is in question. The best you can do with relentless assertion is fight the world to a draw. There is another way: act like a president for all the people. Instead of asserting legitimacy, build it and show it. President Trump could have done that on inauguration day. This is a challenge larger than just one day. Donald Trump built something extraordinary to get to the White House. The question is whether he can build anything bigger as a president of the entire nation. That\u2019s what he\u2019ll need to sustain him when a surprise event puts him on the ropes as it does all presidents -- it\u2019s also what he\u2019ll need to get sixty votes to pass his legislation in the Senate. The inaugural address was a special opportunity. He made a pitch that he was the people\u2019s president. He says he hears things that the elites miss. But there was nothing in his speech that suggests he has heard anything from those outside his base. When people don\u2019t think a president is listening they hear him say \u201cget in line\u201d and they resist. This is among the things that irritated President Obama\u2019s critics. This is not about coddling snowflakes. This is about politics: adding people to your movement. For a politician making a third way, he needs converts. Why not take a chance then, during your big national moment, and show your detractors you hear them? In a year when not hearing and living in a bubble is a capital sin, it would seem like a president wouldn\u2019t leave any doubt in his inauguration whether he hears all Americans. He had another option that he also didn\u2019t take. He could have nodded to those who worry that a norm-breaking president will break too many norms. Trump\u2019s adviser Steve Bannon said Trump\u2019s speech was Jacksonian, but Andrew Jackson\u2019s inaugural address shows the precise ways in which Trump took a different route. Jackson showed humility about his new post, repeatedly referring to the limits he would follow as president: \u201cI shall keep steadily in view the limitations as well as the extent of the Executive power.\u201d He said he was \u201canimated by a proper respect,\u201d and praised the \u201csentiment of conciliation, and spirit of compromise.\u201d How conciliatory was he? The famous warrior in Indian combat even showed deference to Native Americans, promising \u201chumane and considerate attention to their rights and their wants which is consistent with the habits of our Government and the feelings of our people.\u201d The rallying point President Trump chose was a new nationalism and patriotism. \u201cAt the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.\u201d It\u2019s an interesting theory of human behavior, but it\u2019s hard to argue that simple patriotism will bring unity in our present political moment. The people who felt such joyon Friday at Trump\u2019s inauguration attended the ceremony as a sign of their love for America, and the people who protested Donald Trump on Saturday all over the country did so because they love America, too. Patriotism isn\u2019t going to bring them together, and if you declare\u00a0your way\u00a0to be the patriotic way you\u2019re going to drive people apart. Elections are a debate about America. They invite splits over the idea of patriotism and what it means. Inaugurations are designed to rebuild, but they require more than simple assertion-- we must all be patriots-- because if simple assertion were enough,the new president would have already convinced everyone with his campaign assertions. A president must seek unity through appeals to basic human qualities that connect all Americans. Donald Trump quoted from the bible to make his unity case. \u201cHow good and pleasant it is when God\u2019s people live together in unity.\u201d But why stop there? The Good Book actually has some clues for aspiring inauguration speechwriters about how to create that unity. Peter doesn\u2019t talk about allegiance to America, but puts it this way: \u201cFinally, all of you, be like-minded, be sympathetic, love one another, be compassionate and humble.\u201d Before President Trump\u2019s address, many thought Nixon\u2019s first inaugural would be a good template for him. It contained the same dark notes Trump sounded during his campaign-- during a time in American history that was darker-- but Nixon sought to build unity from those same human qualities that Peter advised were the route to unity. \u201cWhen we listen to the better angels of our nature,\u201d said Nixon channeling Lincoln\u2019s first inaugural address, \u201cwe find that they celebrate the simple things, the basic things-- such as goodness, decency, love, kindness.\u201d Had President Trump tried either of those gambits it might have made arguing about crowd size easier. Faced with questions about crowd size, his advisers could have reiterated how the numbers didn\u2019t matter because he sought to be president for all the people. That would have been more than a simple assertion. They could have pointed to a speech that used any of the available and traditional tropes of national bond-building. Since the crowd size debate was also an effort to distract from the Saturdayopposition marches, this messaging would have been helpful in that context, too. If you\u2019re going to drive a righteous wedge between the people and the politicians, it helps to have as many people on your side as possible when you are fighting in their name. Inauguration rhetoric obviously isn\u2019t going to convert your opponents, but acting like you are president for all the people gives you a tool to rebut those who say you aren\u2019t, keeps your political opponents guessing and maybe lays the groundwork for eventually expanding your base. If Donald Trump did not choose to do that in a venue where tradition and custom and his predecessors made it an easy trick to pull, when will he do it? Perhaps the bigger question is whether he wants to convert anyone at all. John Dickerson reports for 60 Minutes as a correspondent and contributes to CBS News election specials.

And a painful political controversy about patriotism follows in its wake. What were American troops doing in Niger? Was it an intelligence failure that led to the ambush that killed four? We will talk with Oklahoma Republican and Senate Intelligence Committee member James Lankford about the raid and how Republicans square decades of focus on deficit reduction with a new budget that actually increases the deficit. Tax cuts are the goal, and we will ask President Trump's budget director, Mick Mulvaney, how it's going to happen and how the numbers are going to add up. Then: President Trump, his chief of staff and a Florida congresswomen feud over how to honor fallen servicemen and their families. We will hear from Khizr Khan, a Gold Star father who appeared at the Democratic Convention last year. His new book is \"An American Family.\" And we will look at finding compromise in controversy, as former- Green-Beret-turned-NFL-football-player Nate Boyer talks about his efforts to find a balance between protest and honoring the flag he fought under. Plus, analysis of all the news and an unusual show of unity from the five former presidents. It's all ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I'm John Dickerson. Last week, a corrosive political spat broke out over the issue of respect for fallen soldiers and their families. We begin with a look at what sparked this new low in America, an October 4 attack in Niger where four American soldiers, Bryan Black, Jeremiah Johnson, La David Johnson, and Dustin Wright, were killed when they were reportedly ambushed by Islamic State extremists. Joining us now to answer some of the questions about the attack are Michael Morell, CBS News senior national security contributor and former number two the at CIA, and CBS News national security correspondent David Martin. Mike, I want to start with you before we get a sense of what exactly happened. Why were U.S. servicemen there? MICHAEL MORELL, CBS NEWS SENIOR SECURITY CONTRIBUTOR: John, it has been U.S. policy for some time to support those nations facing a terrorist threat. One of the key pieces of that support is to train, advise and assist local militaries. One of the places we were doing that was Niger. Niger faces a significant threat from a robust al Qaeda group and a growing ISIS group. Both of those are located in Mali, but they come across that border and conduct attacks in Niger. Americans might ask, why were we there helping the Nigerians? And the answers is, while this is a regional threat today, it could be a threat to Europe tomorrow and it could be a threat to the homeland day after that. So, we're there trying to keep this under control, so that it doesn't become a significant threat to the United States. It's a policy that makes sense. I support it. DICKERSON: David, what happened in this particular case? What do we know? DAVID MARTIN, CBS NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes. What we know is maybe different from what happened. We know that four American soldiers were ambushed and killed during a patrol on which no enemy contact was expected. The Pentagon says that that team of advisers had been on 29 previous patrols in the six months before that, never had any contact. No indication at this time would be any different. As a result, they had no drone overhead providing surveillance, and there were no armed escort aircraft overhead. Now, that version of events seems to be at odds with the fact that the U.N. has published a map which show that there were 46 attacks in that part of Western Niger in the past 20 months. In fact, there was one overnight. A group of militants came across the border from Mali, attacked a police barracks, and are reported to have killed 13. So, it seems like there would have been reason to expect enemy contact. So, we don't understand why no enemy contact was expected. DICKERSON: Yes. So, a discrepancy there, Mike. Is that an intelligence failure? What do we... MORELL: We don't know. We really need the results of the investigation that General Mattis has ordered up before we know what happened. But I will tell you, in this kind of situation, intelligence is far from perfect. But we really need to know the results of the investigation. MARTIN: You know, General Waldhauser, who is the commander of U.S. forces in Africa, testified last March before the Congress. And he said then he had only one-quarter of the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance flights that he needed throughout Africa. This is an operation which is just sort of starting up. And all the resources aren't in place. So, we don't know if somebody missed something out there, or if there just simply weren't the aircraft and other intelligence sources operating that could have detected this. DICKERSON: What's the most important thing going forward, Mike? MORELL: I think it's to make sure that we don't politicize this. And this has the feel of Benghazi to me, right? And I... DICKERSON: In the political field, not the facts on the ground. (CROSSTALK) MORELL: Exactly. Exactly. So, I hope we don't politicize it. And I hope we figure out what happened, so that it doesn't happen again. DICKERSON: David, let me switch and talk about ISIS in Syria. The president announced yesterday the successful capture of Raqqa. Where do things stand? MARTIN: Well, you know, for months, we have been conditioned to think that the battle for Raqqa would be the final battle against ISIS in Syria. And guess what? It's not. Before that city was encircled, the leaders and lot of the foreign fighters got out of there, went down the Euphrates River Valley into these towns along the river that leads down to the Iraqi border. That's where they are now. And in between the American-backed forces at Raqqa and those ISIS forces are a whole bunch of regime, Syrian regime forces and their Russian advisers and Russian aircraft. So, this is going to get very, very dicey, as all these forces converge on the Euphrates River Valley and the remnants of ISIS in Syria. DICKERSON: Quickly. MORELL: Very important that we don't think that the taking away of the caliphate is the end of ISIS. They will go underground. They will be in the shadows. They will remain a fundamental security problem. DICKERSON: All right, gentlemen, thank you so much. We turn now to Oklahoma Republican Senator James Lankford. He joins us from New York. Senator, you're on the Intelligence Committee. What is your assessment? So far, what do you know about Niger, and what questions are you asking? SEN. JAMES LANKFORD (R), OKLAHOMA: Well, we have all the same questions that have already been mentioned there as well, to find out what actually happened. That's the key aspect right now is all the facts that are on the ground. This is an extremely unstable region. A lot of weapons that came out of Libya are going down into this region. They're being used by al Qaeda and ISIS-affiliated groups. We have had well over 100 U.N. troops that have been killed in Mali. It's one of the deadliest places for U.N. peacekeepers in all of the world. And so there are lot of issues with this region, not only the flood of weapons, but the instability of the governments in the area, and have a large growing presence of ISIS and al Qaeda in the area. DICKERSON: Some of your colleagues, Senator McCain among them, has expressed frustration at getting answers out of the administration from the Pentagon. Do you share that frustration? LANKFORD: I do. What Senator McCain focuses on is getting the full story, not getting parts of the story or not getting conflicting stories. So, at this point, we have conflicting stories. We want to be able to get the full, accurate story, and get it right. DICKERSON: Do you feel like this is a localized problem or a broader one? The president has talked about giving the military greater rein to do its work. Does that have -- is there a tension in terms of greater rein, but not informing Congress perhaps as much about what the military is doing and where it's doing it? LANKFORD: Well, we're advising and assisting all over the world to be able to help put down al Qaeda stand ISIS and other radical Islamic groups around the world that are seeking to terrorize not only the local communities, but, as we have learned from Afghanistan, it's not just an isolated region of the world that will never come and come after us. Obviously, they have come after us before from these isolated regions. So, it's extremely important that we do stay engaged. We're typically in the back, and, quite frankly, typically, these ISIS groups won't attack a United States convoy because they're well- protected. They will attack other U.N. peacekeepers. They will attack local police stations. They will attack local governments or bus stations, where they know they are a softer target, than to come after a heavily militarized target like ours. So, typically, we will see each other and we will know each other's presence, but they won't actually engage, certainly until now, and we have seen that here. DICKERSON: Now, let me ask you another question about potential business on the Intelligence Committee that you're on. You're looking into the Russian influence in the election. There have been reports this week about Russian efforts to try to influence the Obama administration and try to influence perhaps Hillary Clinton through donations to the Clinton Foundation with respect to the purchase of uranium. Is that something that Intelligence Committee should look at, that you're interested in looking at? LANKFORD: So, we need to finish up the report that we have now, but that is an unsettled issue. That is something that the FBI has pursued for now a decade to try to determine what influence was done. As you know, there are several Russians that have been arrested for this or have been charged on these crimes of trying to be able to influence the purchase of the -- in the deal on uranium with the Obama administration through the Clinton Foundation. There are unanswered questions that should be answered. It may not necessarily be by this investigation. We would like to be able to close it down. But that is unfinished business. Quite frankly, the Judiciary Committee will probably be the lead investigative team on that one from the Senate. But we still wait to see the final reports from the FBI on it to be able to get the actual details on that one as well. DICKERSON: Let me ask you about the budget. You said -- last year, during one of the Obama budgets, you said, \"We cannot keep saying we will add debt every year, and there's no reckoning for that.\" The budget passed out of the Senate this year -- this week, it's not going to tackle the deficit as much as some would have liked. What does that mean? What about that reckoning? LANKFORD: Yes, a tremendous frustration as we walk through this process. There are several votes there to try to bring back the budget, not necessarily on the tax side, but on some of the spending side. The way to be able to get out of this big hole that we're in is pretty straightforward. To be able to limit our spending, it's not a matter of dramatic cuts, but to be able to cap our spending make sure that it doesn't continue to grow past inflation rate, but then to also have a growing economy. For the last 10 years, our economy has grown at less than 2 percent on average every single year for 10 years. We have not had a decade like that in a century in America. Typically, our economy grows at about 3 percent. What we have encouraged is a bump on the economy with tax reform. It's not been done in 30 years, have a major tax reform. If the economy is stuck, as I like to say with the old illustration of record needle, if the economy is stuck in the same track over and over again, somehow, you have got to be able to bump that to get it going. I think regulatory reform is that, and certainly tax reform is that to be able to get our economy growing again. DICKERSON: Let me ask you a final question on another committee you're on, Homeland Security. Overseas, FEMA, the response to Puerto Rico, the president gave himself a 10 out of 10 this week. How would you grade him? LANKFORD: I'm not sure I would give a grade on the tone. I would say it's extremely difficult for FEMA dealing with disasters in Houston, in Florida and Puerto Rico at the same time. You have staff that's incredibly stretched. You have a lot of resources that are going towards Puerto Rico, but it's a much harder issue, based on the fact that it's an island. Even moving power poles to that island takes a week just by barge to be able to get them there. All of their power is out across the entire island. You have got 3.5 million people that have got to get access to basic services again. And it takes a long time to get equipment there. DICKERSON: All right, we're out of time. Senator, thanks so much for being with us. LANKFORD: Thank you. DICKERSON: Joining us now, the White House director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney. Welcome, Mr. Director. Let's start with the budget. A budget passed out of the Senate this week, setting the stage for tax cuts. But that budget does not achieve balance. That's something you wanted as a congressman. So why doesn't it achieve balance, and why isn't that a big problem? MICK MULVANEY, WHITE HOUSE BUDGET DIRECTOR: I think we have made a decision now within the administration that plan A or part of plan A, which was to try to cut our way to balance, just wasn't going to get very far in Washington, D.C. We had offered $54 billion worth of discretionary cuts in our budget back in March. Only about $4 billion or $5 billion had survived so far on the Hill. We're not going to be able to cut our way to balance. So the next part of the plan, the next part of that, sort of the calculus, right, deficits are revenues, less expenditures, is to focus on the revenues. How do we get government revenues up? The way that we balanced the budget, John, back in the 1990s was fiscal restraint, slower growth in government, plus huge economic growth that drove wealth for families, but also drove receipts to the government. DICKERSON: Let me go back to that spending question, though. Republicans for a long time have talked about spending restraint. And so to now say, well, we're going to do it through growth, that's a big -- that's no small deal. It's like Weight Watchers saying, well, we're going to give up the dieting part. MULVANEY: Yes, but you're not giving up entirely on spending. It just you have to sit there and go, OK, there's two parts to this equation. There isn't the political will on the Hill right now to make... DICKERSON: Why not? Why not? You're in charge. Republicans are in charge. They have run over this for so long. Why no will? MULVANEY: Yes. It's just -- it's difficult, I think, to cut spending in Washington. It really, really is. DICKERSON: But is it lack of will of the members, lobbyists, constituents? What is the... MULVANEY: It's all of the above. It really is. Washington is designed to spend more money. It's probably too deep in the weeds for this show, but the 1974 Budget Act, which drives everything that we do, every dollar that we spend, is designed to spend more money one year from the next. That's the bill that says, if you spent $100 last year, and $104 this year, we call it a cut. I'm not making that up. So, the law really is set up to spend more money. It's hard to get out of that cycle. DICKERSON: Well, here is why I ask, because there's a lot of questions about outsiders and insiders. And what sometimes happens is, people, the outsiders say, we got to do this, that and the other thing. And then they become an insider, and they realize, either through expediency or maybe things are just more complicated than they thought, that they don't follow up with what they said when they were campaigning. That disconnect has led to serious splits in political parties. And it's happening in the Republican Party. So, why would somebody looking at this from the outside say, well, now they're in power, they're just doing the easy thing? MULVANEY: But, listen, you have got bigger issues than just spending that fall into that category. You have got Republicans who have promised to repeal and replace Obamacare. They haven't done that yet on the Hill. You have got Republicans who have promised to do tax reform. Now, we had a huge step in that direction this week. And I think we're making a lot of progress on it, but we haven't done that yet. There's a lot of things we haven't followed through on, on the party. You have seen the president act with a great deal of frustration in reaction to that. You have seen lot of frustration back home with people from that. So, yes, absolutely, we have to start keeping our promises, but passing this budget this week, which is the next step and an absolutely critical step to get tax reform, was a big step forward in keeping that promise. DICKERSON: Let's talk about taxes. There was framework released. It included removing the deductibility for state and local. MULVANEY: Right. DICKERSON: Now there seems to be some wobbling on that. What is the status of removing that as a deduction? MULVANEY: I hope they don't wobble. Keep in mind, what the president wants here, John, is something that is simpler, better and fair. And this is one of those issues that goes right to the fairness issue. If you and I make the same amount of money, we live in house that has the same value, our car is the same car, shouldn't we pay the exact same amount in federal taxes? We should. That's fair. But if you live in New York... DICKERSON: Not matter where you live. MULVANEY: ... and I live in South Carolina, I actually pay more in federal tax than you do. And that's not fair. And we hope that that does remain part of the process. DICKERSON: Although -- well, let's tick off couple of other things that have been discussed. What is the status of the carried interest loophole? This is a tax treatment that helps hedge fund managers. The president called it -- said they were getting away with murder when he was a candidate. It wasn't in the framework. Where is it now? MULVANEY: Keep in mind, the stuff that wasn't in the framework is stuff that we weren't able to sort of come to general agreement on with the House and the Senate leadership going into the more detailed discussions, which will start now. So, that's why the framework was still very important, because we did have agreement on the basic rates, on corporate reductions, on reform and so forth. So, it's not in the framework. It means, well, let's -- we're going to put that aside to discuss later. And later is now. But I will confirm to you the president still believes that the carried interest is probably something that needs to be looked at very, very closely. DICKERSON: Because you talked about fairness. And the president, as a candidate, went right to that fairness argument and said, they're getting away with murder, and the middle class is getting nothing. Why not just say, this must be in tax reform? MULVANEY: I think, if it was up to the president, you probably would. But, again, we have to work with the Senate and the House. DICKERSON: He's not shy about saying what he wants. Why be mumbly on this one? MULVANEY: We have been very careful here now to make sure that we're focusing on what we agree on as we worked -- as we released that framework. OK? So, the things that we agreed on go in the framework. Things that aren't agreed to in advance, they go into committee, and that's the process that starts next week. DICKERSON: Final question. Bipartisan health reform, the president seemed to be supporting the Alexander-Murray. Now he says he's not. What's the status of that? MULVANEY: Yes. And I saw the first statements. Talking to the president about it, he is where he has been from the very beginning on CSRs, which is: I want to get a deal. I don't want to give this money to insurance companies. I don't want to give money to these CEOs who make tens of millions of dollars. DICKERSON: But the bill is written in a way that won't give it to them. MULVANEY: It is. But it's -- well, he doesn't want to do any of that without also getting something for folks who are being hurt. And I think the criticisms you have heard this week are like, look, I'm OK with doing a deal -- this is the president now -- but I'm not getting enough for the folks who are getting hurt. So, give me more by way of associated health plans. Give me more of the things that we know we can do for folks back home to actually help them. I think there's actually a pretty good chance to get a deal. It's just Murray-Alexander in its current form probably isn't far enough yet. DICKERSON: All right, we will have to leave it there. Mr. Director, thank you so much. And we will be back in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: The political controversy over Gold Star families began with a question to President Trump on Monday about why he had not mentioned the loss of the four soldiers in the 12 days after they were killed in Niger. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If you look at President Obama and other presidents, most of them didn't make calls. A lot of them didn't make calls. (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: That was not accurate, as staffers for previous presidents pointed out. Then, a harsher criticism. When the president called the wife of fallen soldier La David Johnson, Democratic Congressman Frederica Wilson accused Mr. Trump of being disrespectful to the grieving widow. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. FREDERICA WILSON (D), FLORIDA: I was in the car for that phone call. He never said the word hero. He said to the wife, \"Well, I guess he knew he was getting in to.\" How insensitive can you be? (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: The president denied it on Twitter. And the next day, Chief of Staff and Four-Star Marine General John Kelly made a stunning statement. Citing his personal experience when he was notified of his own son's death in 2010, he said he had advised the president not to make calls. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KELLY, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: I said to him, sir, there's nothing you can do to lighten the burden on these families. But let me tell you what I tell them. Let me tell you what my best friend, Joe Dunford, told me, because he was my casualty officer. He said, Kel, he was doing exactly what he wanted to do when he was killed. He knew what he was getting into by joining that 1 percent. He knew what the possibilities were, because we're at war. That's what the president tried to say to four families the other day. I was stunned when I came to work yesterday morning and brokenhearted at what I saw a member of Congress doing, a member of Congress who listened in on a phone call from the president of the United States to a young wife, and in his way tried to express that opinion that he's a brave man, a fallen hero. (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: Kelly's criticism of Congresswoman Wilson didn't end there. He accused her of bragging about getting funding for an FBI building at a ceremony honoring two FBI agents killed in the line of duty. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WILSON: To recognize the family of special agent... (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: But video surfaced of the congresswoman's speech that contradicted Kelly's story. We can't tell you how this saga will end, but we will talk about it with another Gold Star parent, Khizr Khan, when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: We're joined by the Gold Star father who last year gave an impassioned speech at the Democratic National Convention, Khizr Khan. He's the author of the new book, \"An American Family: A Memoir of Hope and Sacrifice.\" Welcome. Thank you for being here. We want to get to the book, which was originally why we invited you here. But you are the father of Captain Khan. And I wonder if -- what your reflections are on this week, now that we have had this public feud about Gold Star families. KHIZR KHAN, AUTHOR: In two words: dignity and restraint. First, I offer my deepest condolence to the families of my four sons, brave hero sons that died protecting us. Without their sacrifice, this nation would be vulnerable. They were serving this nation. They will always be remembered. Their families will always be remembered as best of America. I stand with them. I support them. They deserve utmost dignity and respect and privacy at this moment. That should have been accorded when this matter came to public. But that had not been done. It had been made political football. Again, I request and I ask utmost dignity, respect and privacy. DICKERSON: This week, General Kelly, the chief of staff, also talked about number of things in American life that had fallen away. He talked about respect for women, for religion. And he said this. \"Gold Star families, I think that left in the convention over the summer.\" He was talking about the respect accorded to Gold Star families. You spoke at one of the conventions. What did you make of those words? KHAN: We stood for the best of America, for the values of this country. We spoke about the blessed documents and the traditions of this country. We spoke about the best, citizen Kelly, former general, and we acknowledge his sacrifice, as in service and his family's service. But now he is citizen of United States. Should have refrained from doing exactly same thing what he was complaining about. DICKERSON: All right, we will continue this conversation after a commercial. We need to take just a bit of a break here, but we will be back with more from Khizr Khan in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: We will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We continue our conversation with Khizr Khan, author of \"An American Family.\" Mr. Khan, before we get back to the book, I just wanted to get what you were saying about General Kelly. You were saying he engaged in the -- in the behavior he was criticizing? KHIZR KHAN, \"AN AMERICAN FAMILY\": This is American tradition that when military leaders retire, they go home, collect their pension and they maintain the dignity that they have earned. In case of former General Kelly, he had -- I was shocked. I was shocked to see citizen Kelly standing next to the president when he -- when president could not have the proper word to condemn attack on the blessed city of Charlottesville, Virginia, by neo-Nazis. He stood -- you could look at his face and his gesture in disgust, but he stood in support of that moment when Donald Trump could not condemn the attack that took place. Then again, instead of advising the president that restraint and dignity is the call of the moment, former General Kelly indulged in defending behavior of the president and made the situation even worse. Our political leaders, elected by the people, are -- deserve -- deserving of equal dignity and equal respect, instead of being maligned on misstated facts. And that was beyond the call of the moment. DICKERSON: We should note that you live in Charlotte. I want to turn to the book now. And you write in it that in your American story there were many who were in America who were open and welcoming and gregarious. Give us an example of that. KHAN: When we first arrived, the very first day when we arrived, my two sons and Ghazala arrived in Houston, we had rented a $200 bedroom - one bedroom apartment for them. I was off loading the stuff from the car. We just closed the door after off-loading. There was a knock at the door. Paulette (ph), our neighbor, was holding two bags in her hand. That was the first gesture of American goodness that we experienced. She said, we brought this. You have two small children. They may need something. They just arrived. After she left, I looked at Ghazala. I said, all the values that I had dreamed of about America, about this country, the goodness of this country, the generosity, we had been touched by those values while working in Dubai by Americans, are true. And we begin to fall in love. And that has continued, not only in Houston, but in Maryland, in Virginia. Every step the generosity, the kindness, the dignity that America grants. We are immigrants. We are patriotic immigrants. When immigrants become citizens, the patriotism begins to come together by living by experiencing the goodness of this country. DICKERSON: When you first -- you spoke at the Democratic Convention. But when -- you used to carry a Republican membership card. KHAN: Yes. I very well remember the first political participation was, I was not citizen then, was to go and listen to Ronald Reagan's speech in Houston. I am very fond of his speech where he says about the city on the hill, the beacon of hope for the rest of the world. I was very much in support of his policies, his defining of the American values. And we tell that story in detail in our book, and many other stories of how it all came together. I used to take my children to Thomas Jefferson's with other guests and I would ask them to read the inscriptions on the walls of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial. Captain Humayun Khan and both of my children used to roll their eyes because I had taken them so many times there. But look what happens. Patriotism begins to take root in the hearts and minds of people reading these values. Captain Humayun Khan wrote an article, and we mentioned that in the book in detail those stories. The title of his essay was \"Democracy Requires Vigilance and Sacrifice.\" You probably hear my voice raising when I say this. In these tumultuous times, we all will be well served if we are vigilant. Our democracy, our way of life, our self-governing is under attack. DICKERSON: Let me -- describe for a moment the Declaration of Independence, where you first read it and that you talked about Jefferson, so we'll bring his work on the table here. What was that like the first time you read it? KHAN: I was 22 years old in Pakistan, had taken a course in comparative study of constitutions of the world. Among the materials, the very first page was the Declaration of Independence. I looked at it. We come from in Asian countries then from colonized part of the world. Amazing, amazing document I read. Is there a nation on earth that declares its independence? Independence is given. Independence is attained. Independence is politically argued and received. Is there a nation? So that love affair started in 1972. And I am still in awe of those 1338 words of the Declaration of Independence. I implore all Americans read it, how we founded this blessed nation. DICKERSON: Finally, you have stepped into the political arena with the -- at the democratic Convention. What has it been like since then? KHAN: It has been journey of hope, bridge building, interfaith dialogue, standing with those who truly care for the values of this country. We will prevail. I have seen the hope and aspiration in the eyes and in the hearts and in the minds of the people that I have dealt with throughout this nation. We are blessed to have all this. I remembered the moment, and we explained that in the book in much more detail, when I became citizen of United States. I wish every American reads the oath of citizenship that I took. I had nothing when I went -- human dignity terms, nothing when I went to take that oath. I came out blessed with all dignities that a human being aspires to have. It's that story that we write in the book. DICKERSON: All right, Mr. Khan, thank you so much for being with us. KHAN: Thank you. DICKERSON: And we'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: For those looking for an exit from the escalating culture wars in the U.S., we want to look at one model. Nate Boyer served in both Iraq and Afghanistan as a green beret and was awarded the bronze star before playing for the Seattle Seahawks in 2015. Last year, Boyer wrote an open letter to Colin Kaepernick that encouraged Kaepernick to stand during the national anthem as opposed to sitting out of respect for veterans. Kaepernick wouldn't go that far, but the two worked out a compromise and Kaepernick began to kneel instead of sitting. And Nate Boyer joins us from Austin, Texas, this morning. Mr. Boyer, welcome. I want to go back to that first letter you wrote. What inspired you and then how did you get in this conversation with Colin Kaepernick? NATE BOYER, FORMER SEATTLE SEAHAWK: Yes, you know what inspired me was just -- it hurt. It hurt to see somebody, you know, protesting the flag and the anthem. At least in my eyes, that's what it was. It was somebody sort of protesting America and the symbols that stand for, you know, these freedoms and all that. It was confusing to me. I didn't understand where that was coming from and it just -- and it hurt as a, you know, as a war fighter when you're going overseas and you're fighting for those that can't fight for themselves and you're fighting for all those -- those freedoms that we have here. And then, to me, the way I perceived it was somebody was sort of sitting that out and not interested in that and upset about, you know, those things that we were trying to provide. I just was -- was -- was hurt by that. So I wrote an open letter explaining my experiences, my relationships to the flag, why I stand and why I feel the way that I do. But instead of, you know, attacking or telling him, you know, this is why you should stand, it was more like, you know, I want to understand where you're coming from. Why are you sitting? I don't know what it's like to be you. You know, I've only had my experience and so I'm just trying to empathize and understand. Through that letter, you know, Colin reached out and we ended up having a sit down, a face to face conversation, which -- which led to him taking a knee instead. You know it was -- it was -- it was a -- it was a powerful moment for me and I think for a lot of people to see two people that disagreed on the subject or a topic that was pretty important to our country that we're able to work out some sort of a compromise, or at least have that conversation, you know, civilly. DICKERSON: A lot of people think that compromise -- a lot of people who share your views, the first one that inspired your first letter don't think -- they don't think that compromise gets at it. They think the -- that this is still offensive in just the way you've described. BOYER: Right. No, there is. I mean everybody's got a different relationship to everything in our world, you know? And for -- things are perceived different ways. What's interesting about the protest itself, whether it's sitting, kneeling, fist in the air, it doesn't matter. Even when a lot of these -- these men are saying it's not about the military, it's not even about the anthem or the flag. They don't get to necessarily choose how people see it, though. How individuals perceive that, you know? If -- if somebody makes another hand gesture towards you, that's offensive to you but they're saying, no, I'm not -- this is not what it means. This is not what I'm -- that's not the point of what I'm doing right now. It doesn't -- it's not up to them how you take that and how you receive that. So there's been issues with that. And, yes, people -- people believe that kneeling is still offensive they have every right to believe that and feel that because that's what's great about our country. You can -- you can have those opinions, have those feelings. And, you know, for me, I thought it was better. I thought kneeling was better. We -- we -- people kneel in our country to pray. You know, when you propose to your wife, you take a knee out of respect. And so I thought it was better. I want him to stand. I want everybody to stand for the anthem and feel that pride that I feel, but I want them to do it because they want to do it. I don't want them to do it out of obligation. DICKERSON: I want to touch on something else you wrote about, which is that when you returned home from your service overseas, you said you returned to a country that is so divided and so hateful. Talk about that a little bit. Was that what inspired your effort to try to find some ground here and is there any lesson for anyone else in that? BOYER: Yes. I mean it's -- it's a tough time to be back home in America, you know, because we are so divided and we seem so angry and stirred up. And, you know, we don't have these conversations. We don't sit down with someone we disagree with and talk any more. We're just on our cell phones and, you know, we're -- we're sharing stuff through social media or other platforms and it's just a constant attacking of one another. And it's really frustrating as a -- as a -- as a soldier. You know, I was in the Army and going overseas and going to fight for our people here. And then to come back to a nation that's just angry at one another and, you know, like, what has happened, you know, recently with the four soldiers who lost their lives over there, it didn't even really become a topic or something we talked about until, you know, we were discussing the president's involvement and the remarks and all that. It was like, why aren't we honoring these guys before that even happens? Because we're so wrapped up in who's right and who's wrong in our country and, you know, it's like -- everyone's trying to turn each issue into this good versus evil instead of just trying to understand that we all have different, you know, experiences and we come from different places and that's what makes our country great, that mixture of all those things. DICKERSON: All right, Nate Boyer, thank you so much for sharing some time with us. And we'll be back in a moment with our panel. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: And we're back with our political panel. Rich Lowry is the editor of \"The National Review.\" Jamelle Bouie is the chief political correspondent for \"Slate\" magazine and a CBS News political analyst. We're also joined by \"Politico's\" chief international affairs columnist, Susan Glasser, and deputy managing editor for \"Time\" magazine, Michael Duffy. Michael, I want to start with you. Where are we at the end of this week on this question of gold star families and the fight that's grown up around it? MICHAEL DUFFY, \"TIME\" MAGAZINE: To be continued for sure. There's no question that if the president simply apologized on Monday for -- or after Monday for maligning his predecessor for not calling or writing or whatever it is he accused Barack Obama of not doing with respect to this, this whole thing might have gone away. But, instead, we got a cascading series of missteps and mistakes that really took five days to go through. And I don't think we're quite done. It also not only left the president with another week of sort of three steps back, one step forward, it ensnared the chief of staff, who took the job to sort of interpose himself between a president who doesn't have the -- all the protocols and pathways of doing this job down, and may never, and potential disaster. And so by stepping into that space and then making some mistakes of his own, Kelly actually added to it, John Kelly. So it was a week that just started bad, got worse and I think left unanswered a lot of questions about what we're doing in, you know, Niger in the first place. DICKERSON: But you wrote that this is -- this may be, quote, the stupidest and most unworthy controversy of the year. RICH LOWRY, \"NATIONAL REVIEW\": Yes, it's been the most distressing controversy of the year. And that's saying a lot. And this would be a better debate, maybe it wouldn't even be a debate at all if everyone could concede just a modicum of good intentions and good faith on the other side. It's clear that President Trump's call with the widow of Sergeant Johnson, it landed the wrong way. But it's obvious to me he didn't do that maliciously or callously. In fact there was a video of a call with another widow of a soldier killed in Afghanistan in April that was posted by the widow because she found it great comfort in this call. And in that call Trump is sympathetic, he's humane, he is warm. So I think in this instance it's incumbent on him, though, to be the bigger figure and to say, look, I did not mean in any way to add to your distress. If I did, I'm sorry and I'll do anything to make it up to you. But that's obviously not the way he operates. DICKERSON: Right. Jamelle, there does seem to be lack of restraint here. Nobody -- these things usually end when somebody who has the chance to wallop stops. And on both sides, this is not just -- you know their -- we can figure out who started this, but it's now turned into a regular old political fight. JAMELLE BOUIE, \"SLATE\" MAGAZINE: Right. I mean I think -- I agree with what Rich said, this entire controversy is sort of -- it's so small and silly. But I do think it reveals something kid of important about the president, which is that he cannot take responsibility for any mistakes that he's made. From his initial statement maligning his predecessors, that would have ended had he just said, I'm sorry that I said this. I was wrong. His -- the widow's reaction, Representative Wilson's statement, having just said this was my error, or I didn't mean it this way, this would have ended. But at every single stage, the president can either take responsibility for refrain from punching back. And we see this time and time again throughout his presidency. And actually if we just like move away from controversy and scandal and sort of actually being president and doing the job of president, this inability to take responsibility for mistakes or to back down is disastrous. It is what -- it is a quality that has (INAUDIBLE) better presidents. LOWRY: The two sides here, and she also, in better world, the congresswoman, works have gone to John Kelly privately and said, you know what, they were very upset by that call. Is there anything you can do to make it right? Instead she blows it up and she's joying her 15 minutes of fame over this family's distress, which is disgusting in its own right. DICKERSON: Susan, let me ask you about the larger point Kelly made this week, but that also John McCain made, George W. Bush made, President Obama made, which was that this dropping of standards. Chief of Staff Kelly said, you know, whether it's religion or the treatment of women or now this fight intruding on this sacred space. Who's -- there was just this cry this week from a variety of corridors that standards have dropped totally. SUSAN GLASSER, \"POLITICO\": That's almost indisputable. But I think, look, Jamelle is absolutely right, we're not surprised Donald Trump behaved this way because it's very consistent with what we've seen from President Trump throughout not only his presidency but his campaign. He's not going to back away from a fight if one is offered. In fact, he tends to encourages them. I think it's more surprising what we saw in a way from General Kelly. We learned more. One of the things that's been apparent over the last couple of months that this underscored is that it remains Donald Trump's White House and not John Kelly's White House, even if he has imposed more discipline and more of a process, number one. Number two, perhaps we saw that General Kelly, this week, shares more of Donald Trump's agenda than we realized. And you talked about the standards dropping. I found General Kelly's comment to be surprising and even puzzling that he would have brought up in the same commentary about this incident with the gold star families this notion that in the good old days women were sacred and, you know, isn't it so terrible that we didn't get there. A lot of people have talked about the irony of working for a president who has been accused of this kind of behavior. But, to me, there is that issue, you know, working for Donald Trump, but there's also the question of, what's the good old days exactly? Is that what this America first-ism (ph) is about, is about looking backward to some Halcion (ph) and almost mythic past that somehow was better? DICKERSON: Well, he could have been groping for -- for a kind of understanding of it. What's a common idea of -- DUFFY: Not good. No pun intended. LOWRY: John, geez. DICKERSON: Sorry. Get your minds out of the gutter, guys. But he's fumbling for a -- to try and touch on something that you had many other people talking about this week. And, Michael, the chief of staff was there to try to explain how signals were missed. DUFFY: Damage. It was a classic damage control operation by a White House chief of staff. And even though he seemed politically naive with that comment, I thought, I agree with you, he was also -- he's fundamentally a political person. More than the -- the speeches of this week by McCain and Bush about the dropping of standard or the loss of something else, it's an amazing week in this respect, which is that the Republican Party have never been more dominant in American politics in 100 years and it's never been more split, wide open, cracking apart in front of our eyes. You had two of the most esteemed figures of the Republican establishment, John McCain and George W. Bush, of all people, who has been reluctant to say anything since he left the Oval Office about anyone, come out this week and actually, in coded term, not very coded, criticized the Trump White House and Donald Trump for his handling, not only of his rhetoric, but of his foreign policy and a lot of other things. This was on top of McCain's rather remarkable, what do you call it, you know, half-baked, you know, half -- (CROSS TALK) DUFFY: Neo-nationalism. That party split is -- that's war this week. That's not words of war, that's war. And that's happening at the same time that they are seemingly in control of everything. DICKERSON: And yet, Rich, on Monday the president was with Mitch McConnell at the White House showing a picture of unity. How -- LOWRY: Yes, the least -- the least convincing bromance of all time is Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell. There is a civil war in the Republican Party, and the irony is, this civil war really began before the election. It was papered over during the election. And they -- they won everything. And -- on -- at the national level. And Trump is still sort of trying to be the pivotal figure who can work with both sides. He -- he likes Steve Bannon. He understands why Steve Bannon's upset, yet Mitch McConnell is his best friend and he's going to try to work with him on The Hill. So Trump, in a lot of ways, this leads to an incoherence in his own governance. He doesn't know whether he wants Lamar Alexander, the senator from -- Alexander to cut a bipartisan deal or he wants to be with the House Freedom Caucus and conservative peers who oppose that kind of approach. BOUIE: Yes, I think it -- it may speak to sort of a broader exhaustion of the traditional -- or at least since Reagan -- traditional framework for Republican politics, right? That you have a Republican Party whose base is increasingly people who actually look to government for some sort of assistance. This is -- Trump's message spoke to -- he promised to defend Medicaid. He promised to defend Medicare. He promised to defend Social Security. But this is joined to sort of a more traditional Republican activist class, Republican affluent voters who want tax cuts, who want things like Obamacare repeal. And winning hasn't really done anything to sort of reconcile those differences whatsoever. DICKERSON: Final 30 seconds, Susan. GLASSER: Well, I have to say, I do agree with you, but I'm struck by the fact that for Senator McCain, for George W. Bush, their speeches fundamentally are about America's role in the world. DICKERSON: Right. GLASSER: And, you know, this is the major foreign policy rift is why that part of the Republican Party was so active against Donald Trump during the campaign. They believe that regardless of your views on domestic policy or health care, that Trump is pulling the United States away from the international order in a way that actually threatens to undermine all those institutions, which, by the way, we built and rigged in our favor. And so that's what's interesting to me is you have the foreign policy part of the Republican Party standing up and saying \"no.\" DICKERSON: All right, we're going to have to stand up and say \"no.\" I'm afraid we're out of time. So, thanks to all of you. And we'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: Today we want to leave you with an unusual show of unity. That of all five former presidents, Presidents Jimmy Carter, George Herbert Walker Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, who gathered last night at Texas A&M University to raise money for hurricane victims. That's it for us today. We'll be back next week.

            "article_content": "JOHN DICKERSON, CBS HOST: Today on FACE THE NATION, President Trump face the biggest test of his moral instincts since taking office and sees another senior administration official to the exit door. (CROWD CHANTING) DICKERSON: Protesters in cities across the country, an estimated 40,000 in Boston alone, took to the streets this weekend to drown out the messages of hate and violence seen last Saturday in Charlottesville, Virginia. The protesters also decried President Trump`s insistence that white nationalists protesters and counterprotesters were equally to blame for the violence. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think there`s blame on both sides. And I have no doubt about it and you don`t have any doubt about it either. DICKERSON: The president`s response led CEOs of the nation`s top companies to abandon the White House Manufacturing Council. Five of the seven joint chiefs issued tweets denouncing racism and bigotry. Former presidents George Herbert Walker Bush and George W. Bush put out a statement doing the same. But former KKK leader David Duke thanked the president for his honesty and courage. That prompted South Carolina`s Lindsey Graham to plead with the president, you are now receiving praise from some of the most racists and hate-filled individuals and groups in our country. For the sake of our nation as our president, please fix this. How will he fix it? We`ll ask South Carolina`s other Republican senator Tim Scott, who said this week the president`s moral authority is now compromised. Virginia Democratic senator Tim Kaine will also join us to discuss the debate over Confederate monuments that has mushroomed since playing a role in the protests last week. Plus, just days after defending his chief strategist Steve Bannon -- TRUMP: He is not a racist, I can tell you that. He`s a good person. He actually gets a very unfair press in that regard. DICKERSON: -- the president said goodbye to the self-described nationalist. Bannon is the latest senior White House official from the president`s original team to leave the administration. Will his departure lead to the stability the president`s advisors and family crave or open up new fault lines? We`ll talk about that and more with our politics panel. It`s all coming up on FACE THE NATION. (END VIDEOTAPE) DICKERSON: Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I`m John Dickerson. It`s been more than a week since the president`s outrage by blaming all sides for the violence in Charlottesville. On Monday, President Trump gave in to pressure from his staff to respond more specifically against the hate groups involved. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Racism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans. (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: The page had been turned, or so the president`s advisors had hoped. Tuesday, at a press conference scheduled to be about infrastructure, the president went rogue. His priority once again seemed to be equating the two sides in Charlottesville. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: You had a group on one side that was bad and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. And nobody wants to say that. But I`ll say it right now. (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: By Thursday the president had moved on to yet another argument, taking sides against those who support removing or relocating Confederate monuments. By the end of the week, more than just the president`s opinions were being questioned. Tennessee Republican senator Bob Corker said the president`s behavior was part of a larger lack of stability in office. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. BOB CORKER (R), TENNESSEE: The president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful. (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: Nebraska Republican Ben Sasse predicted more violence in the future and questioned the president`s ability to calm and comfort the nation. To talk about the week and address these issues, these larger issues of presidential leadership, we`re joined by Republican senator Tim Scott. He joins us from Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. Welcome, Senator. I want to start with your remarks about the president and idea that his moral authority is compromised. What does that mean? SEN. TIM SCOTT (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: Well, it means that as we look into -- look to the future, it`s going to be very difficult for this president to lead if, in fact, that moral authority remains compromised. He went into office -- sometimes you have positional authority, and that is very hopeful. But the reality of it is this nation responds to moral authority, when we believe that our president has the entire nation`s best interests at heart. His comments on Tuesday that erased his positive comments on Monday started to compromise that moral authority that we need the president to have for this nation to be the beacon of light to all mankind. DICKERSON: What should the president have said? SCOTT: Well, I think what he said on Monday was fantastic. It would have been even better had he said it on Saturday. What he said on Tuesday was just really challenging. What the president should do before he says something is to sit down and become better acquainted, have a personal connection to the painful history of racism and bigotry of this country. It would be fantastic if he sat down with a group of folks who have endured the pain of the `60s, who`ve had humiliation of the `50s and `60s. This would be an opportunity for him to become better educated and acquainted with the living history of so many folks, from John Lewis to my mother and so many others, who have gone through a very painful part of the history of this country. So that when he acts, when he responds, and when he speaks, he`s not reading the words that are so positive, that he`s breathing the very air that brings him to a different conclusion, a conclusion that comes from the wells of his heart. That`s what America wants to see. That`s what we`re seeing in so many of the counterprotests. We`re seeing America rise in a way that it did not in the `60s, which I think is powerful and symbolic to the rest of the world, that we reject the darkness and we embrace the light. These are good times for those who believe that darkness must be put out and light must shine even brighter. DICKERSON: Another thing that the president could have said, and might say, is to those white supremacists, I don`t want your support. And I raise this because two Republican senators have suggested perhaps a reason he hasn`t. The first is Ben Sasse who wrote quote, there are some whispering in the president`s ear that racial division could be good politics for them. Senator Corker from Tennessee said helping inspire divisions because it generates support from your political base is not formula for causing our nation to advance. Do you believe that that`s part of what at play here? And should the president say I don`t want these votes in any form? SCOTT: Well, I assume that`s the automatically obvious answer, that we do not want the support of those folks who want to divide or to conquer this nation. The fact of the matter is that the Republican Party is party of Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. We believe that all men and women are created in the image of God. We believe that we are all equally created. So the fact of the matter is that we should assume by default that we reject the support of those who do not support the theory, the notion, the fact, that all men are created equally. That to me seems like the starting point, and should not be a leap. DICKERSON: Should the president, though, be a little bit more clear about this? Because can the leader of the party of Lincoln, the president, also be the person who`s being praised by former imperial wizard of the KKK, David Duke? SCOTT: Yes, we should bask in the criticism of our enemies. We want those who believe that this country is better with a superior race and thoughts of inferiority pervasive through this nation that has been rejected. It should be rejected by the president and every single person. I`ve said several times that, from my house to the White House, we all must reject hatred, racism, and bigotry, and do it in such a clear and unambiguous way that there leaves no doubt, period. DICKERSON: You`ve worked on these issues for a long time. Charleston had its, of course, the horrible shooting more than two years ago. What can the president do beyond sort of fixing the remarks from last week? What more would you expect him to do to reach and deal with some of these larger issues? SCOTT: At this point it`s not what the president says next. It`s what he does. We are in a very critical and sensitive time in this nation. We need our president to sit down with folks who have a personal experience, a deep connection to the horror and the pain of this country`s provocative racial history. If the president wants to have a better understanding and appreciation for what he should do next, he needs to hear something from folks who have gone through this painful history. Without that personal connection to the painful past, it will be hard for him to regain that moral authority from my perspective. DICKERSON: When you and I talked about this before, you had suggested that this was something president could do at the start of his administration, spend more times in communities of color. Why do you think he hasn`t? SCOTT: It`s hard to say why he has not. I can tell you that I stand by those comments back in January that if in fact our president is going to regain that moral authority, if he`s going to remain on the high ground, if we`re going to make progress in this nation, it`s not simply the issues that we fight for. It`s understanding that people that we are fighting for, and those issues that best represent a better future for those folks. That`s one of the reasons why I have suggested that coming in to some of the most challenging economic communities in this nation is in his best interests, is in the nation`s best interests, that we fight for the issues that encourage and improves the outcome for those folks that are economically most disadvantaged, and frankly socially feel like they`re left out. DICKERSON: Let me ask you about your relationship in South Carolina when the Confederate flag came down. You supported that. The president has said these Confederate monuments are beautiful, and that it`s foolish to take them down. Do you think it`s foolish to take the Confederate monuments down? SCOTT: I think that`s definitely a local issue. But I am certainly wanting to be clear -- one of the most powerful pictures I`ve ever been a part of, from a racial progress standpoint, was seeing President Obama standing in front of the Pettus Bridge. Not the Selma Bridge, but the Pettus Bridge. Someone stood for hatred, bigotry, and oppression -- having an African-American president stand in front of that bridge said so much about the darkness of the human soul in the past, and how much progress that has been mad in this country. Here at home in South Carolina, John C. Calhoun was a United States senator, famously a part of the notion of oppression and bigotry in this country. DICKERSON: But do you -- SCOTT: For the voters of South Carolina to evolve to the place where they elect someone like myself to be in the same seat of John C. Calhoun says what is possible in America, and has started in South Carolina. I think we are on the right path overall. DICKERSON: All right, Senator Scott, we`re going to have to leave it there. We`re out of time. We`re so grateful for you being with us. SCOTT: Yes, sir, thank you. DICKERSON: We`re joined now by Virginia Democratic senator Tim Kaine. He`s in Richmond. Senator, you were also governor of Virginia and mayor of Richmond, a majority African-American city that was also the capital of the Confederacy. From those perspectives, how do you see this debate now over removing Confederate monuments? SEN. TIM KAINE (D), VIRGINIA: Well, John, first, you know, I wouldn`t even be a guest on the show this week if it were just about monuments. The reason that we`re doing this today is because I went to three funerals this week. I`m not here this morning because of statues; I`m here because people brought violence and hatred and bigotry and murder to my state. And I think I`m also here because we have a president who wasn`t able to stand up and condemn the indefensible. DICKERSON: And yet we have, in the wake of everything you just described, there is a conversation now about these monuments, about how you take all of the things that have been roiled up by this, and try to lower the pressure and work through these issues. And so given that, and given that this has moved into a conversation about symbols and history, where do you -- what guidance do you have, given the moment and your history as a governor and a mayor? KAINE: When I was mayor and governor, we worked on some of these issues, John, in Virginia, because we have some painful scar tissue, obviously. We took down two bridges in Richmond that had been named for Confederate generals and renamed them for civil rights heroes. We put up new statues in our city, one of Abraham Lincoln who visited Richmond after the fall of the city. And one of Arthur Ashe on Monument Avenue, which had heretofore just been for Confederate generals. The way we sort of looked at this issue, and I think it`s important that we look at it this way -- it`s not just about subtraction. It also has to be about addition. So our mayor, Levar Stoney, has convened a commission in Richmond to look at all of those statues and decide whether they should stay or be removed or be reinterpreted. But a point that I would also make is, let`s also talk about whose stories haven`t been told and what buildings or monuments we might think about erecting in the future. You went to UVA; you know Virginia well. It`s interesting, we`re a history-obsessed commonwealth, but why do the four years of the Civil War merit so much more attention in Virginia than 250 years of blood sacrifice by hundreds of thousands of slaves who lived here, who built up our state, who were sold to our state? DICKERSON: When you were mayor, you said about a (INAUDIBLE) mural, you said much of our history is not pleasant. You can`t white wash it. Do you feel that same way about the Confederate statues in the Capitol? KAINE: You know, in the Capitol in DC, it`s an interesting one, John, you and I know the story. There`s -- every state gets two statues to put in statuary hall or throughout the Capitol. And just using Virginia as an example. The state gets to choose two people to represent the entire scope of the state`s history. Virginia obviously chose George Washington, the father of the country. But the second choice that was made in 1909 and has never been changed is Robert E. Lee. I think, as you look at the scope of Virginia history, here in 2017, and if you want there to be two people to really stand for who Virginia is, why wouldn`t you think about Pocahontas, who, had she not saved John Smith`s life, we wouldn`t even be here, possibly? Why wouldn`t you think about a Barbara Johns who led a school walkout in Prince Edward County that ultimately became part of the Brown versus Board desegregation decision? Why wouldn`t you think about Governor Wilder, the grandson of a slave, a decorated Korean war combat veteran, who became the first elected African-American governor in the history of the country? I think, from 2017 looking backward, I think Virginia could probably do better in the two people that we choose to stand for us in statuary hall. And I think a number of the other states can do better as well. DICKERSON: Let me ask you about a point the president raised about violence on the left that has been a part of some of these rallies. Does the Democratic Party have any responsibility to call out violence? While it may be separate from the issue in Charlottesville is also part of the issue in Charlottesville. What is the Democratic Party`s responsibility? KAINE: We should call out violence of any kind. Peacefully protesting is a constitutional right. But what the president did this week was suggesting there were some moral equivalence in Charlottesville. And that is outrageous. The president didn`t have a hard time when a Somali young man drove a car into that crowd at Ohio State in December. He called it an act of terrorism, which it was. When somebody drove car into a crowd in Barcelona this week, he jumped on it immediately; it was an act of terrorism. But when this white supremacist drives a car into a crowd of people, killing Heather Heyer and injuring scores more, and the president says there`s fine people on both sides, or there`s violence on both sides, why is he so confused and unclear and unwilling to call out the violent white supremacy that was on such gruesome display in my home state? DICKERSON: Let me ask you a quick question about the criticisms of -- during the campaign, Hillary Clinton used the word deplorable to describe the kind of people that you started your remarks by talking about -- the white supremacist. It overshot the mark, it painted with a broad brush. People felt that she was talking about them. How does the Democratic Party not paint with that broad brush in these conversations that are going to happen coming up now? KAINE: John, this is really important question. We ought to throw away all the broad brushes, you know, and we need to be very precise. First, it`s really important, you have to condemn the intolerable. When there are people marching through the streets of Charlottesville chanting \"blood and soil\" from Hitler rallies, or \"Jews will not replace us\", you can`t be polite and kind about that behavior or certainly about murder and violence. You have to condemn it. But you have to be very specific about what you`re condemning. And it is very important to be absolutely clear and condemn what`s indefensible, but you have to do it in a way that suggests that you`re open to dialogue with people who have different points of view than you do. DICKERSON: And, very briefly, here at the end, you`re on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The president appears to be making a decision about troops to Afghanistan. Should more troops going there and what is U.S. -- what are the U.S. interests in Afghanistan? KAINE: John, I have a high degree of regard for the president`s national security team, especially Secretary Mattis, General Dunford, General McMaster. But I will say this. The troop strength question is sort of the cart before the horse. The real question is what is our strategy? And then when you lay out the strategy, then the troop strength question can kind of answer itself. DICKERSON: Thank you, Senator Kaine. We`ll be back in one minute with deeper analysis on the events in Charlottesville and what they mean for the country. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: To talk about the violence in Charlottesville and the rise of white nationalist groups, we`re joined by Sherrilyn Ifill. She`s president and director counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education fund. Elle Reeve is correspondent for Vice News Tonight. Elle was embedded with a group of white supremacists during the events that took place in Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend. And Christian Picciolini is a former self-identified skinhead and cofounder of the group, Life After Hate. Welcome to all of you. Elle, start with you. The documentary you were in has been watched by 46 million people. And I want to show a little bit of that footage from the Friday night and then get to you talk about it. This is from Vice News Tonight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CROWD (chanting): Jews will not replace us! Jews will not replace us! Jews will not replace us! Jews will not replace us! Blood and soil! Blood and soil! Whose streets? Our streets! Whose streets? Our streets! White lives matter! White lives matter! White lives matter! White lives matter! (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: So, Elle, you weren`t just on the periphery of this; you were embedded. The president said that, on this Friday night where those images were from, that there were good people quietly protesting. What was your sense of what you saw? ELLE REEVE, VICE NEWS TONIGHT: So this was an unannounced event, but a very well-organized one. When we arrived, there were vans dropping off white nationalists at the field. On the field, there were organizers doing crowd control, security, handing out tiki torches. They picked tiki torches as -- to be menacing. Sometimes they call it torch-lit vigil because it`s supposed to be offensive spin on a candlelight vigil. And once they started marching, they didn`t talk about Robert E. Lee being a brilliant military tactician. They chanted about Jews. Like, they wanted to be menacing. It`s not an accident. DICKERSON: Sherrilyn, all of the president`s remarks this week, there are -- his supporters would say but he did call out the racists on Monday. And when he identified violence, there was violence from the counterprotesters in Charlottesville. What are they missing in their defense of the president? SHERRILYN IFILL, NAACP LEGAL DEFENSE AND EDUCATION FUND: I think what we saw this week was the president scripted and unscripted. When the president was unscripted, when the president spoke from his heart, we heard him. He was combative, he was defensive of those who were white supremacists, and those who were Nazis. He put on an equivalent moral plane those who were white supremacists and Nazis with those who came out understandably outraged by seeing flags with swastikas and Confederate flags and hearing the kind of homophobic, anti-Semitic, and racial slurs that Elle talked about -- he put them on the same moral plane. And whenever he was pushed, what came out of him was such tremendous anger that we would even dare to expect him to call out what we think any president, any modern president in this country, should call out, which is Nazism and white supremacism and anti- Semitism. He just wasn`t able to do it. And so what he did this week is not only did he abdicate his role as a leader, as a leader of this entire country, not as a man speaking for himself. Not as a man speaking for his political party. Not as a man speaking on behalf of his voters or his base. But as president of the this entire country, he abdicated that responsibility. And then, even worse, he gave aid and comfort to those white supremacists and neo-Nazis who were out in full force in Charlottesville on Friday night and Saturday. DICKERSON: All right, Christian, quickly, why had this rise come in white nationalism now? CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI, CO-FOUNDER, LIFE AFTER HATE: There`s been a rise over the last 30 decades. And what`s happened, it was with concerted strategy to move away from the skinhead or the Klan look, to grow your hair out. Because even back when I was involved 30 years ago, there was a stigma to that even amongst racist white Americans. So the idea was to blend in, to grow the hair out, trade in the boots for suits. And here we are now. DICKERSON: All right, excellent. We`re going to take a quick break and to go commercial. We`ll have a lot more of this discussion in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: And we`ll have lot more analysis with our Charlottesville panel coming up. And my thoughts on the importance of speaking up. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: We`ll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We continue our discussion on the national rise of white supremacist groups. We`re joined by Sherrilyn Ifill of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Elle Reeve of \"Vice News Tonight,\" and co-founder of the group Life After Hate, Christian Picciolini. Elle, I want to go back to you on a point that Christian was making. One of the things in the documentary I thought was interesting was the explicit way in which some of the members of these groups said, we`re launching kind of a new phase to get publicity. Can you describe that a little bit what they were trying to do? ELLE REEVE, \"VICE NEWS TONIGHT\": Yes, this has been largely an Internet movement. These guys didn`t live together, hang out together. They just swarmed together online. And so this is a movement to hold physical space. They`ve taken tactics from left wing organizers and show that they`re strong and they have camaraderie. And they also are focusing on what they call aesthetics. They want to look middle class, successful, good looking. They don`t want to look like the old, as they called it, white trash racist of the old times. DICKERSON: Christian, let me ask you about the work that you do, trying to help stop this from your own history. You have lost a federal grant now. Tell us about that. And tell us about your work and how that fits into what Elle was just talking about. CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI, LIFE AFTER HATE: Well, how it fits into what Elle does is -- and, first of all, I think what she showed was stunning because it not only showed what we see as the public face of white supremacy, but also behind the scenes how the language changes and becomes more extreme. And it is a marketing tactic to do that. Under President Obama, my organization, Life After Hate was awarded a $400,000 grant to come combat far right extremism. And when President Trump took office, immediately that grant was rescinded. We were the only organization of the pool of grantees that was focused on white supremacist, extremists and disengaging people from that movement. And we do that in a nonaggressive way. Everybody at Life After Hate is a former extremist. So we understand the motivates of why people join. But, more importantly, we understand what it takes to get out of these groups. DICKERSON: And, quickly, what are the motivations? I mean there are the obvious ones, but what`s the key? PICCIOLINI: You know, ideology is not the driver for radicalization. It`s a search for identity, community and purpose. A broken one. And if it`s -- if there`s a brokenness underneath that person, they tend to search for those in really negative pathways. DICKERSON: Sherrilyn, let`s talk about the -- about Congress, about the response to this. There`s been a lot of commentary, but what -- what do you look for next in terms of matching public action with the sentiment that has come out in response to Charlottesville? SHERRILYN IFILL, NAACP: Well, I think this is really important and I hope it doesn`t get lost because I think there`s a powerful role for journalists, like Elle, and the extraordinary film that she made and the extraordinary work of Christian. But there are also policy decisions that we should be expecting our leader to make to deal with white supremacy. The United States Congress, just a few weeks ago, by vote of 51-42, approved a judge for Federal Appellate Court of Appeals who ran a right wing blog and regularly linked to birther articles and articles from white nationalists websites. I mean Congress knew this. They`re supposed to be looking at these judicial nominees and making sure that these judicial nominees are in the mainstream and are not extremists. The grant that Christian just talked about, the cabinet of the president and the coterie surrounding him, Sebastian Gorka and others, this is -- this is Congress` job to vigorously look during the confirmation process at each and every one of these individuals and to make sure that they don`t have these kinds of connections. And, finally, here`s the tough part, Congress has to deal with and state legislatures have to deal with the reality of white supremacy in their own policies. Sebastian Gorka said two weeks ago that there is no real white supremacy. White supremacy is individuals denying the civil rights of others. Well, we`ve had two federal judges just in the last year -- two federal courts in the last year identified two state legislatures, Texas and North Carolina, that those federal courts said deliberately created voter I.D. laws for the purpose of discriminating against African-American and Latino voters. When we see that, when we see state legislatures convening to pass voter suppression laws, that is white supremacy. That is an effort to try and deny the civil rights of African-Americans and Latinos. So if this is a moment for honesty, if this is a moment where America is prepared to confront itself, it has to confront the reality of violent white extremists who are out and who are broken and who are marching in the streets. But we also have to recognize the role that we play and that elected leaders play in setting policies that further white supremacism for the purpose of their own political gain. And my hope is that Congress and that governors and that state legislatures will be prepared in this moment to take on the responsibility themselves of demonstrating that they want no traffic with white supremacy. DICKERSON: Elle, what`s been the reaction? Forty-six million people have watched. We know a lot of people have watched it. But what -- this is pretty tough territory, any of us who have reported or talked about it. What`s the reaction been for you? REEVE: Well, walking through Charlottesville, I got stopped on the street by people in tears because they were happy that I showed what really happened. I think it`s important to let these white nationalists talk and explain their arguments so that we know what they are, so that we can counter them. It`s just critical, I think, to expose what they believe because they are drawing in very young adherence and we have to be able to fight that. DICKERSON: Christian, give me a little bit of your personal story if you`re talking about converting people who are broken. Attach that to your own story. PICCIOLINI: I was recruited into the white supremacist movement in 1987 when I was 14 years old. I joined America`s first neo-Nazi skinhead group. And I was recruited by America`s first neo-Nazi skinhead. My parents were Italian immigrants, so I shouldn`t have been a racist because they were the victims of prejudice. But because they were immigrants, they also had to work very hard. And I didn`t see them very much. They worked seven days a week, 14 hours a day. And I felt this sense of abandonment by my family. So I went searching for that acceptance and that family elsewhere. And the recruiter was very savvy at identifying my vulnerability and promising me paradise. And that`s a common theme among extremist groups is they bring you in, they feed your pride, and then they take that pride and they turn it so that that pride turns into hate of the enemy. DICKERSON: Sherrilyn, on -- at the end here, let me ask you about the debate over monuments. Condoleezza Rice, among others, has said -- and she was talking about names on buildings, not monuments, but she`s basically said, I want to -- this is a quote from her. I want us to have to look at those names and recognize what they did to be able to tell our kids that they -- what they did. And for those kids to have a sense of their own history. When you start wiping out your history, sanitizing your history to make you feel better, it`s a bad thing. This was not in relation to this weekend, but previous remarks she said. Put -- give me your sense of that and this debate that`s happening. IFILL: What we put on monuments and what names we put on buildings demonstrates what we revere. We honor those people when we make monuments to them. That is not about whether you`re erasing history. You`re still going to learn about the Civil War. You`re still going to learn about Robert E. Lee in school. The question is, do you revere him? Do you lift him up in the town square for children to see and to recognize as a hero? So that`s just inaccurate. No one`s trying to erase history. The question is in this country, are we prepared to face that these people were not heroes, that these people were traitors, that these people led us into some of the darkest days in our history. And what should be lifting up are those people who made America better, those people who stitched us together, those people who sacrificed to make us one nation. Those other individuals, they can be in the history books, just like they are in Germany. You don`t see monuments to Hitler in Germany. They learn about their history, but they don`t revere in the public space those people who represent their darkest days. PICCIOLINI: And to go on to Sherrilyn`s point, I don`t think that this was about statutes at all. I think it was an excuse, just like they corrupt the idea of free speech to have an excuse to have to have a rally with a bit platform. This was absolutely not about a statue. DICKERSON: All right, we`re going to have to end it there. Thanks to all of you. And we`ll be right back with our politics panel. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: And we turn now to our politics panel. Julie Pace is the Washington bureau chief for \"The Associated Press, Jamelle Bouie is a CBS News analyst and \"Slate`s\" chief political correspondent. We`re also joined by the editor in chief of \"The Atlantic,\" Jeffrey Goldberg, and \"The National Review`s\" executive editor, Reihan Salam. Jeffrey, I want to start with you. The president`s been involved in a lot of controversies. He`s been criticized by his party at times. Is this a vast difference? Is this just the latest in controversial things this president has done (ph)? JEFFREY GOLDBERG, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"THE ATLANTIC\": It`s a break, but it`s not the decisive break because the Republicans in the main are still with him. Even elected Republicans who are privately disgusted. But, on the other hand, it does represent a kind of a break, especially his equivocation on Nazism. Nazism is literally the easiest thing for an American president to condemn. His instinct was to equivocate, to play a game where both sides have a point. And I think that probably disgusted many Republicans in a way that previous behaviors have not. But people are still with him. DICKERSON: Reihan, in terms of those people that are still with him in the CBS poll, about 67 percent thought the president had -- Republicans had said the right thing in terms of Charlottesville. And I certainly, in my own reporting, have talked to people who said, look, he denounced the KKK and white supremacists on Monday and he pointed out accurately that there was violence. Give me your sense of -- and then finally they say, this is just another pile on by the media. Sure, the president may not have been perfect in this but now it`s gotten into this kind of obsessive overreach by the media. How do you sort through all of this? REIHAN SALAM, THE NATIONAL REVIEW: This weekend the president praised counter-protesters in Boston for protesting against various neo-Nazi, white supremacist groups, et cetera. And that`s something that lots of folks who wanted him to condemn neo-Nazis earlier on more strongly, they hear and they think, well, this is just a throw away. This doesn`t mean anything. It doesn`t actually confirm their preexisting story about him. When he turns around and equivocates, as Jeffrey just said, then it confirms a very powerful narrative for people. So this means that there`s an asymmetry at work. And that asymmetry is there for a good reason, by the way. People have very deep suspicions `doubt Donald Trump for a good reason. But if he`s going to counter those suspicions, he has to take very strong and clear action to convey that, no, I am, in fact, very sincere when I say that I`m on the side of those who are protesting against white nationalists, neo-Nazi, the Ku Klux Klan and all the rest. So the problem is that he does these things -- he does enough to make people who are inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt the opportunity to say, hey, he`s actually trying to be reasonable here. People are not being fair to him. And I think that that`s the tension, that`s why you see this difference between the two constituencies. And the other danger for Republicans is that we could be at the beginning of a moral cascade. If you look at opinion on let`s say same-sex marriage, circa 2006, 2007 it was one thing. It became something very different, in part because people who are opposed to same-sex marriage they frankly weren`t always very disciplined in how they communicated. They weren`t always actually making their argument in the most persuasive possible way to people who are inclined to believe that they weren`t motivated by bigotry. So you could be something -- seeing something very similar here. If you believe that the confederate monuments are about heritage and what have you, you actually have to be a lot more careful than a lot of folks, the president included, have been. DICKERSON: Jamelle, it seems like the president, in linking what happened in Charlottesville to the monuments, has actually created a challenge for anybody who might have the heritage. And I`ve got e- mails from them this week who said, you know, they do feel support for the history of Robert E. Lee, but they feel like now, because of this linkage, they can`t make the case. Is it possible, as Reihan says, for the president to say, to get on the other side of this? JAMELLE BOUIE, CBS NEWS ANALYST: I think -- I really think last Saturday was decisive here. Last Saturday and this past Tuesday were such -- through violations of what people think presidents should do, were such -- so, frankly, shocking to a lot of people that I`m not sure it`s possible for him to recover back like, you know, regroup and make an argument here that actually makes the heritage case but doesn`t sort of apologize or bigots, doesn`t sort of gesture in that direction. I really think it`s too late there. I want to add, though, on the politics of this, that it often seems like Trump is not losing any support from his voters. But a recent poll, a new Marist poll came out today that shows him basically in the mid-30s with his voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. And when asked if they were embarrassed by him, two-thirds of voters, registered voters in that state, said that they were. And so I do think -- and this poll was taken over the last week, so I do think that we are seeing -- this is harming him politically in ways that may not yet trickle up to Republican elected officials, but definitely matter on the ground. DICKERSON: Julie, another thing that happened this week, to Jamelle`s point about the -- how it may affect Republican elected officials, we did see Senator Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, make a different kind of argument. This wasn`t just saying that the remarks about Charlottesville were off, but he said the president lacked the stability for the job. That did seem different. JULIE PACE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: It was different. And I think it`s an open secret in Washington that Republicans, for months, have questioned the president`s temperament, they have questioned his competence, whether he can actually fulfill some of the basic functions of the job. What we saw this week is Corker expressing that publicly. And we, at AP, fanned out around the country. We talked to Republicans in place like Wisconsin, in South Carolina, Kentucky, a Republican stronghold, and over and over again we heard Republicans saying things publicly that they had only been saying privately. I think it`s important to note, though, that those Republicans did not have an action plan. There is no sense of a way forward here in terms of separating from President Trump. And that`s -- that`s where the -- where this really gets down to, will Republicans do something in terms of action that puts them at odds with the president or are they still going to fall in line when we get into the tax reform debate in the fall. DICKERSON: Well, and let`s go do that, Jeffrey. The -- I mean what are Republicans -- spoke out in various different ways about the president this week, but do they -- all kinds of -- other kinds of actions are being talked about. People are saying, you know, that certain White House advisors should leave. People are saying that Republicans should be more specific or stay constant in their attacks on the presidency. What`s realistic? GOLDBERG: Right. Well, what`s realistic is that nothing really is going to change. I don`t think there`s any appetite on the part of the Republican Party to engage in, let`s say, an impeachment process. Certainly zero desire. A lot of people on the left, among Democrats, assume that this presidency can`t go on because of what they see as the absurd quality of it. But this moves toward more and more paralysis, I think. 2018 is decisive. And I think they`re sitting there, going to Julie`s point, they don`t have a plan. They pray every night that he doesn`t tweet the following morning. That`s their plan. DICKERSON: And -- go ahead, Reihan. SALAM: Well, the role of the president in our system is to be both the head of state and the head of government. There`s some presidents who have been great heads of state and not great heads of government. You know, you could put Ronald Reagan in that category. JFK is another. And there are others who were very good heads of government. Donald Trump is not especially good at either one of those jobs right now. And that creates an opportunity potentially. If you`re in Congress, you literally have lost the ability-- the ability to legislate and be the leading institution in our government has atrophied. So, theoretically, this could be an opportunity for Congress to step up. The problem is that the ability to do that, the resource they need to do that, intellectual and otherwise, are just not there. So, you know, maybe they can step up. Who knows? But that`s kind of a long shot we`re depending on to get an agenda moved forward. DICKERSON: And, Jamelle, they would also need willing Democrats who -- who this week have given even more reason not to give the president`s party a win because they are both offended but they also see political (INAUDIBLE). BOUIE: And it was infrastructure week, which is something Democrats could actually get behind. DICKERSON: Right. Right. BOUIE: The mere fact that working with Republicans would deliver a bipartisan win for the president and Trump kind of foregoes the -- forgoes that path for Democrats who might even be interested in some sort of infrastructure bill, but recognize they (INAUDIBLE). That harms their immediate short-term political prospects. And I -- I don`t think necessarily that that`s a bad decision to make for them, in part because President Trump has shown himself to be so transgressive on issues like racism, has shown himself to not be looking towards a United American (ph) (INAUDIBLE) but focusing on very specific base and not offending that base, even as that -- those people are offending many other people. So Democrats choosing to say, we`re going to not work with Trump for a variety of moral and political reasons I think makes a lot of sense. PACE: I do think, though, it`s important on the Democratic front, you know, a lot of Democratic activists that I talked to this were very energized, but a lot of Democrats I talked to who are working on 2018 House and Senate race were a little more nervous because they recognize that in 2016 they ran on an anti-Trump message, they focused on these questions of morality, in some cases they focused on these questions of race and they lost. And they really feel like the party needs to get an economic message, that this -- focusing on this is not going to be enough next year. DICKERSON: Well, Reihan, Steve Bannon, as he departed the White House, made this an -- explicit, this argument that Julie just articulated, which is, as long -- he said, as long as the Democrats are talking about race, that`s great for us because they`re not talking about bread and butter economic issues. SALAM: The argument for Trump on the right has always been, we are not looking to this man for moral leadership. Rather, we are looking to him because we see ourselves as being in a crisis situation and the alternative as being much worse. And, you know, will Trump be able to make that case? I wouldn`t rule it out. GOLDBERG: The irony here, though, it`s interesting for Trump`s cultural supporters, is that -- is that the man has no noteworthy achievements. His most noteworthy achievement to date is accelerating the demise of confederate statues. He`s accelerating the end of southern romanticism. And so maybe -- maybe some people who support him because of those things will understand over time that he`s actually counterproductive. BOUIE: And on the -- on the economic side, the fact that the president and the Republican Congress have yet to have any significant accomplishments on that score, I mean that come 2018, if you`re trying to make the argument that, you know, if you`re a Republican (INAUDIBLE) your tough against Democrats, hey, listen, you know, you agree -- you (INAUDIBLE) in race and we`re going to do something for you economically. That -- that hasn`t shaken out yet. And that, I think, actually will make an impact next year. It was during last year`s election, Trump, because he had no record, could make these claims about the kind of economic stuff he was going to do. But now that he has a record, he has to run on it and Republicans have to run on it in a clear (ph) disadvantage. SALAM: The question -- the question is, do people pay attention to policy debates in so granular a fashion, or do they pay attention to headline numbers. What`s happening to job growth. PACE: Yes. SALAM: Exactly. And I think -- even just unemployment and wage gains and what have you, you know, it`s -- we can separate the question of whether or not he`s -- he deserves the credit for it. I mean he`s barely been in office, right? But the thing is, that is a very powerful factor. If you look at 2010, you know, look, unemployment wend up. If you look between the next two years, when Barack Obama got elected, it -- unemployment levels went up. I mean it`s that straight forward. DICKERSON: Quickly on Bannon. What`s your take? PACE: Bannon has been in a pretty precarious position the last couple of weeks. I think he`s going to be continue to be a force from the outside. He is going to be calling out this White House if they`re not acting on the things that have been on that white board in his office. DICKERSON: Thirty seconds. The president`s about to make a decision on Afghanistan. What should we look for? GOLDBERG: What you look for is a little bit more of the same. He seems to be going down a conventional path of a modest troop increase, which is what the generals, his generals, are asking him to do. The Bannon right wanted a draw down. Trump is now interested in Afghanistan because he`s been told that there`s a lot of mineral wealth under the ground, so he sees a return on the American investment in more troops. And I think what we`re going to see is more of the same and more pressure on Pakistan, which is actually a useful thing. DICKERSON: OK. We`ve run out of time. Thanks to all of you, especially with the speed round at the end. We`ll be back with some thoughts on speaking out. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: In the modern presidency, the chief executive is expected to respond to anxious national moments with words that stabilize the country. President Trump chose a different route. He did not give a stirring speech of unity or create a national gathering point around common ideals. He spent his passion on other things. This created an opportunity for others. For clarity about hate, there was a stampede. Four previous presidents spoke out against bigotry and racism. Five of the seven members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff did. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich was succinct, good people, he said, don`t march with neo-Nazis. There was also grace from Mark Heyer, the father of victim Heather Heyer. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARK HEYER, FATHER OF HEATHER HEYER: People need to stop hate and they need to forgive each other, you know? And I include myself in that in forgiving the guy did that did this, OK? He don`t know no better. (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: Followed by Susan Bro, Heather Heyer`s mother, who, without speech writers or experience, found the words to testify to the meaning of her daughter`s life and build a monument to it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SUSAN BRO, MOTHER OF HEATHER HEYER: And I want you to pay attention, find what`s wrong, don`t ignore it, don`t look the other way, you make a point to look at it and say to yourself, what can I do to make a difference, and that`s how you`re going to make my child`s death worthwhile. (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: Social media which can feel poisonous, lit up with clips of that speech and then later images of the candlelight vigil held at the University of Virginia. It was a collective ground swell from the public to put itself back in touch with the national values of equality and humanity. In the absence of one voice, there was a chorus. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CROWD (singing): I`m going to let it shine. Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine. (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: Back in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: Be sure to join -- to join your CBS station tomorrow for special coverage of the solar eclipse. CBS News will have a special report at 1:00 p.m. Eastern. That`s it for us today, though. Thanks for watching FACE THE NATION. I`m John Dickerson.",

            "article_content": "PARIS -- French far-right leader Marine Le Pen has been charged with allegedly misusing European Parliament funds relating to the payment of parliamentary aides. The prosecutor's office said Le Pen was handed preliminary charges on Friday of breach of trust and complicity in breach of trust concerning two of her aides when she served at the European Parliament. She was elected to the French parliament this month so gave up her seat in the European Parliament. One of the aides in question, Catherine Griset, a top aide at Le Pen's National Front party, was herself charged in February in the case. In May, Le Pen's \"French-first\" nationalism saw her beaten resoundingly in a national election by Emmanuel Macron, an unabashedly pro-European former investment banker who is now the country's youngest ever president.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "White nationalist Richard Spencer has been banned from a local Virginia gym after a confrontation with a Georgetown professor last week. Old Town Sport & Health in Alexandria, Virginia terminated Spencer's membership after C. Christine Fair, an associate professor at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, recognized Spencer and approached him, leading to a public lambasting for his \"alt-right\" views.  Fair described her interaction with Spencer in a post on her blog and on Twitter, saying she had asked him if he was indeed Richard Spencer, to which he replied, \"No.\" Fair said Spencer had asked for assistance from gym staff members as Fair continued to call out Spencer for being \"a cowardly nazi\", and that fellow gym patrons had yelled at her for \"making a scene\" and threatened to call the police.

NONVIOLENT RESISTANCE WORKS. pic.twitter.com/qGI6DhjxR5 Spencer, head of the National Policy Institute, told Buzzfeed that he denied his identity initially to avoid confrontation, and that he was \"disappointed and annoyed\" by the gym's decision to revoke his membership.  \"I'm really a model gym-goer, I don't bother anyone. I don't talk to anyone. I really just go and lift weights,\" said Spencer. This was not the first time Spencer was on the receiving end of personal attacks from those that disagree with his point of view. Spencer was punched in the face during an on-camera interview on Inauguration Day.  Spencer described it as a \"brazen, cowardly attack\" when he was punched by a hooded demonstrator who then ran off after hitting Spencer on the streets of downtown D.C.

Spencer was heard saying \"Hail Trump\" and quoting Nazi propaganda at a white nationalist conference in Washington to mark Mr. Trump's victory.  The Southern Poverty Law Center describes Spencer as a \"suit and tie version of white supremacists of old, a kind of professional racist in khakis.\" #torchlight pic.twitter.com/To6WZrvYGp Most recently, charlottesville-protest-richard-spender-kkk-robert-e-lee-statueEditUnlink \">Spencer was photographed carrying a torch during a Virginia demonstration where groups chanted \"you will not replace us,\" protesting plans to remove a monument of Confederate General Robert E.

Will the public cheer or jeer? And will the Senate go along? \u00a0 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0 DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: How am I doing? Am I doing OK? I'm president. Hey, I'm president. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) Can you believe it? Right? \u00a0 (END VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0 DICKERSON: The president was positively giddy at a Rose Garden victory party after the House passed his bill to replace Obamacare. \u00a0 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0 MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Welcome to the beginning of the end of Obamacare. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) \u00a0 (END VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0 DICKERSON: While Republicans celebrated, Democrats said they were doomed. \u00a0 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0 REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), MINORITY LEADER: But you have every provision of this bill tattooed on your forehead. You will glow in the dark on this one. \u00a0 UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: Shame! Shame! \u00a0 (END VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0 DICKERSON: Opponents are already rallying. And Republican lawmakers have started hearing from angry constituents. \u00a0 Idaho Congressman Raul Labrador was on the defensive at a Friday town hall. \u00a0 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0 REP. RAUL LABRADOR (R), IDAHO: Nobody dies because they don't have access to health care. (END VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0 DICKERSON: What is next for health care reform? We will hear from Budget Director Mick Mulvaney. West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin will also join us. And we spent time this week talking with Pennsylvania voters about the state of the nation. \u00a0 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0 DICKERSON: A word of phrase that describes the country right now. \u00a0 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Scared. \u00a0 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Tenuous. \u00a0 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In deep trouble. \u00a0 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Conflicted. \u00a0 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Moving forward. \u00a0 (END VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0 DICKERSON: Plus, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice joins us to talk about her new book on democracy and whether it is being threatened. And we will also have plenty of political analysis. It is all coming up on FACE THE NATION. Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I am John Dickerson. We begin this morning with White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, one of the key players at the White House in getting the health care bill through the House. Good morning, Mr. Director. Thanks for... \u00a0 MICK MULVANEY, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET: Good morning, John. Thank you for having me. \u00a0 DICKERSON: Thank you for being here. If I get health care through Obamacare, what kind of promises does this House bill make to me? \u00a0 MULVANEY: That it will actually be there. One of the reasons that we are pushing so hard to replace Obamacare -- by the way, I was on it when I was in the House of Representatives. People don't realize that. I was actually on the exchanges. And one of the promises we are making to people is that the health care that we will be providing will actually be sustainable and be there. One of the stories I think that isn't getting nearly enough coverage is the fact that Obamacare is already failing in places like Iowa. And I think even Virginia found out this week they won't have coverage in some places. So, one of the big pushes that we are making is, we are going to provide a system that is actually sustainable and can survive and provide health care. \u00a0 DICKERSON: But, of course, people hear about the Congressional Budget Office assessment of this House bill. And when you say it will be there for them they think, well, wait a minute, the CBO said 24 million people will lose coverage. So it won't be there for those 24. \u00a0 MULVANEY: Yes, I saw the CBO score. And you get down into the details on it, one of the things you see is that the CBO assumes that once the mandate is gone, people will voluntarily drop off of expanded Medicaid. Think about that for a second. The CBO is assuming getting to that 24 million is, you get Medicaid for free, but once the mandate that you take it is gone, you will voluntarily give up that free benefit. It is just absurd. It was one of the -- we talked about it, I think, when that first analysis came out that CBO, we thought, really missed the mark. They missed the mark a couple of years ago on how many people would sign up. And I think they have missed the mark again on how many people will lose coverage. \u00a0 DICKERSON: Let's say they really missed the mark and it's only 15 million people. That is -- that is a lot of people still. Did they really miss the mark by 24 million? \u00a0 MULVANEY: Again, compared to what? So much of the dialogue today is sort of compared to this ideal of what people thought Obamacare was going to be and what they want it so desperately it to be. The real thing to measure it against is against what Obamacare really is. Face it, people are losing coverage today in Iowa, again, for example, under Obamacare. People have 100 percent increases today in Arizona under Obamacare. That is the measure, not against the ideal of what they thought or wanted Obamacare to be. \u00a0 DICKERSON: So, is the -- so, then is final ending point we are at here basically people will lose coverage, but just not as much as you think they would have lost under Obamacare? \u00a0 MULVANEY: Well, I think what they are going to end up is a different type of system that is more state-driven. One of the things I think you saw in the bill this week, as the bill sort of evolved, was devolving more and more control to the state. When the first version of the bill came out a couple of weeks ago, we did that extensively with Medicaid. I used to be in the state government and we used to beg the federal government, give us more control over Medicaid. Give us the money, but let us provide for our own people at the local and state level. And our bill did that. And you saw a little bit more of that again as the bill evolved, giving more and more control to the states. \u00a0 DICKERSON: The president has said he will not sign or support anything that doesn't help his voters. And here is an assessment Avik Roy in \"Forbes.\" He is no fan of Obamacare. But he writes this: \"Millions of low-income Americans in their 50s and 60s will be priced out of the insurance market, while millions of upper-income Americans, who don't need the help, will get a big tax credit. Many of the people adversely affected by the AHCA,\" the bill that passed the House, \"are Trump voters whose favorite candidate campaigned on insurance for everybody.\" So, Avik Roy and a lot of others have said, older voters will see their premiums go up. People -- working-class people will face costs that will cause them to not have insurance coverage. That seems to be a direct blow to a promise the president made. \u00a0 MULVANEY: Yes, I am not familiar with that gentleman's report, not familiar what version of the bill he looked at I know, for example, as we went through the process, more money was set aside to help folks who might be in that 50-to-65 bracket. But face it, we are all sort of guessing right now because the negotiation is ongoing. The bill that passed out of the House is most likely not going to be the bill that is put in front of the president. The Senate will have their chance to change the bill, improve the bill. The negotiations will continue again, so I think it is important we reserve judgment on what the president will or won't sign until we know what is in front of him. \u00a0 DICKERSON: So, the president kept saying this is a great bill, and it's a good bill, but it is incomplete is what you are saying. \u00a0 MULVANEY: No, I am saying that the Senate is part of the government. This is a bill that passed out of the House. You and I are about the same age. We remember \"Schoolhouse Rock\" when we were kids, and I am just a bill, yes, I'm only a bill. And we're going to go through that process. Is it ugly? Maybe. Is it slow? Yes. But it is the right way to do it and it's how we're going to handle the bill. \u00a0 DICKERSON: The president said in the Rose Garden -- quote -- \"We will have great health care for everyone in our nation.\" When we are done with the \"Schoolhouse Rock\" process, will everyone in the nation be covered, as the president promised in the Rose Garden? \u00a0 MULVANEY: I think everybody will have coverage that is better than what they had under Obamacare. \u00a0 DICKERSON: But will everyone -- he says everybody in the nation. So, even Obamacare didn't cover everyone. \u00a0 MULVANEY: Yes. Well, what we talked about before is the access to it. Remember what Obamacare gave you. Obamacare gave you insurance, but not health care. A lot of folks who were technically insured either couldn't afford the premiums or couldn't afford the co-pay. And that's what we have been driving at, giving people the care that they want, the quality that they need, the affordability that they deserve. That's what we are talking about, actual medical care, not just insurance. \u00a0 DICKERSON: So -- but the president, when he says everyone will have health care, that sounds like a pretty simple thing to either say, yes or no, that is going to happen. \u00a0 (CROSSTALK) \u00a0 MULVANEY: We will look forward to doing that. \u00a0 DICKERSON: So, everyone will have health care at the end of this process. Let me ask you a question about this bill. Should House members who passed it go home and have town halls and campaign on it? \u00a0 MULVANEY: Absolutely, without reservation. In fact, I would be surprised if that is not exactly what they are doing. That's what I would do. In fact, I commented in this last four or five weeks. I think it's been four or five weeks since the health bill didn't come to a vote like we expected. And I sort of put my old Congress -- congressman hat on and said, I wouldn't want to go home and explain why we didn't vote on it. I would be ecstatic about going back and saying, look, here is what we did. Here is the process. Was it ugly? Yes, but did we get it done? Did we follow through on our promise to repeal in the House? Yes. No, I think it would be something that Republicans should run to, not run away from. \u00a0 DICKERSON: The president this week on the budget question said that we should have a good shutdown. What is a good shutdown? \u00a0 MULVANEY: Yes, I saw that tweet. In fact, I saw that tweet about two minutes before I walked in to do the press reports on the 2017 funding bill, but here is what I think it is. I think the president is frustrated that the process in Washington is broken. What we just did this week was fine and passable, but not ideal. The appropriations, the spending process, Congress using the power of the purse, has been broken here in Washington for more than 10 years. And I think a good shutdown will be one that can help fix that. It's part of that overall drain the swamp mentality about Washington, D.C. This president is willing to think outside of the box and do things differently around here in order to change Washington. And if that comes to a shutdown in September, so be it. \u00a0 DICKERSON: OK. Well, we will have you back in September and see if the lights are still on. Mr. Director, thanks so much for. \u00a0 MULVANEY: Well, face it, no one thought the lights would be on this week, but they were, so don't ever underestimate the president. \u00a0 DICKERSON: All right, thanks so much. \u00a0 MULVANEY: Thanks, John. \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON IN STUDIO: Earlier we traveled to Reading, Pennsylvania to talk to voters about the state of the nation. Located just outside of Philadelphia, Reading is part of a county that went for President Trump in the election. \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: Tom, your thoughts about our country's direction? \u00a0 TOM: Well, last Sunday on your show, President Trump said that war trumps trade. Well, in my view, war trumps all the other issues because if you look at the money that we've wasted, trillions and trillions of dollars, Donald Trump has surrounded himself with military people. To a hammer, every problem is a nail. To a general, every problem is a military strike. So from this perspective, and I'm sorry to say, I voted for President Trump because he made unequivocal commitments to stay out of Syria. He said that Barack Obama's plans to launch an attack were unconstitutional and illegal and he immediately does that on his own. \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: Dale, I want to get your thoughts about the direction of the country. \u00a0 DALE: Well, I thought over the last couple years we were headed in the right direction. I think a lot more people were being represented and shown more respect, particularly people\u2014LGBTQ people and that kind of thing now. And I think particularly now with the election of President Trump, it's\u2014I don't think it's going be that way anymore. \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: Susie. A word or a phrase that describes the country right now? \u00a0 SUSIE: Scary. \u00a0 TOM: Tenuous. \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: Jerry? \u00a0 JERRY: In deep trouble. \u00a0 CONSTANCE: Conflicted. \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: Barbara? \u00a0 BARBARA: Moving forward. \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: Dale? \u00a0 DALE: Divided. \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: Anthony? \u00a0 ANTHONY: Unsure. \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: Fred? \u00a0 FREDERICK: Divided. \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: Eliza? \u00a0 ELIZA: Uncertain. \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: Keith? \u00a0 KEITH: Divisive. \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: President Trump said he wanted an America first foreign policy. What's you\u2014as a Trump supporter, what have you thought of his foreign policy so far? \u00a0 KEITH: Good. Very good. \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: Were you a fan of his action in Syria? \u00a0 KEITH: Well, it's a tough one. I'm not against it. I think it sent a message. I think it was more of sending a message than it was in what it actually accomplished.\u00a0 I think a lot of things that Trump does are messages. The man's a lot smarter than we give him credit for, I think. \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: Anthony, you voted for President Trump. What did you expect when you voted for him, and what are you thinking now? \u00a0 ANTHONY: Well, me watching him on \"The Apprentice,\" seeing that he was no nonsense. And him being our president now, he still has that same attitude, where past presidents, problems overseas, they would take-- a slow approach like sending in troops on the ground and putting them in danger, where Donald Trump is, \"I'm just gonna blow you up.\" \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: Barbara, what do you think's the best thing the president has done? \u00a0 BARBARA: I think the best thing that he has done is provide the option for our military to seek medical treatment elsewhere when they cannot get in with the VA. I have-- three children in the military. And-- they're affected by that directly. \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: Dale, what do you think the president should know that he doesn't know? \u00a0 DALE: I think his focus has been on the media far too much. I think he commented in almost any interview I see. And I think he needs to realize that he's going to be reported on no matter what. So he should just do a good job, and then maybe they'll report good things about him instead of him being so concerned about his image. \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: Anthony, when he wakes up in the morning, what do you think the president thinks about? \u00a0 ANTHONY: What's the best tweet that he could put out. (LAUGH) Well, Donald Trump is trying to turn America around the best way he know how.\u00a0 Like he said, his job is a lot harder than he thought because it's not like running a business, where Donald Trump would fit more into a kingship than a president in a democracy because when you're a king, you make the rules. And that's the way Donald Trump thinks. But when he became president, there're rules that he has to follow. So he just can't do what he wanna do. \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: Keith, do you think the president tells the truth? \u00a0 KEITH: In his mind, definitely. I don't think he intentionally lies. I think he sometimes has trouble with facts. I think we all have trouble with facts when we try to convince people of understanding our position. \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: Eliza, what would you like to see happen with health care? \u00a0 ELIZA: I personally want to see a Medicare for all-- or a single payer option. I believe that that polls very high actually among the American people we have right now have the ACA, the Affordable Care Act. For now, I mean, that at least needs to stay intact. What the Republicans are planning to do right now is upsetting to me and many people-- because it basically would take away health care for people with pre-existing conditions. Or, you know, just outright deny, allow them to deny, or push premiums up. \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: Connie, what do you think about the state of-- of race relations in the-- in the Trump presidency? \u00a0 CONSTANCE: Since he's been elected there seems to be this rise in kind of-- people feel that they don't have to-- be civil and that they can do and say anything. Because he has such a persona of, \"I'm just going do and say whatever I feel.\" I think people have taken the lead from that and are acting it out and feel that they have support in that. And I-- I think that that's an awful way to be. \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON IN STUDIO: We'll be back in one minute with more of our focus group and their thoughts on the Democrats.   VIDEO LEAD IN: I was on the way to winning until the combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me but got scared off. \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON IN STUDIO: That was Hillary Clinton, speaking out about her loss to President Trump. The liberals in our focus group had some tough talk when it came to the Democrats. \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: Jack, what does the Democratic Party mean to you right now? \u00a0 JACK: Well, the Democratic Party has\u2014seems to be lost. And the reason they seem to be, to me, they seem to be lost is because they let the Republicans define who they are. \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: Connie, if you were giving an instruction manual to the Democratic Party to get their act (LAUGH) together what would you tell them to do? \u00a0 CONNIE: \u00a0They have to define who they are. They have to have a backbone about standing up for it and not be bought out by anyone or swayed because they think they might lose their office. They have to be willing to stand for it. If you're going to say, \"I'm standing for this,\" then you have to stand for it all the way \u00a0 JERRY: I think the Democrats, not only are they out of touch, they have no interest in correcting the situation. They're not doing any post mortems. They're writing off, \"Well, we don't own the White House because of Putin or because of WikiLeaks.\" What did WikiLeaks tell us, by the way? They-- regardless of who was behind it, they confirmed that Hillary Clinton and the Democratic establishment are liars. And that they had their thumb on the scale for-- you know, for Hillary Clinton. Well, you know, so what are they basically saying? \"If-- if we hadn't been caught lying, we'd be running the country right now.\" \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: Do any of you have a story that you hear about all the time that you think, \"This story is not important and I don't want to hear any more about it\"? \u00a0 BARBARA: We'll go with Russia, okay, because that was one of the things that's driving me absolutely mad. I think Russia has already been proven to not have had any impact on our elections. They did not, you know, drive from polling place to polling place and, you know, hoodwink the machines and whatever. And so to try to keep going on, that really makes the Democrats look a little desperate. \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: Eliza, do you trust that government can work in the best interests of the people, even if that's not where it is now? \u00a0 ELIZA: I definitely have faith in\u2014that we can get to where we need to go for the American people. I live in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. And just the outpouring of people who maybe didn't care about politics before, never really thought it mattered people have come out to voice their concerns, but also get active, get activated, get engaged. Go door to door, talk to their neighbors, find out, \"Hey, how are you feeling about what's going on, and do you want to make a difference?\" \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: Have you all generally seen an uptick in political activity in your neighborhoods? \u00a0 JERRY: Yes. \u00a0 \u00a0 JACK: Yes. \u00a0 \u00a0 BARBARA: Oh yeah. \u00a0 JACK: Definitely. \u00a0 BARBARA: Yup. Yup. \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: Since the election, Susie, has the shape of your congregation or the things you hear from parishioners changed? And, if so, how? \u00a0 SUSIE: I remember sitting around the table the Sunday after the women's march-- and having five different women sitting around that table, telling me about how they'd been in Washington the day before. And I was utterly amazed and pleased and happy. \u00a0\u00a0 FRED: \u00a0We're in Reading, Pennsylvania. And what people out there might not know is Reading is one of the poorest cities in the entire country. One thing I know people in my city are thinking about, and it's what this whole country's thinking about, when people are polled, the number one issue is jobs and the economy. The people in Reading, you know, they want good jobs. And I think that's one thing that the Democratic Party always talked about in the past. You know, they were supposed to be the party that represented the blue collar workers. And now, in this past election, you know, we didn't hear anything about jobs. Trump was the one talking about jobs, about, you know, the outsourcing problem, bringing back jobs. And I think one thing that the Democrats are so out of touch with America about is that you ask Democrats about jobs and what their solution is, and they have two solutions. Number one is raise taxes on the rich which, honestly, that does not create jobs. And number two thing they say is, \"We need to raise the minimum wage.\" People in Redding, Pennsylvania and everywhere don't wanna work at McDonald's their entire life. My dad, when I was younger, told me, \"When-- you grow up, I want you to get an education. I want you to do well so you don't need a $20 an hour factory job like I have.\" And now, people are saying, \"$20 an hour factory job? What even is that? \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: Jack, what gives you hope? \u00a0 JACK: Empathy. That is the word that brings all of this together. Caring about someone else. Caring about your party. Caring about your town. Caring about what other people think. Being civil. Caring about getting good jobs. Caring about the people that you're trying to help, to raise up. Empathy. Brings it all together. \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Thank you all very much for being here. \u00a0 (END VIDEOTAPE) \u00a0 DICKERSON: An extended version of our focus group is available on our Web site at FACETHENATION.com. \u00a0 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0 DICKERSON: We are joined by Democratic Senator Joe Manchin. He's in Charleston, West Virginia. Good morning, Senator. I wanted to pick up to on something that OMB Director Mulvaney said. He said there might be something called a good shutdown. What do you think of the notion of a good shutdown? \u00a0 SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D), WEST VIRGINIA: There is no good shutdown. There should not even be the talk of a shutdown. John, basically, we can do a C.R., a continuing resolution, for one day, we can do it for one week, we can do it for one month, but we should at least stay there and get our job done. Shutting it down puts too much, absolute -- too much absolute the agony on people. And it is just un-American. We should not do that. I have been through a shutdown, and it did not end well. And it wasn't good for anyone, and nobody gained a thing. So I hope we get the shutdown out of our vocabulary, get back to working, staying there and get our job done. \u00a0 DICKERSON: Director Mulvaney said that this process that led to the agreement that kept the government open until the fall was a bad process. Some people would look at it and say, well, the Democrats got something and the Republicans got something, and that is not altogether a bad thing, when there is bipartisan cooperation. \u00a0 MANCHIN: Well, they are just not used to bipartisan cooperation, and it's so far and few in between. They didn't know what to do it when they got it. Everybody worked on something. We took care of our military and made sure that's -- that was a big effort by many people on both sides of the aisle. But the Republican -- President Trump pushed that very hard. That was something that was needed, and we did that. There was other things we wanted to protect, basically, the well- being of people, basically, who have been left behind. In my state of West Virginia, a state that has done the heavy lifting for over 100 years, then the mining, provided the energy of the country, made the steel, built guns and ships, defend the country, we have done it all. And we have had a lot of big challenges lately, especially with the opiate addiction. We kept funding in for that. So, there's an awful lot of things that basically came out of this that was negotiated. It was a compromise. And that is something we should all be proud of. \u00a0 DICKERSON: Senator, you mentioned the opioid addiction. There was a report that the White House is thinking in its next budget of largely zeroing out the budget or cutting 95 percent of the budget of the White House drug czar. What is your feeling about that? \u00a0 MANCHIN: John, I would hope that that is not a serious consideration. This is -- this, in any other sense of the word, would be a pandemic. We have lost more Americans -- I have lost over 800 West Virginians in the last year, lost their lives to opiate and drug addiction. This is something that we have got to fight. But we have got to make sure that the FDA does not put more product on the market than is needed, the DEA is doing their job of policing it, that basically we have doctors being more educated and not passing them out like M&Ms. We need to have treatment centers that take care of people. We need to start basically education from kindergarten all the way through adulthood. We need to get involved and stop this epidemic that is going on that is just ravishing. For the first time, a lot of states have fallen below the amount of working people, percentage-wise, greater than those that are working. And that has never happened before. When you fall below 50 percent of your adults that should be working that aren't working, something is wrong. It is either addiction, conviction, or lack of skill sets. We have to attack this, John. And you don't cut 90 percent of the funding out of the greatest epidemic that we have ever had. \u00a0 DICKERSON: All right, Senator Manchin, we are going to talk to you in a moment after this short break we're going to take about health care and a few other topics. So, stay with us. We will be back with more from Senator Manchin. \u00a0 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0 DICKERSON: And we will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION, including our interview with former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and more from Senator Manchin and also our political panel. Stay with us. \u00a0 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0 DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We continue our conversation with West Virginia Democrat Senator Joe Manchin. Senator, what did you make of the health care bill that passed out of the House? \u00a0 MANCHIN: I couldn't believe it. I really couldn't from this standpoint. We are a state, and as I mentioned before, that's done a lot of heavy work for this country, heavy lifting for over 100 years. We have a lot of pre-existing conditions. I have a lot of people that are elderly. Every dynamic in every topography of my state gets absolutely slammed with this piece of legislation. So I said, the get rid of the word \"repeal\" and start talking about repairing. If they can get rid of the word \"repeal,\" John, we can sit down, Democrats and Republicans could work through this. We know that this bill needs to be fixed. The Affordable Care Act, there's not a Democrat that doesn't realize we need to work on the private market. But you're throwing the baby out with the bath water and then you're throwing insult to injury by giving $575 billion tax cut to the wealthiest Americans while you're cutting $880 billion of service to the poorest Americans. If you want more synergies there, you know, I said this before, John, we have given 20 million people -- 20 million people health care that never had, never bought, don't know the value. We never gave them one word of instructions how to use it, how to use it more effectively, how to use it more efficiently, how to keep themselves healthier, nutritional, lifestyles, changing their whole lifestyles, making them more accountable and responsible. There's tremendous savings. We're not trying anything. We're just throwing the baby out with the bath water in order to give a tax break. I just want to work and sit down and try to get something done, but no one's asked us. I understand that we have 13 Republican senators working on revamping the bill. Our congressional delegation says don't worry the Senate will fix it and no one's asked any Democrat. And I'm the more centrist Democrat willing to work and fix things if people really want to do it, but I can't do it with the threat of shutdown, repeal, throw it out. \u00a0 DICKERSON: I want to move on quickly, senator, to the Intelligence Committee, which you sit on. You've gotten some more information. The CIA has given some briefings. Is there -- what's your view on any proof? Have you seen anything that suggests any conclusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign? \u00a0 MANCHIN: Well, there's an awful lot of smoke there, let's put it that way, people that might have said they were involved, to what extent they were involved, to what extent the president might have known about these people or whatever. There's nothing there from that standpoint that we have seen directly linking our president to any of that. But with the other thing being said, there's an awful lot of people surrounding that, whether it be Mike Flynn, Carter Page, Manafort, all these people of high interest. We're going to find out. This is going to be done. And the Senate, as I said before, is the workhorse of this operation, the Senate Intelligence Committee. When Carter Page says he wants to basically be cooperating and all of a sudden we get another message, strange message, saying, well, if you want to know what's going on, check with the Obama or President Obama or his administration. That's not the way to conduct a thorough investigation to get to the bottom, to see if you had, you know, any concerns that we might have of your -- your involvement with the -- the Russians. We know the Russians did everything they could to be involved in our campaign. We know that what they're doing around the world right now, whether it be in France or other parts of the world, they'll do anything they can to disrupt any type of a freedom, if you will, or a democracy or an involvement where there's an orderly transfer of power. That's not for them. \u00a0 DICKERSON: All right. \u00a0 MANCHIN: They're going to do what they can. We've got to make sure we stop it. \u00a0 DICKERSON: All right, Senator Manchin, thank you so much for being with us. And joining us now is former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. She's got a new book out. It's titled \"Democracy: Stories From the Long Road to Freedom.\" Welcome, Madam Secretary. \u00a0 CONDOLEEZZA RICE, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: Thank you. \u00a0 DICKERSON: It's very good to have you here. \u00a0 RICE: It's great to be with you. \u00a0 DICKERSON: Senator Manchin and I were just talking about Russia, so I'll start there with the question to you, which is, help Americans who have heard all the political talk of Russia, how should Americans think about Russia and America's national security interests? \u00a0 RICE: Well, we have to think about Russia in terms of the last several years under Vladimir Putin. And I think what we're seeing is the president of Russia who has established authoritarianism at home and assertiveness and aggressiveness abroad, he really believes that he is re-establishing Russian greatness, that he has Russia back in the game. But the most important thing is that he hasn't seemed to respected certain lines in going that. And the most important thing is to re-establish that the United States is going to defend its allies in NATO under Article 5, an attack upon one is an attack upon all. That the United States will not countenance the Russian military threatening our forces by flying very close to our ships or to our planes. I think rebuilding the defense budget has helped to send that signal. And, by the way, the strike in Syria has helped to send the signal that the United States is going to get leverage back in the Middle East. And so this is a dangerous time with the Russians, but it could also be, once we've established the ground rules, there are many things we need to cooperate with the Russians on, including, by the way, the most vexing problem of North Korea where they too can't be too comforted by a reckless North Korean leader with missiles and nuclear weapons that can reach Russia, as well as eventually the United States. \u00a0 DICKERSON: I want to get to North Korea in a second, but you write in your book about Russia being a tide that has gone deep into Europe when it's powerful and receded when it's weak. Where is America in terms of breaking that tide? I mean is it halfway there, a quarter of the way there? \u00a0 RICE: Well, we've always hoped that the Russians would see their role in the world as one built on the respect that comes from economic power, from soft power. But, unfortunately, it's turned to military power again to establish itself. And I do think that we've -- we've begun to say to the Russians, for instance, what President Obama did to put rotating forces in the Baltic states and in Poland, that was a good message to the Russians that certain things are not acceptable. The strike in Syria was a good message, but we need to continue to send strong messages about Ukraine and other places that we're not going to countenance a Russia that is aggressive against allies and -- and states that -- that shouldn't be threatened by their neighbors. \u00a0 DICKERSON: On North Korea, what should America not countenance? What is the -- what is the tipping point for -- \u00a0 RICE: Well, a lot has happened, John, in the last several years. This is now a -- a different regime that even under Kim Jong-il, the father. Kim Jong-un is reckless, maybe even a bit unstable. He has made improvements in his nuclear capabilities that look as if he's getting closer to a deliverable nuclear weapon. And perhaps in -- and I don't know what they're telling the president because I don't have the intelligence -- but three, five years, the ability to reach the United States. That cannot be countenanced by any American president. I don't care who's in the White House. In order to deal with that, you have to change the Chinese calculus, and I think that's what the administration's trying to do. They've worried most about the collapse of the regime and their long border and instability on their border. But you have to say to them, even if you have to take very tough steps that might ultimately collapse the regime, you have to take steps because we will if you don't. And I think that's the message that you're starting -- starting to see. \u00a0 DICKERSON: In your book you are making the case for democracy. We have a president who talks about America first. We have a lot of Americans who are wary of U.S. entanglements overseas. Make the case for democracy to those who would be in the more, hey, let's just not fuss with the overseas stuff. RICE: Well, the first thing is to remember what democracy promotion is not. It is -- it's not what we did in Iraq and Afghanistan. That -- those were security issues that we felt we had to solve. And then we said, once we've overthrown those dictators, we need to give those people a chance toward democracy. But most of democracy promotion is really about supporting those within their countries that want to have the simple freedoms that we have, the right to say what you think, to worship as you please, to be free from the knock of the secret police at night, places like Liberia and the Ukraine and other places that are trying to get there. Now, Americans should recognize that of course we're going to defend our interests, but in the long run our interests are better served when we have democracies that don't hire child soldiers, that don't harbor terrorists as a matter of state policy, that don't traffic in human beings, that don't start wars with one another. The quintessential example of this is that we took a risk after World War II that a democratic Germany would never threaten its neighbors, that democratic Japan would never threaten its neighbors, and now not only have they not threatened their neighbors, they are firm allies and they are pillars of international stability. Democracy takes time. One of the points that I make in the book is, it took us a long time. That first American Constitution counted my ancestors as three-fifths of a man. That first American Constitution didn't provide my father the right to vote in 1952 in Birmingham, Alabama. But I took an oath of allegiance to the same Constitution as a black woman secretary of state with a Jewish woman Supreme Court justice swearing me in. Democracy takes time and we have to be a little bit more patient and a little bit more helpful in speaking out for those who are still trying to get there. \u00a0 DICKERSON: Well, let me ask you about that, because in -- because President Trump, whether it's Erdogan in Turkey, or al-Sisi in Egypt, or Putin in Russia, the -- the -- the sound of freedom does not seem to come often in conversations with him. Is there a cost for that? \u00a0 RICE: Well, I think it's early in the administration. There's something about the presidency that you recognize over time the tremendous -- not just responsibility, but the weight that it carries. And of course we're going to have to deal with the president of Egypt. Of course we're going to have to deal with the president of Turkey. But it's well to remember too that our interests and our values suggest that when countries that we have good relations with and want good relations with actually reform before there are revolutions our interests are served too. And I think that if the United States -- and democracy promotion actually is very often not very expensive. It's supporting elections, supporting the building of civil societies, supporting a free press abroad. So I have no problem with the president meeting with those leaders. He has to. But we always need to speak for our values as well. And our values are the belief that we were endowed with certain rights by our creator. It can't be true for just us and not for them. \u00a0 DICKERSON: Final question, is this president, like all presidents, is bristling against the constraints of democracy that you write a lot about in here. That has caused him to say critical things of the judiciary, of the press, and of Congress and the pace with which they work. How does that play for other countries that say, you see, you're -- you've got a messiness over there. Don't come tell us about how to do this. \u00a0 RICE: Well, there's no doubt that presidents get to be presidents and then they realize that the founding fathers put all kinds of constraints on the presidency, a Congress, courts, civil society, a press, not to mention Americans who are kind of ungovernable anyway. And it can be frustrating. But I think that when I talk to others who are making (INAUDIBLE), I say it's also safest when the executive is actually constrained. That's what the founding fathers understood. They also understood that democracies are not perfect. We are imperfect, but our message to the world -- in many ways our best message to the world, is that you just get up every day and you keep working to overcome those imperfections. And when you do that, you get a chance to enjoy these amazing liberties. And so I'm very grateful to the founding fathers for having given us these institutions. I hope we can encourage others to have the same. \u00a0 DICKERSON: All right, Secretary Rice, thank you so much for being with us. \u00a0 RICE: Thank you. \u00a0 DICKERSON: And we'll be back with our political panel. \u00a0 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0 DICKERSON: We turn now to our political panel. Susan Page is the Washington bureau chief of \"USA Today,\" Michael Gerson is a columnist at \"The Washington Post,\" Nancy Cordes is a CBS News chief congressional correspondent, and Jamelle Bouie is a CBS News political analyst and \"Slate\" magazine's chief political correspondent. Michael Gerson, I want to start with you quickly picking up on Condoleezza Rice, with whom you worked. The threat to democracy all over the world now and -- is -- is a big story and it's taking place in France as there's an election today. \u00a0 MICHAEL GERSON, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": Yes, it's true and American policy in Europe, for example, has been democracy and unity for seven decades. There's a reason for that. Because in every country you have a conflict between identity and idealism, between kind of blood and soil, nationalism and transnational ideals. And in the 20th century, all the worst defense of the 20th century took place because of the triumph of identity over idealism in Europe. So I think there's a very direct interest that everybody has in the outcome of these kind of debates. \u00a0 DICKERSON: What are you watching, Jamelle, in the outcome of the French election that Americans might care about? \u00a0 JAMELLE BOUIE, CBS NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: I am watching to see how well the National Front and Le Pen do in today's elections. I think the -- the convention wisdom right now is that the National Front will end up falling short of winning -- winning the election. But getting to the second round, its share of the vote, those are actually very significant events for French political history and it will -- it will be a sign perhaps of currents in French politics and in European politics whether Le Pen does, as the polls suggest, are better. \u00a0 DICKERSON: Power of that nationalism Michael was talking about. Susan Page, back here in America, health care. The winners and the losers from that, from the House success? \u00a0 SUSAN PAGE, \"USA TODAY\": So big winners, I think, Paul Ryan and Donald Trump. Big losers, Paul Ryan and Donald Trump. What would we be saying this morning if they had failed to get this through the House/. It would be devastating politically. But when you get to the substance, they now own the American health care system. And you heard the budget director and other administration officials and the president making promises they will not be able to keep, that everyone will be covered, that premiums will go down, that deductibles will go down, that people with pre-existing conditions will not lose any of their protections. That combination of things cannot happen. \u00a0 DICKERSON: Nancy, it came together fast, it felt like, at the end. \u00a0 NANCY CORDES, CBS NEWS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It did. \u00a0 DICKERSON: Give us a sense of what the process tells us about where things stand. \u00a0 CORDES: Well, they had to strike when the iron was hot. They couldn't let their members go once they thought that they had the magic numbers. So you first had this compromise between a moderate member and conservative members that seemed to bring a lot of the Freedom Caucus on board but left a lot of moderates steaming mad. They felt that some of those protections that Susan just talked about had been eroded. Along comes Fred Upton with yet another amendment that puts a little more money into pre- existing conditions. And that gave some political cover to these moderates who felt that the bill was never going to be perfect in the House but they just needed to get it out of the House, get it to the Senate, you know, to fulfill a big promise that they've been making for the past seven years, which was that they were going to repeal Obamacare. \u00a0 DICKERSON: Michael, what did you make of that ceremony in the Rose Garden? You know from White House ceremonies. What did you make of it? \u00a0 GERSON: Well, I think it's a victory dance on the 50-yard line. I think when you do that, it's not a sign of strength, it's actually a -- a kind of pathetic desire for praise. So I think that was premature and this -- you know, the House is really relying on the Senate to come through here. They put out something that did meet all of those standards of the members, but was not coherent in the end. They are, I think, depending on the Senate, led by Senator Alexander, to provide some coherence in this -- in the Republican approach. \u00a0 DICKERSON: Now, what do they -- there are plenty of hurdles among Republicans in the Senate. This is a Republican show over there. What are the hurdles? \u00a0 BOUIE: That hurdles are Medicaid, right? That quite a few Republican senators want to preserve some measure of Medicaid coverage, the Medicaid expansion. During recess earlier in the year, there were many angry town halls involving constituents who wanted to preserve those Medicaid expansions. And the House bill cuts hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicaid, and although the budget director suggested that there would not be any coverage loss as a result of those cuts, the plain fact is that, in fact, many people will lose coverage as a result of those Medicaid cuts. So one major hurdle is what -- what the Senate is going to do about Medicaid and how will Senate Republicans deal with the fact that many of them come from states where large number of constituents have picked up coverage from the Medicaid expansion. \u00a0 CORDES: And there's a hurdle that's just plain logistical, which is the fact that Republicans can only afford to lose two of their members in the Senate. \u00a0 BOUIE: Right. \u00a0 CORDES: And it's very hard at this point to envision a bill that would satisfy Rand Paul and Ted Cruz and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. Both Susan Collins and Rand Paul said this week the House bill is dead, but for completely different reasons. He thinks it leaves too much of Obamacare intact. She thinks it takes too much of Obamacare away. How does the Senate craft a bill that satisfies these two wings of the party when you have this incredibly small margin of error? \u00a0 PAGE: But, of course, we should remember that Democrats faced big divides when they passed the Affordable Care Act as well. And -- and when you deal with something that's as big and complicated as the American health care system, you're going to end up with people accepting things that they start out thinking aren't acceptable. The thing that Republicans have going for them is that they've been -- made this promise for seven years, as you said, and there is a big impetus to deliver on it. And I don't know if they'll be able to deliver on it or not, but there are going to be huge consequences for either delivering or not delivering on them and that may be the best argument that Republicans have going forward. \u00a0 DICKERSON: Michael, what do you make of the president, his signature talent? He said he would come to Washington and be a negotiator of a kind no one had ever seen before. Assess his negotiating in this case but also in what he's got to do in the Senate process. GERSON: Well, it was a unique view of the presidential role. Usually a president will come in with some of his own ideas and try to sell a bunch of people in the Congress on them. He did not do that in this -- in this case. All he wanted was a bill passed. The goal was something, not something with these parameters. And so I think that is very different than -- than presidents have done in the past. \u00a0 DICKERSON: Jamelle, Democrats are running ads now attacking Republicans. They are -- they raised a lot of money. Sort through the politics. Are they right or are they a little premature here? \u00a0 BOUIE: I don't think they're too premature. If -- if the American Health Care Act passes in its current form, if it becomes law in the current form, which likely isn't going to happen let's say -- let's say, well, what the House voted for, all of a sudden millions of Americans will, once again, be open to a scenario where their insurers charge sort of impossibly higher rates for pre-existing conditions. And so while it might be technically true that the bill doesn't deny anyone coverage on the basis of pre-existing conditions, it is certainly true that people will certainly no longer be able to afford their coverage. And that is a very potent attack line. I want to -- I want to quickly go to something Susan said. It's totally true that during the Affordable Care Act fight there were these big divisions among Democrats about how much they were going to spend for coverage, so on and so forth. But there was one unifying principle, and it was basically everyone in the Democratic Party agreed that the government had some fundamental responsibility to the public for health insurance. And that -- that agreement doesn't exist among Republicans, and I think that's the sticking point. And it's a tough thing to -- to get around. PAGE: And you said that -- that if this is passed in its current form there will be these political problem for Republicans. The Republicans who voted for this in the House can have ads run against them on the basis of this vote, even if this plan goes nowhere. \u00a0 BOUIE: Right. \u00a0 CORDES: Right. \u00a0 DICKERSON: Right. \u00a0 PAGE: And we know that there are, what, 23 seats held by Republicans -- \u00a0 BOUIE: Right. \u00a0 PAGE: In districts that Hillary Clinton carried. Those are going to be the prime target for the next 18 months. \u00a0 CORDES: And the disinteresting thing about these ads isn't just the damage that they could do in advance of 2018, which is still 18 months away. But they're also to send a message to Senate Republicans, look at the kind of heat that you're going to get if you put together a bill that hurts Medicaid, that hurts people with pre-existing conditions. There are 24 House Republicans who are going to start facing those ads tomorrow, and even more facing radio ads in California. This is designed to, you know, to pave the way for 2018, but even more so right now to send the message to Senate Republicans who are getting to work. \u00a0 GERSON: In an odd way this is the victory of President Obama. I think he has ingrained expectations -- \u00a0 BOUIE: Right. \u00a0 GERSON: In the American public about pre-existing condition, about universal coverage and about costs, affordable costs, that are not going to be met by Republicans, in this case. They were not really met by Obamacare either, when you had higher premiums and higher deductibles at the same time for a lot of people. So -- but I -- these expectations are now ingrained and you wonder, what is -- what's the road that doesn't keep us from going to single payer eventually because -- given those assumptions? \u00a0 BOUIE: That's -- that's real interesting because for a lot of liberal Democrats, and for a lot of Democrats on the left, Obamacare was a very flawed compromise. It was sort of this middling path between -- because that's what they thought they had to do to get something approaching universal coverage. And it's clear that the Republican Party will never accept any kind of compromise on this. And so I think for the Democratic left there's a new argument, right, that next time we have power, why not go for Medicare for all? What are -- what are the practical reasons not to do it, but the political reason not to do it, and looking at how House Republicans got this bill through. Why do we have to go through all the rigmarole that we did last time if -- if -- if the Republicans didn't? And that's where I think the GOP has opened itself up to perhaps a backlash that it might not be anticipating policy wise. \u00a0 DICKERSON: Nancy, the Freedom Caucus, the conservatives in the House, fought and got what they wanted for this House bill. The Senate bill's going to come back to them, maybe. \u00a0 CORDES: Right. \u00a0 DICKERSON: Why are they going to agree to a bill that's gotten more moderate when it went over to the Senate? \u00a0 CORDES: There's, you know, no guarantee that they will. I think that the Senate is going to have to make a calculation at some point, who are we trying to win over with this bill in the House? Is it going to be the Freedom Caucus or is it going to be the GOP moderates? You know, they can afford to lose members of one group, but probably not both. And so, you know, that's going to be part of the -- the political process here. Not only how do we win over Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski or Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. And probably at some point they're going to have to go in a direction that's going to make one of those two wings unhappy, and it's going to play out the same way in the House. \u00a0 DICKERSON: All right, we're going to have to go in a direction toward the commercial. So, thanks to all of you. And we'll be back in a moment. \u00a0 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0 DICKERSON: That's it for us today. Thanks for watching. Next week we'll hear from former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. For FACE THE NATION, I'm John Dickerson.      i",

            "article_content": "Is the world ready to defend against the next big infectious disease outbreak? It\u2019s one of the biggest threats humanity could face. But experts who have reviewed reports on the global response to the massive Ebola outbreak that swept through West African countries for two years starting in 2014 say we\u2019re \u201cgrossly underprepared\u201d to handle a similar health crisis.\u00a0 A team headed by Dr. Suerie Moon, director of research at the Global Health Centre at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, published their findings from a review of seven major post-Ebola reports in the medical journal The BMJ at the end of January. The team concluded that, while progress has clearly been made by the world\u2019s governments and the World Health Organization (WHO), for instance, there are gaps that could still leave millions of people at risk. \u201cI would say the biggest surprise from our findings was that there are some areas where there has been nothing done. There is a lot of agreement among the various reports, and certainly the reports focused on different aspects of what went wrong between lots of people from lots of organizations,\u201d Moon told CBS News. \u201cWhile there is a lot of agreement, there are certain areas that have been neglected.\u201d The research team\u2019s findings cited a wide range of \u201cneglected\u201d areas, from the organizational failings at WHO to the ways in which other countries respond when news of an Ebola-type outbreak hits international media. For instance, Moon cited trade and travel restrictions that are often imposed when an outbreak is declared, often to the detriment of the affected country. The natural reaction is often \u201coverreacted panic,\u201d she said, spurring nations to \u201c[put] in place a number of restrictions that don\u2019t make sense.\u201d\u00a0 This kind of panic can have \u201chuge repercussions in countries where the outbreak has been detected.\u201d It can make leaders less willing to share information in the first place, a reaction fueled by fears over the economic consequences of disclosing the problem. And that silence can be dangerous \u2014 allowing an outbreak to fester and spread. In January 2016,\u00a0WHO declared that the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history had come to an end, though it warned it would take several months before the world could be deemed conclusively free from the disease. The outbreak had claimed more than 11,300 lives since the\u00a0first cases were detected in Guinea in March 2014.\u00a0 The vast majority of the deaths happened in Guinea and its neighbors Liberia and Sierra Leone \u2014 but in our age of easy global air travel, no corner of the world was immune. The first American case sparked panic nationwide and a number of drastic measures including quarantines\u00a0to try to contain the threat. Moon said the experience points out how important it is for the U.S. to work with other countries on this issue. \u201cInternational collaboration is an important pillar for protecting the health of Americans,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not only about giving money \u2014 there really is an important self-interest rationale here in that this can impact Americans\u2019 health.\u201d She urged the new administration to pay attention to the lessons of the past in preparing for the future. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial that the U.S. government and other countries of the world don\u2019t forget about these countries several years after the outbreak hits its peak. There is a real risk that comes from people forgetting. It\u2019s important to issue a wakeup call to policy makers \u2014 for instance, in the United States you have a new president who never dealt with Ebola in office before, so it\u2019s important to remind him and his advisors that there is a lot that remains to be addressed.\u201d\u00a0 Another huge flaw Moon and her team pinpointed in their report was the fact that there is no \u201cmonitoring mechanism\u201d in place to track various groups\u2019 responses to outbreaks. Without a \u201ccentralized public information source,\u201d she said, people will remain more vulnerable when future outbreaks hit. \u201cWe need people to invest in monitoring what is happening \u2014 we have no good accountability in place,\u201d she added. \u201cYou end up having to do a lot of detective work to examine what has been done and what is being done, and it shouldn\u2019t be that hard.\u201d Moon also noted that the worst-hit countries are often those left very poor after years of internal conflicts. With few resources and weak public health systems, they are highly susceptible to outbreaks spreading out of control. Yet WHO finds itself in a difficult position, as an agency within the United Nations, \u201chesitant to take on some challenging political decisions that might upset leaders in these countries,\u201d Moon suggested. While things have improved \u2014 WHO\u2019s response to last year\u2019s\u00a0Zika\u00a0outbreak met with less criticism \u2014 the response to Ebola has set the tone for the organization\u2019s own Director-General election that will come July 1. Running for the role are Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of Ethiopia, David Nabarro of the U.K., and Sania Nishtar of Pakistan. \u201cThe new DG (Director-General) will certainly continue to prioritize on-going change and improvements, particularly in health emergencies,\u201d according to a statement WHO provided to CBS News. \u201cYou can see this in the platforms of all three candidates.\u201d A lot of the criticisms that WHO faced in its sluggish Ebola response centered on what was perceived as wide-reaching bureaucratic bungling. From the inability to contain a pandemic as it spread easily through porous national borders, to WHO\u2019s conflicts with local governments, the Ebola crisis was the perfect storm of what happens when ineffective institutional practices collide with a deadly infectious disease outbreak. While facing the brunt of scrutiny, WHO wasn\u2019t the only organization derided for its response to the crisis. For instance, San Francisco-based Metabiota Inc., a company founded to track just this kind of emergency epidemic, was called out for adding to the chaos. A 2016 investigation by the Associated Press revealed that internal warring between company staff members and responders led to some misdiagnosed Ebola cases. The company was chosen by WHO and the government of Sierra Leone to track the virus\u2019s spread. Dr. Leslie Roberts, a professor of population and family health at the Columbia University Medical Center, was actually on the ground for WHO as its foreign medical coordinator in Sierra Leone during some of the outbreak\u2019s darkest days. Roberts had worked for WHO before \u2014 he was an epidemiologist in Rwanda in 1994 during that country\u2019s genocide and civil war. Roberts told CBS News that he headed to Sierra Leone starting in September 2014 for a three-month period, returning again for about six to eight weeks after his spring 2015 semester teaching obligations at Columbia were finished. In Sierra Leone alone, there were 8,706 recorded cases of Ebola and 3,956 people died, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The highly contagious infection spread from patients to family caregivers and by way of the country\u2019s burial traditions, which involved loved ones rinsing the bodies of the deceased before clothing and often kissing them. Of course, putting a stop to risky traditional practices can set up a culture clash between a community\u2019s customs and global medical protocols \u2014 a difficult balancing act for an organization like WHO, Roberts said. He said this kind of tug-of-war could very easily make the next big pandemic worse. Roberts said, from his perspective, WHO did an effective job of training responders as well as providing outreach to affected communities. That being said, Roberts acknowledged WHO was \u201cnot the most effective machine at stopping this outbreak.\u201d Pandemics as global security threats What happens next time a health crisis threatens to spiral out of control?\u00a0 Moon said an \u201cideal system\u201d would \u201csee all countries of the world have some basic level of preparedness\u201d when there seems to be a \u201csuspicious pattern of infectious disease.\u201d\u00a0 But it\u2019s not just about medical practices \u2014 some experts say governments need to view pandemics as security threats. \u201cThe Neglected Dimension of Global Security,\u201d a 2016 report from public health officials published by the National Academy of Medicine, looks at how the wave of large-scale infectious disease outbreaks over the past few decades \u2014 not just Ebola, but others like HIV/AIDS and SARS \u2014 exposed how economically and politically vulnerable nations are in the face of the ravages of future pandemics. The report finds that a range of factors, from growing population numbers to environmental degradation to increasing economic globalization, have shifted the dynamics of how disease outbreaks can affect countries.\u00a0 \u201cWe have not done nearly enough to prevent or prepare for such potential pandemics,\u201d Peter Sands, the commission\u2019s chair, wrote in the preface. \u201cWhile there are certainly gaps in our scientific defenses, the bigger problem is that leaders at all levels have not been giving these threats anything close to the priority they demand.\u201d\u00a0 Sands called this the \u201cneglected dimension of global security.\u201d\u00a0 This report essentially places global pandemics on the same level of seriousness as a military assault on a country.\u00a0 Since pandemics are generally viewed as \u201chealth problems\u201d rather than \u201csecurity risks,\u201d the study argues that public health departments tend to put outbreak preparedness on the back burner. Rather than building up defenses as one would for a war or a terrorist attack, potential pandemics are relatively ignored.\u00a0 The commission issued 10 recommendations for building more effective public health resources in countries that are particularly prone to being decimated by an Ebola-level pandemic, such as developing universal benchmarks for preparedness that nations have to meet. Economic assistance for at-risk countries is also needed \u2014and the report argues that money spent on preparedness would more than pay for itself. For instance, the study contends that if nations invested $4.5 billion a year to safeguard against the next major outbreak, $60 billion a year in losses from future pandemics could be avoided.\u00a0 When an outbreak emerges, Moon said it\u2019s essential that drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics are \u201cready to be deployed and ready for people who are affected immediately.\u201d But many financial and geopolitical factors can stand in the way. \u201cA good example is H1N1,\u201d she said, referring to the global bird flu scare in 2009. \u201cYou had some countries actually hoarding vaccine supplies, and some of the vaccines limited in volume did not reach the countries hit hardest by H1N1.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWe don\u2019t have any system in place still to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d One potential roadblock she sees is the current rise of nationalism in Western nations that would normally take the lead in developing and distributing vaccines in times of need. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that this current administration in the U.S. is not concerned about the importance of ensuring that drugs and vaccines could be quickly sent to other places where people are affected,\u201d Moon stressed. \u201cOf course, the reality, ironically, is that this is what is needed to protect Americans around the world. \u2018America First,\u2019 if it is going to diminish the need to respond quickly around the world, could hurt other Americans.\u201d Roberts echoed those thoughts given that much of Europe, including Great Britain, seems to be moving in an \u201cisolationist mindset along with the United States.\u201d He said this could have dire consequences when it comes to public health. \u201cEradicating smallpox cost a lot, but it now pays for itself every month. Look, if we could fund for research that would identify multiple drug-resistant strains of pathogens before they show up, or if we could understand, say, Zika, before it comes here \u2014 wow. That would make America a lot safer,\u201d he asserted.\u00a0 \u201cIsolationism is not financially beneficial, and in terms of the risks of outbreaks of disease, it\u2019s not a constructive path for us to be following in this moment of time to keep diseases at bay.\u201d The cost of a major pandemic could be catastrophic. If an outbreak the scope of the Spanish influenza of 1918 \u2014 which resulted in more than 50 million deaths worldwide \u2014 were to spring up today, the global economic damage would pile up into the trillions of dollars, on top of the toll in human lives, according to the 2016 commission report. Moon summed up the shortcomings: \u201cLook, we don\u2019t have good monitoring to actually know how ready or not ready we are. We still need to invest a whole lot more. And there is still the need for more investment to build up WHO\u2019s capacity. WHO remains deeply underfunded in carrying out the pretty big mandate that we, as the world, have put on it.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThe headline really is: \u2018We are not ready.\u2019\u201d Brian Mastroianni covers science and technology for CBSNews.com",

            "article_content": "Let\u2019s start with an easy one: What does a Republican believe?  Well, maybe not so easy. In the Reagan and Bush eras, there was a rather simple answer for what the GOP wanted: a hawkish foreign policy, limited government, and social conservatism -- the various factions all living under one Big Tent.  But by 2012, the year Rick Santorum and Ron Paul both commanded large subsections of the Republican base, it was becoming increasingly hazy what the GOP stood for, and how it could translate that message into something electable at the national level.  It turned out a guy with no political experience \u2013 one who had spent much of his life as a liberalish New York Democrat \u2013 had the answer to that riddle. Donald Trump, guided by his strategist Steve Bannon, figured out how to cobble together a winning message with a hodgepodge of ideological parts.  Trump\u2019s formula was inelegant, and remains so. But from a vote-getting standpoint, it also worked.  But even as the party\u2019s base has become increasingly unpredictable and non-doctrinaire in its opinions, the Republican governing class has become in recent years more rigid. With the retirement of John Boehner, Paul Ryan became not only the party\u2019s chief ideologist but its political leader in Washington.  Washington Republicans, with their tax-cutting zeal and love of open markets, always saw the GOP base as an extension of themselves. This is the major reason that they never thought Trump could win the primary, let alone the general.  And it was the hope of Ryan\u2019s fellow ideologues that Congressional Republicans would essentially run the government, at least from a domestic policy standpoint, once the GOP retook the White House. As the conservative power broker Grover Norquist said in 2012, the job of the next Republican president would be \u201cto sign the legislation that has already been prepared.\u201d The legislation is indeed ready to sign. But when Norquist made that comment, it\u2019s unlikely he was imagining Trump would be the guy with the pen.  How much of the GOP agenda is Trump really willing to expend political capital on? He must know he wasn\u2019t voted in to enact Medicare reform, an idea without a constituency that is nonetheless near to Ryan\u2019s heart and central to his thinking.\u00a0 Trump also promised not to let people die on the street during his presidency. How will he square that with an Obamacare repeal that puts an industry-friendly scheme in its place?  Or what about industrial policy, this practice of the government intervening to help manufacturing-sector workers, which Trump has fully embraced in practice before even taking office? Does anyone think Trump will stop attempting to keep manufacturing jobs here, even though doing so flies in the face of free-market orthodoxy his party embraces?  Deals can be hardened out of small-ball disagreements. But we are talking about major, fundamental disagreements. There is a looming Republican schism and it\u2019s about more than Trump\u2019s lack of philosophical mooring. It is about two very different visions of what the GOP should be.  Ryan rose in the Republican ranks by being an attractive, articulate ideologue in a party that was supposed to be all about ideology. The Trump-Bannon formulation of how the GOP should work, however, is not really ideological at all. It\u2019s about getting better results for certain economic and demographic groups, presumably at the expense of others.  Like most ideologies, modern conservatism insists that it contains the best set of policies for everyone: rich and poor, white and black, and so on. It\u2019s difficult to know how many people actually believe all that, but it\u2019s been the central message of the GOP for decades.  Bannon, meanwhile, has a habit of describing politics as a zero-sum game between competing groups, namely working- and middle-class Americans versus an ascendant elite class. And the populism Bannon talks about is, in a sense, neither left nor right, and instead all about serving the interests of the downwardly-mobile.  \u201cTrump is a builder,\u201d as Bannon said to Bloomberg\u2019s Joshua Green this fall. \u201cAnd what he\u2019s built is the underlying apparatus for a political movement that\u2019s going to propel us to victory on Nov. 8 and dominate Republican politics after that.\u201d And this movement, Bannon has made clear, is not about enacting the Ryan agenda. It\u2019s about displacing Ryanism, and the whole modern conservative project, with populism and economic nationalism. \u00a0 \u201cThe conservatives are going to go crazy,\u201d is how Bannon put it to Michael Wolff after the election. \u201cI\u2019m the guy pushing a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan. With negative interest rates throughout the world, it\u2019s the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything. Shipyards, ironworks, get them all jacked up. We\u2019re just going to throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks.\u201d  So what does a Republican believe? It\u2019s hard to say. There is now a Party of Trump and a Party of Ryan. The former rejects ideological rigidity in favor of policies it sees as beneficial to Middle Americans. The latter is ideological in the extreme, the end result of decades of conservative movement insistence that the path to victory was paved by intellectual seriousness and a deluge of policy white papers. In the short term, there are ways for these two camps to live together peacefully within the GOP. There will be alliances of convenience between them, particularly when it comes to overturning President Obama\u2019s agenda and lowering taxes.\u00a0  But eventually the two sides will go to war, and one will come to dominate Republican politics after that. And that\u2019s because the disagreements are simply too profound to allow for any other outcome.  Trump\u2019s and Bannon\u2019s vision is diametrically opposed to Ryan\u2019s, and at some point both sides will run out of compromises they\u2019re willing to make. The Big Tent simply won\u2019t be big enough for all of them.\u00a0 Will Rahn is a political correspondent and managing director, politics, for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "\"To abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe, to refuse the obligations of international leadership for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems is as unpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history.\" -- Sen. John McCain, Oct. 16  Actually, Senator McCain, I prefer my nationalists \"half-baked.\" Because the alternative could be the\u00a0whole\u00a0loaf.  If Sen. McCain's speech is aligned with the thinking of the GOP establishment, Republicans may need to take a look at their party and step back. Attacking nationalism and populism as illegitimate, insulting its advocates (\"people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems\") and calling them \"unpatriotic?\" This feeds right into the message of the Talk-Right and Steve Bannon to disaffected voters: Establishment Republicans don't like you, don't understand you, and they don't want to.  A reminder, Senator McCain: The last time GOP voters felt this way, they nominated\u00a0Donald Trump.  No matter how much John McCain or Hillary Clinton hate it, there's a populist movement in American politics on both the right and left, evident in both Bernie Sanders' and Donald Trump's candidacies.  And is it a coincidence that the party that chose the populist is the one that elected a president?  Global politics is experiencing a populist moment. Austria just elected Europe's youngest leader, 31-year-old Sebastian Kurz, head of the \"People's Party\" (hint, hint). Populist and nationalist parties have made gains from the Netherlands to Italy. And in perhaps the most \"nationalist\" moment of all, the people of Catalonia just voted to break away from Spain to make their own nation.  Ross Douthat of the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0made an interesting observation in a recent Ricochet.com podcast:\u00a0 In Europe, populism is part of virtually every center-Right coalition. For years they've been smaller and subsumed into broader-based parties, but that strain of politics\u2014\"[insert nation name here] First!\"\u2014has always been part of the mix.\u00a0 And now it's on the rise.  The vision that McCain and others establishment members espouse of a center-right American movement that rejects populism would be a radical exception. In fact, when candidates like pro-Trump right-winger Luther Strange are \"too establishment\" to win a GOP primary in Alabama, a populist-free GOP seems unimaginable.  And if Republicans want to actually win elections, it may be downright undesirable.  This is why Sen. McCain's rejection of \"half-baked\" populism is so ironic. The lesson of the past 18 months is that, if the GOP establishment had bothered to take some half-measures to address the anger of the populist right, they might have been able to pull them\u00a0into the party\u00a0rather than watch helplessly as Trump took over.  There is a smarter strategy: If you can't beat 'em, get them to join\u00a0you.\u00a0Find those issues and policies where nationalism and traditional conservatism overlap, like border security or fighting the threat of jihadist terrorism. Or even make concessions. There's a real divide over free trade.\u00a0 Many traditional conservatives and economists believe it's a big win for the U.S. But populists see the impact it has in specific sectors -- like manufacturing -- and they want limits.  President Reagan confronted this conflict over steel production. And though he was a free trader, he pushed through quotas in imported steel. Was Reagan violating his own principles? Absolutely. But that's what members of governing coalitions do. Nationalists who didn't particularly care for Reagan's aggressive foreign policy stuck with him in part because he stood by them.  Instead of speeches attacking half-baked, spurious nationalism, how about one by a major establishment figure (Mitch McConnell or Paul Ryan) that lays out elements of common agenda and makes the case that the smart way for populists to see progress on their issues is to team up with the broader GOP coalition, rather than fighting against it.  Or the traditional Republican can keep attacking the \"half-baked\" Trumpers, Steve Bannon can target the traditionalists, and both groups can start shopping now for the housewarming gift they'll give Speaker Pelosi when she takes the gavel in 2019.

            "article_content": "CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. -- A Virginia mayor has become the target of hate-filled, anti-Semitic messages from anonymous Twitter trolls after condemning a weekend protest over the planned removal of a Confederate monument.\u00a0 Many public figures are advised to ignore the trolls. But Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer is hitting back.\u00a0 \"Whew! Lot of trolls out tonight. Must be doing something right,\" Signer tweeted Sunday.  Online trolls seek to provoke angry responses, pulling people into unwinnable and ill-advised flame wars. Signer, however, has shown a sense of humor: When an anonymous tweeter called him a \"disgrace,\" he wrote: \"You seem nice. What's your real name?\"  He responded to another Twitter user who called him a Bolshevik \"on the side of evil\" by tweeting: \"Apparently this troll doesn't know about our unemployment rate (2.9%-lowest in Va.) and AAA-bond rating. Oh well!\"\u00a0 And when still another troll called him a \"slimy spineless white coward,\" Signer wrote: \"Another profile in courage here-anonymous trolls lecturing elected officials about cowardice. Yawn.\"\u00a0 The Democratic mayor said in an interview Monday that he doesn't intend to make a habit out of responding to online trolls. But after white nationalists showed up burning torches in his city, he wants to show that neither he nor his community will be silenced.\u00a0 \"It's always a difficult balancing act for public officials about how much oxygen to give the alt-right, which depends on publicity to survive,\" Signer said, referring to the fringe movement that blends racism, white nationalism, anti-Semitism and anti-immigrant ideas.  \"I think for me, it's the right choice to say: 'Enough is enough,'\" he said.\u00a0 \"While I am very troubled, angry, and extremely dissapointed, I'm encouraged by what I saw not on Saturday but on Sunday,\" Charlottesville Vice Mayor Wes Bellamy told CBS affiliate WCAV-TV . \"These folks who came here this weekend, most of whom are outsiders, they do not want to engage in debate. They don't believe much in democracy. They're instead interested in intimidation and theatrics, which is something we are seeing in the Trump era.\" Among those at the protest over the Gen. Robert E. Lee statue Saturday was Richard Spencer, who popularized the term \"alt-right\" and is is a leading figure in a fringe movement that has been described as a mix of racism, white nationalism and populism. After President Donald Trump's election, Spencer hosted a conference in Washington where he shouted \"Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!\" and the audience responded with Nazi salutes.\u00a0 Spencer scoffed at Signer's suggestion that the torches, a mainstay of Ku Klux Klan rallies decades ago, were brought to instill fear. Spencer said there's \"something magical about fire at night.\"  The torch-carrying crowd also included Nathan Damigo, who leads a white nationalist group and can be seen in a video that went viral last month punching a woman at a rally in Berkeley, California.\u00a0 Signer said he's received hundreds of negative tweets, including dozens attacking him for his Jewish faith. He reported one to Twitter that said his \"days are numbered\" but said he hasn't received any other explicit threats.  And the supportive emails and social media messages he's received from across the country have far outweighed the negative, he said.  Hundreds of people gathered in the park with candles Sunday to speak out against the previous night's rally. Police said three people were arrested after scuffles broke out.\u00a0 The Charlottesville City Council voted earlier this year to remove the Lee statue from the park, but a judge has agreed to a temporary injunction that blocks the city from doing so for six months.  Signer voted against the statue's removal, saying among other things that he worries \"about the impulse to remove, delete, and expunge that which offends us.\" Signer instead supported a plan to add a new memorial to civil rights victories.  The debate about Confederate symbols has swept through cities across the South since the 2015 massacre of nine black parishioners at a South Carolina church by an avowed white supremacist.  Last week, workers in New Orleans removed a statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, the second of four monuments to Confederate era figures the city has voted to remove. The first to go was a granite obelisk honoring whites who battled a biracial Reconstruction government installed in New Orleans after the Civil War. ",

            "article_content": "MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE\u2014At a speech in New Hampshire Thursday night, GOP strategist Steve Bannon compared the accusations against Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore to the release of President Trump's infamous \"Access Hollywood\" video during the 2016 election. \"But it's interesting,\" Bannon told the audience. \"The Bezos-Amazon-Washington Post that dropped that dime on Donald Trump, is the same Bezos-Amazon-Washington Post that dropped the dime this afternoon on Judge Roy Moore. Now is that a coincidence? That's what I mean when I say opposition party, right? It's purely part of the apparatus of the Democratic Party. They don't make any bones about it. By the way, I don't mind it. I'll call them out every day.\" Bannon called out the media saying, \"it's not a free and fair media anymore.\" \"You know, I run Breitbart, we're kind of an advocacy group in our own way, in the way we present grassroots and present working class people and economic nationalism, we're not shy about it,\" Bannon said. \"Guys come to me for jobs and I say I'm not looking to hire people who want to win Pulitzers, I'm looking for people who want to be Pulitzer. Right? So I don't mind it, but I think it's a strange coincidence.\" Bannon called it the accusations \"politics of self-destruction,\" as he headlined the 603 Alliance's \"Taking On The Establishment\" fundraiser benefiting candidates running for the statehouse. Bannon's defense \u2014 that the Washington Post report was an orchestrated political attack \u2014 echoed Moore's campaign statement calling the Washington Post report the \"very definition of fake news and intentional defamation.\"\u00a0 The Washington Post\u00a0report, which CBS News has confirmed, disclosed that not only did their reporters speak with more than 30 people who knew Moore between 1977 and 1982, but also that none of the women accusers in the story sought out the Post.\u00a0 \"All were initially reluctant to speak publicly but chose to do so after multiple interviews, saying that they thought it was important for people to know about their interactions with Moore,\" the Washington Post report says. Bannon backed the insurgent conservative who made headlines for his far-right beliefs \u2013\u00a0Moore has said that homosexuality should be illegal\u00a0and that Muslims should be banned from serving in Congress \u2014 over sitting Senator Luther Strange, who was endorsed by Mr. Trump. In a radio appearance after Moore's primary win over Strange in September, Bannon sought credit for Moore's victory, bragging that he was \"6-0\" with special election candidates. He mocked the President for being \"5-1.\" \"Do not get on the wrong side of the football of your base. Listen to the people, please,\" Bannon added on Sirius XM's \"Breitbart News Daily.\" On Thursday, Bannon also went into some of the backstory of what happened in the Trump campaign when the \"Access Hollywood\" tape broke, describing how Mr. Trump \"blew up,\" and Bannon said it was time to \"double down.\" \"But when Billy Bush Saturday, we got you know kind of the high command and the war council and everybody went around the room, and Trump once again is asking for percentages,\" Bannon said. \"I think the highest percentage was 40 percent. Right? They were telling him some guy's gotta go on 60 Minutes and cry on Ivanka's shoulder, and other people do this and do that and apologize, and apologize, apologize. He came to me and said what's the chance? I said 100 percent.\"\u00a0 Bannon then laughed and continued \"he goes don't look at me, and I said 100 percent. And he said I don't want to hear it now. I mean he really blew up, he was not happy. And I said no, I mean it, right? They don't care about this, they don't care about locker room talk. They care about their country, right? I said, we double down now, right? You're Donald Trump and they're not, right?\" Bannon's speech Thursday comes after he reminisced about Mr. Trump's win on the one-year anniversary of the 2016 election, or as he calls it, \"the high holy day of MAGA.\" Bannon \u2014 unprompted and before the Moore story broke \u2014 also mentioned the \"Access Hollywood\" tape then. \"The people don't care about locker room talk,\"Bannon said of the tape, adding that instead people care about the \"destruction\" of the greatest country on earth.\u00a0 Bannon, who left the White House this summer to return to Breitbart News, has pledged to wage war on the establishment GOP.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "\"In all of our years of tracking, we've never seen this many [hate] groups,\" Heidi Beirich told CBS News correspondent Tony Dokoupil. Beirich is the director of\u00a0Southern Poverty Law Center's (SPLC) Intelligence Project, which monitors hate group activity online. \"We've never seen their ideas penetrating the mainstream the way they are. I would say most Americans don't realize how much of this there is.\" It's been a little over a week since neo-Nazis marched in the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia, chanting \"Jews will not replace us.\" In the intervening days, debate has raged over just how America's national conversation has become a real-time discussion of white supremacy and its place in the U.S., muddied by President Trump's ambiguity on the matter. The groups in question -- who openly espouse racist views and have felt newly emboldened since the recent presidential campaign -- find themselves pushing into the mainstream. Dokoupil traveled to Alabama for \"CBSN: On Assignment\" to speak with Beirich, before heading to Boston for last weekend's rally. The flashpoints of this debate have been, for once, out in the open -- manifesting as public protests and counter-protests in the streets of major cities. Saturday saw a so-called \"free speech\" protest on Boston Common, organized by right-wing elements but dwarfed by its anti-supremacy counter-protest from the left. A similar, if smaller, pair of gatherings clashed in a shouting match in Laguna Beach, California.\u00a0 The nation witnessed what's considered one of the largest white supremacy marches in decades as hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Charlottesville. During the rally, a car rammed into a crowd of anti-fascist protesters, injuring dozens and killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer. All this against a backdrop of a national debate around the rights and wrongs of maintaining statues that celebrate the Confederacy.  The SPLC estimates that there are currently more than 900 hate groups -- organizations with beliefs that attack an entire group of people -- operating in the country. Many of these hate groups subscribe to the ideals of white supremacy. In fact, Beirich says the number of hate groups has doubled over the past two decades -- a trend that appears to follow the impact minorities, financial crisis and political elections have on society. According to the SPLC, there's a new generation of so-called white nationalism being run by millennials.\u00a0Matt Heimbach, one of the main organizers of the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, is the face of this movement. \"Well, we have energy, I think, because Donald Trump's election showed that the majority of white American's social, working class America believes in sovereignty,\" Heimbach told \"CBSN: On Assignment.\" Heimbach represents a minority who feel strongly that \"white America\" is under growing threat. A recent HuffPost/YouGov poll found that Trump voters are more likely to believe that discrimination against whites is worse than discrimination against any other group. In the aftermath of Charlottesville, white supremacists feel re-energized. Their goal: to infiltrate the mainstream. Heimbach, along with many other self-proclaimed white supremacists, deny that the Holocaust ever happened. He says his intent is to create an all-white nation -- excluding African-Americans, Jews and homosexuals. Starting this fall, Heimbach will begin recruiting candidates to run in local elections. At this time, he claims about 1,000 people have joined his political party. \"We're going to be running through our local school board, for county council,\" he said. \"Being able to have an influence in the community to show nationalists can have better governments than the two broken political parties.\"",

            "article_content": "U.S. equities chopped around the unchanged line on Tuesday amid volatile trading -- something traders haven\u2019t really experienced since the post-election \u201cmelt-up\u201d started in early November. Political machinations in Washington were the main event, as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet picks move through the Senate, while the House considers what to do about Obamacare.  The big economic headline was the explosion in small business optimism, posting the biggest monthly gain on record in the aftermath of Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise win.  Yet while the perceived economic tailwinds are great and everyone seems excited about the future, something is keeping a cap on those animal spirits. Market breadth, for one thing, remains a problem as buying interest in stocks narrows. Investor expectations may have come too far too fast, leaving the market vulnerable to disappointment heading into the inauguration as the post-election honeymoon gives way to the realities of governance and setting policy.  In fact, as noted by Jason Goepfert at SentimenTrader, breadth has narrowed to such a degree that Monday marked only the third time since at least 1984 that the Nasdaq composite index closed at a new high even though more issues declined than advanced.  That also happened in July 1998 and February 2012. Both times, stocks declined almost immediately afterward.  In 1998, the index went on to lose a quarter of its value in the months that followed as Federal Reserve interest rate hikes destabilized foreign currency and bond markets. That\u2019s somewhat similar to what\u2019s happening now as the surge in the U.S. dollar and interest rates since the election has unnerved markets from China to Mexico.  In 2012, the Nasdaq recovered from a short-lived pullback to hit new highs before rolling over and losing 12 percent over the next couple of months.  It\u2019s not just the Nasdaq that\u2019s suffering from narrow breadth. The 20-day moving average of the New York Stock Exchange advance-decline line has rolled over to levels not seen since late November. It\u2019s down 75 percent from the highs seen in early December.\u00a0 The NYSE up volume ratio has been below 45 percent for the past three days, while stocks overall have barely budged. That has happened only one other time in the last 50 years (January 1970). Seasonality is also shifting negative as Wall Street exits the \u201cSanta Claus\u201d tailwind and hits the headwinds stocks have faced in the second half of January in recent years. Not only that, but investors will need to contend with the start of the fourth-quarter earnings season in two weeks.  That\u2019s a lot to chew through, so it\u2019s no surprise that economic uncertainty has reached its highest level in years according to a media-based index created by economists from Stanford, the University of Chicago and Northwestern that uses mentions of uncertainty in major newspapers.  Yet market-based measures of confidence -- from equities to bonds and the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) -- remain ebullient. Consumers are demonstrating a similar disconnect, with survey-based measures of confidence surging, while retail sales over the holiday shopping season were rather tepid based on early indications. Business owners also appear a bit split, with small-business confidence off the charts but actual spending down and hiring plans weak.  To put it plainly, a lot of hope and optimism are out there as the prospect of \u201cAmerica first\u201d nationalism mixed with tax cuts and deregulation seem poised to accelerate GDP growth and job creation. But that disconnect, a nagging doubt, is keeping shoppers, many investors (given narrowing breadth), the media and businesses more cautious than they\u2019ll admit.  The tension can best be seen in the market\u2019s inability to cross the Dow 20,000 threshold over the last five weeks despite daily cheerleading in the financial press.  Something has to give soon.

            "article_content": "U.S. equities broke a five-session losing streak and climbed higher on Friday as Donald J. Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the U.S. The Dow Jones industrials average gained 0.5 percent, or nearly 95 points. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose 0.34 percent and 0.28 percent, respectively. This marked Wall Street\u2019s best Inauguration Day performance since President Ronald Reagan\u2019s second one in 1985 (chart below). \u00a0 And it capped a historic post-election period for the stock market, with large-cap stocks nearly 11 percent above their preelection low. That ranks as the market\u2019s best Election Day to Inauguration Day move, edging out the rallies enjoyed in the wake of the elections of Presidents William McKinley and Calvin Coolidge. Wall Street also shrugged off a tendency for weakness on Inauguration Day: According to the folks behind the Traders\u2019 Almanac, stocks fall as new presidents are sworn in two-thirds of the time. The last occurrence, for President Obama in 2008, was marked by a 4 percent decline in the Dow (332 points). Reagan suffered a 2 percent decline on his first inauguration. Looking back, CFRA Research chief investment strategist Sam Stovall noted that starting with President Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2019s inauguration in 1953, the S&P 500 has risen an average of 1.6 percent during the 100 days of a president\u2019s first term.  Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration address largely echoed his campaign themes, with economic nationalism and populist sentiment prominently featured. Pledges to increase infrastructure, military spending and border security were all mentioned. And in this digital era, the peaceful transition of power could be watched from the White House website\u00a0to\u00a0Wikipedia. \u00a0 Looking ahead, as the political pomp quiets and traders and investors return to their normal work, the fourth-quarter earnings season will continue to roll on ahead of a Federal Reserve policy meeting at the end of the month.\u00a0 According to FactSet data, analysts are looking for S&P 500 earnings to grow 3.2 percent from last year -- which would mark the first back-to-back expansion in profitability since the beginning of 2015.\u00a0 Anthony Mirhaydari is founder of the Edge\r\n, an investment advisory newsletter, and Edge Pro, options newsletter.

Biden said America under President Trump has shifted toward a \"theory of foreign policy that is closed-off and clannish,\" and frames foreign affairs issues as \"us and them.\" Under the Trump administration, Biden said diplomacy is handled with the mindset that, for America to succeed, others must lose.\u00a0 \"This administration casts global affairs in a dog-eat-dog competition,\" as if it's a competition for who gets to build the latest high-rise structure, Biden said. \"It's this brand of zero-sum thinking that I find the most disturbing and dangerous.\" Biden also expressed concern that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's State Department, which has struggled to fill key positions, doesn't have the manpower it needs to perform its functions well. Go to the seventh floor of the State Department, where the highest officials work, and there's an \"echo,\" Biden said. \"It's irresponsible,\" the former vice president said.\u00a0 Biden, who considered running for president in the 2016 election cycle but decided against it after the death of his son, Beau Biden,\u00a0isn't ruling out a 2020 bid. For now, he leads the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement at the University of Pennsylvania. Prior to joining former President Obama's ticket in 2008, Biden served on the powerful Senate foreign relations committee.\u00a0 Biden said the U.S. cannot go to the United Nations and \"wave the flag of narrow nationalism,\" expressing his displeasure with the U.N. General Assembly gathering last month in which Mr. Trump offered a fiery speech threatening to \"totally destroy\" North Korea and harshly criticizing Iran.\u00a0 Biden said the actions the administration is taking are making it more difficult for the U.S. to face current challenges, undermining the country's credibility by planning to back out of the Paris climate deal, questioning the U.S. commitment to NATO and threatening to negate the Iran nuclear deal.\u00a0 \"This administration is calling into question what the word of the United States is actually worth,\" Biden said. Biden said China and Russia will rush to fill the vacuum the U.S. leaves on the world stage.\u00a0 Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "JOHN DICKERSON, CBS HOST: Today on FACE THE NATION: The president discovers that governing is a lot tougher than campaigning. It was a make-or-break week for President Trump\u2019s signature campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, so he hit the campaign trail running. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This is our long- awaited chance to finally get rid of Obamacare. (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: But, soon, he was slowed by Washington quicksand, negotiating behind closed doors with House Republicans who didn\u2019t like his legislation. In the end, the closer was unable to close the deal with members of his own party. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: I will not sugarcoat this. This is a disappointing day for us. Doing big things is hard. (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: President Trump took defeat as a chance to rewrite history, backing away from the push he just lost. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I never said repeal it and replace it within 64 days. (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: And sounded a defiant note. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: The best thing we can do, politically speaking, is let Obamacare explode. It is exploding right now. (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: But it is not the only thing exploding. New revelations in the investigation into whether or not Trump campaign officials colluded with the Russians to influence the election sparked a partisan brawl in the House. FBI Director Comey confirmed what Washington has been talking about for weeks, that the FBI is looking into those ties and said flat out there was no evidence to support President Trump\u2019s claim that President Obama had wiretapped him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR: The FBI and the Department of Justice have no information to support those tweets. (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes did find new information relevant to the investigation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA: On numerous occasions, the intelligence community incidentally collected information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition. QUESTION: Was the president also part of that incidental collection, his communications? NUNES: Yes. (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: We will ask the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, why the chairman\u2019s revelation threatens to undermine the House investigation. Schiff\u2019s Republican Intelligence Committee colleague Trey Gowdy responds. Conservative senator Tom cotton who warned his House colleagues not to walk the plank and vote for a bad health care bill will also be here. Plus, we will have an interview with Ronald Reagan Secretary of State George Shultz, who has some advice for President Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEORGE SHULTZ, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Trust is the coin of the realm. (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: And we will cover the rest of the week\u2019s events with our political panel, including the bright spot for the president. Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch appears to be coasting to confirmation, despite a filibuster threat from Democrats. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NEIL GORSUCH, SUPREME COURT NOMINEE: I have a canon of ethics that precludes me from getting involved in any way, shape or form in politics. (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: If true to his word, he will be the only one in partisan Washington who does. It is all ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I am John Dickerson. The behind-the-scenes blame game is in full swing here in Washington after the Obamacare repeal\u2019s failure. The president immediately blamed the Democrats. But it was his own party, largely a coalition of House conservatives known as the Freedom Caucus, who refused to support the bill. We begin with Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, who was a vocal critic of the bill. Senator, welcome. In \u201cThe Washington Examiner,\u201d Philip Klein writes, where the headline to his piece is \u201cGOP cave on Obamacare Repeal is the biggest broken promise in political history.\u201d What is your reaction to that judgment? SEN. TOM COTTON (R), ARKANSAS: Well, John, first, let\u2019s say the president is right that the Democrats gave us Obamacare, and the failure of the bill this week doesn\u2019t solve the problems of Obamacare. It is continuing to get worse. And our health care system is groaning under the weight of Obamacare. So we have to revisit it. We now have the time to do it in a more deliberate and careful fashion, but ultimately I don\u2019t think you can lay the defeat of this bill last week on any single faction in the House of Representatives. Some conservatives opposed it. Some moderates opposed it. Even chairmen of powerful committees opposed it. I just think the problem was with first the bill and tent process. Health care is a very complicated issue. To release a bill that was written in secret and then expect to pass it in 18 days, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s feasible. DICKERSON: So, you said written in secret. Well, that is on Paul Ryan then. He controls that process. So, are you saying basically that the House leaders, the House speaker did it, and the process was poorly handled? COTTON: I think you can\u2019t expect to try to solve a problem that addresses one-sixth of the country\u2019s economy and touches every American in a very personal and intimate way in 18 days. When the Democrats came to power in 2009, for 60 years, at least, they had been pursuing a national health care system, yet they didn\u2019t introduce legislation for eight months. They didn\u2019t pass it for over a year of Barack Obama\u2019s first term. So it went through very public hearings and took testimony, developed a fact-based foundation of knowledge. President Obama traveled around the country, hell town halls. He spoke to a joint session of Congress. I am not saying that we needed 14 months to do this, but I think a more careful and deliberate approach, which we now have time to do, because we are going to have to revisit health care anyway, would have gotten us further down the path towards a solution. I believe that both conservatives and moderates in the House made a lot of concessions already. And I have friends like Jim Jordan in the Freedom Caucus and Charlie Dent in the Tuesday Group. And I know that they are both good men. They want to work together. They want to try to find a solution that both they and everyone in between can agree to. With time, I think we can do that. DICKERSON: So, your judgment, just so nobody mistakes, your message is that the House rushed it? COTTON: I think the House moved a bit too fast; 18 days is simply not enough time for such major landmark legislation. DICKERSON: The president this morning, though, is actually pointing fingers at the Freedom Caucus. He says -- quote -- \u201cDemocrats are smiling in D.C. that the Freedom Caucus, with the help of the Club for Growth and Heritage, have saved Planned Parenthood and Obamacare. \u201c What do you think about that? COTTON: Again, you know, it wasn\u2019t just conservatives in the House. In fact, I think more non-conservatives than conservatives opposed it. And when you lose the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, one of the most powerful positions, the problem really is not with a specific faction in the House. I think it is with the bill. DICKERSON: Let me get your experience from that town hall that everybody saw. There was a woman who stood up and said that she would be dead were it not for Obamacare. The president has said that he is going to wait for Obamacare to explode and collapse, and then it will get fixed. How would that go over with that woman at that town hall or the other people? COTTON: Well, I think the president is simply stating a fact, that Obamacare continues to get worse. Premiums continue to go up every year when you get to new open enrollment system. Many counties across the country have only one insurer, which means an insurance has a monopoly over your care. Now, what can happen in the short term, while the Congress is continuing to deliberate about health care, is what was being called phase two. Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price can undertake regulations designed to lift some of the worst harms of Obamacare and try to give some people relief. Later this year, we have must-pass health care legislation that is coming up, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. It is very important to a lot of Democrats. By that point, I hope that we can reach some kind of consensus where we can try to do away with the worst problems of Obamacare that can only be addressed by legislation. DICKERSON: Here is what I wonder about, is the people at the end of these policies and that you dealt with in those town halls, is when they hear the president say, I am going to let it collapse, and then the Democrats will beg me to fix it. When people who are out there nervous about this who have Obamacare, who don\u2019t have Obamacare, people who are straight-up nervous, isn\u2019t that a nervous-making thing to hear? COTTON: Well, as I said to all my town halls, say, any time Obamacare comes up as topic in Arkansas, I know that some people were helped by Obamacare. There\u2019s no doubt about that. But many more were hurt by it. And those are the people who we need to keep in mind when we are trying to solve the problems for people who have benefited from Obamacare, without causing -- putting, imposing all of the costs that Obamacare did. And the president is simply stating a fact, that the entire health care system is growing under the weight of Obamacare. We don\u2019t have a choice to revisit or not revisit it. We have to revisit it. DICKERSON: Let me ask you finally about Mosul. There are reports that 200 civilians have been killed as a result of a bombing in Mosul, perhaps from an American air mission there. Is this a result of the loosening of rules of engagement? And how should people think about this? COTTON: Very sad development. Obviously, the Department of Defense is investigating. I don\u2019t believe this is a result of any kind of loosening of rules of engagement. Rather, I think it is simply the facts on the ground. For much of the last part of last year, the fighting was in East Mosul, which is a much smaller, less densely populated area. Now the fighting is in West Mosul, which is a more densely populated area. Ultimately, though, the blame lays with the Islamic State. They are the savages that are fighting from civilian locations, like apartment buildings, homes, mosques, hospitals, schools and so forth. The blame does not lay with coalition pilots or with Iraqi forces. An investigation will occur, but ultimately it is the terrorists who are using civilians to shield that are responsible for those deaths. DICKERSON: All right, Senator Cotton, thanks so much for being with us. COTTON: Thanks, John. DICKERSON: For more on the investigation into possible ties between Trump campaign officials and Russia, we are joined now by the top Democrat in the House Intelligence Committee, California Representative Adam Schiff. He\u2019s in Palo Alto. Congressman, I want to start with something Chairman Nunes of the committee said. He suggested that some private citizens had been unmasked as a part of a surveillance effort. If, in fact, that were true, that would be a big deal, wouldn\u2019t it? REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA: Well, it all depends. There are perfectly appropriate circumstances to unmask the names of people. In fact, that is done quite often. And the standard is whether the unmasking of those names is necessary to determine the significance of the intelligence. So, unmasking is not at all unusual. The question is, was it done appropriately? And here, the problem, John, is that none of us have seen what the chairman is talking about. This evidence was taken apparently directly to the White House, which creates another issue, because, of course, it is associates involved in the Trump campaign who are in part the subject of what we are investigating. That is the bigger problem, I think, than the chairman\u2019s claim. Certainly, we want to oversee the minimization processes, make sure they are operating correctly, but we can\u2019t have a credible investigation if one of the members, indeed, the chairman, takes only information he has seen to the White House and doesn\u2019t share it with his own committee. DICKERSON: And so he has not shared that with you, including his claim that the president himself, when he was a candidate, was caught in the surveillance; is that right? SCHIFF: Yes. He hasn\u2019t shared with me. And, to my knowledge -- and you can check with my colleague Mr. Gowdy -- I don\u2019t think he has shared it with anyone on the committee. So we are all quite in the dark on this. And we, I think, suffered really two serious blows to the integrity of the investigation this week, one, with that unilateral trip to the White House, but the other with a cancellation of an open hearing that was scheduled for Tuesday with Directors Clapper, Brennan and Sally Yates, the deputy -- former deputy attorney general. I think her testimony in particular would have shed a lot of light for the public on the whole Michael Flynn chapter. And perhaps that is something the White House didn\u2019t want to see. I can\u2019t otherwise account for why we would have this abrupt cancellation of a hearing that both the chair and I had committed to doing. DICKERSON: Well, the chairman\u2019s argument is that the cancellation of that hearing was necessary because he wanted to have other closed-door testimony beforehand before having that next hearing. That seems like a reasonable idea. SCHIFF: You know, it certainly would be reasonable, if that were the justification. But, of course, the one doesn\u2019t preclude the other. We welcome the return of any of the witnesses in closed session. But their testimony doesn\u2019t necessarily preclude us doing an open hearing that we had already agreed with, the witnesses were prepared to do, they were more than willing to do. So, I really don\u2019t think that is the justification. Indeed, we got word that they were trying to close the open hearing even before they suggested an alternate hearing. DICKERSON: You suggested in a tweet that the chairman was trying to -- quote -- \u201cchoke off public information.\u201d What evidence did you have for that? SCHIFF: Well, I think that the hearing that we had on Monday, where the director of the FBI testified for the first time that there is an ongoing investigation of potential coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russians, as well as the disclosure by the director that there was no factual basis for the president\u2019s accusation of wiretapping by his predecessor, I think that hearing went so poorly for the White House, that there was a lot of pushback in doing a second open hearing, honestly, John, because the other explanations simply don\u2019t make sense. We could always have Directors Comey and Rogers come back at any time. There is no necessity of having them come back before the open hearing. I think that was merely an effort to camouflage the true object here, which was the closure or the cancellation of the hearing with Sally Yates. DICKERSON: So... SCHIFF: But let me just make a -- yes. DICKERSON: Well, I just want to interrupt briefly, Congressman, because basically what it sounds like you are saying is that the chairman of the committee is a tool of the White House he is investigating. And if you are saying that, how can this committee get its work done? SCHIFF: Well, look, I think the chairman has to make a decision, whether to act as a surrogate of the White House, as he did during the campaign and the transition, or to lead an independent and credible investigation. I hope he chooses the latter. The country really needs to have an independent, credible investigation in the House. And we had that up until and through Monday. Where I think that the House process went off the rails was with that -- that venture by the chairman to the White House. You simply can\u2019t run a credible investigation that way. I am going to do everything I can to get this back on track. And I implore our chairman and the speaker to rededicate themselves to a serious and bipartisan investigation. We know that Russia was involved in hacking our democracy. We know that the evidence or information is sufficient to warrant an FBI investigation of this. We are trying to do as much of this as we can in the public eye transparently. Obviously, some of it will have to be done in closed session. But it really demands both parties work together on this. We made every effort to do so, but we need the chairman to decide that is what his object is as well. DICKERSON: Congressman, there has been a report from CNN that -- Wednesday night that they -- that the FBI was looking into collusion with the Russians in the Trump campaign in terms of spreading information about Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. Do you have any information to back that up? SCHIFF: I am not sure that I can comment on that. I can say that I think that the investigation that the director talked about at our Monday hearing is justified. I think there is a sufficient basis for that investigation, not to only have been indicated, but for it to continue at this point. And I think that we owe it to the country to do this in a credible way. I would make one final point, John. And that is, I do think the events of this week call out the need for an independent commission, quite separate and apart from what we do in Congress. There are enough questions that have now been called, that have been raised, where I think the establishment of that commission would give the country a lot of confidence that at least one body was doing this in a way that was completely removed from any political considerations. DICKERSON: And quickly, Congressman, you have said that there is circumstantial evidence of this connection, but then you said you can\u2019t talk about it. Isn\u2019t that just what you are complaining about with the chairman of the committee, that he says there are things, but isn\u2019t showing the evidence? SCHIFF: No, my complaint with the chairman is taking whatever information he has to the White House, when the White House is the subject in a way of the investigation. I wouldn\u2019t have any problem with the chairman saying that he is concerned about whether minimization procedures are being followed. And I don\u2019t have a concern with other members characterizing the evidence as they have. And many of them have said they think there is no evidence of collusion. My disagreement with those members is, I don\u2019t think that is accurate, and I feel an obligation to say so. DICKERSON: All right, Congressman, thanks so much for being with us And we will be back in a minute with a Republican member of the House Intelligence Committee, Trey Gowdy. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: Joining us now is South Carolina Congressman Trey Gowdy. He chaired the Special Committee on Benghazi, so he is no stranger into challenges of running into partisan politics when trying to do an investigation. He joins us from Greenville. Congressman, I want to start with this question of unmasking that Chairman Nunes has brought out. Has he shown you any of what caused him to suggest that Obama officials doing surveillance captured some Trump campaign associates and then unmasked them in the process of investigating? REP. TREY GOWDY (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: He has not shown it to me, John. I am vaguely familiar with it, no more, no less familiar with it than Adam Schiff is. I will just tell you this. My understanding is, Chairman Nunes briefed the commander in chief on matters unrelated to the Russian investigation. So, if that is big deal in Washington, then we have sunk to a new low. DICKERSON: Well, I guess Congressman Schiff would say, but the president is the one that is a part of this investigation being done by the committee, so the chairman shouldn\u2019t be talking to him. GOWDY: Well, then, let me repeat what I said. The chairman of House intel briefed the commander in chief on something that has nothing to do with the Russia investigation. So if the commander in chief cannot be briefed by the chairperson of the House Intel Committee on a matter that has nothing to do with the FBI investigation, then I don\u2019t know what they can talk about, John. DICKERSON: All right. So, here is what... GOWDY: He is the commander in chief. DICKERSON: So if this is an issue outside of the one they are investigating at the moment in the committee and that you are investigating, should it then be taken out of this investigation, have a separate investigation on both the issues that Chairman Nunes has discovered this week, and then also the one you are quite concerned about, which is the leaks that have been in the paper, some of them potentially illegal, get that out of this question of Russia to keep things from getting mixed the way they appear to have? GOWDY: Well, they are separate. And I heard my friend from California mention an independent commission. Thank goodness we have one. It is called the FBI. The FBI has counterintelligence jurisdiction and they have criminal jurisdiction, and what we learned on Monday, and it is about the only thing we learned on Monday, was that the FBI\u2019s investigating both. They are the world\u2019s premier law enforcement agency. They are independent. You have women and men at the Department of Justice who have dedicated their careers to the blind pursuit of justice. It doesn\u2019t get any more independent than that. So we have an independent entity investigating counterintelligence and allegations of potential criminality. Let Congress do its job, which is provide oversight over the intelligence community. DICKERSON: Do you have any sense from the chairman about the schedule of when this new information that we have been talking about here, this question of unmasking, when you might have enough information to make a judgment about whether this is, in fact, something that was done improperly or whether, as Congressman Schiff said, this is just the normal procedures for going through unmasking? GOWDY: It is just one more reason to bring Director Comey and Admiral Rogers back on Tuesday. It is incredibly important. Adam is right. Adam is right that the incidental collection of U.S. persons happens. What I wish some of my friend on the other side would be a little more outraged about is the political use of that unmasking. So I understand we collect U.S. citizens, but we don\u2019t read about those U.S. citizens on the front page of \u201cThe New York Times\u201d and \u201cThe Washington Post.\u201d That, in addition to threatening the surveillance programs, is also a felony. So I hope that we learn more about that on Tuesday. All of this is important, John, every bit of it. Russia is not our friend. They attacked our democracy. I want to investigate every fact that is related thereto. But the felonious dissemination of classified information is the only thing we know for sure is a crime, and it would be nice if we showed the same level of interest in that. DICKERSON: Let me ask you. You chaired a committee that got a lot of attention in the papers. What is your sense of the health of this committee? We have seen dueling press conferences. There has been a lot of accusations and passive aggression here. How healthy is this committee? GOWDY: I think it is fine. I actually think Chairman Nunes and Ranking Member Schiff are both good men, and I they get along fine. I think what you learned Monday, because I heard the witnesses almost 100 times, John, say they could not answer the question in that setting. And I want you and your viewers to ask themselves, why are we satisfied with every other facet of culture having serious investigations done confidentially, the grand jury, judges meeting with attorneys, police officers interviewing suspects, all of that is done confidentially, and we are more than satisfied with those investigations. And yet, when it comes to Congress, we think we ought to have a public hearing -- 100 times, those two witnesses said they could not answer the question in that setting. Why in the hell would we go back to that setting if the witnesses can\u2019t answer the questions? DICKERSON: All right. Congressman Gowdy, we are going to give you the last word there. Thanks so much for being with us. GOWDY: Yes, sir. Thank you. DICKERSON: And we will be back in a moment with some thoughts on the president and the presidency. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: President Trump said President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. This week, the FBI director said there was no evidence of that. This wasn\u2019t just a fact-check. It highlighted how lightly President Trump treats the presidency. We have presidents and we have an office of the presidency. Opponents respect the office, even if they disagree with the occupant. Presidents are criticized, but the presidency is behind protective glass. That\u2019s why a president can come into office attacking his predecessor\u2019s policies, but later celebrate the dedication of his predecessor\u2019s presidential library. It is why George W. Bush prepared a smooth transition for Barack Obama, and why President Obama did the same for Donald Trump. Once on the job, a president also gains respect for the presidency because they learn, as President Trump did this week, that the job is harder than it appeared from the campaign trail. The historical continuity of the presidency is an heirloom and a tool. Presidents gain stature by hugging those who came before them. Donald Trump visited Andrew Jackson\u2019s grave and compared himself to the seventh president, who also spooked elites. These perks and protections are why presidents honor the presidency. \u201cI shall keep steadily in view the limitations of my office,\u201d said Andrew Jackson. Break the limits, and you break the office. Nevertheless, President Trump compared his predecessor to Nixon and McCarthy, called him sick and bad. To break glass like that, a president must have a good reason and proof. President Trump had no evidence and no higher purpose. Tending the presidency is important for a disruptive president like Donald Trump, because it shows people he knows the line between renovating the office and demolishing it. You measure twice, and cut once. You don\u2019t cut without measuring at all. Back in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: Some of our CBS stations are leaving us now, but, for most of you, we will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION, including and interview with former Secretary of State George Shultz, plus our political panel. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. I\u2019m John Dickerson. We sat down with Ronald Reagan\u2019s secretary of state, George Shultz, last week. He told us that the Trump presidency so far has been up and down. Among the ups, he praised several of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet picks, including Secretary of Defense James Mattis, his colleague at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. And as for not so up, the early defeat of the president\u2019s travel ban. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DICKERSON: What would you say are the down parts of the -- of the administration so far? SHULTZ: Well, obviously, when you roll out a big initiative and it blows up, that\u2019s a downer. I think it\u2019s important for a president to get off to a start where people see he says what he means, he means what he says and he can carry out what he starts out to carry out. DICKERSON: You said that your advice to President Trump was that he not let the White House dominate anything. What does that mean? SHULTZ: That has become a tendency to put decision making and even operational things in the White House. The White House staff has grown a lot. The NSE staff has grown a lot, with a result that that\u2019s a dominant place. So I would hope the president might say something like this. I consider my cabinet and sub cabinet people to be my staff. Those are the people I\u2019m going to work with to develop policy. And they are the ones who are going to execute it under my supervision. But they\u2019re going to execute it. When you do that, you get good people, you get all people who have been confirmed by the Senate, and you get better policy and you get better execution. DICKERSON: What are the upsides of having been in business and coming to Washington and then what are the ways in which Washington doesn\u2019t work the same way, since we\u2019ve got a -- a businessman as president now? SHULTZ: Mr. Tillerson called me up. I don\u2019t know him. And I said, I hear you\u2019re being knocked for being a businessman. I said, I was a businessman and let me tell you, you have two big advantages. Number one, you have known how to run a big organization, so you realize it\u2019s not about me, it\u2019s about the organization, getting the organization rolling so that it does things. See, as head of Exxon, you didn\u2019t want to run a refinery, but you wanted to be damn sure you had people in the company that did know how to do it. By the same token, in the State Department, you\u2019ve got people stationed all over the world. So a big part of your job is to see to it that that organization works. And it\u2019s not that difficult, but you can do it. You know how to do that. And the second thing that\u2019s happened here as a businessman is you built places and you have to hire people and fire people and buy things and sell things and get your money out and all kinds of things like that. That\u2019s kind of the way the country really works. DICKERSON: But what advice did you give Secretary of State Tillerson? SHULTZ: Well, I think the secretary of state has to establish two things. One, that he\u2019s close to the president and that he speaks for the president. And being close to the president, listens to him. So together they formulate the policy. The second thing, of course, is to let it be clear that he has really got his department working with him in the way that he wants. And he can do that. DICKERSON: Let me ask you about honesty in public office. President Trump made a claim that his predecessor, President Obama, wiretapped his Trump Tower and now the director of the FBI has said he has no evidence of -- of that. What cost is that for a president, to say something that doesn\u2019t turn out to have evidence behind it? SHULTZ: Well, he\u2019s got to figure out a way not -- to get out of it. To say, OK, I made a mistake, and go on from there because you\u2019ve got to establish an atmosphere of trust. Trust is the coin of the realm. And you need to do that with other leaders, or people you\u2019re going to deal with, including your adversaries. When I go back to my days in the Marine Corps boot camp at the start of World War II, sergeant handed me my rifle. He says, take good care of this rifle. This is your best friend. And remember one thing, never point this rifle at anybody unless you\u2019re willing to pull the trigger. No empty threats. And you can extrapolate that and say, mean what you say, and carry out what you say you\u2019re going to carry out, then people will trust you and they can deal with you because they know if you say you\u2019ll -- I\u2019ll do something, you\u2019ll do something, that you\u2019ll do what you said you were going to do. If I can\u2019t trust you, I can\u2019t deal. But if I trust you, then I can deal. And so trust is the coin of the realm. A very important point. DICKERSON: Some people heard President Trump\u2019s inaugural address and some of the things he said and they feel like his version of nationalism is pulling America back a little from its foreign commitments. He argues, the president does, that America has been extended too far overseas and has lost focus on what\u2019s happening at home. Do you share that view? SHULTZ: Well, there\u2019s -- you\u2019re going to extend yourself too far and we\u2019ve made some mistakes, but I think that we have a major role in the world. If we\u2019re not there, there\u2019s no leadership. Think about it. At the end of World War II, some gifted people with names like Atchison (ph) and Marshal and Truman looked back, what did they see? They saw two world wars, they saw the Holocaust, they saw the Great Depression and they said to themselves, what a crummy world. And we\u2019re a part of it whether we like it or not. Then comes the Cold War. The Doctrine of Containment comes forward. NATO comes forward. This is all U.S. leadership, but not domination. And by the time the Cold War was over, I think you could say there was in the world a secure and economic commons from which everybody benefited. Unfortunately, that has fallen apart. In part because we have withdrawn. Russia can\u2019t take our place. China can\u2019t take our place. Only the United States can do it. And it doesn\u2019t mean you go around telling people what to do. I think to some extent our Afghanistan and Iraqi experience would teach us something about that. But you go around the world trying to make life better, because a healthy world is to our advantage. DICKERSON: What do Americas allies need to hear right now? SHULTZ: Well, they need to hear that we\u2019re -- we\u2019re -- we\u2019re in the alliance full bore. And they have been hearing that, I think. DICKERSON: Last question. You wrote a book, I believe it was called \u201cThings on My Mind.\u201d SHULTZ: Learning from experience. DICKERSON: What else is on your mind these days? SHULTZ: Well, I have five great grandchildren, and I watch them. They don\u2019t walk anywhere, they run. They\u2019re curious about everything. And they\u2019re so much fun. There\u2019s so much life in them. And I look at them and I say to myself, what kind of a world are they going to inherit? Is there anything I can do that will make it a little better? So that\u2019s my main motivating spirit. DICKERSON: That\u2019s great. Mr. Secretary, thanks for being with us. (END VIDEOTAPE) DICKERSON: And we\u2019ll be right back with our political panel. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: And we\u2019re back with our political panel. Juliet Eilperin is a senior national correspondent for \u201cThe Washington Post,\u201d Ron Brownstein is the editorial director for Atlantic Media. We are also joined by CBS News political analyst and \u201cSlate\u201d magazine\u2019s chief political correspond, Jamelle Bouie, and Ben Domenech, who is the publisher of \u201cThe Federalist.\u201d Juliet, I want to start with you. What happened this week on healthcare? JULIET EILPERIN, \u201cTHEE WASHINGTON POST\u201d: Well, what you really saw was -- was an extraordinary moment of gamesmanship where President Trump delivered an ultimatum to House Republicans, dared them to take a vote and pass the bill that they\u2019ve been working on for a couple of weeks. And, at the end of the day, Paul Ryan, the speaker, had to come down and admit that he could not force his members to walk the plank for this proposal. And at this point acknowledged that the Affordable Care Act is the law of the land for the foreseeable future. DICKERSON: Ben, what\u2019s the lesson here coming out of this for Republicans? BEN DOMENECH, \u201cTHE FEDERALIST\u201d: There are a number of lessons. So, John, prior to my work with \u201cThe Federalist,\u201d I worked for 12 years in health policy. I was in the Bush administration during -- at HHS during the Medicare Part D fight and then in the Senate and saw that play out. There\u2019s a major difference between the politics then and the politics now. Part D was a popular measure. This measure had 17 percent approval in the most recent poll taken about it. During the Part D fight, leadership had earmarks that they could use to offer different members carrot in order to support their measure, keeping a vote open in one instance in the House for three hours. Now they no longer have that. GOP leadership needs to recognize a lesson that they can take away from this moment, which is that the Freedom Caucus and what it represents, fiscal conservatives who have support in their districts, support that far outpaces the president of the United States, are here to stay. And they\u2019re a large enough faction to be able to get what they want done. The fact is that, you know, today, Adam Kinzinger, a representative from Illinois, came out and said he thought that leadership should take the lesson that they should abandon dealing with these conservatives and instead reach out to centrist Democrats, to which I say it\u2019s fun to play pretend. The reality is that this faction is not going away and in order to include them in the process, to bring them, to not draft legislation behind closed doors, you have to have a more open, a more collaborative process that includes them and other stakeholder groups from the get-go. The real, hard problem that leadership has to face is that it wasn\u2019t just conservatives who killed this bill, it wasn\u2019t just the Heritage Foundation that opposed it, it was the AARP, it was every major medical group -- RON BROWNSTEIN, ATLANTIC MEDIA: AMA, hospitals. EILPERIN: Right. DOMENECH: Everyone. If you -- if you had seven years to put that together, how could you even make that happen? BROWNSTEIN: It was -- it was a panoramic collapse, right, because you\u2019re talking about, first of all, it is difficult to think of another new president who has lost a legislative fight this big this fast in their presidency. It is -- it is really hard to think of another example -- DICKERSON: No, people would say Clinton, so explained why. BROWNSTEIN: Well -- well, Clinton -- Clinton, you know, Clinton ultimately passed his budget. He lost healthcare, you know, in the -- in -- in the second year, ultimately, the end of 1993, 1994. But to be 60 days into your presidency and have something of this magnitude, the first big thing that Clinton did it was very difficult but he did pass it in the end. Of course, President Obama passed the stimulus. George W. Bush passed the No Child Left Behind and the tax cut. But I think what\u2019s really important here is -- is Ben\u2019s point, that it was not just the conservatives in the end who bolted. In fact, as Tom Cotton noted to you that in most of the whip counts there were more people outside of the Freedom Caucus who opposed the bill who were -- than those who were inside. And, to me, there\u2019s one of the big lessons here, beside all of the tactical problems, and I think we should go back to the question of whether it\u2019s possible to work with Democrats because of the decision not to in effect gave a veto to each faction in the Republican Party. But bigger than any of that, facts on the ground matter. DOMENECH: Right. EILPERIN: Right. BROWNSTEIN: Obamacare provided coverage for 20 million people. And the fundamental debate -- the division in the Republican Party was conservatives who wanted to take it away from more faster who would not have created anything like an entitlement and then those, both moderate centrists and even some conservatives who said, you know, I can\u2019t -- I have hundreds of thousands of people in my state or in my district who have gained coverage and we cannot simply pull the rug out from under them. JAMELLE BOUIE, CBS NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: That\u2019s when I don\u2019t -- I think you can\u2019t underestimate what the effects of Democratic mobilization on the ground had on more moderate Republicans, more vulnerable members who were seeing angry people at their town halls, who were seeing mass protests and decided, you know, I -- I risk losing my seat, I risk incurring some sort of political damage by voting for a bill whose headline number, the headline number on this bill was that 24 million people would lose their insurance. DICKERSON: Right. BOUIE: And added to that, I think it\u2019s important to recognize that in addition to tactical mistakes and strategic mistakes, there\u2019s just the fact that the bill wasn\u2019t -- was just a shoddy bill, yes, it was a bad bill. EILPERIN: Well, and you can\u2019t -- and you can\u2019t underestimate the fact that there was no negotiation. DOMENECH: Yes. EILPERIN: And what that means that, yes, you have mobilization on the ground. I was talking to a health care lobbyist yesterday who said, it\u2019s not that they shut their doors and they didn\u2019t take our calls, but they didn\u2019t solicit our input and more importantly they -- there wasn\u2019t a negotiation. And so you had no buy in from all of these other constituencies and it really (INAUDIBLE). DOMENECH: Exactly. DICKERSON: Well, and to the extent there was a negotiation when things were taken out of it to buy off the Freedom Caucus -- BROWNSTEIN: Right. DICKERSON: You lost those sidelines we were talking -- DOMENECH: And -- and in the same sense, even those things that were taken out, a lot of it, the real question that I had as a -- as a health policy person when I looked at this was not an ideological question. I have my own positions when it comes to health possibility. It was more about workability. Is this even going to work? And I think in this sense you were asking, you know, this past week, for all these members of Congress to come out and vote for something that they didn\u2019t have a final CBO score for, that they really didn\u2019t know how it would apply to their districts, and you can look at the Senate\u2019s schedule going forward, they\u2019re going to do Montenegro next and they\u2019re going to do Gorsuch and then there\u2019s going to be a recess and then they\u2019re going to do a CR, and all of those things mean House members will be flailing for five weeks defending a bill that they didn\u2019t even fully understand. DICKERSON: Yes. BROWNSTEIN: You know, and we talked about this before what I wrote, the Trumpcare conundrum in January. DICKERSON: Yes. BROWNSTEIN: I mean the core problem here is the basic solution on the private markets, all right leave aside the fact that half the people who are getting coverage under Obamacare were under the expansion of Medicaid, which is a really separate issue that Republicans wanted to repeal, but on the private market side, the core solution that Republicans had was to deregulate insurance in a variety of different ways and the individual mandate ultimately and the essential health benefits. And what that does over and over again is advantage younger, healthier and raise costs and diminish access for people, older people, with larger health needs and that is their coalition at this point. BOUIE: Right. BROWNSTEIN: The reality is, 60 percent of House Republicans are in districts that are older than the national average and a majority of Donald Trump\u2019s votes came from whites over 45. CBO said people in their 50s would have a 25 percent premium increase and would suffer much of the -- of the coverage loss. They were colliding with their new coalition. You remember in healthcare in the \u201890s, they twice passed a block grant for Medicaid under Bill Clinton without fuss or muss among Republicans. Now it\u2019s a lot of their voters who will get hit by that. DICKERSON: And the president said he would never support a bill that hurts his own voters, but then in the horse trading that was going on -- BROWNSTEIN: Yes. DICKERSON: There seemed to be nothing -- EILPERIN: (INAUDIBLE). DICKERSON: It was a little bit on the tax credit for older people, but nothing that would get to the problems that you identified. BROWNSTEIN: Yes. DICKERSON: Juliet, let me ask you about the president as a marketer. We know what the president looks like when he has got something on his mind. EILPERIN: Right. DICKERSON: It is a constant conversation. Measure Donald Trump at 100 percent to the Donald Trump, President Donald Trump, who worked on this bill. EILPERIN: Right. I mean this was a -- really a different person in some ways, partially because he had deep ambivalence about this legislation. He kept asking his own advisors whether this was a good bill and part of it was, this was not his comfort zone. This is not an area which he prioritized in his own campaign, aside from saying that he wanted to reverse it. And so he did, you know, they can trot out that he talked on the phone or in person to 120 members, but he basically was just making these incredibly broad arguments of, you need to vote for this and we\u2019re telling you to vote for it. And as a result, you didn\u2019t have the public communication or even kind of the detailed private communication. That\u2019s what you need to bring it across the (INAUDIBLE). BOUIE: In order to be an effective advocate, a president actually has to know something about the policies in question. And Donald Trump hasn\u2019t shown that he has that knowledge. And so it made it difficult for him to advocate in public, to advocate to members, and it means that in these negotiations and horse trading, and we\u2019ve seen reporting to say exactly this, he doesn\u2019t really have anything to say or add. DOMENECH: But the fact is that Paul Ryan has been working on this for seven years. He was working on it when Donald Trump was still a reality star. He should have expected that -- (CROSS TALK) DICKERSON: Well, I\u2019m going to -- hold that. I\u2019m going to take a quick break there. I want to get back to this very dynamic between the president and Paul Ryan. DOMENECH: Yes. DICKERSON: It\u2019s going to matter going forward. So let\u2019s a shake -- a short break and we\u2019ll be right back. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: And we\u2019re back with our panel. Ben, pick up where you were. DOMENECH: So the issue I think that you really have to look at right now is the relationship that Donald Trump and -- and the White House has with Paul Ryan. This really was a situation where they outsourced their policy to him, and other Republican leaders who had been working on this process for seven years. They could have expected much better -- a much better outcome from that leadership, I think. It\u2019s not irrational to expect that. My sources who are close to the White House tell me that Reince Priebus, who is obviously very close with Paul Ryan, the White House chief of staff, is now on extremely shaky ground. That the president really doubts him, and was assured by him multiple times through this process that things were going well, that they were going to come out of this with a bill. Obviously that didn\u2019t -- that didn\u2019t work out. And it\u2019s really a question of where he stands (INAUDIBLE). BROWNSTEIN: This whole episodes, I think, revealed what a shotgun marriage it is between Donald Trump\u2019s economic nationalism and the more conventional, small government conservativism or even liberalism that Ryan represents, because there was a direct collision between this bill -- a week -- a few days earlier in the budget, President Trump made a big statement. He said, I am going to depart from traditional Republican thinking and exempt Social Security and Medicare from any changes, which has been Paul Ryan\u2019s biggest crusade, particularly on Medicare, and -- because those are my voters. Because the majority of my votes came from whites over 45 and we have a lot of lower, middle income, older, predominantly white voters who now depend on those program. I\u2019m going to deviate or redirect Republican ideology. Then you come back a few days later with a bill that hammers those very same voters that is driven by Ryan. And it is a remind that in a variety of ways, you\u2019re going to see, I think, a consistent collision between the economic nationalism that Trump is embracing -- which in many case -- in most countries around the world includes a pretty big government component and the traditional Republican drive to shrink government over all other goals. BOUIE: I think it was an important point about process (INAUDIBLE). It is true that Paul Ryan and House leadership should have had a better sense of how to go forward because they\u2019ve been working on this for seven years. But we\u2019re also living in an age where the presidency is pretty involved in policy matters. And a White House has to have policy expertise. It has to have some sort of knowledge and know how about how to get these things done. And the fact of the matter is, is that not only does the Trump White House not have these things, it has a lot of people new, not just to national politics or government, but new to just policy-making period. But Donald Trump himself, if you look at his career as a businessman, what he is skilled at is branding. Putting his name on a bill that the House produced is 100 percent what you\u2019d expect Donald Trump to do. And I\u2019m not sure -- I think this may demonstrate that Trump himself does not actually have the kind of skills necessary to shepherd these kinds of big legislative programs through. DICKERSON: To give it the special sauce. He gave everybody a name during the campaign. BOUIE: Right. DICKERSON: He was quite expert at that. Make America great again had a punch to it. This never got a name from -- EILPERIN: Right, he didn\u2019t want it called Trumpcare. He did not want that. (CROSS TALK) DICKERSON: Although -- and, Juliet, take this from where we are in healthcare and where this goes forward, but with this idea, couldn\u2019t Paul Ryan say, hey, if we had this Freedom Caucus, we knew they were going to be a challenge, they have always been, Donald Trump could have done rallies in their districts. EILPERIN: Right. DICKERSON: He could have -- instead of giving them an ultimatum at the end, could he have started earlier and what does this mean for going forward either with healthcare or tax reform or anything else? EILPERIN: Absolutely. I mean -- and also interestingly the leverage that he want -- you know, that he was kind of exercising at the end, this idea that, look, I\u2019m going to put you on the spot, you will take the blame for this going down and I\u2019m popular in your states, as Ben points out, that\u2019s both not as effective with Freedom Caucus members, the most conservatives. But also, again, he\u2019s not following through on that threat. That was his leverage. And, instead, he wants to blame the democrats and say that it\u2019s going to explode. BROWNSTEIN: We should revisit Ben\u2019s point from -- EILPERIN: So -- BROWNSTEIN: I\u2019m sorry, go ahead. EILPERIN: Oh, yes. Well, just that so -- you know, so there\u2019s no question that he could have invested more and his ambivalence hampered it. His unwillingness to essentially license it in the way he has done other things. And I think going forward, again particularly when you have these ideological cross currents, he\u2019s got to decide what he is going to fully invest in, do that kind of politics, both outside the beltway where he has enormous scale, and figure out how to have enough involvement and enough buy in that he can effectively sell it here. BROWNSTEIN: Because Ben said earlier that it was a fantasy really -- DOMENECH: Yes. BROWNSTEIN: To believe that you could bring in some Democrats. But one lesson of this clearly is if you are -- if you are starting from the get-go, assuming that you\u2019re going to have no Democratic support, in essence you are giving a veto to each faction -- DOMENECH: Yes. BROWNSTEIN: In the Republican coalition. So it does raise the question -- I mean it was never even discussed here. It was like never even really an option to kind of reach out to Democrats. But going forward on -- on tax -- tax reform in particular, where you have this enormous divide again over this idea of the import adjustment fee and Tom Cotton, who you had on earlier, you know, he can\u2019t -- a senator from Arkansas with Wal-Mart being against -- you know, for an import (ph) -- that\u2019s an idea that just seems like a non-starter in the Senate. They are going to be in the same position structurally where each side of the party can veto this unless they can find a way to bring in some Democrats. DOMENECH: Which is -- which is why I think you have to have a more open process that brings people in beforehand, that doesn\u2019t just try to legislate from on high. The fact is that when you -- we\u2019ve heard leadership in both Houses of Congress complain about this new brand of conservativism over the past several years, but these people are not going away. This is -- this is the way things are now and you have to recognize that. And it\u2019s clear now, after this experience, Donald Trump is not going to solve that for you. The people who would be challenging these Freedom Caucus members in their districts would be challenging them from the right, not from the center, and that\u2019s -- that\u2019s a reality that you have to come to grips with. You can\u2019t just keep playing pretend. BROWNSTEIN: But a more open process only with Republicans? DOMENECH: I think it has to include other people as well. It has to include Democrats in districts where Donald Trump performed well, which includes several Democrats who are in the House and the Senate. BROWNSTEIN: Twelve -- twelve Democrats in the House. EILPERIN: Exactly. DOMENECH: Exactly. And that\u2019s -- and that\u2019s the kind of people who I think you need to be looking at going forward who are going to have to run again in a year. What are the issues that voters in their districts care about? Where can they be moved? DICKERSON: All right, Jamelle, are those Democratic going to play and join in given where the Democratic base is right now, which is, anything you do to work with Donald Trump is normalizing him. I mean you know the rhetoric coming from the left. BOUIE: Right. I have a hard time believing that any Democrats, even Democrats in districts that Trump won, are going to want to risk working with the Trump administration, with Republicans, to advance Trump\u2019s political interests. My sense is that any Democrat who takes that step will immediately face the wrath of much of the Democratic base. And so in this case I do think an open process is just going to have to be within Republican -- among Republicans. And, again, I am not sure that the Trump White House is really ready to make these kinds of adjustments. I mean they want to go from an issue that involves a sixth of the economy to an issue that involves the entire economy, and they want to do so like quickly. And I\u2019m really skeptical that they\u2019ll be able to make the kinds of on the ground changes they need to make to make that successful. DICKERSON: All right, we\u2019re going to have to leave it there. Thanks, all of you, for being with us. Thank you, all of you out there, for watching us. And we\u2019ll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: That\u2019s it for us today. Our full interview with the former secretary of state, George Shultz, is available on our website, facethenation.com.

Spencer is a leader in the so-called \u201calt-right\u201d movement, which has been energized by President Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the 2016 election. He has said that the United States \u201cat the end of the day, belongs to white men,\u201d and at a November conference in Washington, D.C., he received Nazi salutes from supporters.  He runs the National Policy Institute, an Arlington, Va.-based think tank which bills itself as \u201cdedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of people of European descent in the United States.\u201d The group stopped filing tax returns with the IRS after 2012. Failing to file for three consecutive years results in an automatic loss of tax-exempt status. There are also questions about whether Spencer, a vocal supporter of Mr. Trump, violated rules that prohibit nonprofits from supporting any particular candidates or campaigns. Spencer said he did not believe his group was required to file federal tax returns, and told the Times that he would be appealing the IRS\u2019 decision. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. I don\u2019t want to make a comment because I don\u2019t understand this stuff,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit embarrassing, but it\u2019s not good. We\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d He also said his group has filed the required paperwork to operate as a nonprofit in the commonwealth of Virginia, but a spokeswoman for the Virginia agency which deals with charities told the Times that his group\u2019s status was being reviewed.

            "article_content": "A panel of scientists and scholars announced a change to the Doomsday Clock\u00a0Thursday morning, which shows how close we may be to the end of the world. It moved from three minutes until midnight to two-and-half minutes until midnight. The 12 o\u2019clock hour represents the destruction of human civilization. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists magazine first set the clock 70 years ago, and with Thursday\u2019s announcement it\u2019s been adjusted 22 times since. The Doomsday Clock isn\u2019t a physical clock so much as it is an attempt to express how close a panel of noted experts feels we are to destroying the planet, reports CBS News correspondent Kris Van Cleave. Scientists consider factors like nuclear weapons and, more recently, climate change. \u201cIt is a metaphor, but we are literally minutes away from a nuclear exchange should someone press a button,\u201d said Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists executive director Rachel Bronson.\u00a0 In a statement explaining today\u2019s decision, the group said:\u00a0 \u201cWorld leaders have failed to come to grips with humanity\u2019s most pressing existential threats: nuclear weapons and climate change. Disturbing comments about the use and proliferation of nuclear weapons made by Donald Trump, as well as the expressed disbelief in the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change by both Trump and several of his cabinet appointees, affected the Board\u2019s decision, as did the emergence of strident nationalism worldwide.\u201d With the Doomsday Clock starting the day at three minutes to midnight, it\u2019s President Trump\u2019s finger on the button. Prior to taking office, he called for the U.S. to \u201cstrengthen and expand its nuclear capability.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cDoes the election of a new president who might be more hawkish \u2013 is that grounds for moving the clock?\u201d Van Cleave asked. \u201cThose are the issues that the science and security board take into consideration. We very rarely make a decision based on an individual,\u201d Bronson said.\u00a0 The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists debuted the clock in 1947, setting the initial time at seven minutes to midnight because \u2013 according to the artist who designed it \u2013 \u201cit looked good to my eye.\u201d The hands came closest to midnight at two minutes away in 1953 after the U.S. and the Soviet Union tested their first hydrogen bombs. \u201cThis seems to me to be more a day for a searching of the human soul perhaps than for any kind of scientific celebration,\u201d former CBS News broadcaster Bill Downs said on air.\u00a0 We were furthest from annihilation in 1991 with 17 minutes to spare after the signing of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty at the end of the Cold War. But they acknowledge they once got it wrong: the year of the Cuban missile crisis \u2013 which brought the world to the brink of nuclear war \u2013 the clock moved back to 12 minutes to midnight.\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s the one that when we look back across our whole time series, is the one that we\u2019d say, they didn\u2019t know all the information at that point,\u201d Bronson said. Bill Gertz writes about national security for the Washington Times and is publishing a new book which details the continuing threat of nuclear weapons. \u201cIf that clock ticks closer to midnight, are you going to lose any sleep?\u201d Van Cleave asked him. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to lose any sleep,\u201d Gertz said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re near an apocalypse.\u201d He sees the Doomsday Clock as more of a political barometer. \u201cIn a lot of ways, the Doomsday Clock is being used by the liberal left to try to promote its agenda for nuclear disarmament, for greater efforts to control climate change and other elements,\u201d Gertz said.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ve moved it for Republicans and Democrats, and most recently a Democratic administration,\u201d Bronson said. \u201cThere are some that are going to say all you\u2019re doing is creating panic at a time when there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty,\u201d Van Cleave said. \u201cOur goal isn\u2019t to create panic, but it is to say this is very serious,\u201d Bronson responded. \u201cAnd there\u2019s things that we can do. And if we can have that conversation that would be very productive.\u201d The Doomsday Clock only factors in man-made threats to the world. Scientists don\u2019t consider threats like epidemics or meteors. In a 2014 poll by \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and Vanity Fair, more than one third of Americans said a nuclear war was most likely to end humanity.",

            "article_content": "By Sarah Dutton, Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus, Kabir Khanna and Anthony Salvanto Donald Trump campaigned on keeping jobs in the U.S. and six in ten Americans expect he will keep a significant number of U.S. jobs from moving overseas. Just under half think he will be able to get big money out of politics. About a third think he will build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border (something six in ten Americans oppose), or defeat ISIS. Overall, just 39 percent expect Mr. Trump will keep most of the promises he made during the presidential campaign, while over half the public thinks he will not keep those promises. Expectations are that Mr. Trump\u2019s policies will be most advantageous for large corporations, the rich and white Americans, and will be more detrimental to racial minorities and women. Fifty-nine percent of Americans oppose building a wall along the Mexico border; 37 percent favor that. Views divide along party lines: 65 percent of Republicans favor building a wall, while 79 percent of Democrats oppose it. Seventy-nine percent of Americans expect that if a wall is built along the border, the U.S. will ultimately pay for it. Just 14 percent expect Mexico will pay, as Mr. Trump has claimed. Sixty percent of Republicans, and 91 percent of Democrats, think the U.S. will pay for the wall if it is built. Mr. Trump intends to step down from the positions he holds at the Trump Organization and turn over operations to a trust controlled by his adult sons, but does not plan to give up ownership of the organization. Forty-six percent of Americans think these steps are adequate to prevent any conflicts of interest he may have during his presidency, while 50 percent think they are not adequate. There are large differences between Republicans and Democrats. More generally, Americans are divided as to whether Donald Trump will serve the interests of his family and businesses, or those of the American people, when he becomes president. Partisan differences also run large on this question. Among Republicans, 81 percent say that Mr. Trump will make decisions to further the interests of the American people, compared to only 19 percent of Democrats who believe the same thing. Mr. Trump has named his son-in-law Jared Kushner as senior adviser to the president. In general, 70 percent of Americans think it is not appropriate for presidents to appoint family members to senior White House positions, while just 26 percent think that is appropriate. Mr. Trump has yet to release his income tax returns, something that candidates for president generally do. Most Americans (57 percent) think it is necessary that he do so, but on this question as well, the public is divided along party lines. Twenty-nine percent of Republicans say it\u2019s necessary for him to release his returns, while 80 percent of Democrats say it\u2019s necessary. Americans are now split in their views of the Affordable Care Act: 48 percent approve of the law, while about as many, 47 percent, disapprove, including 32 percent who disapprove strongly.\u00a0 Nevertheless, the percentage that approves of the law is the highest it has been since the CBS News Poll began asking about it nearly seven years ago.\u00a0  Sixty-one percent of Republicans strongly disapprove of the ACA; 44 percent of Democrats strongly approve. Just 22 percent of the public now think the health care law should be repealed entirely, the lowest that has been since the question was first asked in CBS News Polls in 2013.  Among the 22 percent of Americans who want to see the law repealed, 47 percent want the law to be repealed immediately, while half \u2013 50 percent- think it should be repealed only after Congress has agreed on a new health care law to replace it. Six in ten Americans are very concerned that if the law is repealed before a replacement is enacted, individuals currently covered by the law would not have health insurance. Another 24 percent are somewhat concerned about that. After a contentious election, 56 percent of Americans are optimistic about the next four years with Mr. Trump in the White House, but that\u2019s the lowest level of optimism for any president-elect in CBS News polling going back to Jimmy Carter in 1977, when CBS began asking the question. Thirty-nine percent are pessimistic \u2013 a record high. What\u2019s behind these numbers is a starker partisan divide compared to views of previous presidents-elect. Past presidents have received much more optimism across party lines. Republicans are especially optimistic about Mr. Trump in the White House (87 percent), while Democrats are pessimistic (62 percent), but eight years ago majorities across partisan lines were optimistic about President-elect Obama. \u00a0After George W. Bush\u2019s 2000 election, nearly half of Democrats \u2013 47 percent - were optimistic about George W. Bush taking office, compared to just 32 percent who say that about Trump today. Americans\u2019 expectations about what kind of president Donald Trump will be are also more negative than expectations for his immediate predecessors. \u00a0Thirty-six percent of Americans think Donald Trump will be a poor president - far higher than either Barack Obama (4 percent) or George W. Bush (12 percent) just before each became president. Thirty-five percent think Mr. Trump will be a very good or good president, and another 23 percent say he will be average.\u00a0 Prospects for the kind of president Donald Trump will be also exhibit a partisan divide. Most Republicans expect Trump to be a very good or good president (71 percent), compared to just 9 percent of Democrats (67 percent think he will do a poor job). Looking back, Republicans about Barack Obama eight years ago. Bringing change to Washington was central to Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, and a majority of Americans (59 percent) think he will do that. Most also view him as a strong leader (55 percent), but there are areas of concern. More than six in ten Americans are uneasy about how Mr. Trump would handle an international crisis (64 percent) and most think he will divide the country (61 percent) rather than bring people together.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 As Mike Pence prepares to become Vice President, more Americans view him favorably (29 percent) than unfavorably (21 percent), but like many incoming VPs before him, many are undecided or don\u2019t know enough about him to have an opinion. Incoming First Lady Melania Trump plans to spend part of Donald Trump\u2019s first year in office in New York while their son finishes school.\u00a0 Americans are split in their overall views of Mrs. Trump; more than half are undecided or don\u2019t know enough about her to have an opinion. Previous incoming First Ladies were viewed more positively.  After Donald Trump is sworn in as president, the Republican Party will control both the White House and Congress, leaving the Democratic Party in the minority. Eight in 10 Americans want Democrats in Congress to try and work with Mr. Trump and Congressional Republicans to get things done.  During the presidential campaign, Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans didn\u2019t always see eye-to-eye. Looking ahead, Americans think Republicans in Congress will have more influence than Donald Trump over what gets done in Washington. Overall, the public continues to give Congress overwhelmingly negative ratings, but 24 percent now approve of the job Congress is doing, up from 15 percent before the election and the highest it has been since September 2013.\u00a0 \u00a0 This poll was conducted by telephone January 13-17, 2017 among a random sample of 1,257 adults nationwide.\u00a0 Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Media, PA.\u00a0 Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones.  The poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone.  Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables.  The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample could be plus or minus three percentage points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request. The margin of error includes the effects of standard weighting procedures which enlarge sampling error slightly.

            "article_content": "Ahead of Montana's special House election on Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence and President Trump are stepping in to lend a hand to the GOP's candidate in the moderately Republican state.  On Tuesday, Pence recorded a robocall on behalf of Greg Gianforte, saying \"President Trump and I need Greg working with us in Washington to cut your taxes, secure our borders and protect your Second Amendment rights.\" Pence goes on to slam House Democrats, specifically Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, urging voters not to let them \"take this seat out of Republican hands\" adding that \"the stakes are high\" in Thursday's election.  This is the second case of Pence stepping in to help Republican candidates. He recently established his own political action committee, the Great America Committee, in order to help raise money to get pro-Trump candidates elected. Pence campaign strategist Nick Ayers shut down any speculation that the PAC was anything more than a vehicle to help other candidates.  While it's not common for a sitting vice president to set up a fundraising vehicle like Pence's, the PAC, Ayers says, moves all of the data, emails and digital assets that Pence had built up in a state-level gubernatorial political committee into a federal PAC. It's a \"legal necessity,\" Ayers said. \"It is what it is.\" On Wednesday, the RNC released Mr. Trump's own recording, in which he called upon Montanas to vote for what they \"really want\" including \"lower taxes, good paying jobs and secure borders.\" Mr. Trump also echoed Pence's call to protect the Second Amendment, as well as the call to stop \"liberal Democrats decimating and dismantling all that we've done.\" Calling Gianforte a \"wonderful guy\" who \"knows how to win\", Mr. Trump told voters that they're going to have \"great healthcare\" and \"all of the other things you so desperately want and need\" if they head to the polls on Thursday.\u00a0 Democrats are hoping for a win in Montana as they need to win 24 seats to get back control of the House in 2018. Both parties have been spending large sums to fill the vacant seat left by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. The campaign committees for Democrat Rob Quist and Gianforte have raised at least $10 million combined, with outside groups spending more than $7.1 million thus far.\u00a0 Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

            "article_content": "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Wednesday claimed a dominating parliamentary election victory over anti-Islam lawmaker Geert Wilders, who failed the year\u2019s first litmus test for populism in Europe. Provisional results with over half the votes counted suggested Rutte\u2019s party won 32 seats in the 150-member legislature, 13 more than Wilders\u2019 party, which took only third place with 19 seats. The surging CDA Christian Democrats claimed 20. Following Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union and Donald Trump\u2019s election as U.S. president, \u201cthe Netherlands said, \u2018Whoa!\u2019 to the wrong kind of populism,\u201d said Rutte, who is now poised for a third term as prime minister. \u201cWe want to stick to the course we have -- safe and stable and prosperous,\u201d Rutte added. Wilders, who campaigned on radical pledges to close borders to migrants from Muslim nations, close mosques, ban the Quran and take the Netherlands out of the EU, had insisted that whatever the result of the election, the kind of populist politics he and others in Europe represent aren\u2019t going away. \u201cRutte has not seen the back of me,\u201d Wilders said after the results had sunk in. His Party for Freedom clinched 24 seats in 2010 before sinking to 15 in 2012, and Wednesday\u2019s total left him with about 12 percent of the electorate, far less than populists in Britain and the United States have scored. \u201cThose are not the 30 seats we hoped for,\u201d Wilders told reporters early Thursday, adding that he\u2019d \u201crather have been the biggest party.\u201d Both France and Germany have elections this year in which far-right candidates and parties are hoping to make an impact. French President Francois Hollande congratulated Rutte on his election success and his \u201cclear victory against extremism.\u201d In Germany, Socialist leader Martin Schulz tweeted. \u201cI am relieved, but we need to continue to fight for an open and Free Europe.\u201d Rutte, who for much of the campaign appeared to be racing to keep pace with Wilders, may have profited from the hard line he drew in a diplomatic standoff with Turkey over the past week. The fight erupted over the Netherlands\u2019 refusal to let two Turkish government ministers address rallies in Rotterdam about a referendum that could give Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan more powers. It gave Rutte an opportunity to show his statesmanship by refusing to bow to foreign pressure, a stance with widespread backing in the nation. \u201cI mean, this is your electoral campaign dream, right? You can\u2019t script this if it was a movie,\u201d Amsterdam Free University political scientist Andre Krouwel said. \u201cIt\u2019s really helped Mark Rutte to take the lead and a big lead over Geert Wilders.\u201d Under brilliant skies, the Dutch went to vote in huge numbers, with turnout estimated to have reached at 82 percent. In a subplot of the elections, the Green Left party registered a historic victory, turning it into the largest party on the left wing of Dutch politics, together with the Socialist Party. The provisional results showed the Greens leaping from four seats to 14 in parliament after a strong campaign by charismatic leader Jesse Klaver, who invites comparisons to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. It remains to be seen if the 30-year-old Klaver will take his party into the next ruling coalition, which looks likely to be dominated by Rutte\u2019s VVD and other right-leaning parties. The Labor Party of Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem appeared to have been punished by voters in the election, plunging from 38 seats at the last election to just nine, according to the Ipsos exit poll. Because of the result, it looked unlikely Dijsselbloem would be able to hang on to his post of leading the 19-nation Eurogroup, which manages the currency of the European Union nations that use the euro. Rutte had framed the election as a choice between continuity and chaos, portraying himself as a safe custodian of the nation\u2019s economic recovery and casting Wilders as a far-right radical who was unprepared to make tough decisions. Although he drove through unpopular austerity measures over the last four years, the Dutch economic recovery has gathered pace and unemployment has fallen fast under the prime minister. Wilders, meanwhile, attempted to tap into discontent among voters who said they were not benefiting from the economic recovery. Even if his party had placed first in the election, Wilders stood a remote chance of becoming prime minister in the Netherlands, where a proportional representation system all but guarantees coalition governments. The main political parties, including Rutte\u2019s, had ruled out forming a coalition government with the Party for Freedom. The left-leaning Dutch Labor Party appeared to be hammered by its supporters for its role over the last four years in pushing through a tough austerity package as junior member in a two-party Cabinet with Rutte\u2019s VVD. The coalition Rutte\u2019s VVD party had with Labor can no longer be replicated and the prime minister is likely to look to the right for new coalition partners. Rutte has been resolute about not wanting to share power with Wilders, so that tightens the market in which he can acquire the necessary 75-seat threshold. Weeks, if not months of coalition-building talks may be required before a new government is installed.",

            "article_content": "LONDON -- Senior members of British Prime Minister Theresa May's government rallied to her defense Monday amid doubts over her ability to remain in power following a disastrous election result. As the Conservative Party digested the loss of its majority in last week's election, government officials suggested both the announcement of the prime minister's agenda, known as the Queen's Speech, and talks over Britain's divorce from the European Union could be postponed. Sky News reported the speech would be delayed a few days -- a highly unusual circumstance in a country where the monarch's schedule is determined months in advance. The BBC and other British outlets reported that the delay of the speech was, in part, down to the fact that the Queen's Speech, according to tradition, must be written on goatskin parchment paper. The government prepares the speech for the monarch, and reportedly it had two versions ready before the election; one to be used in the case of a Conservative majority, and one for an outright Labour victory. As last week's vote yielded no majority winner, a new speech was required -- and the time it would take for that missive to be scrawled upon the thick specialist paper (which is no longer made using animal hides) and sufficiently dried for use was, apparently, a factor in the delay. Members of the Labour Party pounced on the possible delay, however, as another example of the \"chaos\" surrounding May's leadership. The possible delays come as critics urge cross-party discussions to reach a consensus on Britain's exit from the EU. May's failure to get a majority has undercut her tough Brexit strategy, which had raised fears that Britain was heading for a so-called \"hard Brexit,\" which could potentially see tariffs slapped on British exports to the bloc. May moved to demonstrate that she understands the frustration of voters by moving up a meeting with rank-and-file Conservative Party lawmakers, some of whom have called for her to step aside sooner rather than later. The meeting will now be held Monday afternoon instead of Tuesday. The prime minister's most prominent potential rival, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, sought to quash any suggestion that she would be ousted imminently. Writing in the mass-circulation Sun newspaper, Johnson stressed that the Conservatives won more votes than at any time since Margaret Thatcher and are still the largest party in Parliament. \"The people of Britain have had a bellyful of promises and politicking,\" he wrote. \"Now is the time for delivery - and Theresa May is the right person to continue that vital work.\" With opinion polls showing the Conservatives had a commanding lead over the opposition Labour Party, May called an early election in hopes of increasing her majority in Parliament and strengthening her position in Brexit negotiations. Instead, the election stripped May of her majority and obliterated her political authority. The Conservatives are now trying to secure the support of Northern Ireland's 10 Democratic Unionist Party lawmakers to assure passage of May's program. Over the weekend, May's top two aides stepped aside. Many in the party were furious at the pair for shutting them out of decision-making during the election campaign. May also restored former Justice Secretary Michael Gove to the Cabinet in another move designed to show she was willing to listen to critics. Gove, a long-time opponent who was dismissed when May became prime minister last year, will now serve as environment secretary. Conservative leaders on Monday sought to shift the debate away from May's wounded leadership and onto complex Brexit talks, which are formally set to begin next week. David Davis, the cabinet member in charge of Brexit, said talks with the EU may not start on Monday because it would clash with the Queen's Speech, but they will still begin next week. \"It may not be on the Monday because we also have got the Queen's Speech that week and I will have to speak in that, and so on,\" he told Sky News. Davis suggested the government would focus on the divorce proceedings before moving on to trade. The divorce issues include the rights of EU citizens in Britain as well as U.K. citizens in the EU, how much Britain will have to pay to cover previous spending commitments and the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The EU has said that sufficient progress must be made on these issues before trade deals can be discussed, though Britain had argued the talks should take place simultaneously. Moody's Investors Service said the inconclusive election outcome would complicate and \"probably delay\" negotiations with the EU. \"Overall, we believe that the election outcome will hamper Brexit negotiations and increase fiscal risks, and therefore be negative for the U.K.'s credit profile,\" Moody's said in a statement. \"However, the Conservative Party's reduced share of the vote may indicate a higher likelihood that a 'softer' form of Brexit might now be pursued, involving compromises with the EU that Ms. May would not have countenanced previously, and which would be positive.\" As discussion continued, a leading business organization said the political uncertainty is leading to a \"dramatic drop\" in confidence. The Institute of Directors survey said company directors see no clear way to resolve the political situation quickly. They also believe another election would negatively impact the U.K. economy. \"It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could - if not addressed immediately - be disastrous for the U.K. economy,\" said Stephen Martin, the director-general of the IoD. \"The needs of business and discussion of the economy were largely absent from the campaign, but this crash in confidence shows how urgently that must change in the new government.\"",

            "article_content": "On Tuesday, now-HHS Secretary Tom Price's seat is up for grabs in Georgia's 6th Congressional District. He cruised to victory with a 23-point margin in November. The race between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel could be considerably closer. Tuesday's election is a runoff, a result of the fact that no candidate won 50 percent of the vote in the April 18 jungle primary. Ossoff received 48.1 percent and Handel came in second with 19.8 percent in the 18-candidate field, including 11 Republicans, 5 Democrats, 2 independents. The election, which has become the most expensive House race in history, is being touted as a must-win for both parties, but it's not necessarily predictive of what's to come in the 2018 midterms. Polls close at 7 p.m. ET on Tuesday, but in-person early voting was open from May 30-June 16, and\u00a0over 140,000\u00a0cast early ballots -- including 36,000 who didn't vote in the April primary -- according to the Georgia secretary of State. In the primary, 192,000 voters cast ballots, including 52,000 early voters. The district, which consists of Atlanta's northern suburbs, comprises parts of Cobb, DeKalb and Fulton counties. The seat has been in Republican hands since Newt Gingrich won in 1978. Johnny Isakson, now a senator, replaced him in 1999, and Tom Price replaced Isakson in 2005. President Trump won this district, which is considered solidly Republican, by a slim 1.5 percent in 2016. In contrast, Mitt Romney won it by 23 points. The\u00a0district\u00a0is 70 percent white, 13 percent black, and 13 percent Hispanic. The Cook Political Report has described the district \"as one of the wealthiest, most urban, and best-educated districts that voted Republican last fall.\" The report also called it \"an outlier and rather unrepresentative of the larger House playing field.\" Republican Karen Handel, 55, served as Georgia's secretary of State from 2007-2010. She resigned in 2010 to run for governor, losing a runoff to Nathan Deal, who went on to win the general election. Handel also ran for U.S. Senate in 2014 and came in third in the GOP primary. Outside of public office, she worked as vice president of public policy for the Susan G. Komen for the Cure from 2011-2012, resigning after Komen reversed its controversial move to cut ties with Planned Parenthood, a move that happened under Handel's watch. She has also served as chairman of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners, and deputy chief of staff to former Gov. Sonny Perdue. Democrat Jon Ossoff, 30, is a documentary filmmaker and a former Capitol Hill staffer, working for five years as a legislative aide, with a focus on national security, to Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Georgia.\u00a0 This is his first run for political office. He also does not live in the district, a fact seized upon by Republicans, including President Trump, who tweeted about it on the day before the election. Ossoff is a staunch opponent of the GOP efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare. He has run ads with a centrist fiscal message of cutting \"wasteful spending.\" Because the district is traditionally Republican and conservative, an anti-Trump message has not been much of a priority for Ossoff during his campaign. Handel hasn't shunned Mr. Trump but she's hasn't exactly emphasized him in her campaign, either.\u00a0 With regard to Mr. Trump's Russia controversy, she has said let's see \"where the facts take us\" but has also called the controversy \"noise.\" On health care, she's been lukewarm on the GOP effort to repeal and replace Obamacare, saying that the House bill isn't perfect. Handel is trying to sell herself as fiscally conservative and an \"independent\" while slamming Ossoff as too liberal for the district. Mr. Trump tweeted his support Handel on Monday, slamming Democrats' efforts to \"stop tax cuts, good health care and border security.\" The Dems want to stop tax cuts, good healthcare and Border Security.Their ObamaCare is dead with 100% increases in P's. Vote now for Karen H Between the Ossoff and Handel campaigns and outside groups, at least $40 million has been spent so far on this race. As of May 31, Ossoff had raised $23.6 million for the primary and runoff combined, a whopping $8.3 million for the primary and $15.3 million since. Republicans are loudly criticizing the fact that the vast majority of his campaign donations are from out of state. Handel has raised a total of $4.56 million as of May 31, but she has had way more help from outside groups. It's estimated that $12 million has been spent by outside groups on behalf of Handel with $6.2 million spent on ads by the GOP super PAC Congressional Leadership Fund being the largest share of that. Ossoff has been the beneficiary of $6.7 million from outside groups with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's $5 million outlay making up the biggest chunk of that total. According to IssueOne, a pro-campaign finance reform group that looked at filings with the Federal Election Commission, $59.6 million has been invested in the race so far by all candidates and political groups, including money that was spent during the primary process of the election. If Ossoff wins, it'll give heart to Democrats that the enthusiasm among Democratic voters and activists who oppose Mr. Trump can make a difference in midterm races, even in some Republican districts. Mr. Trump's opponents around the country -- Democrats and anti-Trump independents -- will have some proof that Mr. Trump can be a political liability and they'll get a huge lift in terms of energy and enthusiasm for recruiting candidates and for fundraising. However, if Handel wins, the deep divisions within the Democratic Party about which direction the party should go will surely be amplified. An Ossoff loss would hit Democrats hard, after his candidacy was fueled by so much cash and Democratic voter enthusiasm. And it would continue the party's winless streak in the 2017 special elections. The continuing battle between progressives and establishment Democrats would likely intensify. Even if Ossoff wins, that battle within the party will continue to rage, though it may be briefly tamped down as Democrats celebrate his victory. If Handel loses, the chatter about a negative \"Trump effect\" will likely rise to a fever pitch. Republican hand-wringing about how Trump's controversies and negative ratings will affect them in future elections will be in full force. Why? Again, it's mainly because this is a Republican district that has been held by Republicans for decades -- even though Trump barely squeaked by Clinton with a mere 1.5 percent margin in November.

After attending a raucous and colorful independence day parade, Mattis met with President Petro Poroshenko and other top government leaders. He is the first Pentagon chief to visit the former Soviet republic since Robert Gates in 2007. \"Have no doubt,\" Mattis said at a news conference with Poroshenko. \"The United States stands with Ukraine.\" He said Washington does not, \"and we will not,\" accept Russia's annexation of Crimea, a 2014 action that was followed by Russian military intervention in support of separatists in eastern Ukraine. \"Despite Russia's denials, we know they are seeking to redraw international borders by force,\" Mattis said, an ambition by Moscow that Mattis said is undermining sovereign European nations and stirring tension. Mattis ticked off a series of international agreements and commitments that Moscow has made since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, including a two-year-old accord known as the Minsk Agreement, which lays out a roadmap for reducing the conflict in Ukraine that has claimed some 10,000 lives over the past three years. He also cited other Russian commitments to Ukraine dating to 1994. \"Unfortunately, Russia is not adhering to the letter, much less the spirit of these international commitments,\" he said. In June when Poroshenko\u00a0visited the White House, he lauded the U.S. for continuing to apply pressure on Russia for violating his country's territorial sovereignty and stood by the framework of the\u00a0Minsk Agreement\u00a0to halt the fighting in the Donbass region of Ukraine.\u00a0 When speaking to reporters at the Ukrainian embassy in Washington during his overseas trip, Poroshenko said he did \"not consider it necessary to change the Minsk and Normandy formats of negotiations.\" The Associated Press reported earlier this month that the Trump administration has reopened consideration of long-rejected plans to give Ukraine lethal weapons. Those deliberations put pressure on President Donald Trump, who is fighting perceptions he is soft on Moscow amid investigations into whether his campaign colluded with the Kremlin to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election. In his remarks alongside Poroshenko, Mattis said the U.S. is committed to helping Ukraine build and modernize its armed forces, but he made no mention of providing lethal arms.",

It\u2019s funding the government from April 28 to September 30.\u201d  Congress must pass a new spending package by April 28 or the government will shut down. Last year, lawmakers twice delayed the passage of 2017 funding\u00a0in order to give the Trump White House more control over spending levels. The government is currently running on funding from fiscal 2016, which ended last September.  Ryan suggested that Congress won\u2019t fulfill the Trump administration\u2019s request for additional money for the Department of Homeland Security for the border wall for this year, though he said there will be funding for border security.\u00a0 \u201cThe big chunk of money for the wall, really, is...next fiscal year\u2019s appropriations because they literally can\u2019t start construction even this quickly,\u201d he said.  In its initial budget blueprint released earlier this month, the White House had requested $1.4 billion for the current fiscal year to fund the initial developments of the wall. Democrats have suggested they would oppose any spending bill that includes money for the proposed wall.  The speaker insisted that Republicans won\u2019t revisit their effort from 2015 to try to defund Planned Parenthood in the government-wide spending package and will instead do it through legislation through the budget reconciliation process.  \u201cWe think the smart way to go is...reconciliation because that only requires 50 votes. It takes 60 votes to defund Planned Parenthood in the Senate if you go through appropriations. I don\u2019t think there are 60 votes,\u201d he said.  Asked how his relationship is with President Trump, Ryan said, \u201cVery good. We talk frequently actually. Actually we, you know, we didn\u2019t know each other very well or if at all before the election.

So, in my opinion, they have a lot to answer for.\u201d\u00a0 Russia has chipped into the bedrock of American politics at least since the 2016 presidential election, when emails from the DNC were stolen by Russian hackers and published by WikiLeaks.\u00a0 An FBI investigation started in July 2016, and investigations in the House and the Senate began in January to identify the extent of Russian cyber attacks and possible relationships with Trump officials.\u00a0 \u201cThey\u2019re playing a very weak hand,\u201d Shultz said of the Russians. \u201cThey\u2019re playing it aggressively. And I think if we put up a big stop sign, they will change because their demography is against them, their economy is against them.\u201d\u00a0",

If you put up a wall you might be able to keep people out, but you can't keep the Internet out. You can't keep ideas out,\" he later added. \"Do we believe, fundamentally, in having an inclusive nation of cooperating, diverse communities? Or a nation of exclusive groups with separate interests and goals, who believe in order for them to win, someone else has to lose.\" Clinton emphasized the importance of strong, positive leadership and inclusivity in the face of political adversity. \"Everybody should be seen, everybody should be heard,\" he said. \"But that requires a certain style of leadership. Which, again, is providence not just of the elected, but of every active citizen. Which kind of leadership do you favor: blame or responsibility?\"",

            "article_content": "JOHN DICKERSON, HOST: Today on FACE THE NATION: President Trump's controversial decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel sparks violent protests in the Middle East.  Plus, forced resignations over sexual misconduct rattle Congress, as work begins to clean up a messy tax bill in the rush to get it to the president's desk by Christmas.  There is fury in the Arab world today and concern for American citizens' safety overseas, as criticism from U.S. allies over the administration's plan to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem threatens to further deteriorate the view of the U.S. role around the world.  We will talk to U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley.  Back at home, members of Congress push three of their colleagues accused of sexual misconduct out. But with two days until the Senate special election in Alabama, will accused child molester Roy Moore be in?  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  ROY MOORE (R), ALABAMA SENATORIAL CANDIDATE: I did not date underage women. I did not molest anyone. And so these allegations are false.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: Democrats are hoping Doug Jones can turn out the African-American vote and are attacking Moore's character.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  NARRATOR: Think about it. Has Roy Moore ever looked you in the eye told you the truth?  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: Senate Republicans still refuse to support Moore, but the president is all in, campaigning near Alabama and recording a robo-call on Moore's behalf.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So, get out and vote for Roy Moore.  (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)  TRUMP: Do it. Do it.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: We will talk to Maine's Republican Senator Susan Collins and the number two Democrat in the Senate, Illinois' Richard Durbin, about the politics of sexual misconduct in Congress and efforts to clean up a sprawling tax bill that has sparked more questions than answers.  We will also have plenty of analysis, both foreign and domestic, on all the news this week.  It's just ahead on FACE THE NATION.  Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I'm John Dickerson.  We want to begin with a look at the reaction to the president's decision on Jerusalem.  CBS News correspondent Seth Doane reports.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  SETH DOANE, CBS NEWS CORRESPONDENT: This is the entrance to the Old City of Jerusalem. Damascus Gate has historically been a flash point for violence.  It is calm today, but additional security is in place. And there is a worrying development this morning. Unrest is pushing beyond Israel's borders.  (voice-over): In Lebanon today, security forces fired tear gas and used water cannons to push back pro-Palestinian protesters in front of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut. Those demonstrators threw objects and lit fires to register their anger over President Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.  In Cairo, there was serious diplomatic blowback at an emergency meeting of Arab League foreign ministers, who criticized Mr. Trump's decision, saying it threatens to push the region to the edge of the abyss of violence, chaos and bloodshed.  After days of clashes, protests continue, while funerals for some of those killed in Gaza revealed a dangerous mix of anger and grief. Israel's military announced today it destroyed what it called a significant terrorist tunnel.  In the past, Hamas used tunnels to move weapons, supplies and to carry out surprise attacks.  (on camera): Today, the military wing of Hamas made an ominous statement, saying that the next few days would prove to the world what a mistake the U.S. decision had been, and warned not to underestimate the will of the Palestinian resistant.  (END VIDEOTAPE)  DICKERSON: And we turn now to U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. She joins us from New York.  Welcome, Madam Ambassador.  I want to start. You have seen the violence in response to the U.S. decision on the embassy. There's a lot of tension in the Middle East. With all that's going on and all that the U.S. has to deal with there, why was this a priority and in America's national interest to make this move right now?  NIKKI HALEY, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: Good morning, John.  Well, first of all, this is a move the American people had asked for, for 22 years. And six months ago, the Senate overwhelmingly again asked for the embassy to be moved.  And I think you have to look at the fact that every presidential candidate, Republican or Democrat, has all said that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and the embassy should be moved.  President Trump is the only one that had the courage to actually do that. And so what this does is basically do what we do in almost every other country, which is put the embassy in the capital city.  And Jerusalem is where the prime minister is, the president is, the Parliament, the Supreme Court. It makes sense for our embassy to be there.  DICKERSON: Given all that's happening in the world, why is it a priority to do this right now, and why the -- and why is it worth paying the price of the increased violence?  HALEY: Because it's the right thing to do. It is absolutely the right thing to do.  And, look, for the last 22 years, everyone around every president has said, just wait, just wait, just wait. And President Trump is not going to wait anymore.  DICKERSON: But explain why it's the right thing to do.  HALEY: It's the right thing to do because it's just reality. Jerusalem is the capital of Israel.  They have said that. When the American people say they want something, it is -- it's their will that we're supposed to follow.  DICKERSON: But, in this case, the U.S. is, critics believe, changing its role. It's stepping in more forcefully on the side of Israel, and that that sends signal that is not going to make things better.  So, explain how we get from this move to a better outcome and whether this isn't -- all this violence isn't going to delay a better outcome.  HALEY: Well, first of all, I think that when you recognize the truth, when both parties recognize reality, peace comes.  And that's just -- that's just the true reality of the situation. We're living in the reality that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. But, if you notice, when the president spoke, he made it very clear. He didn't talk about boundaries. He didn't talk about borders. He didn't get into any of that, because the final status of Jerusalem is between the Palestinians and the Israelis.  It's not for the Americans to decide. So we are doing what we do in every other country. Israel should be no different. And then we're going to continue to support the peace process.  You know, courage breeds leadership. What you saw was, you saw a courageous move by the president. And, of course, any time you have to use courage, any time you have to go against the status quo, you're going to have people saying the sky is falling. But the sky is not falling.  If anything, what we're going to see is both sides are going to come to the table, they're going to decide what they think Jerusalem should look like, and we're going to support that process.  DICKERSON: Well, of course, people would -- the rebuttal would be that aggressive moves in the Middle East have often cost the United States a lot in blood and treasure.  Let me ask you this question on a negotiating standpoint. One of the criticisms is, the president gave up a bargaining chip that could be used in negotiation. Another view is, the president is now giving the Israelis something, and now he can ask something from them in return. Which of those two do you subscribe to?  HALEY: So, neither one of those is right.  The president took Jerusalem off the table. That's what he did, because that is something that we have always -- people have said use that as bargaining chip. Let's be clear. The last 22 years, that was a bargaining chip, and it got us nowhere closer to peace.  What he did was take it off the table. Jerusalem is the capital of the Israel. Take that off the table. Tell both sides to come together, and say, OK, you decide how you want to split up Jerusalem. You decide if you're going to create boundaries or borders there. And let them decide.  They're going to be naysayers, John, that say, you shouldn't do this, you shouldn't do this. But they also thought -- they also questioned the president when he first decided to strike for chemical weapons in Syria, and that was true leadership. They said the same thing when we started to push North Korea and push sanctions. That was true leadership.  This again will go down in history to show he made the move that finally got the two parties to come to the table. And it's OK for naysayers, but we know at the end of the day this is the right thing to do.  DICKERSON: Let me ask you about North Korea.  Lindsey Graham, South Carolina senator, said the U.S. should start moving civilians out of South Korea. What is your response to that?  HALEY: Well, I think we're watching North Korea very carefully.  And if you look at the last ballistic missile launch, it had advanced quite a bit compared to the missile before. And it's a concern. And what we will tell you is, North Korea is the biggest threat we have right now. But we're not going to let that stop us. We're going to continue to be forceful.  We're going to continue to have the international community join us, as they have. And we're going to make sure that we do everything we can to denuclearize North Korea.  DICKERSON: Let me ask you about a domestic issue here.  There is a cultural shift going on in America right now. You saw it, three members of Congress kicked out of Congress because of sexual behavior, misdeeds.  You were the first woman senator of South Carolina. What do you think of this cultural moment that's happening?  HALEY: I -- you know, I am incredibly proud of the women who have come forward. I'm proud of their strength. I'm proud of their courage.  And I think that the idea that this is happening, I think it will start to bring a conscience to the situation, not just in politics, but in -- we have seen in Hollywood and in every industry. And I think the time has come.  DICKERSON: Of course, I'm wrong. You were the governor -- first governor of South Carolina.  Given that consciousness, how do you think people should assess the accusers of the president?  HALEY: Well, I mean, the -- the same thing, is women who accuse anyone should be heard. They should be heard, and they should be dealt with.  And I think we heard from them prior to the election. And I think any woman who has felt violated or felt mistreated in any way, they have every right to speak up.  DICKERSON: And does the election mean that's a settled issue?  HALEY: You know, that's for the people to decide.  I know that he was elected, but women should always feel comfortable coming forward. And we should all be willing to listen to them.  DICKERSON: Ambassador Nikki Haley, thanks so much for being with us.  HALEY: OK. Thanks, John.  DICKERSON: And we want to turn now to Maine's Republican Senator Susan Collins.  Welcome, Senator.  We have some important tax business to get to, but I want to stay with this -- this question of the revolution that is going on in the way that sexual assault is being dealt with.  This week, the Republican National Committee supported Roy Moore. You do not support him. You say you believe his accusers.  Your colleague Republican Ben Sasse wrote this: \"I believe the women. And the RNC previously did, too. What's changed? Or is the party just indifferent?\"  You're a Republican. What do you think about the RNC supporting Roy Moore?  SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R), MAINE: I'm disappointed that the RNC has resumed its support of Roy Moore. I think that is a mistake.  I would point out that I did not support Mr. Moore even prior to these allegations of sexual misconduct because I was concerned about his anti-Muslim comments, his anti-LGBT comments. And also, most important of all, he's been removed twice from the Alabama Supreme Court for failure to follow lawful judicial orders.  DICKERSON: You also -- with the news about Al Franken this week, you called for him to resign. Are you closer to your -- are you closer to the Democratic Party on these issues than you are the Republican Party?  COLLINS: I think Republicans care just as much as Democrats about sexual misconduct and sexual harassment.  There's a new awakening in our country that this is pervasive, whether we're talking about Hollywood or Wall Street or the media or Capitol Hill. And that's why I'm joining a bipartisan group of senators who are trying to look at our own procedures on Capitol Hill to assure that allegations of sexual misconduct involving members or staff are dealt with seriously.  DICKERSON: Last question on this before taxes. On the question of procedures, the Senate might have a decision to make with Roy Moore if he's elected. Here is something I'm trying to work with.  With the president, there were these accusations. They were adjudicated in the election, the White House says. So the voters knew about them, and they voted for him. And now he's president.  Why wouldn't that same standard apply to Roy Moore? The voters of Alabama know exactly what has been alleged. If he gets elected, what business does Senate have telling the voters they're wrong?  COLLINS: Well, I think that's the tough question.  If the allegations are known prior to the election, which they weren't in the case of Al Franken, for example, then we have a very tough decision to make about whether it's our role as senators to overturn the will of the people.  Now, I think it's a different situation if the allegations are not known or if they occur while the person is sitting in the Senate.  DICKERSON: Let me go on to taxes.  You voted for the Senate tax cut bill, but you seem to be having qualms, questions about this conference report. Where are you on things now?  COLLINS: I always wait until the final version of the bill is brought before us before I make a final decision on whether or not to support it.  There are major differences between the House and Senate bills, and I don't know where the bill is going to come out. I also obviously care very much about amendments that I was successful in getting in the bill that particularly help middle-income families.  And I'm also concerned about agreements that I have.  DICKERSON: Let me ask you about two of those agreements.  One is on Medicare. You got the agreement from Leader McConnell and Paul Ryan that there would not be these automatic Medicare cuts afterwards. Paul Ryan seemed to suggest maybe he wasn't party to that agreement. What is the nature -- where do things stand on that agreement?  COLLINS: I have written correspondence that memorializes the agreement that the 4 percent cut in Medicare that could go into effect will not go into effect.  I would point out that that law has been waived 16 times. It has never been implemented. But I don't want seniors to have the anxiety of wondering whether the tax bill somehow is going to trigger a cut in Medicare.  I'm absolutely confident. I have it in writing, a statement by both Mitch McConnell and Speaker Ryan.  DICKERSON: The waiving of the so-called pay-go rules.  Let me ask you about seniors and seniors in Maine. The other thing you got a commitment on, as I understand it, is that there would be legislation that would come up before the end of the year dealing with these cost-sharing payments. There's a piece of legislation sponsored by Alexander and Murray.  What is happening with that? Because, in the House, Republicans are being told, no, that's not going to be part of anything before the end of the year, which means, without those cost-sharing payments, premiums are going up for Maine seniors.  COLLINS: I have had a lot of conversations, not only with my colleagues in the Senate, but with my colleagues on the House side and with the White House. I have talked to the president three times about this issue.  And once again, I have no reason to believe that that commitment will not be kept. After all, who wants to see health insurance premiums become more unaffordable than they already are for individuals who are buying insurance in the individual market?  And our two bills, the one that I have with Bill Nelson and Alexander-Murray bill, will exert downward pressure on premiums to make it more affordable.  DICKERSON: There is one critique of that, though, that your legislation helped the condition before this tax bill, which has removal of that individual mandate, and that basically these fixes won't be enough for those people who will see higher premium increases.  COLLINS: We have a brand-new study that just came out last week by Avalere, a respect consulting firm, that says it will more than offset the repeal of the individual mandate. And Keep in mind that the individual mandate fines fall disproportionately on low- and middle-income families. Eighty percent of those fines are paid by families who make less than $50,000 a year.  DICKERSON: All right, Senator, I'm afraid we're going to have to leave it there.  Thank you so much for being with us.  COLLINS: Thank you, John.  DICKERSON: And we will be back in one minute to hear from the number two Democrat in the Senate, Richard Durbin.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Joining us now is Senate Democratic Whip Richard Durbin. He is in Springfield, Illinois. Welcome, Senator.  I want to pick on something That senator Collins said about the face -- the choice that senators may face if Roy Moore is elected in Alabama.  And the question is, what business does Senate have in overturning the will of the people of Alabama if he's elected? Senator Collins says that's a very tough decision. What is your sense ever it?  SEN. RICHARD DURBIN (D-IL), MINORITY WHIP: Well, John, I can tell you this.  First, the decision is to be made by voters of Alabama on Tuesday. And I hope that they will do the right thing in terms of defining their standards and values when it comes to people representing them in Washington.  But we have heard from Republican senators first who have suggested that, if Roy Moore ends up being elected to the Senate, he would face close scrutiny, investigation, even removal from the Senate once he arrives.  I agree with Senator Collins. It's a complicated issue, but I will tell you this. We faced the reality this past week. I have known Al Franken for over 20 years. He is my friend. He was on the floor of the Senate announcing his resignation.  I sat just a few feet away from him. He said it was the worst day in his political life. It was a somber feeling. It was a reality. And I hope the voters of Alabama appreciate that reality when they make their decision on Tuesday.  DICKERSON: Let me ask you about a political critique of the Democratic Party's pressure on Al Franken that led to his resignation.  Dahlia Lithwick writes in \"Slate\" a piece that says: \"Morality is no longer its own reward. What we get in exchange for being good and morally right is now nothing.\"  The argument that the Democrats have a standard that leads Franken to go, and Republicans are going to -- a Republican committee supporting Moore, the president supporting Moore, and that essentially Democrats are on the high road, but it's a politically bad road to be on.  DURBIN: I can just tell you, your interview with Susan Collins demonstrates that's not true.  There are Republicans who feel very strongly about this issue, and have said so. And I think, if more do, then we can establish a national standard, not a partisan standard, when it comes to the future of relationships with women.  This, to me, from Susan Collins' comments, gives me hope that Alabama voters will do the right thing, and also see both parties coming to the same conclusion on this issue.  DICKERSON: Let's -- a final question on this, Senator.  There's a criticism that Al Franken was pressured, not because of the specific facts of the case, but Democrats wanted to look good in comparison to Republicans. What is your response?  DURBIN: I can tell you, it was a painful process because of our personal friendships and relationships with Al and his family.  There was no political calculation in here. It was just a painful moment when we made a decision, moved forward on the Democratic side. I hope the Republicans will face that reality as well.  DICKERSON: On taxes, Senator, what can Democrats do? This is moving into the conference committee. And the Republicans have the vote to pass it. What are Democrats going to do?  DURBIN: Well, it did pass the Senate. There was only one Republican senator, Bob Corker, who voted no.  Susan Collins made it clear she's still waiting before she makes a final decision. I think others are in the same position. Jeff Flake, for example, from Arizona made it clear that bringing up this issue about DACA and the dreamers is critical to his vote when it comes to tax.  So, I can't assume where the Republicans will end, but they have an awful lot to accomplish in a very short period of time.  DICKERSON: You mentioned DACA. Let's just go up on a side road there on that.  A number of your Democratic supporters, colleagues would like you, the Democrats, to basically make funding of the government to keep the government running, would like you to make it contingent on doing something about DACA. Will you?  DURBIN: Well, I can tell you this. We don't want to see the government shut down. We want to move forward in a bipartisan fashion to solve our problems.  We believe that DACA is central. The president is the one who made this issue. September the 5th, he eliminated the DACA program and put in doubt the future of over 780,000 people in America. And we want to get this done and accomplished.  Thirty-four Republicans in the House came out last week and said do it before the end of the year. Senate Republicans have said the same thing. Lisa Murkowski yesterday tweeted that her Christmas wish, her greatest Christmas wish is to see this done, DACA and the dreamer issue resolved this calendar year.  It is within the power of the Republicans to get this done and to put together a package that we can pass. We want to stand by them, work with them, and get that done.  DICKERSON: Nothing focuses like a deadline, though, and using the deadline of the funding as leverage, both for this and also the children's health insurance, nine million children. That still is yet to be dealt with.  You at one point said, \"I'm not prepared to go home for the holidays until we get our work done.\"  That suggests a little bit of use of this funding as a deadline, but are you really going to go that far?  DURBIN: Well, I feel very strongly about it.  There are many important issues. DACA, to me personally, the DREAM Act, are very personal and mean an awful lot. But when we're talking about funding our government, providing the resources and programs that middle-income families use across America, dealing with the opioid crisis, making certain that we take care of our veterans, making certain that we have the money for biomedical research, these are part of the conversation and part of the dialogue as we close down this budget.  It is up to Republicans to make a decision about what we will do. I think we can get this done right.  DICKERSON: Final question, Senator. You're on the Judiciary Committee. There have been some questions raised about inspectors, people working for the special counsel, one of whom sent disparaging texts about the president, and then another went to Hillary Clinton's victory party and also praised blocking the president's travel ban.  What is your -- how big of a deal do you think this is that these questions are being raised?  DURBIN: Let me say at the outset I have the highest confidence in Bob Mueller. I also have confidence that if he has any questions about the motives or conduct of his staff, he will act on it decisively and professionally.  He is moving forward on this investigation. I trust him. If there's something that went wrong in terms of the staffing, I trust him to take care of it.  DICKERSON: All right, Senator, that's it. We're out of time. Thanks so much for being with us.  And we will be right back in a moment. Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Be sure to sure to tune in to tomorrow night's \"CBS Evening News,\" which will feature Jeff Glor's interview with French President Emmanuel Macron, ahead of the One Planet climate change summit in Paris this week. And then Jeff will anchor tomorrow night's broadcast from the Elysee Palace. And we will be right here with more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Some of our stations are leaving us now, but we have got a lot more FACE THE NATION coming up, plenty of analysis on news here and abroad.  Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.  For a closer look at some of the major issues we're facing abroad, we turn to Kori Schake, who is a distinguished fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. Her new book is \"Safe Passage: The Transition from British to American Hegemony.\" Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow and director of research at the Brookings Institution is here. And he, of course, is in Washington.  Kori, let me start with you. I tried to get the U.N. ambassador to give me a sense of why now on Jerusalem.  Why now?  KORI SCHAKE, HOOVER INSTITUTION: It's not clear why now. I think the White House is hoping that it will push the peace process forward by -- as Nikki Haley said, taking Jerusalem off the table. I think that's unlikely to prove true. I think it's going to make that peace process a lot more complicated because it doesn't look like they -- it doesn't look like they had anything to offer Palestinians.  DICKERSON: Right.  SCHAKE: And so it's surprising that other countries in the region care less, in part because they need more cooperation from Israel now than before.  DICKERSON: Michael, what's your view, people to see this violence. What -- how should they see this? Big deal? Should they be nervous? What's your sense?  MICHAEL O'HANLON, BROOKINGS INSTITUTION: Well, I'm glad that you asked it that way, John, because I think it's -- it's a medium deal. It's not the end of the world. President Trump didn't say that east Jerusalem could never be the capital for Palestine. He didn't make any other such declarations that were really out of what we all expect in any kind of a final peace agreement anyway. And, of course, the peace process, even though Kori's totally right, that it's -- this is not helpful to the peace process, it wasn't exactly going any place anyway.  So I think there are bigger questions about what kind of leverage can we create with both parties. And perhaps we need to think harder about that. But I don't see this as more than what my colleague Natan Sachs calls an unforced error. In other words, it's not tragedy. It's probably a mistake. It probably complicates the atmosphere I'm not sure it really changes the terms of any potential peace deal or really impedes any negotiation that was having any momentum to begin with.  DICKERSON: Let's talk now to -- about a place where an unforced error could lead to a tragedy, which is North Korea.  Kori, where are -- what's happening right now. Americans hear, you know, it's perilous and then it kind of -- the issue goes away, and then it becomes perilous again. How should people think about this?  SCHAKE: Well, I'm -- I am more concerned about it now. I think what I hear out of the White House parallels pretty closely what the Bush administration sounded like in 2003 in the run-up to the Iraq War, that the leadership of North Korea is fundamentally erratic and untrustworthy, that retaliation is inadequate as a strategy and I think they're not thinking through quite carefully enough. For example, what Asia will look like geopolitically if the United States engages in a preventive war that the Australians, Japanese, and South Koreans don't want and might not participate in.  DICKERSON: Michael, Kori raises 2003. This president has said that lead up to the Iraq War and the war itself was the greatest blubber in American history. So parallels to that, that should make people nerve.  O'HANLON: And this would probably by 100 times more lethal for allied forces than the Iraq War. We have to keep that in mind.  Let's say the North Koreans can only detonate one or two nuclear weapons but they're over Seoul. Then we have -- we have up to a couple hundred thousand Americans in Seoul. Leave aside the issues of whether the families of American servicemen should come home. There are a lot of American civilians who just live there doing business.  So if we were to have a war in Korea, the estimates are that one nuclear explosion over that densely populated city could kill about two or three times as many people as the Hiroshima or Nagasaki bomb. And that's for one explosion. So anything that leads us towards a higher probability of nuclear war I think is probably a huge mistake.  But there is -- I don't want to be to scary -- there is one potential interpretation of what's going on that's a little more hopeful, which is that the Trump administration really doesn't have particular interest at the end of the day in launching a preventive war, but by creating the sense that they're impatient, they're trying to persuade China to turn the economic screws more forcefully and try to get us in better bargaining position.  I'm not comfort with this situation because I don't know if what I just said is true. And if the alternative interpretation is true, then we could be in for horrible war. The worst since World War II.  SCHAKE: Moreover, the administration is painting themselves into a corner with the rhetoric, even if it is just intended to make the Chinese more cooperative, they have -- actually they are saying that the sand is slipping through the hour glass and we might have to act soon and the military option is the only option if this doesn't work. And that actually, I think, not only creates a red line that attaches a ticking clock to it.  O'HANLON: If I could add, the question, too, I agree 100 percent with Kori. The question is, what are the military options under consideration? All out preventive war is, of course, the extreme. There's also one idea that Ash Carter and Bill Perry, two former secretaries of defense of the Democratic Party wrote about ten years ago. They're not necessarily articulating it now, but 11 years ago they suggested that we shoot down a North Korean ICBM launch before it either gets off the launch pad or before it gets out of the atmosphere and just deny North Korea the ability to really learn more about its missile programs. That's the kind -- that's a very dangerous idea, too, because you don't know what North Korea's going to do in response. But that's the sort of idea that may be in play here.  DICKERSON: Let me step back here for a second and ask you all -- both a question about the larger buildup of forces. There is, in the Congress, a request for even more money than the president has asked for, for his defense budget.  Kori, what do you think will happen with that and do we need all this money?  SCHAKE: I'm skeptical that the Congress is actually going to pass an appropriations bill that will give the Defense Department the $700 billion that authorizers in Congress have asked for. It looks to me much more likely that we will see a series of continuing resolutions.  We're already a third of the way into the fiscal year. So I'm really skeptical both because of the way the president's budget teed this up, so Congress is going to be adding $100 billion over what the president requested, but I'm also skeptical that they can get deals on the other thing like DACA, like the spending distinction between domestic and national security.  It looks to me like this is likely to drag on. And that's actually terrible for the Defense Department. Continuing resolutions present them starting new programs, it prevents the managerial latitude that DOD needs to use the money well. So rather than add more money, I would instead give DOD the latitude to do a lot more programmatic management. I think that would help them a lot more.  DICKERSON: Michael, your thoughts?  O'HANLON: Amen. I mean we're at a point here in December, two and a half months into the new fiscal year. We don't know if the defense budget is going to be $600 billion for this year or $700 billion. That's a huge gap. And that's roughly the range of play.  And Donald Trump is sort of in between in his request. I'm sort of in between myself. The Congress, under Senator McCain and Congressman Thornberry and others, have proposed the $700 billion. Anything north of $600 billion exceeds the Cold War average when you adjust for inflation.  I do think we need a bit more money. But I think what we need really is clarity and a decision, because you can't do proper training, maintenance, you can't enter into long-term contracts, you can just do good custodianship of the Department of Dense when you're this far into the year and you don't know what your budget will be.  DICKERSON: All right, that's it for both of you. Thank you so much.  And we'll be right back to discuss the political news of the week with our political panel.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: We turn now to our political panel. Molly Ball is national political correspondent for \"Time\" magazine. Their person of the year was the silence breakers and the me too movement. Lanhee Chen is a research fellow at the Hoover Institution and a policy advisor to the Romney and Rubio presidential campaign. We're also joined by CBS News White House and senior foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan, and Ed O'Keefe, who covers Capitol Hill for \"The Washington Post\" and is a CBS News contributor.  Margaret, I want to start with you on this question of Jerusalem. What do you make of this decision and the timing of it?  MARGARET BRENNAN, CBS NEWS: Well, this appears to have been a significant foreign policy, national security decision made primarily for domestic political reason by the president of the United States. He succeed in touching probably the most sensitive nerve in one of the most intractable conflicts in history and this is going to make for a complicated visit for Vice President Pence, who has to head to Israel and to Egypt within just a week or so.  But what the president appears to be doing here is interesting, with all due respect to the U.N. ambassador who was talking to you about making this decision. It doesn't do the thing she said. It doesn't actually move the embassy. In fact, the president, on camera, signed a waiver keeping the embassy in Tel Aviv. And it doesn't, for the moment, decide the fate of Jerusalem if you listen to president's national security team who says, actually, we're still up for negotiation on the final status. In fact, if you ask U.S. diplomats where the city of Jerusalem is located, they still won't tell you it's located in Israel. They'll just tell you it's the political capital.  So it appears to be the kind of sleight of hand that allows the president to say he achieved a campaign objective, much like the Iran deal, without necessarily changing things because any new embassy is going to take four years or more to build.  DICKERSON: All right. Well, let's now move back to domestic issues.  Molly, let's to go Alabama here. We've got a Senate race going to come to its conclusion next week. Where do you think things stand in this race?  MOLLY BALL, \"TIME\": I do not think we know how this is going to turn out. There has -- seemed to be a shift in the conventional wisdom toward Roy Moore. You hear a lot of predictions that he is going to prevail having -- because the beginning of the accusations against him have now -- is now several weeks in the rear view mirror and has -- and a lot of Alabamians have had a chance to sort of process that. But we have still seen polls that are quite equivocal, especially in such a red state, that's pretty remarkable.  And what I have heard from my sources on the ground, and I'll be in Alabama in just a few hours, is that voters are pretty powerfully conflicted. You know, these are voters who generally want to favor the Republicans, all other things being equal.  But you have to remember that Roy Moore, even among Republicans, is a very polarizing figure. There's a lot of Alabamians who see him as an embarrassment to the state or just as not the sort of person, particularly considering these charges, that they want representing them. So whether that is enough to put a Democrat over the top in a state like Alabama is very difficult to tell.  DICKERSON: Lanhee, let me ask you about the reaction to the RNC supporting Roy Moore this week. The president supporting Roy Moore. There were -- there was some talk about -- and coverage of Republicans saying, I'm through with the party because they're supporting him. Now, that can get over torqued (ph) in today's media environment, so it's hard to know what the level of real outrage -- I mean obviously Ben Sasse said what he said. Senator Collins was disappointed too. What's your sense of how big a deal this is outside of Alabama for the Republican Party where it is right now?  LANHEE CHEN, HOOVER INSTITUTION: I think that it is a developing big deal, if that makes sense. As we go into 2018, this is not the last time we're going to see some version of this move. In other words, I think you're going to continue to see this conflict between different parts of the Republican Party. And, yes, it's played out in Alabama in really concerning fashion, a guy like Roy Moore, clearly very flawed and very problematic.  But you're going to have contested primaries potentially in states like Arizona, maybe even Nevada next year. So this battlefield is just being played out right now. People are just kind of stepping onto this battlefield.  So I think to the extent that we're seeing this in Alabama now, what we're seeing is a microcosm of the kinds of battles we're going to see through 2018. And for Republicans, like myself, it's very concerning because what you're seeing is a fundamental split and fracture in the party that we've known has existed for some time, but now is being played out in a very public way and being played out in elections that really do matter and have policy consequences for the last two years of President Trump's administration, at least for his first term.  DICKERSON: Well, and, Ed, and that was the -- it was policy implications President Trump was arguing for, basically saying, whatever you may believe, I want a Republican in the seat.  ED O'KEEFE, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": It worked for him because, remember, in the last few weeks of the presidential campaign he was running around the country saying to Republicans, you may not like me, but I'm going to appoint conservative Supreme Court justices and other conservatives to the court, and it worked. One in five voters showed up and the exit polls showed the Supreme Court was their top concern. Moore's making the same exact argument and that may, in fact, end up working for him.  What I find interesting, and what will be very curious to track in the next few weeks is, if he wins, how quickly does that ethics investigation begin? How long does it end up taking? And what do they do if it brings forward information that suggests conduct unbecoming of a senator?  Susan Collins seems to suggest today, that would be a difficult, you know, thing to do, to expel him. But the fact that there could be a secretive ethics investigation underway will just hang over the Republican Party on Capitol Hill over the course of most of the year most likely.  And, you know, I -- even talking to a colleague who takes photographs up at the Capitol, he says, I suspect most people are even going to avoid getting in the elevator with him because they just don't want to be associated with him at all.  BRENNAN: And those are the -- related to the allegations that he denies --  O'KEEFE: Right.  BRENNAN: In terms of sexual misconduct. He doesn't deny having said that homosexual activity should be illegal. He doesn't deny having said that Muslims shouldn't be allowed to serve in the United States Congress.  So there are things that are being set up here that not only highlight the divisions you talked about within the Republican Party, some would say the fight for the soul and the identity, but also position the Democrats here. And that's what was so interesting with the Al Franken resignation to come was that the Democrats seem to be positioning themselves around that identity of, this is what we are not. We are not going to play those cultural politics.  DICKERSON: I want to get to Franken and, as you say, resignation to come. We still don't know what the end date on that is. But, Lanhee, I wanted to go back to something you said because Mitt Romney, who you used to work for, came out and basically took the moral position above all other Republicans basically and said, there's no reason to support Roy Moore and it's a stain on the party. Then Steve Bannon came back at him from the -- what did you make of that back and forth? Is -- does it have any lasting impact? And what's -- is it -- Mitt Romney's sort of emerging here as something in the Republican Party. Put a name on it.  CHEN: Well, you know, he's sort of the sensible conscious of the Republican Party in a lot of ways. I mean, look, the only reason anybody cares about what Steve Bannon has to say is to the extent that he -- people think he's a proxy for the president. To the extent that people think that Steve Bannon is expressing a point of view that the president holds, then it's relevant. Otherwise he's just a political pundit out there with another opinion.  And the question really will be, to what extent the president carries through this argument, if there is a Senate campaign to be had in Utah for Governor Romney, for example, to what extent is the president willing to go out there and prosecute some argument against Mitt Romney or try to find somebody to run against him. That's the only way it becomes relevant. Otherwise, it's all just a bunch of blather as far as I'm concerned.  Now it's very concerning blather because obviously what Bannon said was completely beyond the pale. What Bannon said about Governor Romney. But I think Governor Romney is putting out there a point of view that needs to be articulated in the Senate and in the Congress beyond the 2018 elections cycle.  DICKERSON: Just so people aren't confused, Steve Bannon said that Governor Romney ducked service in Vietnam because he had a religious exemption. He went over. He was a missionary in France.  CHEN: Right.  DICKERSON: Which is a strange thing to say given that his president, Trump, had many, many deferments from the Vietnam War.  Let me, Molly, switch to you quick -- here on the question of Al Franken. You wrote about him this week and you said he really didn't want to leave the Senate.  BALL: He really didn't seem to. I mean if you saw the farewell speech that he gave, first of all, it took a lot of pressure to get him to resign. And what you saw was more than half of the Democratic caucus had to come out publicly. It wasn't enough -- you know, we knew that there was -- there was pressure from behind the scenes on Senator Franken and he resisted that pressure. And that was why his colleagues were forced to come out publicly, all the way up to the Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, and then finally very grudgingly Franken got up there on the floor of the Senate and said he believed it was ironic that he was resigning given the allegations against President Trump and against Roy Moore.  This is a sort of what about-ism argument of the kind that we sometimes hear Trump make, right? Why is it fair that you're -- that you're persecuting me. Look at what crooked Hillary did. It's the same kind of argument.  And not only did he not apologize for his alleged misconduct, he took -- he took pains to clarify that he hadn't actually admitted to anything and he cast doubt on some of his accusers. So -- but he did -- he did exceed to this pressure. There's a lot of resentment and disagreement in Democratic circles about whether this was the right thing to do. A lot of Democrats talking about where they're setting the standard and whether it's fair.  Minnesota Democrats, very sad to lose Franken. The national party sad to lose someone who is probably the biggest fundraising draw for Democratic candidates across the country.  O'KEEFE: (INAUDIBLE).  BALL: And so -- and now you have a situation where, given that Minnesota was quite close in 2016, whoever the governor appoints to fill this seat is going to have to run again in 2018, and that could possibly be a tough race.  DICKERSON: All right, we're going to pause that there. We'll be back in a moment with a little more on Al Franken, plus taxes.  Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: And we're back with our political panel.  Ed, Senator Durbin said there was no political calculation in the Al Franken decision. Do you buy that?  O'KEEFE: No. Not at all. It was a total political calculation.  We know that the week before he resigned he was already facing pressure from his colleagues who were asked to hold off. And that the morning that the final allegation surfaced, they all got together by e-mail and text and phone calls and said, this is it, we've got to do this.  The party wants to make -- the Democrats want to make a competency and professionalism argument in November, believing that that is the way they can take back the House and the Senate. They've got to purge all these guys in order to do that because you can't sit there and have alleged bad actors in your party if you're trying to suggested that you would run the government better.  More broadly, I think viewers deserve to know this. It's no secret for those of us who cover Congress that we have all, in one way or another, been contacted by lawmakers or aides in recent days privately asking, what else do you have? Who's next? They are terrified of this story line. And they know the consequences of it now could lead to much bigger problems for their party, maybe for a piece of legislation they're working on, maybe the chance of the party holding together through the election. But members in both parties, aides in both parties, very concerned that more is to come.  And, look, I think it's safe to say more is to come. We don't know who exactly it will be about. It will be carefully reported. But it shows you that they are so scared now because they realize so quickly people are disappearing. And think about it. We saw a guy who served more than 50 years kicked out. We saw the party's top -- one of the party's top fundraisers kicked out. A social conservative warrior, Trent Franks, had to resign amid a lot of questions about his behavior. And we've never seen this kind of a purge. Not since the Civil War.  DICKERSON: Margaret, I want to switch to taxes here because this is a big thing that's happening, too. And the president wants it signed by Christmas. What have you made of his salesmanship of the tax cut bill relative to health care? Because the tax cut bill, according to both the Quinnipiac poll this week and Gallup has only 29 percent support in the country. This is a president whose key skill is as a marketer, but that's not very popular for that legislation.  BRENNAN: Well, he's marketing something that seems to be different than what is -- the product he's selling. And the message from the president, even just on Twitter, his constant focus on the stock market, it appears to be that he sees stocks and corporate profits as a proxy for the success of this bill and ultimately his end goal, even though on the campaign trail, and when he goes out to sell this he's talking about the benefit to the middle class and to the working class, who helped to support him. And it's not clear that these pieces, at this point, add up to a benefit for those people.  At this point, though, to say that this would be a boost to corporations, undoubtedly it would, to take the corporate tax rate from 35 down to 20 percent, but you're not legislating how corporations spend those profits, right? You're not necessarily forcing income growth. You're not making that worker take home more pay as a result. You can't possibly force that. You also can't force broader employment.  So this gamble of how this will ultimately pay off to the broader economic benefit of the country is something that the president seems to be focusing on, whether you call it trickle-down economics more something else.  DICKERSON: Lanhee, what did you make of Senator Rubio who said, Republicans should go back and look at a 1977 speech by President Reagan, or not president, then Governor Reagan, where he said the Republican Party has to worry about having a country club big business image.  CHEN: Well, yes, I think there's a point that he's making, right? Now, Senator Rubio and Senator Lee had an amendment the tax bill that would have made the child tax credit fully refundable, which would have been a huge boon to lower middle class and lower income families. And, unfortunately, that was voted down by the Senate.  I think that point of view, though, suggests that what we're seeing in the tax bill now to Republicans, this is more of a feature and not a bug, right, that they're actually looking at lowering the corporate tax rate. This has been something Republicans, mainstream Republicans have talked about now for years, if not decades. And so this is actually a relatively conventional tax bill. The difficulty in selling it, though, is, how do you translate a corporate tax cut into what it means for the average middle class worker. There is a strong argument to be made that this tax bill is going to boost growth, which is going to boost wages, which is going to go into the pockets of middle class taxpayers. But that's not really the argument you're hearing. You're hearing, this is a middle class tax cut. So there's a little bit of dissidence in the messaging that they're going to have to get straight, but I think that it won't inhibit them from getting this bill through and to the president's deskin a matter of weeks.  DICKERSON: Molly, 30 seconds, do you agree and also do Democrats have any opportunity here to take advantage of this tax process?  BALL: Well, if you believe Democrats, they are extremely excited about the political opportunity afforded by this tax bill. It is, as you mentioned, very similar to what happened with health care, where Republicans were sort of between a rock and a hard place. They wanted to keep a campaign promise, particularly to their own base, that Republican primary voters, who they told they were going to repeal Obamacare and reform the tax system. But the bill itself was broadly unpopular and it really is not clear whether what was worse for them politically, passing the bill or not passing the bill given how disliked it is.  And so -- but what you do hear from Republicans is, they feel they have to do this, a, because they think it's a good idea to cut taxes. And also because their base will be so dispirited if they don't get anything done this first year. DICKERSON: All right. Got to end it there. Thanks, Molly. And we'll be right back.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "NEW ORLEANS --\u00a0Hurricane Nate made landfall as a Category 1 storm, first striking the mouth of Mississippi River late Saturday and then making second landfall near Biloxi early Sunday.\u00a0 The storm had maximum sustained winds of 85 mph as the eye of the storm moved over Keesler Air Force base in Mississippi.\u00a0 Gulf Coast residents scrambled earlier to finalize storm preparations as\u00a0Hurricane Nate\u00a0raced swiftly over the central Gulf of Mexico on Saturday, gaining added strength as forecasters said it would smash into the U.S. coast during the night. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said the storm's eye is expected to make landfall in the area near the mouth of the Mississippi River around 7 p.m., likely as a Category 2 hurricane. He urged residents to make final preparations quickly and stressed that Nate will bring the possibility of storm surge reaching up to 11 feet in some coastal areas and strong winds. \"It's going to hit and move through our area at a relatively fast rate, limiting the amount of time it's going to drop rain,\" Edwards said. \"But this is a very dangerous storm nonetheless.\" Forecasters said Nate could dump 3 to 6 inches of rain on the region -- with isolated totals of up to 10 inches. Follow along with the latest updates below. All times are Eastern unless otherwise noted. Hurricane Nate made second landfall near Biloxi, Mississippi as a Category 1 storm, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm has maximum sustained winds of 85 mph. A hurricane warning is in effect from the mouth of the Pearl River to the Alabama/Florida border. A turn toward the north-northeast and northeast with an increase in forward speed is expected during the next couple of days, the National Hurricane Center said. On the forecast track, Nate's center will continue to move inland over Mississippi and across the Deep South, Tennessee Valley, and central Appalachian Mountains through Monday. As of 1 a.m. ET Sunday, roughly 17,000 customers from multiple utility companies are without power, CBS affiliate WLOX reports. 1:15 a.m.: Social media images show storm surge washing ashore Photos and videos from social media early Sunday showed the storm surge washing ashore along the Gulf Coast in Mississippi and Alabama.

Nearly 3,500 people from multiple utility companies were without power as of 11 p.m., reported CBS Biloxi affiliate WLOX. The storm is expected to make second landfall near Biloxi. As of 11 p.m., the National Hurricane Center said Nate was about 35 miles (56 kilometers) south of Biloxi. After that, the center of the storm will move across the Deep South, Tennessee Valley and central Appalachian Mountains through Monday. Nate's northern eyewall, the most dangerous part of the storm, is moving onshore on the Mississippi coast, said the National Hurricane Center. Hurricane conditions are spreading on the coasts in Mississippi and Alabama, the National Hurricane Cetner said. Life-threatening storm surge is expected from the mouth of the Mississippi River to the Okaloosa/Walton county line in Florida. New Orleans mayor Mitch Landrieu lifted the city's curfew after the National Weather Service lifted the hurricane warning for the city. Landrieu's office recommended that people continue to shelter in place.\u00a0 CBS News' weather producer David Parkinson reported New Orleans will get the weaker end of the storm, but the city could still face wind gusts as high as 55 mph, Parkinson said.\u00a0 Hurricane Nate made its first landfall on the Louisiana coast and is expected to make landfall around midnight on the Mississippi coast, CBS News weather producer David Parkinson reports. Storm surge will be a real threat from Pensacola Beach through Dauphin Island and along the entire Mississippi Gulf Coast. Surge of 7 to 11 feet is expected from Waveland, Mississippi to the state's border with Alabama, and surge of 6 to 9 feet is expected in Mobile Bay. \u00a0 In terms of New Orleans, while it is possible power goes out, the city is on the weaker side of the storm so even if they get 3 inches of rain, there shouldn't be widespread flooding. Major surge isn't expected there as they are protected by a levee. Four to seven feet of surge is possible on the north end of Lake Pontchartrain. The impact zone for this storm is Mississippi Gulf Coast, Alabama Gulf Coast and western Florida panhandle Gulf Coast.\u00a0 Wind from the storm is expected to be 90 mph, with some wind gusts up to 100 mph. The primary threat from the storm is storm surge, Parkinson reports. \u00a0 Hurricane Nate made landfall near the mouth of the Mississippi River as a Category 1 storm with winds of 85 mph, the National Hurricane Center said. As of 8 p.m., the storm is located about 100 miles south of Biloxi, Mississippi.\u00a0 The National Hurricane Center said Saturday night that Nate is expected to make a second landfall along the coast of Mississippi on Saturday night and then pass over parts of Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee. Delta has canceled four flights to two cities in Alabama and the Florida Panhandle ahead of Hurricane Nate, the company said in a statement Saturday. It said an additional six flights were cancelled for Sunday. Delta said it extended its \"severe weather waiver\" to 12 cities along the Gulf Coast and inland in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. \"The waiver allows customers to make one-time changes to their itinerary without incurring a fee. Customers are encouraged to check real-time flight status on delta.com or via the Fly Delta Mobile App,\" it said. Florida Gov. Rick Scott on Saturday evening called on President Trump to declare a \"pre-landfall emergency\" for his state in response to Hurricane Nate. In a statement, Scott said the declaration would \"make federal resources readily available as Northwest Florida prepares and responds to Hurricane Nate.\" Scott urged Florida residents to prepare for the \"powerful storm\" and said its effects \"will be felt across the Florida Panhandle.\" \"We must not let our guard down,\" he said. Scott said an early declaration would \"free up funding sources\" from the federal government for the emergency response. \"We will continue to work with state, local and federal partners to ensure that every Floridian in the storm's path is prepared and we are able to quickly respond to Hurricane Nate,\" Scott said. The National Hurricane Center in Miami says Hurricane Nate is about 50 miles south of the mouth of the Mississippi River at Louisiana's southeastern tip. The storm is moving north-northwest toward the Gulf Coast at an unusually fast 23 mph. With maximum sustained winds of 90 mph, Nate had not gained strength as of the center's latest advisory. But forecasters said it might still reach Category 2 strength of 96 mph or more by the time it makes landfall. Nate was on a track that could take it over or near the mouth of the Mississippi by around 7 p.m. local time on its way to a later landfall on the Louisiana or Mississippi coast. CBS affiliate WWL-TV compiled a list of evacuation orders across Louisiana. Some of the mandatory evacuation orders issued are low lying areas in Hancock County and Orleans Parish's Venetian Isles, Lake Catherine and Irish Bayou. Some voluntary orders in Jefferson Parish include Pleasure Bend, Barataria and Crown Point. For the full list of mandatory and voluntary evacuation orders visit WWL-TV here. Officials in Alabama and Mississippi say their states are starting to see impacts from the fast-approaching Hurricane Nate. On Alabama's Dauphin Island, Mayor Jeff Collier reports water had already begun washing over the road on the island's low-lying west end. The city of Gulf Shores, meanwhile, has issued an evacuation order for beachfront properties, and shelters have been opened along the state's coastal counties. In Mississippi, state Emergency Management Director Lee Smithson said 67 people were already in shelters in two coastal counties while strong winds and high tides were driving Gulf of Mexico waters over roads near the Louisiana state line. And Gov. Phil Bryant says the state's National Guard has mobilized 75 soldiers and the Highway Patrol has moved an additional 60 state troopers into south Mississippi. Airports in some southern states are closing in anticipation of Hurricane Nate. The Pensacola International Airport in Florida and the Mobile Regional Airport in Alabama say they are closing Saturday before the storm makes landfall. The Florida airport said it will close by 6 p.m. local time, remain closed through Sunday and hopefully resume operations Monday morning. Officials at the Alabama airport said they hope to reopen Sunday around noon. Officials at the airports say passengers should contact their airlines for information about rebooking flights. In Mississippi, the Air Force Reserve's 403rd Wing relocated aircrafts to Ellington Field, Texas, and Little Rock Air Force Base, Arkansas, as the storm approached the coast. \"We are moving aircraft as a precautionary measure ahead of Tropical Storm Nate, and so we can continue the mission,\" Col. Jennie R. Johnson said in a statement. \"At this time, Keesler Air Force Base has not mandated the evacuation of base personnel.\" The 403rd Wing is evacuating aircraft as a precautionary measure ahead of Tropical Storm #Nate. More: https://t.co/YsujAEE5iS pic.twitter.com/tioKeiBlNx More than 40 percent of manned oil- and gas-producing platforms in the Gulf of Mexico have been evacuated, according to an update from the Interior Department. The department said Saturday that workers were evacuated from 312 of the 737 manned platforms in the Gulf. Crews also have been taken off 13 of 20 manned drilling rigs and other rigs have been moved out of the storm's path. About one-fifth of U.S. oil is produced in the Gulf. The platforms mostly avoided Hurricane Harvey in late August. Governors in Louisiana and Florida are urging residents to make final preparations for Hurricane Nate's arrival. In Louisiana, Gov. John Bel Edwards said Saturday that people in the southeastern part of the state should hunker down by 3 p.m. local time. He says the storm's eye is expected to make landfall about four hours later, likely bringing limited rain but powerful storm surges and strong winds. The state National Guard, meanwhile, has mobilized 1,300 troops and positioned high-water vehicles, boats and even school buses from Baton Rouge to New Orleans to help with rescues. Edwards said he also spoke with President Trump Saturday morning, who assured him the federal government was prepared to respond as well. In Florida, Gov. Rick Scott said the roughly 100,000 residents in evacuation zones should heed warnings, stick to their emergency plan and stay vigilant for updates from local officials. He said the hurricane could bring not just storm surges and strong winds to the Panhandle, but also tornadoes. Some oil and gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico are being shut down as Hurricane Nate churns toward the U.S. mainland. Federal officials said Friday that workers were evacuated from 66 oil- and gas-producing platforms in the Gulf, about 9 percent of the total of manned facilities. The Interior Department says crews also have been taken off five drilling rigs and other rigs have been moved out of the storm's path.\tAbout one-fifth of U.S. oil is produced in the Gulf. The platforms mostly avoided Hurricane Harvey in late August. Early voting is wrapping up sooner than scheduled in parts of Louisiana because of Hurricane Nate. Meg Casper Sunstrom, spokeswoman for the secretary of state's office, said voters in some southeastern parishes will have until 3 p.m. on Saturday to cast their ballots early. The parishes affected are in the New Orleans-area, including Orleans, St. Bernard, Plaquemines and St. Tammany parishes. Early voting will close as scheduled at 6 p.m. local time in the state's other parishes. Saturday is the last day of the week-long early voting period. Louisiana has a statewide election Oct. 14, and New Orleans has a hotly contested mayor's race on the ballot. The National Weather Service is placing much of Alabama under a tropical storm warning. Forecasters said Saturday that Hurricane Nate could bring wind gusts of up to 60 mph across much of the central part of the state, which includes Birmingham, the state's largest city. The storm is expected to down trees and cause significant power outages. Isolated tornadoes were also possible Sunday afternoon. On Alabama's Gulf coast, some communities have already imposed mandatory curfews from Saturday evening through Sunday morning. They've also ordered beaches and fishing piers closed and issued voluntary evacuation orders. On Florida's Panhandle, officials have ordered evacuations in some low-lying areas. They're also warning beachgoers to stay out of the Gulf of Mexico as the storm is already whipping up deadly rip currents and rough surf. CBS News correspondent Michelle Miller is in New Orleans and reports that a mandatory curfew goes into effect at 7 p.m. local time Saturday. Mayor Mitch Landrieu issued mandatory evacuation orders for areas outside of the city's storm protection system. City officials closed off about 200 floodgates on Friday night, ahead of a storm surge that could be as high as 10 feet, Michelle reports. Water is already spilling onto streets in the city's Venetian Isles neighborhood from an unusually high tide. Residents had until noon Saturday to leave. \"Can't call anybody, not coming, so it is a good idea to leave for most people,\" one resident told Miller. Others have already left their homes. The first evacuees began arriving at one shelter in Plaquemines Parish. About 20 were there by late Friday night with more expected to come. \"They take very good care of us opening these centers so we can have a place to go, and I appreciate that,\" East Bank resident Betty Duplessis told Miller. Strengthening Hurricane Nate is now expected to be a Category 2 hurricane at landfall on the central Gulf Coast in coming hours. The National Hurricane Center in Miami says Nate's top sustained winds have recently risen to 90 mph and the core is now about 180 miles south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River. As of 11 a.m. Saturday, Nate was accelerating to 26 mph and headed north-northwest on a course expected to take it onto the central Gulf Coast on Saturday night. Forecasters say the hurricane-force winds extend out up to 35 miles, mainly to the east of the eye. In addition to hurricane warnings and tropical storm warnings already in place along a wide stretch of Gulf Coast, a new tropical storm warning has been issued in the Florida Panhandle from east of the Okaloosa-Walton County line to Indian Pass, Florida.",

            "article_content": "A polygamous group's dwindling control of a remote Utah-Arizona border town that it has called home for a century slipped a bit more after official election returns showed four non-group members took over the mayor's office and three city council seats. Donia Jessop, a former sect member who left several years ago over discord with leaders, defeated incumbent mayor Philip Barlow by winning 61 percent of the 210 votes cast in the all-mail election in Hildale, Utah, according to final results unveiled Tuesday. Jessop becomes the town's first female mayor and the first person to hold the post who isn't a member of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, or FLDS. The group is an offshoot of mainstream Mormonism, which disavowed polygamy more than 100 years ago. Jessop said she's excited and hopeful the transition will be smooth after Barlow and current council members on Tuesday graciously accepted the results presented by county officials during a council meeting she attended. She said she wants to give residents better water, better roads and explore using fiber optics already in place to offer internet as a utility. She also wants to create a better sense of community by offering more town events. \"Big changes are heading our way,\" Jessop said. \"There's so many things lined up and ready to roll.\" Barlow, who was looking to win a second term, wasn't immediately available for comment. He said last week after initial results showed he was likely to lose that he'll accept the will of the people and move on to other opportunities in his life. Hildale is part of a community that also includes the sister city of Colorado City, Arizona, which has elections next year. In the Hildale council races, Maha Layton and Jared Nicol won four-year seats while JVar Dutson won an election to fill the final two years for a councilman who left early. Two other members of the five-person council remain in place because they weren't up for re-election: Doran Jessop and Brian Jessop. The competitive elections were another sign of the major changes the community has undergone in recent years. In the past, mayors and council members were decided behind the scenes by the FLDS choosing men to run unopposed, making elections non-events. The new town leadership is the latest sign that the community's demographics are shifting as the town begins to resemble a typical Western town, not a cloistered religious community. Government-ordered evictions of sect families from nearly 150 homes forced many members to seek refuge in trailers around town or in different cities across the West. The town governments and the police are being watched closely by court-appointed monitors after a jury found them guilty of civil rights violations. Also, a food-stamp fraud case led 10 people to plead guilty and exacerbated a leadership void. People such as Donia Jessop with past ties to the group have returned to buy the evicted homes and in some cases, open new businesses. She other former sect members consider the changes progress that will help the community break free from the reign of sect leader Warren Jeffs, who is serving life in prison in Texas for sexually assaulting underage girls he considered brides. But FLDS members believe the town they built and love is being ripped away from them. They still believe Jeffs is their prophet and that he was wrongly convicted. Lori Barlow said Tuesday she believes the evictions were accelerated this year to change the electorate so the outsiders could win. \"It hurts. It's like losing anything you love,\" Barlow said. \"It's heartbreaking but under these circumstances it was to be expected.\" New council member Nicol, one of only a few residents who isn't a current or former member of the FLDS, said he will try to be a voice for all residents and work to get the city to work more cooperatively with a board that runs a former church trust that holds most the property. In the past, the board of former sect members and city leaders have sometimes clashed. \"The diversity of representation is going to give a better product to everyone involved,\" Nicol said. \"It just shows that things have swapped.\" Donia Jessop and the others are expected to be sworn in early January. She left the FLDS four years ago with her husband and 10 kids over unrest about how Jeffs was running the group. She and her husband later brought a \"sister wife\" into the family, and the two women now raise their children and run the family business together. She and others in the new political group they call \"RISE\" are already setting their sights on winning elections next year in Colorado City, including the mayor's seat. \"There's people already standing up saying they're ready to do this,\" Donia Jessop said. \"Hopefully, this has shown people this can happen.\"",

            "article_content": "The stock market\u2019s dominant theme since November has been so-called Trump trade: A general market lift led by a select group of stocks best poised to profit from President Donald Trump\u2019s ambitious policy agenda.  Everything has flowed from this. The Dow Jones industrials index surged to a record above the 21,000 level. Investors enjoyed the lowest volatility in the first quarter since 1965. And all this came despite underwhelming measures of market breadth: A relatively small number of stocks are fueling the uptrend, but investors don\u2019t seem to care.  But the Trump trade was dealt a big blow two weeks ago, when the Republican health insurance overhaul failed to advance in the House of Representatives -- mainly due to resistance from conservative GOP members -- resulting in Wall Street\u2019s largest one-day pullback since October. Stocks have been treading water since then, raising the question: Is the Trump trade over? \u00a0 Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategist Savita Subramanian noted that the classic Trump trade peaked late last year led by small-cap stocks and cyclical issues in areas like industrials and materials. Since the New Year, those leaders have turned into laggards as investors have reevaluated the likelihood Trump\u2019s campaign promises actually turning into signed legislation.  Moreover, certain areas of the market have been pushed lower as investors realize some of the Trump administration\u2019s ideas could be detrimental to certain areas of the economy. The prime example is the risk of a so-called \u201cborder adjustment tax\u201d -- essentially an import tariff -- that would drive up costs for retailers while benefiting U.S. manufacturers.  An index of the stocks that the border tax would most negatively affect has fallen more than 10 percent since late November, more than reversing their post-election gains.  But other areas of the market that keyed into different Trump proposals, such as boosting infrastructure spending and lowering the corporate tax rate, have remained high. This includes shares poised to benefit most from tax reform, which have outperformed the Russell 1000 index by around 4 percent according to Subramanian. Or those set to gain from infrastructure spending, which are outperforming the Russell 2000 by 7 percent.  The performance of health care stocks is mixed, given that the outlook for action in that area is extremely uncertain.  I\u2019ll end with a big caveat: Many of the stocks that appear to be benefiting from the Trump trade could actually be getting help from other catalysts.  For instance, stocks rising on hopes of a repatriation holiday for foreign-held corporate cash are largely big-cap techs that could be moving higher on improving industry trends and a rebound in global growth measures. Energy stocks are commonly touted as an area that would be helped by allowing capital spending to be expensed immediately. But they\u2019ve also been boosted by the rebound in crude prices, thanks to last year\u2019s OPEC supply freeze agreement.  Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress will need to make progress soon on some of these agenda items or risk a loss of patience on Wall Street. Goldman Sachs noted that investors are increasingly looking to traditional market catalysts, like the economic growth outlook, as political hope fades.\u00a0 But that\u2019s a problem because the growth outlook is uneven: The Atlanta Fed is looking for first-quarter GDP expansion of just 1.2 percent.

            "article_content": "BOZEMAN, Mont. -- Republican multimillionaire Greg Gianforte won Montana's only U.S. House seat Thursday despite being charged a day earlier with assault after witnesses said he grabbed a reporter by the neck and threw him to the ground. Gianforte cruised to victory after weathering a political firestorm, observes CBS Billings affiliate KTVQ-TV. He won 48 of Montana's 56 counties, the station notes. Gianforte, a technology entrepreneur, defeated Democrat Rob Quist to continue the GOP's two-decade stronghold on the congressional seat. Democrats had hoped Quist, a musician and first-time candidate, could capitalize on a wave of activism following President Trump's election. Instead, the win reaffirmed Montana's voters support for Mr. Trump's young presidency in a conservative-leaning state that voted overwhelmingly for him in November. Gianforte was a strong favorite throughout the campaign and that continued even after authorities charged him with misdemeanor assault Wednesday. Witnesses said he grabbed Ben Jacobs, a reporter for The Guardian newspaper, and slammed him to the ground after being asked about the Republican health care bill. At least two major Montana newspapers,\u00a0the Billings Gazette, in the state's largest city, and\u00a0the Missoulian, in Missoula, Montana's second-largest city, announced late Wednesday they were rescinding their endorsements of Gianforte. Jacobs reported in April that Gianforte\u00a0has financial ties to Russian companies that have been sanctioned by the U.S.\u00a0 CBS News Elections Director Anthony Salvanto said that, based on CBS News estimates as the vote was coming in, there didn't appear to be a large difference between the early/mail vote and Election Day vote overall. And turnout was comparable to that of a midterm election. With some 97 percent of the vote counted, Gianforte had 50 percent of the vote, Quist had 44 percent and Libertarian Mark Wicks had six percent. Turnout was almost 54 percent of registered voters. Gianforte dropped out of sight after he was cited by police and ignored calls Thursday by national Republicans for him to apologize to the reporter. He emerged only at his victory celebration Thursday night, where he said he accepted responsibility for the incident. \"Last night I made a mistake and I took an action I can't take back and I am not proud of what happened,\" Gianforte told the crowd. \"I should not have responded the way I did and for that I am sorry.\" The last-minute controversy unnerved Republicans, who also faced close calls this year in traditionally Republican congressional districts in Kansas and Georgia. A runoff election is scheduled for next month in Georgia between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel after Ossoff fell just short of winning outright. Quist told supporters he called Gianforte to congratulate him on his win and urge him to represent all Montanans. \"I know that Montanans will hold Mr. Gianforte accountable,\" Quist said Thursday night. Gianforte showed lukewarm support for Mr. Trump during his unsuccessful run for governor in Montana last fall but did an about-face and turned into an ebullient Trump backer after he started campaigning for the congressional seat vacated by Republican Ryan Zinke when Zinke was tapped by the president to serve as Interior Department secretary. Gianforte urged Montana voters to send him to help Mr. Trump \"drain the swamp,\" brought in Vice President Mike Pence and first son Donald Trump Jr. to campaign for him and was supported by millions of dollars of ads and mailers paid for by Republican groups. But the theme of the election shifted Wednesday night when Jacobs walked into Gianforte's office as he was preparing for an interview with Fox News. Jacobs began asking the candidate about the health care bill passed by the House when the crew and Jacobs say Gianforte slammed him to the floor, yelling \"Get out of here!\" Gianforte's campaign issued a statement Wednesday blaming the incident on Jacobs. But on Thursday night, Gianforte apologized both to Jacobs and to the Fox News crew for having to witness the attack. \"I should not have treated that reporter that way and for that I'm sorry, Mr. Jacobs.\" It had been unclear if Gianforte's assault charge would impact the race. About a third of eligible voters in Montana had already cast their ballots in early voting, and others said it didn't influence their vote. Shaun Scott, a computer science professor at Carroll College in Helena, said the assault charge was barely a factor in his decision. \"If you have somebody sticking a phone in your face, a mic in your face, over and over, and you don't know how to deal with the situation, you haven't really done that, you haven't dealt with that, I can see where it can ... make you a little angry,\" Scott said Thursday. Quist, a popular 69-year-old singer and cowboy poet who was the front man for the Montana's Mission Mountain Wood Band, was helped by money that poured in from across the U.S. as Democrats seek to capture congressional seats that would have been considered safely Republican a year ago. Gianforte campaigned as a gun-loving Montanan endorsed by the National Rifle Association to build his credibility among hunting enthusiasts and motivate gun rights activists to vote. He echoed the Republican Party mantras of cutting taxes, beefing up the military and securing the country's borders. Montana overwhelmingly supported Mr. Trump in November, voted in Republican majorities in the state Legislature and elected GOP candidates to four of five statewide elected positions, leaving Gov. Steve Bullock as the only Democratic statewide elected official. A Democrat has not held the Montana U.S. House seat since Pat Williams departed in 1997 after he decided not to seek re-election. Quist ran a nontraditional populist campaign that saw appearances by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. He stuck to issues that have broad appeal in Montana, such as maintaining and improving access to public land. He collected nearly $3.2 million from individual donors across the U.S. But Quist had to overcome reports of financial problems that included unpaid taxes, a loan default and legal squabbles with a former band member over royalties and a contractor over payments. He tried to turn those negatives into positives by saying his story illustrated problems many Montanans face because of high health care costs.",

            "article_content": "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Prime Minister Mark Rutte and anti-Islam lawmaker Geert Wilders cast Wednesday\u2019s Dutch parliamentary elections as a litmus test for populism in Europe, only months ahead of crucial votes in France and Germany. As the nation went to the voting stations on a bright spring morning, two-term premier Rutte\u2019s right-wing VVD party was leading in the latest polls, with the anti-Islam Party for Freedom of firebrand lawmaker Geert Wilders a close second. Coming after last\u2019s year British vote to leave the European Union and the election of President Trump in the U.S. -- two stunning successes for populists -- Rutte now hopes to slow the momentum of what he called the \u201cwrong sort of populism.\u201d \u201cThis is a chance for a big democracy like the Netherlands to make a point to stop this toppling over of the domino stones of the wrong sort of populism,\u201d Rutte said after his vote. Despite positive poll results in recent days Rutte was wary of the results. \u201cThere is still a risk that we wake up Thursday morning and seeing that Geert Wilders is leading the biggest party,\u201d he said. Wilders sought to dampen expectations for himself -- but insisted that whatever the result of Wednesday\u2019s election, the kind of populist politics he and others in Europe represent will be here to stay. \u201cThe genie will not go back into the bottle. People feel misrepresented,\u201d he said, predicting this would show in elections later this year in France and Germany too. \u201cDespite what the elite wants, politicians are getting strong who have a totally different concept of what the people want them to do,\u201d he said. Rutte has framed the election as a choice between continuity and chaos, portraying himself as a safe custodian of the nation\u2019s economic recovery, while casting Wilders as a far-right radical who would not be prepared to take tough decisions. The chance of Wilders becoming leader in this country where the proportional representation voting system all but guarantees coalition governments is small -- all mainstream parties, including Rutte\u2019s VVD, have ruled out working with Wilders. Wilders\u2019 one-page election manifesto includes pledges to close borders to immigrants from Muslim nations, shuttering mosques and banning the Quran, as well as taking the Netherlands out of the European Union. The final days of campaigning were overshadowed by a diplomatic crisis between the Dutch and Turkish governments over the refusal of the Netherlands to let two Turkish government ministers address rallies about a constitutional reform referendum next month that could give President Recep Tayyip Erdogan more powers. It showed Rutte as refusing to bow to pressure from outside, a stance which has widespread backing in the nation. \u201cIt is my task to keep the nation safe and stable and deal with these kinds of people,\u201d said Rutte. The 12.9 million Dutch voters can cast their ballots until 9 p.m. (2000 GMT). They have plenty to choose from; there are 28 parties fielding candidates in the splintered political landscape. The election in the Netherlands comes ahead of polls in France and Germany later this year, when right-wing nationalists will also be key players. Voting in Amsterdam, Sam Godfried said he tried to turn the tide away from the far right. \u201cThe thing is, I think the whole world around us is getting more extreme and it is just getting more polarized,\u201d he said. He did not say who he voted for. During a final televised debate Tuesday night among leaders from the parties vying for seats and control of the government, Wilders piled on the anti-Islam invective while Rutte played up his leadership experience. Rutte has driven through unpopular austerity measures over the last four years, but the Dutch economic recovery has gathered pace and unemployment has fallen fast. So the prime minister is urging voters to stick with him. Wilders, meanwhile, is tapping into discontent among voters who say they are not benefiting from economic recovery. With such a knife-edge vote expected, only one thing appeared certain: Talks to form the next ruling coalition will take a while. \u201cThe longest coalition formation was seven months,\u201d said Amsterdam Free University political analyst Andre Krouwel. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if this results leads to a very complicated and long formation process.\u201d",

            "article_content": "There will be no shortage of vulnerable Republican members of Congress in 2018's midterm elections, which Democrats hope could turn into a \"wave year\" that sweeps their party back into power in the House. However, there are also a few Democratic seats that could fall into Republican hands, which could keep Paul Ryan in the speakership and frustrate liberal attempts to stifle President Trump and the GOP.  Republicans who could lose their seats include regular Democratic targets like Illinois' Pete Roskam and Colorado's Mike Coffman, both of whose races could serve as bellwethers of whether the GOP retain control of the House. Other Republicans who could soon find themselves out of a job are some of the GOP's most high-profile representatives, including ones that regularly find themselves the subjects of national scrutiny.  Here's a list of five of the most vulnerable House incumbents heading into 2018. For decades, Virginia was known as a reliable GOP stronghold, and voted Republican in presidential years from 1968 to 2004. However, the commonwealth's changing demographics and the GOP's weakness in its suburbs have now made it the most solidly Democratic state in the South, a trend that only became clearer when Democrat Ralph Northam won Virginia's governorship in a surprise landslide earlier this month.  That brings us to Comstock, who was elected to Congress in 2014 to replace Rep. Frank Wolf, a moderate Republican who represented the district for decades. Comstock represents a large portion of Washington, D.C.'s affluent and well-educated suburbs, which makes the area a natural Democratic target in 2018. It's certainly not an area that's friendly to Mr. Trump, and Democrats will be doing their best to tie Comstock to the unpopular president.  The silver lining for Comstock in all this is that, given her vulnerability, a number of Democrats are currently vying to replace her. With Democrats still showing their penchant for bitter infighting, there's a chance that their eventual nominee will stumble into a general election against Comstock bruised and battered, allowing the two-term Congresswoman to beat the national odds and keep her seat.  Issa, believed to be the single richest member of Congress and a onetime chairman of the powerful House Oversight Committee, is running for reelection in a district Democrat Hillary Clinton won by eight points in 2016. The onetime car-alarm magnate won last time by the skin of his teeth, and may be heading for a rematch against Marine veteran Doug Applegate.  But Issa does have money to burn, and has proven resilient despite being a top Democratic target in the past.  Rohrabacher has served in Congress since 1988 after serving as a speechwriter in President Ronald Reagan's White House. His seat has long been considered safe, but his once solidly GOP district also voted for Clinton last year, and he regularly garners national headlines due to his unabashed support for Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Their relationship is so strong, in fact, that GOP House Majority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy once reportedly joked that Rohrabacher is on Putin's payroll.  With Russian meddling in the 2016 election a major national issue, Democrats are hoping they can finally knock off Rohrabacher. The 15-term Congressman is unlikely to benefit from the media scrutiny of his Russia positions, particularly given his role running the House subcommittee overseeing U.S. policies toward Moscow.  Earlier this week, The New York Times reported that Russian intelligence viewed him as a source with his own code name. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, the man tasked with investigating the Russian meddling, is also said to be interested in some of Rohrabacher's connections to the Kremlin.  \"My constituents couldn't care less about this,\" Rohrabacher told the Times earlier this week. \"They are not concerned about Russia.\" That could be true, but Democrats sure are hoping otherwise.  The lone Democrat on this list is widely seen as the most vulnerable member of his party in the House. Originally elected in the post-Watergate Democrat sweep of 1975, Nolan left office in 1981, only to return to Congress in 2012. He's been reelected twice since then, even as Mr. Trump won the district in a landslide last year.  But Republicans argue that Nolan's 2016 opponent was a weak one, and GOP recruit Pete Stauber is seen as a better fit for the largely rural and blue-collar district. Nolan also has a Democratic primary challenge from his left, and a Green Party candidate who could siphon away votes from him in the general election. So, even in what's shaping up to be a bad year for Republicans nationwide, the GOP hopes that they can at least pick up Nolan's seat.  Hurd, one of only three black Republicans serving in Congress and a former CIA agent, is young, telegenic, and rather moderate. No stranger to the national press, he's sometimes touted as a politician with national potential and an ability to win over new voters to the GOP.  But despite his sterling resume and obvious political acumen, Hurd is vulnerable in 2018, with Democrats hoping they can nip his future in the bud. The sprawling district he represents along the Mexican border is larger in size than several states, overwhelmingly Hispanic, and went for Clinton last year, which makes it an obvious Democratic pick-up opportunity. Hurd, meanwhile, won reelection by just one point in 2016.  Hurd also has to navigate surviving the politics of a district that is naturally resistant to some of Mr. Trump's big plans, such as a border wall that Hurd says would hurt his constituents.  \"Building a wall from sea to shining sea is the most expensive and least effective way to do border security,\" Hurd told CBS News' \"The Takeout\" in April. \"You can't have a one-size-fits-all solution to border security.\"",

            "article_content": "Tonight, you're going to hear from a 41-year-old man who has remained largely unnoticed even though he was one of the top decision-makers of the Trump campaign. His name is Brad Parscale. While Steve Bannon, Paul Manafort, and Kellyanne Conway are marquee names you're familiar with, Parscale was in the back room -- operating as the campaign's secret weapon. He was hired to run the digital team, but over time came to oversee advertising, data collection and much of the fund-raising. As digital director, he's being drawn into the \u00a0 investigation of whether the campaign colluded with the Russians in the election. It's a charge he denies. He says he was focused on competing with the Clinton campaign's huge advantage in money and TV ads. What he decided to do was turn to social media, most importantly to Facebook. Brad Parscale: I understood early that Facebook was how Donald Trump was going to win. Twitter is how he talked to the people. Facebook was going to be how he won. Lesley Stahl: And Facebook IS how he won. Brad Parscale: I think so.\u00a0 I think Donald Trump won, but I think Facebook was the method -- it was the highway in which his car drove on. And Brad Parscale was in the driver's seat. \u00a0In the beginning of the campaign he worked alone at home in San Antonio, but by the end he had 100 people reporting to him. One of his main jobs was to send out carefully-tailored, low-cost digital ads to millions of people. Lesley Stahl: And these were ads on Facebook? Brad Parscale: Facebook, we did 'em on Twitter, Google search, other platforms. Facebook was the 500-pound gorilla, 80 percent of the budget kind of thing. Facebook's advertising technology helped President Obama in 2012, but today Facebook offers something far more precise and sophisticated. While the president recently tweeted that \"Facebook was always anti-Trump,\" Parscale relied heavily on the company, particularly on its cutting-edge targeting tools. Lesley Stahl: One of the best things Facebook did for you, I heard, was penetrate the rural vote. Is that correct? Brad Parscale: Yeah. So Facebook now lets you get to places and places possibly that you would never go with TV ads. Now, I can find, you know, 15 people in the Florida Panhandle that I would never buy a TV commercial for. And, we took opportunities that I think the other side didn't. Lesley Stahl: Like what? Brad Parscale: Well, we had our-- their staff embedded inside our offices. Lesley Stahl: What? Brad Parscale: Yeah, Facebook employees would show up for work every day in our offices. Lesley Stahl: Whoa, wait a minute. Facebook employees showed up at the Trump headquarters -- Brad Parscale: Google employees, and Twitter employees. Lesley Stahl: They were embedded in your campaign? Brad Parscale: I mean, like, they were there multiple days a week, three, four days a week, two days week, five days a week -- Lesley Stahl: What were they doing inside? I mean -- Brad Parscale: Helping teach us how to use their platform. I wanna get -- Lesley Stahl: Helping him get elected? Brad Parscale: I asked each one of them by email, I wanna know every, single secret button, click, technology you have. \"I wanna know everything you would tell Hillary's campaign plus some. And I want your people here to teach me how to use it.\" Lesley Stahl: Inside? Brad Parscale: Yeah, I want 'em sittin' right next to us -- Lesley Stahl: How do you know they weren't Trojan Horses? Brad Parscale: 'Cause I'd ask 'em to be Republicans, and I'd -- we'd talk to 'em. Lesley Stahl: Oh, you only wanted Republicans? Brad Parscale: I wanted people who support Donald Trump from their companies.  Lesley Stahl: And that's what you got? Brad Parscale: Yeah. They already have divisions set up that way. Lesley Stahl: What do you mean? Brad Parscale: They already have groups of people in their political divisions that are Republican and Democrat. Lesley Stahl: You're kidding? Brad Parscale: Yeah, they're businesses, they are publicly traded companies with stock price. Lesley Stahl: Did Hillary's campaign have someone embedded -- Brad Parscale: I had heard that they didn't accept any of their offers. Lesley Stahl: So you're saying Facebook and the others offered an embed, and they said no. Brad Parscale: That's what I've heard. People in the Clinton campaign confirmed that the offer was made and turned down. \u00a0Facebook told us in a statement: \"...for candidates across the political spectrum, Facebook offers the same level of support in key moments to help campaigns understand how best to use the platform.\" And indeed, both campaigns used Facebook's technology extensively to reach out to potential voters. Parscale said the Trump campaign used the technology to microtarget on a scale never seen before -- and to customize their ads for individual voters. Brad Parscale: We were making hundreds of thousands of 'em. Lesley Stahl: You make 100,000 ads.  Brad Parscale: Programmatically. In one day. In one day. Lesley Stahl: So 100,000 different ads every day?  Brad Parscale: Average day 50-60 thousands ads. This was all automated. Brad Parscale: Changing language, words, colors, changing things because certain people like a green button better than a blue button. Some people like the word \"donate\" or \"contribute.\" Lesley Stahl: So how would you know ... let's say I like a green button. How do you know I'd only like a green button? Brad Parscale: Because I'd give you the red, blue buttons, you never click on 'em. Parscale showed us how they tested: by sending out multiple versions of the same ad with only subtle differences. Brad Parscale: Here we have an American flag, here we have a face of Hillary. Different colors, the blues, different messages above. Lesley Stahl: So you'd send two identical ads with different colors? Brad Parscale: Maybe thousands. Lesley Stahl: You'd send THOUSAND of ads with different colors? Brad Parscale: Different colors. What it is is: what can make people react? What catches their attention? Remember, there's so much noise on your phone. You know, or on your desktop. What is it that makes it go: Poof! \"I'm gonna stop and look.\" To get people to stop and look, he crafted different messages for different people -- so that you only got ads about the issues you cared about most. He showed us three ads that looked alike. Brad Parscale: It's pretty much the identical design. Positive coloring. Different message. Lesley Stahl: This is one is tax, this one is childcare, this one is energy. Brad Parscale: They were all targeted to different users of whatever platform, in this case it was Facebook. Sent out to different people. And it could be each other's next-door neighbors\u2026all in Ohio. Lesley Stahl: This one person at 11 Elm Street gets this one and 13 Elm Street gets that one. Brad Parscale: Yup, yup. Parscale took some heat for taking microtargeting too far because he hired Cambridge Analytica. It's a company that uses so-called psychographics that microtarget ads based on personality. For instance, an extrovert would get one kind of message, a neurotic person another. It's controversial because of its Orwellian overtones. After Trump won, Cambridge Analytica said it was key to the victory. But Parscale insists he never used psychographics. He said it doesn't work. Lesley Stahl: So you didn't use it because you didn't think it really worked, as opposed to you didn't use it because you thought it was wrong that it was manipulative or sinister, or something like that. Brad Parscale: No, I don't believe it's sinister. Lesley Stahl: No. OK, you just don't think it works. Brad Parscale: No, I just don't think it works. Parscale's title was digital director, but by the end of the campaign his portfolio grew. He oversaw data collection, polling, advertising both online and on TV, and significantly digital fund raising. By adding donation buttons for people to click on in the online ads, he was able to bring in a record $240 million in small donations. Lesley Stahl: How many presidential campaigns had you worked on before this one? Brad Parscale: Zero. Lesley Stahl: Your wife has a wonderful expression about you being thrown into this. Brad Parscale: Yeah.\u00a0 She said that I was thrown into the Super Bowl, never played a game and won. Lesley Stahl: That's what it sounds like. It's made him a local hero back home in Kansas. He grew up in Topeka, playing basketball -- he's 6 foot 8. After briefly working at a tech company in California, he moved to San Antonio, Texas, and became a marketer. He taught himself to code, opened a small web-design business and went looking for customers. Brad Parscale: I started tapping shoulders at a bookstore asking people if they needed a website, when they were buying books on web design. Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but what-- you're hanging around at a bookstore? Brad Parscale: Yeah, a Border's. Lesley Stahl: You're hanging around at Border's and say, \"Can you hire me?\"  Brad Parscale: Yeah. Lesley Stahl: Come-on.  Brad Parscale: Yeah. Lesley Stahl: So how did you get involved with the Trump people? Brad Parscale: I was sitting at IHOP and I got an email. I was eating a ham and cheese omelet. I was. I get an email and I open it up and it says -- \"This is Kathy K. from the Trump Org -- can you please call me?\" That's it -- Lesley Stahl: Outta nowhere? Brad Parscale: Outta nowhere. Six years ago she was looking for someone to design a website for a Trump real estate project. Parscale bid lowest, got the job, and soon many more followed: websites for Eric's foundation, Melania's skincare line, the family's wineries. Then, in early 2015, came another life-changing email: Brad Parscale: It said \"Donald Trump is thinking about running for president. We need a website in two days.\" So I wrote back, I said, \"Yeah, I'll do it for $1,500.\" Lesley Stahl: $1,500? Brad Parscale: Yeah. And by the end, it was $94 million. $94 million is what his company was paid. Much of it was spent on things like buying ads.\u00a0 Parscale learned very fast on the job, with the help of the Republican National Committee. They had amassed a giant database to identify the issues people cared about, and predict how nearly 200 million Americans would vote. One reason Parscale thinks President Trump won is because of an issue the RNC database honed in on that he says the Clinton campaign missed: Lesley Stahl: Infrastructure. Brad Parscale: Infrastructure. It was voters in the rust belt that cared about their roads being rebuilt, their highways, their bridges. They felt like the world was crumbling. So I started making ads that would show the bridge crumbling. You know, that's microtargeting them. Because I can find the 1,500 people in one town that care about infrastructure. Now, that might be a voter that normally votes Democrat. While he tried to persuade Democrats to vote for Mr. Trump -- the campaign was accused, in a Businessweek article, of trying to suppress the vote of \"idealistic white liberals, young women and African Americans,\" a charge he denies. Lesley Stahl: Did you micro target by race? Brad Parscale: No we did not. Not at all. Lesley Stahl: Never? Brad Parscale: Nope. Lesley Stahl: Did you post hateful images? Brad Parscale: I don't believe so. Lesley Stahl: The candidate Trump was never shy about pushing buttons, about pushing prejudices. He used what most people would consider offensive language sometimes. Brad Parscale: I don't think the math said that most people saw it as offensive. I think a small group of people saw it as offensive, who have a lot of power. Lesley Stahl: But you did mirror him? Brad Parscale: We mirrored certain things that he would say, mainly things he said in rallies. Many of the messages he sent out were what's known as dark ads. They're called dark because they're microtargeted to individual users who are the only ones who see them.\u00a0 Unless they choose to share them \u2013 they disappear.\u00a0 Lesley Stahl: Can you say anything you want in those dark ads? They're really not transparent? Brad Parscale: No, because if I said something crazy in those, they would share a million times, it would be all over. Lesley Stahl: So if you said something that appealed to racists? Brad Parscale: Oh, it would be everywhere. But some dark ads flew under the radar, like ones sent out, we now know, by the Russians in their attempt to influence our election. These were separate from the posts the Russians reportedly sent of fake news stories that made Clinton look bad. The ads\u00a0-- on divisive issues -- were spread using Facebook tools similar to the ones Parscale and the Clinton campaign used. Lesley Stahl: Facebook has admitted that the Russians spent $100,000 -- at least $100,000 -- on ads to influence the U.S. campaign. Does that bother you? Brad Parscale: Yeah, I would not want a foreign entity to meddle in our election; you know, a government. Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't want that; I'm American. But the question is: did the Trump campaign collude with the Russians -- and as the digital director, was Parscale involved? Brad Parscale: I think it's a joke. Like, at least for my part in it. Lesley Stahl: Very few people think it's a joke. Brad Parscale: I think it's a joke when they involve myself. 'Cause I know my own activities, and I know the activities of this campaign. I was there. It's just a farce. Lesley Stahl: It's a farce that you colluded with the Russians? Brad Parscale: Yeah. It's just a joke. What about what happened on Twitter? Which was flooded with pro-Trump tweets generated by robots, or bots. Lesley Stahl: Did you have a hand in generating these bots -- Brad Parscale: I had nothing to do with bots. I don't think bots work. Lesley Stahl: You were called the king of the bots. Brad Parscale: I know. It's ridiculous. It's just the craziest thing ever. No one on our team ever sat down with me and said, \"Brad, we should make bots.\" Lesley Stahl: But if-- if you see that there are hundreds of thousands of bots floating around with pro-Trump messages, somebody generated it. Where would it come from? Brad Parscale: I would imagine there were people, everyday people in America, who thought they were trying to help. I don't know. Lesley Stahl: If the bots came from the Russians, would you know? Brad Parscale:\u00a0 Nah. Lesley Stahl: Do you think it might have? Brad Parscale:\u00a0 No idea. Lesley Stahl: Could it have? Brad Parscale: Could be from anybody in the world.  The House Intelligence Committee looking into the Russian meddling has contacted Parscale and he's agreed to talk to them. Lesley Stahl: I understand that part of these investigations that are going on is to understand how the Russians knew where to target their campaigns, their messages. They seemed to know specifically where to go-- that were places that helped Trump. Brad Parscale: Yeah. First of all, I -- it's not very hard to figure out. Pennsylvania, Ohio, you know. I mean, the same -- I think we've had the same swing states for decades.  Parscale told us the Russian plotline is pushed by liberals who think they lost because he cheated. The irony, he says, is that it wasn't a foreign entity helping the campaign, but left-leaning American companies like Twitter, Google, and above all Facebook. Brad Parscale: These social platforms are all invented by very liberal people on the West and East Coast, and we figure out how to use it to push conservative values. I don't think they ever thought that would happen. I would say the number one thing that people come up to me is, like, \"I just never thought Republicans would be the ones to figure out how to use all this.\" Lesley Stahl: So a liberal invents all this stuff and a conservative in the Middle-West figures out how to use it? Brad Parscale: And I think we used it better than anyone ever had in history.  Last month, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced plans to make political ads on the site more transparent. As for Brad Parscale, he's already working on President Trump's 2020 reelection campaign. Produced by Shachar Bar-On. Natalie Jimenez Peel, associate producer.

            "article_content": "Ahead of International Women\u2019s Day, CBS News reached out to various women across the United States to see what their thoughts are on women in the first 100 days of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.  Some of these women supported the president, while others were not old enough to cast a vote in the 2016 election, but all had thoughts about how this administration is impacting women.  Blue in a state of red Zoe Allen wasn\u2019t old enough to vote in the presidential election, but she was confident Hillary Clinton would win. When that didn\u2019t happen, the 17-year-old Texan was shocked, quickly realizing that she was in the center of a liberal bubble in Dallas.  \u201cI always grew up in an environment that women can do anything,\u201d Allen told CBS News. \u201cMy mom is a lawyer and I look up to her. When Trump won, it felt like, no you can\u2019t actually be whatever you want.\u201d  Now, just over six weeks since Mr. Trump took offfice, she feels that her voice as a woman has become smaller.  \u201cThere are so many things that are happening that I feel like my voice isn\u2019t being heard,\u201d she said.  Despite feeling helpless at times, Allen is hopeful for women and for President Trump. \u00a0\u201cI want his presidency to do well, as an American,\u201d she said. But she hopes to see more inclusivity and more acceptance.  \u201cIt\u2019s so important, and so many steps have been taken in the wrong direction, like the travel ban and the wall,\u201d she added.  Trump has done \u201camazing\u201d things Trump supporter Jennifer Orlando, 46, has not always identified as a Republican. In fact, the Cleveland, Ohio, resident said she voted for Barack Obama in 2008. In the 2012 election, she wrote in former congressman Ron Paul\u2019s name on the ticket. It\u2019s not about the \u201cpolitics,\u201d Orlando told CBS News. It\u2019s about the person, and what he or she stands for. \u201c[Donald Trump\u2019s] not a polished politician, not a career politician,\u2019\u201d Orlando said. \u201cHe does speak from the hip. But you\u2019ve already had the career politicians, you know what that\u2019s about \u2014 why not give him a try?\u201d Orlando decided to do just that. \u201cThere are things I may not 100 percent agree with; the same with President Obama,\u201d Orlando said. \u201cBut I fully supported him though there were things I didn\u2019t agree with either.\u201d As a Jewish woman, Orlando is proud to say she voted for Trump, and said she\u2019s already seen an outpouring of patriotism and women coming together to support the president and each other. Orlando is a Facebook administrator for the popular group \u201cWomen for Trump.\u201d Within the past two months, Orlando said the group\u2019s membership has increased by about 27,000, to 34,000. She says she has seen the social media page grow every day with more women joining to show their solidarity and support for President Trump. \u201cWe saw a huge surge to this group after the Women\u2019s March [in Washington, D.C.],\u201d Orlando said. \u201cThey wanted to be a part of something where they felt represented.\u201d Since then, Orlando said she has worked hard to help educate both men and women on President Trump\u2019s policies, and she hopes everyone will keep an open mind. \u201cWe want to see our families safe again. We want our borders to be secure. We want our jobs back. We want our military and our veterans to be honored,\u201d said Orlando, while encouraging other American families to stand back and consider whether these things would benefit them. The path we\u2019ve been on, \u201cwe\u2019re not getting anywhere, whether it\u2019s good or bad,\u201d Orlando said. \u201cWe\u2019re just stuck in a rut, and that\u2019s not good for anyone.\u201d Feeling \u201cempowered\u201d during the presidency Genna Kindelberger is a high school student in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She knows of many people in her community who voted for President Trump during the 2016 election. However, she wasn\u2019t a supporter. \u201cI think that a lot of his comments he made about women and how he views women is hard to take,\u201d she said. At first, she felt helpless after the election, but her perspective started to transform. \u201cNow that time has set in, I feel almost empowered, like I can make a difference.\u201d She has become more politically engaged since President Trump stepped into office, joining local political groups and even going to a rally in Pittsburgh a few weeks ago.  \u201cA lot of the groups I\u2019m a part of, they aren\u2019t directly against the president. Trump\u2019s presidency has somehow empowered me \u2014 it is almost unexpected,\u201d she said.  She hopes in the next four years other women will also feel encouraged to become more informed and engaged, no matter who they support politically.  \u201cI want [the president] to have the values and views that are important to America. I want women to feel important and their voices to be heard,\u201d she said.\u00a0 A Democrat turned (moderate) Republican in Miami When Bree Lenoir, 36, turned 18, she registered as a Democrat, because that\u2019s where her family\u2019s values lay. But as the Miami resident grew older, her own views started to take form and she began to consider herself a moderate Republican. A few years ago she took on a leadership role as committee person for a local Republican Party group in Miami. And when it came time for the 2016 election, Lenoir stuck with the candidate from her own political party, Donald Trump. \u201cI think people don\u2019t realize how much their values really line up,\u201d Lenoir told CBS News. \u201cI just really think if you write out how you feel about certain issues that go on in the world you\u2019ll really see that, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m more like this.\u2019\u201d Lenoir encourages everyone to make their voices heard \u2014 no matter which side they\u2019re on. \u201cI respect people\u2019s political stance and opinions, but sometimes people don\u2019t afford me the same courtesy,\u201d Lenoir said. \u201cThey bash the fact that I\u2019m a Republican, maybe because I\u2019m African-American, and I take offense to that.\u201d No one should be able to rob you of your opinions, Lenoir continued. \u201cHowever you feel, you need to be whole-hearted about it. Go for it,\u201d Lenoir said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fight for women to have their voice in any realm, but we\u2019re not living in the Stone Age anymore. As far as voice and opinion, that should be equal. Period.\u201d Though Lenoir said she was driven mostly by her faith throughout the election, she also focused on women\u2019s rights, specifically on the fight for women\u2019s equal pay. \u201cThat\u2019s a major thing we\u2019re going to have to work very hard on,\u201d Lenoir said. \u201cWe deserve the respect and we deserve the pay.\u201d A live panel discussion on \u201cWomen in the First 100 Days of Trump\u201d \u2014 a multigenerational examination about the future of the country \u2014 was filmed in front of a live audience in YouTube\u2019s creative space in New York City and broadcast live on CBSN.

            "article_content": "Is Wall Street right to worry that President Donald Trump\u2019s drubbing on health care means big trouble for tax cuts? Judging by the market\u2019s reaction lately to bad tidings on the health bill, the financial community frets that its defeat will endanger what it really cares about most: taxes. But a number of market observers caution that the stumble on health legislation does not necessarily spell doom for Mr. Trump\u2019s economic stimulus agenda, which also includes a $1 trillion program to fix ailing infrastructure. The reason: To lawmakers, tax cuts and, to a lesser extent, pork-barrel public works projects are like big chocolate cakes with extra frosting. Repealing and replacing Obamacare, which risks harming some of their constituents, is a dung heap in comparison.\u00a0 \u201cHealth care is a temporary setback that won\u2019t have a nefarious effect on tax cuts, which is like handing out candy,\u201d said John Maloney, head of New York\u2019s M&R Capital Management. The failure to pass an Obamacare overhaul, he noted, could hurt stocks \u201cbut the impact will be short-lived.\u201d For the market, the health care bill\u2019s failure \u201cwill matter in the short term,\u201d said Brent Schutte, chief strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. \u201cBut not in the long term. The market wants health care out of the way.\u201d \u00a0 The White House made clear it intends to pivot to taxes. \u201cNow we\u2019re going for tax reform, which I\u2019ve always liked,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the wake of the health bill\u2019s getting pulled Friday, before a certain defeat in the House of Representatives. No one believes that tax cuts will be easy to do -- the tax code is an intricate mosaic of special subsidies and loopholes supported by powerful interest groups and their savvy, hard-charging lobbyists.\u00a0 But what if the health impasse demonstrates an inability of the president and his party\u2019s legislative leadership to get things done? Investment firm FBR\u2019s baleful take in a research note was that the defeat diminishes the chances of a tax cut and raises \u201cserious questions about the ability of congressional Republicans to effectively govern and achieve their agenda.\u201d \u00a0 \u201cYes, this does make tax reform more difficult, but not impossible,\u201d said House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, referring to the health bill\u2019s demise. In what turned out to be a strategic error, Ryan wanted to pass an Obamacare substitute first before tackling taxes.\u00a0 Wall Street in general has shrunk its expectations for the Trump tax cuts. A recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of fund managers found that just 10 percent of them thought a tax bill could be passed before the August congressional recess, the administration\u2019s target. \u00a0 \u00a0 Since Election Day until recently, excitement over the Trump administration\u2019s stimulus plans has helped power the market to strong gains, up 10 percent, although the rally actually started earlier in 2016. On the run-up to the health vote, though, the market got choppy. Last Tuesday, worries about the Trump economic agenda\u2019s stalling were a strong influence in pushing the S&P 500 to a 1.2 percent loss, the\u00a0worst slide in five months. Then on Friday, as the health bill crashed and burned, the market swung back and forth, to finish down 1.4 percent for the week, its worst weekly showing since the week before the election.  The House health bill, known as the American Health Care Act, aimed to rescind the taxes created by Obamacare, cancel a penalty against those who do not buy coverage, lower funding for the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled, and reduce tax subsidies that help individuals buy plans. The current template for tax cuts, crafted by Speaker Ryan, calls for sweeping reductions in rates for businesses and individuals -- paring personal income tax brackets to three from seven, and the top individual rate to 33 percent from 39.6 percent, while trimming the top corporate rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. Mr. Trump has a slightly different version, which would decrease the highest corporate rate to 15 percent, for instance.\u00a0 Both the president and Ryan want to entice the estimated $2 trillion in U.S. corporate cash stashed in low-tax locales overseas to return home. The Ryan framework also seeks to slap a 20 percent levy on imports and not tax exports at all, called a border adjustment tax. This has generated a lot of skepticism, especially from Mr. Trump. Both the president and the speaker want to bring an enormous infusion of capital into the U.S. economy, so\u00a0people and companies spend and invest more, and that has gotten Wall Street salivating. By the same token, Mr. Trump wants to spend some $1 trillion on restoring decrepit roads, bridges, tunnels and the like, which he believes will be an adrenaline shot for economic growth.\u00a0 Here\u2019s are three key things investors should know about what the health bill\u2019s reversal could mean for taxes and infrastructure:\u00a0 Gridlock remains an impediment. At first blush, divisions over health care in Congress seem to illustrate irreparable divisions, with intransigent Democrats and squabbling Republicans, who control both chambers, unable to agree. Would that standoff recur with other legislation, and dash Wall Street hopes for economic stimulus? Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Friday that the administration wants to get a tax plan passed before Congress\u2019 August recess. That is a tall order: The last major tax revamp, in 1986, took more than a year to enact.\u00a0\u201cHistory reminds us that it has been decades since significant tax reform has passed in Washington, because it is not easy,\u201d said Bankrate.com\u2019s senior economic analyst, Mark Hamrick.\u00a0 Goodies are popular, but the larger question is how to pay for it all. The border tax is supposed to raise some $100 billion yearly, which would be a big help. But such a tax could end up hiking prices for goods and services in the U.S. and harm American retailers, who depend on buying many of their wares overseas. So this feature is sure to be a snag in congressional negotiations. Trump is versed in the art of the comeback. \u00a0That was the name of one of Mr. Trump\u2019s books, detailing how he turned around his sorry lot after his real estate empire almost collapsed in the early 1990s. He has an intense competitive streak and doesn\u2019t like to lose. According to the New York Times, Mr. Trump all along has wanted to shift to tax cuts after it became clear that health care would face tough going. His message on the campaign trail was economic -- about how lowering taxes and other moves, such as lightening regulations, would boost the economy. This argument remains potent. For all the economic advances since the Great Recession, growth remains anemic. The Federal Reserve forecasts tepid increases in gross domestic product of around 2 percent annually for the next three years. That is the pace we\u2019ve seen for most of the past eight years. And the president has forged an alliance with Ryan and other Republican congressional leaders that could help him push his program to enactment. \u201cThere is more agreement about tax reform\u201d in Congress than on the health question, Ryan said. \u00a0 And while congressional Republicans have a solid cadre of budget hawks who oppose willy-nilly government spending, fixing the nation\u2019s physical plant has a solid appeal, too. Plus, bringing back federal largesse has broad support among pols. A member of Congress benefits if he or she can say to voters, \u201cYou wanted that bridge fixed, well, it is,\u201d M&R Capital\u2019s Maloney said. On the minus side, Mr. Trump is new to the Washington scene. Certainly, the president\u2019s strong suit is not horse-trading over specific legislative provisions, such as accelerated depreciation and revenue offsets. \u201cThe guy is used to doing real estate deals,\u201d where there are two participants, not the 535 in Congress, said Steve Bell, senior adviser at the Bipartisan Policy Center. \u201cThis is not a real estate deal.\u201d\u00a0 Competing with the GOP leadership on the Hill and the White House are the vast legions of lobbyists, whose employers shower representatives and senators with campaign contributions. Many an earnest proposal in Congress has foundered in the Washington swamp of influence peddling. The markets have the momentum to rise, tax cuts or no. The post-election stock rally has been called \u201cthe Trump trade,\u201d but buoyant economic news also has had a big role in propelling it. Let\u2019s say that the president\u2019s tax and infrastructure plans take a dive, the same as the health initiative did. There\u2019s a school of thought that all the Washington turbulence won\u2019t matter if it produces nothing or very little -- because the economy\u2019s improvement will keep investors happy. Aside from the so-so GDP growth numbers, numerous economic indicators are positive: consumer sentiment is healthy, wages are higher, business capital spending is expanding, oil prices are stabilizing, corporate earnings have recovered. \u201cThe truth is that the economy is getting better, and the market notices that,\u201d Northwestern\u2019s Schutte said. So if Americans receive fatter take-home pay and a fixed bridge, that would be a welcome extra. If not, their investment portfolios may expand anyway.\u00a0 Larry Light is a veteran financial editor and reporter who has worked for the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Business Week, Money, AdviceIQ and Newsday.",

            "article_content": "JOHN DICKERSON: Today on FACE THE NATION, Senate Republicans cut last-minute deals to get their tax bill passed. It's a giant step towards granting the President's wish for a tax bill by Christmas. But a plea deal for former national security advisor Michael Flynn might make for a not so happy New Year for the Trump administration. MIKE PENCE: The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as amended, is passed. JOHN DICKERSON: It was a 3:00 A.M. call the President said he was happy to get. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I said, \"Call me. You can call me.\" It's the largest tax decrease in the history of our country by far. Not even close. JOHN DICKERSON: As for the news that Flynn is cooperating in the Russia investigation, is the President worried? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, I'm not. And what has been shown is no collusion. No collusion. JOHN DICKERSON: We'll talk about the two big stories in Washington this week and more with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Two senators investigating Russian influence in the election, South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham and Maine independent Angus King will also be here. Budget director Mick Mulvaney will set the stage for the next round of tax bill negotiations, and handicap the chances of the government shutting down at the end of the week when it runs out of funding. Plus, new poll numbers on the Alabama Senate race. How is Roy Moore faring after allegations of sexual misconduct with minors? All that, plus, plenty of political analysis coming up on FACE THE NATION. Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I'm John Dickerson. We knew it would be a busy week when Congress and the White House return to Washington Monday, but we had no idea just how busy. More stories of sexual misconduct on the part of the longest serving House Democrat John Conyers and now others prompted more calls for Congress to do a better job of policing its own. North Korea fired another missile, one that in theory could reach Washington. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It is a situation that we will handle. TED CRUZ: Mister President, tonight I ask-- JOHN DICKERSON: Progress on the tax bill continued at a brisk pace after Senate Republicans cut a number of deals to gain its passage, which thrilled the President. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: People are going to be very, very happy they're going to get tremendous-- tremendous tax cuts and tax relief. JOHN DICKERSON: That remains to be seen. Unsurprisingly Democrats were not happy. Montana's Jon Tester tweeted a show and tell of the massive bill. JON TESTER: This is your government at work. Here's the bill as it's written. Here's the modifications that are in it. I can read one word, it's called \"add this language.\" Can you tell me what that word is? JOHN DICKERSON: Friday arrived with a big development in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible Trump campaign collusion with the Russians and obstruction of justice as Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and said he's cooperating with Mueller. The President further muddied an already complicated story with a Saturday tweet that seemed to suggest he was aware of Flynn lying to the FBI at the time when he was calling the investigation a \"witch hunt.\" \"I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies.\" The day after the President fired Flynn for lying, former FBI Director James Comey says the President asked him to go easy on his investigation of Flynn. Sources tell CBS News that the tweet was drafted by one of Mister Trump's attorneys. We want to take a closer look at what the Senate passed, their bill would repeal the Obamacare individual mandate, the corporate tax rate would be cut from thirty-five percent to twenty percent. It will nearly double the standard tax deduction, eliminate state and local tax deductions but would allow an up to ten thousand dollar exception for property taxes. The bill would also double the estate tax exemption limit and raise the alternative minimum tax threshold. An analysis of the bill by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation indicated that even accounting for economic growth the tax plan would add a trillion dollars to the deficit. We begin this morning with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. He joins us from Louisville. Welcome, Mister Majority Leader. I want to start with the balance of this tax cut that passed through the Senate. The corporate tax rate is at twenty percent. It's been sold as a middle class tax cut, but those middle class taxes will expire. Analysis shows that while the majority of the middle class will get a tax cut there are some whose taxes will increase. Why not, in putting this bill together, make-- make it so that you could say everybody in the middle class will get a tax cut that's permanent? SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL (Majority Leader/@SenateMajLdr/R-Kentucky): Well, it's impossible to do that. You can't craft any bill that would guarantee no one was in a special category that might get a tax increase. What I can tell you is that every segment of taxpayers, every category of taxpayers on average gets significant relief. The average family of four, twenty-two hundred dollars a year. You mentioned the standard deduction doubling, the child care credit increase. Clearly most people, middle income taxpayers, an overwhelming majority of them will get tax relief. And because of the business tax changes it's much less likely that the job they currently have is going to end up in another country because we are clearly uncompetitive in the global economy with the current tax rates. JOHN DICKERSON: But-- SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL: John, I think this coupled with-- with the regulatory relief, the administration's been providing are the reasons the economy's beginning to pick up. Consumer confidence is up. I don't want to read too much into quarterly growth rates, but we've had two quarterly growth rates in a row of three percent growth. I think this is going to get the country growing again. JOHN DICKERSON: But on the question of the middle class, there would be a way to craft it so that the number of people who might get a tax increase would be pretty small. And there were Republican efforts to expand the earned income tax credit, to make the child tax credit more robust, to lower the rates for people at the lower end. And those were all Republican efforts that didn't get much energy whereas the energy on the corporate tax rate was always, it's going to be twenty percent, and nobody's tinkering with that. So just in terms of where the emphasis was on the work, there's much more work that could have been done on the middle class and lower income question than was really done in crafting this bill. SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL: Well, the question is whether you're getting a tax relief. And of course people on the lower end don't provide a huge percentage of the revenue that we raise through taxation. But what people want is, am I going to get some relief myself answer overwhelmingly likely to, and is my job likely to continue to be in the United States, and are we going to have a growing economy so my children will be able to realize the same goals and aspirations that I want them to have? JOHN DICKERSON: I think that-- SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL: And this is designed-- this is designed to get the economy grow-- we didn't have a single year of three percent growth during all of the Obama years. We were clearly underperforming. You have to ask the question why. JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah. SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL: A combination of overregulation and a lousy tax code. JOHN DICKERSON: I think the-- the question was about really the winners and losers, but let's move on to the question of process. Because the Democrats of course have made a lot of complaints about process. You said on Friday night, you complain about process when you're losing. And-- and the Senate process might seem like something that's not important to people, but you wrote a book called The Long Game in which you talk a lot about the process. You say in fact it's what's at the heart of the Senate and why it's a different institution. So this looks like a situation when you're in the minority you like the process but when you're in the majority you move on. SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL: Not true. We fought-- we followed the regular order. There were multiple hearings. The Democrats were there. Days of hearings. Days of amendments. The Democrats offered amendments in committee ad nauseam. The-- the process on the floor, the reconciliation process, is regular order. That's how they passed Obamacare. It's-- it's-- we didn't do anything that you could call a foul on process. JOHN DICKERSON: Well, they-- SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL: Well, they didn't-- didn't-- well, let me just say they didn't-- they didn't like the fact that we repealed the unpopular individual mandate from Obamacare, but yet they didn't offer a single amendment to take it out, and they had the opportunity to do it. JOHN DICKERSON: Well, they had twenty-five days of debate on Obamacare. And you said the process at the time was arrogant and that they were pushing an unpopular bill through. This bill is unpopular. Why isn't it's the same thing? SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL: Well, we'll see how unpopular it is when people start noticing they're paying less in taxes, the economy's growing, there are more jobs and opportunity. Look, we have a very different-- it was pretty clear during this debate we have a very different view of what America ought to look like. Our Democratic friends apparently are quite content with slow growth-- JOHN DICKERSON: Mm. SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL: --and little opportunity-- JOHN DICKERSON: Let me-- SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL: --to improve your condition. We think we need to jumpstart the economy and provide more jobs and opportunity for the American people. One of us is going to be proven wrong here over a period of time. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about Roy Moore. We have a poll out that says Mister Moore is up six points over his Democratic opponent Doug Jones. And in that poll it says that among Mister Moore's supporters fifty-six percent say they were more likely to vote for him after you said he should quit the race. What do you make of that? SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL: Well, look, the people of Alabama are going to decide a week from Tuesday who they want to send to the Senate. It's really up to them. It's been a pretty robust campaign with a lot of people weighing in. The President and I of course supported somebody different earlier in the process. But in the end the voters of Alabama will make their choice. JOHN DICKERSON: And should that be the final word? The White House, when asked about the President's accusers, said, \"The voters heard about President's accusers. They voted for him anyway, end of subject.\" So shouldn't that be the case with Roy Moore? SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL: Well, look. I'm concerned about the Senate. And if-- we have two ethics investigations in the Senate going on right now--Senator Franken and Senator Menendez and there might well be another one depending upon people who are in the Senate. And it'll be up to the people of Alabama to make this decision. And we'll swear in whoever's elected and see where we are at that particular point. JOHN DICKERSON: In the past you've supported Ethics Committee determinations in the case of Senator Vitter that said, basically, behavior before he got to the Senate was not germane in terms of punishing him as a senator. That would seem to cover Roy Moore in which case, what's the Senate Ethics Committee got to look into? SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL: Yeah, I don't remember the-- I'm not on the Ethics Committee. I don't remember exactly how the Vitter case was handled. But the Ethics Committee makes those decisions about whether behavior prior to the Senate is relevant or not. They'll decide the-- the parameters, if you will, of their jurisdiction. And then a decision will be made based upon the facts of a particular case. I can imagine there probably will be a case. Whether the outcome is there, I don't know. But, look, the Ethics Committee is three-three. Neither side can take advantage of the other. It has to be a pretty credible case to go forward. In other words, at least one member of the other party would have to decide that the case was worth pursuing. All of that'll be considered by the committee if they have a member of the Senate-- JOHN DICKERSON: Okay. SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL: --that they think has a case that ought to come before them. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, thanks so much for being with us. Joining us now, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. Congratulations Senator on Clemson's big win. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-South Carolina/Judiciary Committee/@LindseyGrahamSC): Go Tigers. JOHN DICKERSON: I know. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Number one. JOHN DICKERSON: Let-- let me pick up on something we were just talking about with the Majority Leader, which is on Roy Moore. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Right. JOHN DICKERSON: Majority Leader said, voters of Alabama are going to decide. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Mm-Hm. JOHN DICKERSON: That seems like there's a new standard basically if it happened before you got into the Senate, the voters will decide. That means-- sounds like he's going to be a senator. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think the body can regulate itself, you know, at the end of the day when he comes to the Senate if he does. I think an investigation-- an ethics investigation would be a smart thing to do. And we'll see what the Ethics Committee decides as to whether they look at behavior before he came into the Senate, does that matter, if they do, what did they find, we'll see. JOHN DICKERSON: Could you have him be a senator, by your lights? I mean, would-- would you be able to based on what you've heard, you'd be okay with him being a senator? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: We can't stop him from being seated. If there was an investigation and all six members of the committee said they believe he was a child molester that would be a problem. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me move on to the President's tweet this morning about the FBI, you're on the judiciary committee. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Right. JOHN DICKERSON: You oversee the FBI. President says that-- that after-- in the tweet, he says, after years of Comey, with the phony dishonest Clinton investigations (and more) running the FBI, he's talking about Comey there, its reputation is in Tatters - worst in History. But fear not, he says, we'll bring it back to greatness. FBI worst in history, in tatters. Do you agree? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: No. I think Comey needs to answer questions as his time as director. I think he made some decisions that were really very, very wrong. I would just say this President-- there's an ongoing criminal investigation, Comey may be part of it. He tweet and comment regarding ongoing criminal investigations at your own peril. I'd be careful if I were you Mister President. (INDISTINCT). JOHN DICKERSON: You were a former prosecutor. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Right. JOHN DICKERSON: Along those lines, the President has said he knew that Flynn lied to the FBI and yet he has called the investigation into whether Flynn lied to the FBI, a witch hunt and because it was a witch hunt he fired James Comey. How can you know that you lied to the FBI and then fired the FBI director for investigating that? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think, number one, what Flynn lied about, is not a crime. I don't think it's wrong for a transition person to talk to foreign government about change in policy. I don't think the Logan Act is worth the paper it's written on. So I'm not really worried about what happened after the election in terms of trying to communicate with the Russians about the-- the Israeli resolution or about sanctions. It comes down to the following to me. Was there any effort by the Trump campaign to coordinate with Russian intelligent services or any entity controlled by the Russians to receive benefit during the election. And they found the one guy that would know that. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you though on that question of obstruction, because that's the other thing that's a part of this issue, and if you know he lied to the FBI, how can you say an investigation into whether he lied to the FBI, it's a witch hunt that Comey should be fired for carrying out? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Apparently this statement is that-- by the President's lawyer. JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: He says, I didn't know, I mean, he wasn't in on the interview. He did know that he lied to the vice president. The vice president was very upset, he took action. To me that's not the issue. Here's the issue. In fact-- JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah, yeah. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --from my point of view. If it was coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russians, I can't think of a person who would know more about that than Flynn. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you on the national security front though, you are very critical of the Russians for interfering in the election? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah, they did. JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah. And-- and former Obama administration official says the interference was the cyber equivalent or espionage equivalent of 9/11. So if after that kind of an event, given me your foreign policy judgment about an incoming administration that then says to the perpetrators of an event that that's serious. \"Hey, let's work out a deal on these sanctions that are going to punish you for that behavior, don't overreact because we'll-- we'll be on your side later when we're in the administration.\" SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah. Yes. JOHN DICKERSON: Give me your national security judgment. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Okay. Well, number one, the Obama administration sure didn't act like it was a 9/11. They were late to the game and did this-- this, the least amount possible. What they did in the interim before Trump took office was a slap on the wrist. I don't buy that whole narrative. JOHN DICKERSON: Mm-Hm. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I don't have a problem with the Trump administration reaching out to the Russians. We're going to take a different view about sanctions and we're going to seek your help in the U.N. Security Council. JOHN DICKERSON: Even given your rough opinion of the Russians on what they did, it's okay to play footsie? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah. Well, here's what I'm saying, that behavior after the election is reaching out to foreign government that we have a different view about things. I'm not here to condemn the President about that. Here's what I'm saying that collusion between a campaign and a foreign government is unacceptable. There is no evidence of collusion, nobody has been charged with it, but you found the one person who would know if it did exist. So it won't be long before we understand one way or the other whether Trump people colluded with Russia because I can't imagine it happening and Flynn not know about it. JOHN DICKERSON: Let's take a quick break. We'll be right back on the other side of that. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah. JOHN DICKERSON: We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: And we're back with Senator Lindsey Graham. Senator, before we get to North Korea, one more question on this investigation. The New York Times reported this week the President had made some calls up to the Hill about these investigations into Russian interference. Was that appropriate for him to make those phone calls? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I don't know what the content was, but he's never asked me to stop an investigation. Yeah, it would be inappropriate for the President to say. \"Stop the investigation. It's not inappropriate to have a discussion in general.\" Again, I just want people to understand, Mike Flynn would know if there was collusion in my view between the Trump campaign and the Russians. There's no evidence of collusion yet, nobody has been charged with collusion. The-- the Manafort lawyers said there was no collusion. But if there was, Flynn would know. And we're going to know pretty soon one way or the other. JOHN DICKERSON: But on a larger question, you're not saying it's only about collusion because there is this obstruction of justice question-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes. JOHN DICKERSON: --which is quite important-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: A complete-- JOHN DICKERSON: --and lying to the F.B.I.-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Completely different, but that's not my focus right now. JOHN DICKERSON: Sure. I understand. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah. JOHN DICKERSON: But I'm saying in general that's not-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Sure, absolutely, absolutely. JOHN DICKERSON: --you don't want to want to overlook that. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: North Korea-- JOHN DICKERSON: North Korea. Where are we with North Korea right now? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: We're getting close to military conflict because North Korea is marching toward marrying up the technology of an ICBM with the nuclear weapon on top that cannot only get to America, but deliver the weapon. We're running out of time. McMaster said that yesterday. I'm going to urge the Pentagon not to send any more dependents to South Korea. South Korea should be unaccompanied tour. It's crazy to send spouses and children to South Korea, given the provocation in North Korea. So, I want them to stop sending dependents. And I think it's now time to start moving American dependents out of the South Korea.\" JOHN DICKERSON: How close? You say we're getting close to military confrontation. What's-- what-- what are we talking about here? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: The intelligence community can tell you that better than I can. But I had extensive discussion with the administration about this topic. The policy of the Trump administration is to deny North Korea the capability to hit America with a nuclear-tipped missile. Not to contain it. Denial means pre-emptive war as a last resort. That preemption is becoming more likely as their technology matures. Every missile test, every underground test of a nuclear weapon means the marriage is more likely. I think we're really running out of time. The Chinese are trying, but ineffectively. If there's an underground nuclear test then you need to get ready for a very serious response by United States. JOHN DICKERSON: Should the-- should the Congress be having a big open conversation about pre-emptive war? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah, I think so. I think the President as inherent authority as commander-in-chief has the ability to strike North Korea to protect the American homeland. But this discussion needs to happen among ourselves. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about the President's team. There were a lot of back and forth this week about whether Secretary of State Tillerson, going to stay in the job. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah. JOHN DICKERSON: Do you-- net-net after all the reports and so forth is over, do you have confidence in the President's team around him to manage this tricky question? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: He's got the best national security team of anybody I've seen since I've been in Washington. The President, himself, early on, made the right decision. I'm not going to allow North Korea to hit America with a nuclear weapon. We're not going to live under that threat. If I have to go to war, and I don't want to, to stop it, I will. Everybody before President Trump screwed it up, including Republicans. Now we need to get it right. And I think he's got the right approach. He's got the right team. I hope China will help us. We're running out of time. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. And we have run out of time, senator. Thank you so much-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Thank you. JOHN DICKERSON: --for being with us. And we'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: Joining us now is independent Maine Senator Angus King. Welcome, senator. Mitch McConnell, majority leader, says regular order was followed on this tax bill. What's your response? SENATOR ANGUS KING (I-Maine/Intelligence Committee/@SenAngusKing): If that was regular order, I'd hated to see something else. This is the bill. I brought it. This is the bill that we got at about six o'clock at night that we were going to vote on that night. There were no hearings. There were some general hearings about tax reform. There were zero hearings on the bill. And--and even the bill that was reported out by the finance committee was different than what we were handed that we had to vote on a few hours later. And what worries me about this, I'd-- I commandeered a staffer's desk right off the floor Friday night and read it all the way through. Now, I can't say I understood all of it, but you could do the things that we were talking about, reducing corporate tax rates, doubling the standard deduction in maybe fifty pages. This is four hundred and seventy-seven pages, John. There's a lot of stuff in here that I don't think anybody knows what it's all about. I just happen to pick up. I marked in the margin on page four-oh-nine, \"domestic royal and gas extraction income.\" What's that all about? There is a later provision about income on oil and gas from foreign countries, what's that all about? The point is nobody knew what was going on here and there was a moment when we could have fixed it. Chuck Schumer moved to-- to recess Friday night about nine o' clock until Monday, give people a chance to go through this and dig through it. Party line vote, denied. We end up voting at 3:00 AM. JOHN DICKERSON: Senator McConnell said Friday night, he said, you know, \"When you're complaining about the process. It means that you're losing.\" SENATOR ANGUS KING: Well, I think there is-- I mean, there's a point there because I heard him complain about the process a lot when I first arrived, but at-- at some point process matters. I mean, the eighty-six tax bill, thirty-three hearings, ten months, the vote in the Senate, by the way, was ninety to ten. This one barely was dragged across the finish line on a party-line vote. JOHN DICKERSON: So what happens now? SENATOR ANGUS KING: Well, I'm-- you know, there's a lot of talk about what the conference will be. I-- I give it fifty-fifty. There will be no conference. I think there is a chance, because I don't think that either side wants to take the-- either the House or the Senate wants to bring this back to the floor. JOHN DICKERSON: Mm-Hm. SENATOR ANGUS KING: The-- the House just may take the Senate bill and send it to the President. So, what happens now is we have now made a thirty-year decision. This is-- this may be the most important vote any of us take in our-- in our career because this isn't the reauthorization of the FAA or even the farm bill. This is something that's going to affect every American, every business, the whole economy for decades. And what happens now is, we're going to see-- well, I give you three predictions. I got three predictions. One is-- JOHN DICKERSON: All right. You have thirty seconds. SENATOR ANGUS KING: One is you're going to see people put on their long serious face as Orrin Hatch did this morning and say \"The deficits really a problem, we can't do snap or social security or Medicare.\" We got to restructure, that's number one. That's the first prediction. Two, we're going to find some really stinky stuff in here that we didn't know. And three, anything good that happens in America in the next year including good weather at the Super Bowl is going to be attributed to this bill. Those are my predictions. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. We're going to come back and talk to you, senator, on the other side of the commercial. We'll be back with Senator Angus King just after this break, stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: And we'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We're back with independent Maine Senator Angus King. Before I-- I want to ask you about the intelligence committee, but first on the question of spending. Government spending at the end of the year, democratic leaders didn't meet with the President this week. What's your sense of what happens when the government is running out of money? SENATOR ANGUS KING: Well, they're already talking about another short term--what they call a CR, continuing resolution-- that would get us into January and escape this deadline of this week. I think it's really unfortunate, most-- generally all the work of the Appropriations Committees have been done for a budget. We could pass a budget. We could have passed a budget two months ago. And I-- I don't sense that nobody wants to shut down, I don't sense that that's going to come unless it's through mutual misunderstanding between the two sides. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about Michael Flynn. Given what you know as a member of the intelligence committee, how do you read this plea deal that he made? SENATOR ANGUS KING: Well, I think you can read it in one of two ways. One, you could say he pled to a fairly minor offense and that's the end of it. It's not a big deal. The other you could say he pled to a fairly minor offense, and that means he has lot to deliver to the prosecutors. JOHN DICKERSON: Mm-Hm. SENATOR ANGUS KING: I think one of the most significant developments, though, has been in the last twenty-four hours where the President tweeted yesterday that he fired him because he had lied to the FBI. That's the first time the President has said that. And it was the next day after he was fired that the President allegedly said to Jim Comey, \"Go easy on Flynn.\" If he said to Comey go easy on Flynn knowing that he had lied to the FBI, that ups the ante on that particular part of this whole situation. And I think that may be one of the things Mister Mueller is focusing upon. JOHN DICKERSON: Does that change the shape of your investigation on intelligence committee? Are you looking into obstruction of justice in the work you're doing? SENATOR ANGUS KING: No. And I think that's important distinction to make. Mueller is-- is a criminal investigation. JOHN DICKERSON: Mm-Hm. SENATOR ANGUS KING: He is a prosecutor. He is looking for criminal violations. We're looking for the facts. And our focus is on what did the Russians do? Will they do it again? What did they do in the states? And was there collusion between the Trump campaign? My concern about all this, John, is that the-- the-- the latter issue, the-- the hot political issue of Trump and the Russians in the campaign is obscuring the larger issue, which is the Russians attacked our democracy, and they're going to do it again. And that's where the focus of our investigation is and on the collusion issue. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me quickly get your thoughts. You're on the Senate Armed Services Committee. You just heard Lindsey Graham talked about Americans preparing for pre-emptive action in North Korea. What's your take on that? SENATOR ANGUS KING: Well, part of diplomacy has to be the threat of military force in the background. And although it-- it makes your negotiations credible. But we've really got to lean on the Chinese. They have to be the solution to this. This is not a case. One of the worst terms ever to enter our lexicon is surgical strike. There's no such thing as a surgical strike. And the idea that we can go in and take out their nuclear capability just isn't so. Most of it's deep underground. So we would be talking about a major war on the Korean Peninsula, plus Seoul is only thirty-five miles from the North Korean border. Anything happens in North Korea, Seoul is history. That's twenty-six million people, including a hundred-- a couple hundred-thousand Americans. So that's-- I wouldn't say it's unthinkable. It's got to be credible. But we can't go there anytime soon. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Senator, thank you so much for being with us. And we'll be right back with White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: And we're back with White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney. Mister Director, this is not in your bailiwick, but I've got to ask you as an administration official. Yesterday, the President said that he knew Michael Flynn lied to the FBI and that's why he fired him. But then consistently he said this investigation is a witch hunt. But if you lie to the FBI, that's not a witch hunt. MICK MULVANEY (White House Budget Director/@MickMulvaneyOMB): Yeah. John, you're probably asking the exact wrong person about that. It's been kind of a busy week for me. I'm working two jobs. In fact, I'm leaving here to go back over to the CFPB on a Sunday. So I'm probably not the right person to ask about the Flynn investigation. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. We'll-- we'll-- we'll let that be there. Let me ask you about taxes. The President said that he might be okay with a twenty-two percent corporate rate instead of a twenty percent corporate rate. Is that right? And why the change? MICK MULVANEY: I-- I don't think it's a change. I think what you heard the President say is, \"Look, we're-- we're very close to the finish line.\" You know he's wanted a fifteen percent rate from the very beginning. That move to a twenty percent rate is part of the discussion. My understanding is that the Senate has a twenty percent rate now. The House has a twenty percent rate now. We're-- we're-- we're happy with both of those numbers. If something small happens in conference that gets us across the finish line, we'll look at it on a case-by-case basis. But I don't think-- I don't think you'll see any significant change in our position on the corporate taxes. JOHN DICKERSON: One of the goals for this tax cut plan was that it's going to make taxes less complicated. Taxes are not going to be less complicated if this passes. MICK MULVANEY: They will be-- they will be for ordinary people. For ordinary Americans, they will be. For small businesses, they're still going to be fairly complex. But they always were. You know when you sign up to be a pass-through entity that your life is going to be fairly complicated for taxes. But for ordinary folks it will be. JOHN DICKERSON: But for conservatives who wanted to shrink the IRS, the IRS is going to have to get bigger to watch all of these new tax regulations. Because if you don't, you're not going to squeeze the revenue out that you need to keep the budget more in balance than it would be. MICK MULVANEY: Keep in mind, there's not a lot of new regulations. Yeah, you're going to change the way we treat, again, pass-through entities. But a lot of the deductions are gone, A lot of the loopholes. Again, one person's loophole is another person's deduction. Those are gone. So there is still some-- some simplification. So I don't think, no, you're not going to see a dramatic increase in the size of the IRS in order to administer this law. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about carried interest. You and I have talked about this. The President said the loophole that exists that allows people to get away with murder, hedge fund managers and so forth. There have been tweaks in that-- MICK MULVANEY: Hmm. JOHN DICKERSON: But not material changes. Why was that something that couldn't get through given what the President said, which is that these people who benefit from that loophole are getting away with murder? MICK MULVANEY: Yeah, go back to the very beginning. And, you know, I've talked about this before. We laid out some principles at the White House. That principle was ordinary families would pay less, and it would be simpler for them to pay, and the corporate rate would come down. Within those guardrails, we sort of left it up to the House and the Senate. And the House and the Senate apparently I think have both settled on the same plan, which is that if you hold an asset longer than three years, you're going to get that carried interest treatment. The same in both bills. But I think that does discourage some of the abuse, the short-term churning and so forth. JOHN DICKERSON: But there's not much short-term churning in that carried it. That-- people-- MICK MULVANEY: Oh. JOHN DICKERSON: --who benefit from the carried interest, I think the average holding on the assets is well over three years. So it's not something that's going to get at what the President made a big deal about both as-- as candidate and as President. The treatment that benefits those people he said was getting away with murder, that's going continue.  MICK MULVANEY: But, again, go back to what we-- what our priorities were. Ordinary families, lower corporate tax rate. We got that. JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah. MICK MULVANEY: What the House and the Senate sort of filled in the details on that was up to them. JOHN DICKERSON: We've talked about this before, but that priority, sticking with the priorities. But the middle-class families are still-- there's going to be about a quarter that might see their taxes go up. And in the Senate bill, they-- those-- those tax cuts expire. And-- and just in watching this go through, there's been such focus on keeping that corporate rate steady at twenty percent. But there's been that flexibility on really being able to say what you started is being able to say at the beginning of this, which is that everybody in the middle class will get a tax cut. MICK MULVANEY: Yeah. I'm not sure where the quarter number comes from, so let's talk about-- JOHN DICKERSON: Well, those who--  MICK MULVANEY: --the expiration. JOHN DICKERSON: --who deduct, who don't take the standard deduction, who itemize, those are the ones who might see their taxes go up. MICK MULVANEY: Well, but keep in mind also we're doubling the size of the standard deduction. So the number of people who will otherwise itemize will go down dramatically. But, anyway, come to this-- this issue of this expiration. That's, it is. Well, call it what it is. It's gaming the system. The Senate rules are so bizarre and so arcane that you have to sort of horseshoe a bill into that Senate reconciliation process, which is why they're supposedly these-- these rates are going to expire after five years. The Bush tax cuts were the same way, and most of them didn't expire. We said before. We'll say again. If it's good policy, it will be permanent. If it's bad policy, it will be temporary. JOHN DICKERSON: Gaming the system seems like a dangerous place to be when you're passing legislation. MICK MULVANEY: Well, they did it-- they did it for health care. They did-- any time you want to get something through the Senate on fifty votes, you have to sort of-- JOHN DICKERSON: I know. But you do want to repeat-- MICK MULVANEY: --forcing into those rules. JOHN DICKERSON: --the mistakes of the previous-- the other team that you were so unhappy about? Do you want to repeat those mistakes yourself when you're in charge? MICK MULVANEY: What I'd rather do is change the rules so that ordinary legislation can be considered on an ordinary basis and you're not sitting there forcing policy into procedure. You shouldn't let procedure dictate what your policy is, which is exactly what you have to do because of these rules. JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah. Well, but people would say those procedures helped keep the deficit problem going down. But let me ask you about the shutdown which might be coming. Government's running out of money. Democrats wouldn't meet with the President. What's the status of things? MICK MULVANEY: Oh, you know, it's-- it's funny to see now that the Republicans are in charge. I-- I think there's a group of right-wingers in the House who say they want to shut the government down. There's a group of Democrats who want to shut-- shut the government down over DACA. And there's a group of lawmakers from some of the hurricane states who want to shut-- shut the government down until they get what they want. This just sheds light on the fact that the appropriations, the spending system is broken when any little group can sort of hold the government hostage. We need to get beyond that. I think that we will, I don't think you'll see a government shutdown. JOHN DICKERSON: People used to say that about you. You were in one of those little groups when you wanted to-- to shut the government down for reasons. You've changed your stripes. MICK MULVANEY: Well, all the more reason the system should be fixed. We don't spend money properly in Washington, DC. We-- we jump these massive bills to massive bills. The government shut down I think, John, seventeen times in twenty years between '80 and '94 or something like that. So it used to happen. JOHN DICKERSON: But-- but some people would say, \"Well, then go back to the tax bill where people basically gave up their fiscal conservatism in order to get a tax bill.\" That-- that this is always what happens. MICK MULVANEY: No. No. I mean-- JOHN DICKERSON: You want to fix the system, but-- MICK MULVANEY: Well-- JOHN DICKERSON: --the instincts are to basically-- MICK MULVANEY: But-- but my reputation is as a fiscal hawk. At least I hope that it is. And that's why I'm so interested in seeing that tax bill passed because these deficits are a function of two things, the amount of money in and the amount of money out. Spending is one of those. Tax revenues is the other. We have to get the tax revenues up. That means we have to get back to a healthy American economy, grow the economy so that you make more money, I make more money, ordinary Americans make more money, and so does the government. That helps lessen the deficit. JOHN DICKERSON: Obviously, there's a big debate among other deficit hawks about whether this bill meets that criteria. MICK MULVANEY: I've had long conversations with Mister Corker. Yes, sir. JOHN DICKERSON: The-- well, more than him. But anyway, a good shutdown. The President once talked about, \"It would maybe be good to have a shutdown.\" Is that still his view? MICK MULVANEY: Well that goes back, I remember when he said that in April. And that goes back to the system being broken. Congress doesn't spend money the way it's supposed to. It's supposed to pass, and I know this is getting deep down in the weeds, thirteen different-- twelve different appropriations bills. They don't pass any. And we have these massive bills at the end of the year. And either they pass those all at one time or it fails all at one time. And that's-- that's sort of managing by crisis to crisis. And it's not a good way to run the country. JOHN DICKERSON: Our crisis is we're out of time. Mister Director, thanks so much for being with us. MICK MULVANEY: It's always a pleasure. JOHN DICKERSON: And we'll be back in a moment with our panel. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: For some analysis on this very busy week, we turn to our political panel. Julie Pace is the Washington bureau chief for the Associated Press. Ramesh-- Ramesh Ponnuru is the senior editor at the National Review. We're also joined by Ron Brownstein, the senior editor of The Atlantic and a CNN senior political analyst, and Ezra Klein is the founder and editor-at-large of Vox.com. Ramesh, let me start with you. The tax cut, this is-- looks like it's going to pass. It's in signed by the President, so big win for the President, what's your take on it? RAMESH PONNURU (Bloomberg View/National Review/American Enterprise Institute/@RameshPonnuru): It's not just a big win for the President, it's his only major legislative win so far. And I think that is the thing that led to its happening because Republicans were just desperate to get something across the finish line and be able to tell people that they've accomplished something while in office. So I think it is a big accomplishment. It does achieve several longstanding Republican goals, particularly bringing down that corporate tax rate, which is what this entire bill is designed around. JOHN DICKERSON: Ron, how does this shake out in terms of the effects of this bill do you think? RON BROWNSTEIN (The Atlantic/@RonBrownstein): You know, normally passing a tax cut is like playing tennis without a net in terms of the public reaction. People like the idea. This tax cut is facing two to one opposition in polling. Sixty percent of Americans in Quinnipiac said it would benefit the rich at the expense of the middle class which is pretty tough language. And there are reasons for that. I mean, it will increase the deficit by at least a trillion in the most optimistic estimates after growth. It puts most of its benefits, sixty-two percent by some estimates into the top one percent. And all of the studies have shown it will have relatively limited impact on accelerating growth. But that I don't think is the reason why it is at risk. It's at risk because it departs from earlier tax bills in raising taxes on certain targets. People who live in big cities, people who live in-- who live in blue states, it cuts taxes for alternative energy while preserving them for oil and gas. In many ways it is as much an enemy's list as a tax bill. I mean, it is a clear expression of this is-- these are the people on our side, these are people on the other side and that I think exposes us to much more political risk than you usually see in a tax bill. JOHN DICKERSON: Ezra, picking up on Ron's point, I was struck on Leader McConnell said, well, we'll see how popular it gets once it passes. Chuck Schumer in 2010 after the Affordable Care Act passes-- passed said when people learn what's actually in the bill as this goes along it's going to become more and more popular. So they've really just switch teams. EZRA KLEIN (Vox.com/@ezraklein): Well, there are two actually interesting things about that because two things happen here. One is that recently Obamacare has gone a lot more popular. JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah. EZRA KLEIN: It's become a majority popular bill for first time since it-- its passage, since Trump got elected. But the other thing this tax bill does is on the way to passage, it casually destabilizes the entire individual insurance market in America. So the Republicans had skinny repeal at the end of the Obamacare appeal effort. The main provision of skinny repeal was that they're going to repeal the individual mandate, not really replace it with anything. They knew that was a bad idea. And so the idea was it could only pass if Republicans promise it wouldn't make it law, they would change it to conference. But right now they've passed the tax bill that on the way to passage, it gets rid of the individual mandate according to the Congressional Budget Office. Thirteen million people will lose health insurance, insurance premiums will go up by ten percent, individual markets will be much more destabilized and they don't have any answer for this. So in addition to a tax bill that is incredibly progressive, has all the features Ron just mentioned, it's also going to upend American health insurance markets, and they've not really thought hard about this or what to do about it or how to handle it at all. It's something they need to get a little bit of revenue and didn't really think through on the way to passage. JOHN DICKERSON: What's your take, Julie, on this? JULIE PACE (The Associated Press/@jpaceDC): Well, politically big win for the President and Republicans if they can get through to conference process and they have every political incentive to try to move through that process pretty quickly. I think one of the big things that we have to look at over the next year or two as the President heads toward 2020 is what is the impacted of this legislation on his voters. He has made sweeping promises to his voters, working class voters that they are going to get big tax cuts. They're going to-- there's going to be lot of tape for Democrats to go back to. If you look at a lot of the analysis that's come through, yes, many middle class Americans will get some kind of tax cut, some may not, and-- and for some it may be fairly minimal. So, he's putting lot of his own political capital into a piece of legislation that may not bring the kind of success for his voters that he is promising right now. RON BROWNSTEIN: One intriguing marker in this. If you go back and you look, twenty-five Democratic senators voted for the Reagan tax cuts in 1981. Twelve Democratic senators-- JOHN DICKERSON: '86. RON BROWNSTEIN: '81. The original. The original '81. '86 everybody voted for it. JOHN DICKERSON: Right. RON BROWNSTEIN: Both parties. There's ninety, you know, ninety-- ninety plus votes. Twenty-five Democratic senators in '81. In 2001, twelve Democratic senators voted for the Bush tax cuts. When this started there was a lot of expectation that because there are ten Democrats running in 2018 in states-- senators in states that President Trump carried that he would have a lot of leverage-- JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah. RON BROWNSTEIN: --to get them to vote for it. This bill is so tilted toward Republican constituencies, relatively narrowly at the top that no Democrat felt compelled, even in states that Trump won by double digits to vote for-- in stark contrast to '01. And I understand politics has changed since the '80s and even since '01. But this is not something that they were afraid of opposing. Both because of the politics and because of the substance. RAMESH PONNURU: And because Trump is less popular than most presidents are. JOHN DICKERSON: You can respond to that, but first-- JULIE PACE: But it seems like North Dakota, West Virginia, we're talking about here. RON BROWNSTEIN: Yeah. JOHN DICKERSON: But, Ramesh, you-- you wrote this week about an effort by Senator Rubio and Senator Lee to try to build up that-- the families at the lower end of this. Why was there resistance to what they were trying to do? There's also other things-- Paul Ryan has been the fan of increasing the ITC for childless. RAMESH PONNURU: Right. JOHN DICKERSON: There are-- you could lower the rates at the bottom. Why were those which would've been direct, you know, injections into the middle class and lower class, why where were those start to get through? RAMESH PONNURU: Right. So they weren't the priority for Republicans. Senator Mike Lee and Marco Rubio tried to make payroll tax relief possible for families by extending the child credit to them and pay for that by just increasing the corporate rate less than one percent. Republicans were just dead set against it. Thirty-two of them saying that we had to keep this twenty percent rate that that's somehow written in stone. And the Democrats by and large decided they did not want to participate in this bill. They could have carried that across the finish line if they had wanted to. JOHN DICKERSON: Ezra, let me go back on the health care question. Susan Collins as a-- as a trade for her vote said that Mitch McConnell promised her that Alexander Murray, the bill being used to kind of try to stabilize the Affordable Care Act, of course, before the individual mandate was being taken away. Give me your sense on-- on that. EZRA KLEIN: Yeah. JOHN DICKERSON: And-- and McConnell is committed to that to bringing that up. EZRA KLEIN: Alexander Murray was build-- was designed to deal with some problems that are in Obamacare now, and also the Trump administration's continuing sabotage of Obamacare, particularly, the expectation they're going to stop paying the cost sharing reductions. You cannot pass Alexander Murray after blowing a giant new hole in it. Alexander Murray doesn't fix that. It's not build to fix that. It's not powerful enough to fix that. So I mean, you can even-- these are percentages pulled out of nowhere, but can imagine that Alexander Murray stabilizes the individual market by fifteen percent, the individual market destabilizes him by forty percent. JOHN DICKERSON: Mm-Hm. EZRA KLEIN: You have net worth individual market. This was not a-- a trade that ever made any sense. It's a fig leaf. It's a way of saying that you're doing something without having any idea of what you're actually doing. RON BROWNSTEIN: John, can I go back to Julie's point for a minute? JOHN DICKERSON: Quickly. RON BROWNSTEIN: Real quick about-- about the economic impact of the tax bill. I mean, essentially you have a Republican coalition now that depends largely on the votes of blue collar, lower middle income whites and who Trump is speaking to very powerfully on a cultural basis. JULIE PACE: Absolutely. RON BROWNSTEIN: But you have-- you have a tax bill that tilts even more towards the top one percent and the Bush tax cuts that gave about a quarter of its benefits, this is about three fifths. And the question is, you know, can they hold those blue collar voters. One way they're doing it is by ramping up even relative to Bush or Reagan, the cultural antagonism, even the kind of overt kind of racial element in-- in the message. The problem they're getting is that's pushing away more people at the top. And if you have to predict for 2018 what's a bigger risk, blue collar people thinking they violated their interests or white collar people thinking they're violating their values. I'm betting on the latter. That's what we saw in Virginia. That's what we're seeing in Alabama. And the blue collar side is holding so far for the Republicans. RAMESH PONNURU: But the tax bill does reduce taxes on average including for blue collar people. The question is, are they going to be upset that other people get a bigger tax cut than they do. And my guess is-- (Cross talk) EZRA KLEIN: Until that expires, right? Until those parts of the bill expires. RON BROWNSTEIN: The people who are coiling from Trump on cultural grounds would also-- will also face higher taxes in blue states. And there are still a lot of Republicans in Southern California, New York, New Jersey, Northern Virginia, suburbs in Minneapolis and Chicago who will be at risk in this bill from voters who are really pulling away from them on the cultural and racial grounds. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Let's switch here to-- Julie, let's switch to Michael Flynn. What do we make of this? I mean, obviously it's a big deal. What's your take on it? JULIE PACE: It's a huge deal. And the White House is leaning hard on this idea that in the actual court documents that came out at the end of the week, there is no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. That is true, based on what is in the court documents. But I think Senator Graham made a good point if that is Mueller's aim to see if that collusion existed, he now has the witness that he-- a cooperating witness that he needs, Michael Flynn was by Trump's side throughout the campaign. He was flying on-- on Trump's plane with him, he was with him behind the scenes, he was a major player in terms of their-- their formation of policy such as-- as it was. And I think the other thing that is significant about the-- the court documents is that it undermines the entire White House argument about why Flynn was fired. They said Flynn was fired essentially because he was freelancing in his conversations with the Russian ambassador, he lied to Mike Pence about it, and he did this on his own. Those court documents say that he was actually in direct conversations with Jared Kushner and with KT McFarland, who was part of a larger group talking about conversations they were going to have with the Russians. We haven't had-- heard a good explanation from the White House about that right now. But it's very clear that Flynn was not the only person during the transition who was aware that they were going to be talking policy with-- JOHN DICKERSON: Right. JULIE PACE: --Russian officials. JOHN DICKERSON: Transition policy. Go ahead. EZRA KLEIN: The big one-- just big point about this. If you just step back from Flynn, from Manafort, from everything we're hearing from the-- the meetings that Sessions forgot, all the times Kushner lied on the security clearances. There's lot being forgotten about, lied about, misrepresented, for all to be innocent. I mean, there's something-- we don't know the whole story yet, Mueller is running what appears to be a very expansive and very aggressive investigation, but it is getting to be-- what we are being asked to believe as innocent is getting to be almost ridiculous. You go back to the Don Trump Jr. e-mails with the Russian lawyer saying, I would love to get some dirt on-- on Hillary Clinton. There's an overall picture coming together here and for a group that says they have nothing to hide, there sure is lot, they appeared to be trying extremely hard-- at great legal risk-- JOHN DICKERSON: Right. EZRA KLEIN: --to hide. JOHN DICKERSON: Ramesh. RAMESH PONNURU: So, you know, we all want to know what this means for the future of the Mueller investigation. So obviously because this is a plea agreement that means that Mueller thought that he can charge Flynn with more than that, and that he wants Flynn's cooperation. So, of course, we all want to know what the future holds here. But one thing that we can easily skip over is, this just shows terrible judgment on the part of somebody who was the National Security Advisor, and therefore also shows terrible judgment on the part of the person who hired him. The administration is sending out these press releases where they say, this was an Obama guy, Flynn. And, of course, Flynn did work in the Obama administration, but the Obama administration warned the Trump people not to hire him. They went ahead anyway and it really just shows again abysmal judgment from a President who always said he was going to surround himself with the best people. JOHN DICKERSON: Twenty-five seconds. RON BROWNSTEIN: One thing you know about the special counsel is he does not give out hall passes easily. There was a lot he could've charged Michael Flynn with that he did not charge him with. And the assumption has to be-- there's a reason why they made that call. The only thing we know about the special counsel, there's a lot we know, there's a lot we don't know. They have-- they know a lot more than we do. They may know a lot more than the people they're interviewing do. And I think that limits our ability to truly understand where this is going except every indication is that this is a very serious, aggressive and comprehensive investigation. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. We're going to have to end it there. Thanks to all of you. And we'll be right back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: That's it for us today. Thanks for watching. Be sure to tune in to the CBS EVENING NEWS tomorrow night as we begin a new era with Jeff Glor. He's taking over as anchor of the broadcast. Until next week for FACE THE NATION, I'm John Dickerson.",

As bad as it is now, it will get even worse.\u201d \u00a0 The House Budget Committee will be the third congressional panel to mark up the legislation proposed by House Republicans to repeal and replace Obamacare. The committee is expected to take up the measure next Wednesday, following the\u00a0 two markups this week by the House Ways and Means Committee and House Energy and Commerce Committee, which\u00a0advanced the bill. Civil liberties and human rights groups are urging Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly not to require people applying for U.S. visas to provide log-in information to their social media accounts. \u201cWe urge you to reject any proposal to require anyone to provide log-in information to their online accounts as a condition of entry into the United States. Demanding log-in information is a direct assault on fundamental rights and would weaken, rather than promote, national security,\u201d the groups wrote\u00a0in a letter to Kelly\u00a0on Friday. Rep. John Shimkus, R-Illinois, suggested during a markup of the GOP Obamacare replacement bill Thursday that men don\u2019t like the current health care law because they have to pay for prenatal care. During the House Energy and Commerce Committee markup, Rep. Michael Doyle, D-Pennsylvania, asked Shimkus what\u00a0 mandate in Obamacare he took issue with. \u201cCertainly not with pre-existing conditions, or caps on benefits or letting your child stay on the policy until 26, so I\u2019m curious what is it we\u2019re mandating?\u201d Doyle said. \u201cWhat about men having to purchase prenatal care? Is that not correct? And should they?\u201d Shimkus said. Most election forecasters found themselves in a social media buzzsaw the day after Donald\u00a0Trump stunned the country\u00a0with his triumph over Hillary Clinton. Major political oddsmakers had predicted a Clinton win, and famed numbers savant\u00a0Nate Silver announced\u00a0the day before the election, \u201cClinton is a 71 percent favorite to win the election.\u201d He wasn\u2019t alone, though, and since then, analysts, academics and number crunchers have been trying to figure out why they were wrong. \u201cFreakonomics\u201d\u00a0co-founder Stephen Dubner brings a different lens to the argument, though, suggesting in this week\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Takeout\u201d podcast that we may all just be looking at this the wrong way.\u00a0 Watch \u201cThe Takeout\u201d with Major Garrett and Steve Chaggaris on CBSN -- Fridays at 9 p.m. -- or on the CBS News app on iPhones and Android devices, as well as Apple TV, Amazon Fire, Roku, Playstation, Xbox and Chromecast.

For months, President Donald Trump and his advisers have tried to distance themselves from Carter Page, a little-known investment banker\u00a0who briefly served as a foreign policy adviser\u00a0on the Republican\u2019s presidential campaign. This week, Page - who is at the center of the swirling controversy over Trump associates\u2019 connections to Russia - painted himself as a recurrent visitor to Trump Tower, the New York skyscraper that housed Trump\u2019s campaign offices. Discusses health care bill with key committee members, 11:30 a.m.; speaks with Mahmoud Abbas by phone, 12:15 p.m.; lunch with Tillerson, 12:45 p.m.; meets with Ben Carson, 3:30 p.m. How do you compete with a restaurant at President Donald Trump\u2019s hotel down the road from the White House?\u00a0Two Washington restaurateurs argue you can\u2019t\u00a0\u2014 and have sued him over it. The plaintiffs are Khalid Pitts and Diane Gross. They allege unfair competition under local law and have filed a lawsuit against Trump personally and the Trump Old Post Office LLC, which operates the Trump International Hotel. The two plaintiffs own Cork Wine Bar, which is in the Logan Circle neighborhood, about a mile and a half away from the hotel. Cork Wine Bar is a well-regarded brick-walled market and wine bar that serves New American small plates. FBI Director James\u00a0Comey went to Capitol Hill Thursday to brief the Gang of Eight members\u00a0of Congress on President Trump\u2019s wiretapping allegations, as well as other national security matters, CBS News\u2019 Nancy Cordes reports. Comey met with the Gang of Eight in two separate meetings -- one with the senators and one with the House members. The Gang is composed of the leaders from each party in the House and Senate, as well as the chair and ranking member from the House and Senate Intelligence Committees. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on Thursday\u00a0struggled with the question\u00a0of whether President Donald Trump is under investigation by the Department of Justice, saying in a lengthy exchange with reporters that the White House is \u201cnot aware\u201d of any investigation involving the president. On Wednesday, Spicer was asked about the issue in the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s\u00a0allegations about being wiretapped\u00a0at Trump Tower during the 2016 election. He replied that there\u2019s \u201cobviously a lot of concern\u201d about the issue. Later in the briefing, however, an aide handed him a note and he was more definitive in his answer. Vice President Mike Pence said Thursday that former national security adviser Michael\u00a0Flynn\u2019s work to further the interests of the government of Turkey\u00a0is \u201can affirmation\u201d of President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to ask for his resignation. Pence told Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier in an interview airing Thursday evening that media reports about Flynn\u2019s work were \u201cthe first I heard of it and I think it is an affirmation of the President\u2019s decision to ask General Flynn to resign.\u201d Secretary of State\u00a0Rex Tillerson has recused himself from TransCanada\u2019s application\u00a0for a presidential permit for the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, the State Department says. Republicans on a pivotal House committee\u00a0scored an initial triumph\u00a0in their effort to scuttle former President Obama\u2019s health care overhaul, using a pre-dawn vote Thursday to abolish the tax penalty his statute imposes on people who don\u2019t purchase insurance and reshaping how millions of Americans buy medical care. Yet the Ways and Means\u00a0 panel\u2019s approval of health care legislation only masked deeper problems Republican backers face. Hospitals, doctors and consumer groups mounted intensifying opposition to the GOP health care drive, and the White House and Republican leaders labored to rally a divided party behind their high-stakes overhaul crusade. President Trump is nominating former Utah Gov. Jon\u00a0Huntsman to serve as U.S. ambassador to Russia, two sources familiar with the situation have confirmed to CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett. The nomination, like many in the Trump world, has been on the table for weeks and it took some time to complete the paperwork. Before the president nominated Rex Tillerson for secretary of state, Huntsman was\u00a0among the contenders considered for the job. A Wisconsin Democrat\u00a0will be introducing congressional legislation\u00a0Thursday aimed at ensuring that taxpayers won\u2019t be paying for President Trump\u2019s southern border wall, CBS News\u2019 Rebecca Shabad reports. The \u201cNo Taxpayer Funding for the Wall Act,\u201d obtained first by CBS News, is sponsored by Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wisconsin, and would prohibit the use of federal funds to build a fence, wall or any other physical barrier along the border with Mexico. \u201cI am not in favor of the wall, but if there is a wall, then I do not want the United States of America to pay for the wall,\u201d Moore said in an interview with CBS, adding that she doesn\u2019t want American taxpayers and consumers harmed by the cost. President Donald Trump\u2019s daughter and son-in-law are renting a house from a foreign billionaire\u00a0who is fighting the U.S. government over a proposed mine in Minnesota. The Wall Street Journal reports that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner are renting a $5.5 million house in Washington\u2019s Kalorama neighborhood from Andr\u00f3nico Luksic. One of the Chilean billionaire\u2019s companies is suing the federal government over lost mineral right leases for a proposed copper-nickel mine in northeastern Minnesota.

            "article_content": "JOHN DICKERSON, HOST: Today on FACE THE NATION: President Trump steps across the world stage after a week of stumbles back in Washington.  Now, that's more like it. For an aggrieved president, the warm welcome in Saudi Arabia kicked off a bold gambit to unite Muslim nations against extremism. And the president who had once campaigned on banning Muslims now offered an olive branch to members of the world's largest religion.  But, back home, the president's domestic agenda has remained interrupted by chaos and questions over whether his campaign worked with Russians to influence the 2016 presidential election and whether he fired FBI Director James Comey to divert his investigation of the matter.  Comey agreed to testify publicly in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee. What do senators want to hear from him? We will hear from a key Republican on the committee, Senator Marco Rubio.  And what can we expect from the newly appointed special counsel, former FBI Director Robert Mueller, as he takes the reins of a growing investigation.  We will talk to the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dianne Feinstein.  Plus, what do Americans make of all of this? We will have some answers from our latest Nation Tracker survey. And our politics panel will also weigh in.  It's all coming up on FACE THE NATION.  Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I'm John Dickerson.  It was another week of chaos and distraction for President Trump, and he wasn't happy about it.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: No politician in history -- and I say this with great surety -- has been treated worse or more unfairly. (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: But much of the trouble was self-inflicted.  Monday, \"The Washington Post\" reported that the president had given the Russians highly classified information that normally wouldn't be shared with friendly countries, let alone an adversary.  Tuesday, \"The New York Times\" reported that the FBI had a memo from former FBI Director James Comey that said the president had asked him to let go of the federal investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.  Republican Senator John McCain was reminded of previous presidential tampering.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: I think we have seen this movie before. I think it's reaching the point where it's of Watergate size and scale.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: The biggest news came Wednesday, when a special counsel was named to investigate Russia's involvement in the 2016 presidential campaign.  President Trump was asked about the decision.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: Well, I respect the move, but the entire thing has been a witch-hunt.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: Friday, a flood of revelations, as the president left on a carefully planned eight-day foreign trip.  The first headline? The FBI investigation is looking at a senior official close to the president. The second? That the investigation now includes the possibility of a White House cover-up. And the third? That the president told the Russians something else in that meeting, that firing FBI Director Comey had relieved him of the pressure of his investigation.  And the president this morning is in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, giving a speech on Islam and terrorism.  We're now joined by White House and senior affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan, who is traveling with the president -- Margaret.  MARGARET BRENNAN, CBS NEWS WHITE HOUSE AND SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning. While reaching out to leaders of more than 50 Muslim-majority countries who are gathered here in Saudi Arabia, President Trump is calling for unity against extremism. He's abandoning that campaign era rhetoric against Islam, a religion he once said hates us, even calling for the shutdown of all Muslims from entering the U.S.  Today, right now, he's trying to recast that instead as a battle between against all decent people and the barbaric criminals he says falsely invoke the name of God.  Unlike past U.S. presidents, Mr. Trump is making it a policy to avoid public criticism of human rights abuses, saying, we are not here to lecture. And he has lifted those Obama era restrictions on certain weapon sales, inking a $110 billion deal with Saudi Arabia.  And the kingdom has warmly embraced President Trump with honors that they did not bestow on his predecessor. U.S. relations were damaged in large part by the Obama era's outreach to Iran.  So, while President Trump is bringing with him all the baggage of those domestic issues, so far, he is sticking to scripted remarks and he's avoiding Twitter.  But, John, he's got eight more stops on this foreign trip, and, tomorrow, he heads to Israel.  DICKERSON: Thank you, Margaret.  We turn to Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who joins us from Miami, Florida.  Welcome, Senator.  I want to start with former Director James Comey. He will testify in front of the Intelligence Committee, which you are on. What do you want to know from Director Comey?  SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), FLORIDA: Well, obviously, look, these media report raise that are out there questions that deserve answers.  What did the president say? Did, in fact, you keep memos? What do those memos say and why did you write them and what was your feeling? And the American public deserves to know the answers to that. I think that's fair to the president. I think that's fair to former Director Comey and I think that's fair to the country.  DICKERSON: What did you make of \"The New York Times\"' report which apparently came just from the notes taken by White House note takers in the meeting between the president and the Russians in which the president said: \"I just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nutjob. I faced great pressure because of Russia. That's taken off.\"  RUBIO: Well, I haven't seen the notes.  I told people earlier this week I had a conversation with the White House. People that were in that meeting, they denied anything had been said in that meeting that could compromise sources, methods or information with regards to intelligence. They said there were no transcripts. They said there were notes.  I encouraged them to make those notes available to the committees. That's not happened. And, of course, apparently someone has discussed them or leaked them or what have you.  But we haven't seen them. So, I don't know that's an accurate description of what is in the notes. And that's why it's important that the Intelligence Committee and those conducting this inquiry look at them.  DICKERSON: That's right.  And there were two elements of that meetings with the Russians, one possible classified information that was handed over, the other this question about what may have been said about James Comey.  Is one thing you're interested in at least with respect to Comey, though, whether there was an attempt to interfere with the investigation by the president?  RUBIO: Well, look, that's a relevant question that needs to be asked and it needs to answered.  But the question is, how are they asked and answered? Do you do it through the press or do you do it through the processes that are now moving forward? Director Mueller -- or former Director Mueller has now been appointed. I think virtually everyone has full confidence that he's going to conduct a thorough and fair investigation and a look at all of these things and give answers.  And we're now going to look at it and continue to look at it from a counterintelligence perspective. And that's our job.  DICKERSON: I wanted to get your response to something the White House said about Director Comey that bears on foreign policy.  Sean Spicer, the press secretary, said that: \"By grandstanding and politicizing the investigation into Russia's actions, James Comey created unnecessary pressure on our ability to engage and negotiate with Russia.\"  Do you think that's right?  RUBIO: Well, that may be the White House's opinion. I don't necessarily share that 100 percent, assuming that that's in fact what Director Comey was doing.  I don't think that that was -- because, at the end of the day, the United States of America remains a major factor, if not the major factor, on the global stage. And American foreign policy resides not solely in the hands of the White House, but also the Congress.  As you know, there's plenty of votes in Congress for additional sanctions. So, I don't necessarily believe that it undermined our ability to deal with the Russians. That's my view of it. Obviously, the White House has a different take. But I don't think that.  DICKERSON: Isn't it, Senator, also the fact that the Russians, by trying to meddle in the election, undermined the U.S. ability to negotiate with the Russians?  RUBIO: Well, certainly it's a factor in our relationship, there's no doubt. And that should be the core focus of the Intel Committee's work, is to lay out to the American people not just what Russia did -- I think we have a pretty good view of that already -- but how they did it and what it means for the future and we should be doing about it.  DICKERSON: Let me ask about this report that classified information was given.  The president said he was giving information to the Russians in that meeting in order to help them -- quote -- \"greatly step up their fight against ISIS and terrorism.\"  Do you think that's a possibility, that by giving them information, that the Russians will step up and help with ISIS?  RUBIO: Well, two things.  First of all, I don't know what the Russians knew already, number one, or at least I won't discuss that. Number two, I'm not sure that's what the president did, that he gave them that sort of information. Everybody that was in the room that I have spoken to denies that that's what happened.  But, obviously, that will be a focus of the inquiries as we move forward. And, number three, I think the Russians will -- if they cooperate against terrorism, it will to the extent that it's in their interests vis-a-vis their view of the United States.  Who they define as terrorists is simply ISIS. They also define as terrorists virtually any group on the ground that is confronting Assad. We're focusing on radical jihadists. They're focused not just on that, but anybody who is trying to get rid of Assad.  DICKERSON: Senator McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, said he'd like a little less drama out of the White House. Do you share that view?  RUBIO: Well, look, I don't understand why people are that shocked. This president ran a very unconventional campaign. I was there for a big part of it at the beginning alongside, being one of his competitors.  And that's what the American people voted for. And, in essence, this White House is not much different from the campaign. People got what they voted for. They elected him. Obviously, it's in the best interest of this country to try to help him succeed. As far as the drama's concerned, yes, it's unique. It's different from anything we have ever confronted. I think our job remains to do our work. We will have to deal with these issues. These issues come up, these questions, every single day.  And I do think the White House would benefit from some systems in place that perhaps avoids some of the unnecessary friction points that come up on a daily basis. But this is also the political environment we now live in too. Politics are covered this way.  And politicians also behave in this way because they know they can get attention for saying things one way or the other. It's just the way politics has moved. I don't think it's good for the country, but that's where we're headed for now, apparently.  DICKERSON: Let me ask you a question about how you see the Trump administration and the message they've sent about human rights.  One the one hand, this week, the administration sanctioned eight Venezuelan judges. And you said -- this is an issue you have been working on -- \"The United States is not going to allow those who impede democracy to violate human rights.\"  But then, on the other hand, the administration, towards countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Russia even, seems to have a more muted public voice about human rights. How are we to weigh those two differences?  RUBIO: Well, it's not an approach that I entirely agree with.  I certainly believe that we need to confront Venezuela and Cuba and Iran and all the human rights violators in the world. And the White House is willing to do so publicly for nations that are hostile towards the United States. They believe -- and it's a point of disagreement -- but they believe that on the countries that are cooperative with us on other issues, like Saudi Arabia, like, Egypt, we should privately confront them on the issues of human rights, that you will get a better result that way.  Now, I have a different take on it. I believe human rights are important for us to speak about publicly. The human rights activists in those countries would agree, because they're demoralized when they don't hear it.  But, in fairness, the White House has gotten results. I remember raising the issue of Aya Hijazi repeatedly with the White House. They raised it in private with Egypt. She was released. Sandy Phan-Gillis was being held unjustly in China. I raised it with the White House. They raised it privately with the Chinese. She was released.  So, I do want to acknowledge they have gotten results through their approach. But I think, from a broader perspective, I disagree with it. I have told them that. They know it's a point of disagreement with me, because I believe that these countries, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the like, are not sustainable in the long term if they continue to systemically violate the rights of their people.  DICKERSON: OK.  Senator Marco Rubio, thanks so much for being with us.  RUBIO: Thank you. Thanks.  DICKERSON: Joining us now is the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein.  Welcome, Senator.  SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D), CALIFORNIA: Thank you, John.  DICKERSON: Let's start with former Director Comey. What do you want to know from him?  FEINSTEIN: Well, what I want to know from him is, how many times did he meet with the president -- excuse me, John -- or talk with the president on the phone? What was he asked by the president?  Was he asked to in any way alter the investigation? What was he asked about Mr. -- General Flynn? Questions like that.  I think it's important for the American people to know what may be behind some of the actions that have recently been taken.  DICKERSON: Director Comey testified in front of the Judiciary Committee back in May. And he was asked these questions about whether anybody had tried to impede the investigation. And Director Comey at the time said, \"Not in my experience.\"  Talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for a political reason: \"That would be a very big deal. It's not happened in my experience.\"  So, it seems like, before, he said it hadn't happened. Now he might be saying something different. Doesn't that make him...  FEINSTEIN: Well, that's why doing this in public, so that the people can hear, is so important.  And it's why, although I would prefer it to be in Judiciary, because that's the committee of jurisdiction, Mr. Comey has chosen the Intelligence Committee. I also sit on the Intelligence Committee.  So, if nobody asks the questions before they get to me, you have just heard the questions that I will ask.  When Sally Yates came before a panel of the Judiciary Committee, I think the questions asked of her were primary questions. And the American people gain by hearing those questions.  I really think that, rather than have all these memorandums and issues circulating around, that we need to put the facts before the American people. And did -- the big fact is, did the president fire Comey because of his investigation and he was worried about what the investigation might conclude?  That -- if so, that borders on a very serious charge. So, we need to flush that out. We need to see what the response is. And it's got to come from Director Comey himself.  DICKERSON: And what do you make of the comment attributed to the president in \"The New York Times\" that the White House has not disputed, that the president said, \"I just\" -- in his meeting with the Russians -- \"I just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job. I faced great pressure because of Russia. That's taken off\"?  FEINSTEIN: Well, again, we will see what records there are and hopefully be able to have access to them.  I mean, this is a horrible thing for a president to say. Director -- former Director Comey is in no way, shape or form a nut job. He's a very strong man. He's a very principled man.  I have to believe he made a couple of mistakes. I suspect he thinks he made a couple of mistakes. Whether that deserved his termination or not is not up to me.  The fact is, he's been terminated. But the reason for the termination has really not been ferreted out. And that's what has to be before the American people, clear and distinct.  DICKERSON: You said you wanted to see these memos that the former director wrote about his meetings with the president.  The president has also talked about tapes or taping in the White House. Is that also something the Judiciary Committee would be asking for?  FEINSTEIN: Well, and the president has referred to tapes. So, we need to see. And, yes, I think it is.  Senator Grassley, our chairman, and myself, we have written a letter to Director Comey asking him to appear before the Judiciary Committee. I would hope that, although he's going before Intelligence, that he would also do this, because our questions would be separate and distinct and more along the lines of what you just asked, John.  DICKERSON: Do you get the sense that the federal investigation into this includes something beyond just the question of Russia and the Trump campaign, but that it now includes a cover-up question?  FEINSTEIN: Well, I think that's right. It does.  I know what the president told me when he called to say that he was firing him. And that turned out not to be the reason.  So, I think there's one thing about this president. And I would really like to say it meaning well, and that is, stop the tweeting. Think about what you say, because you're reflecting in a big pool. And the Senate and the House have to feel a sense of stability from day to day.  We can't feel the anxiety that goes with not knowing what may happen next, what may be said next. And we need to depend on our president for truth. That is really important.  DICKERSON: And in the final 30 seconds, what do you want to see in the next FBI director?  FEINSTEIN: What I want to see in the next FBI director is a law enforcement program.  I have recommended to the president Mr. McCabe. I find him strong. I find him a good leader. I find him with the experience that's necessary. And this is a law enforcement agency separate from the political branch. And so we will see what happens.  DICKERSON: All right, Senator Feinstein, thanks so much for being with us.  FEINSTEIN: Thank you, John.  DICKERSON: And we will be back in one minute.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: We're now joined by CBS News chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford and CBS News justice and homeland security correspondent Jeff Pegues.  Jeff, I want to start with you.  Why did Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein have to name a special counsel?  JEFF PEGUES, CBS NEWS JUSTICE AND HOMELAND SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, because -- it was those memos, the Comey memos that popped up that were causing a lot of controversy, and then this idea that Comey was fired, and why was he fired?  Was it the Russia investigation or was it the recommendation of Rosenstein? And so you had all of this bubbling up to the surface. It came to the point where he had no choice but to appoint Bob Mueller.  DICKERSON: And, Jan, what's the scope of what Bob Mueller can do?  JAN CRAWFORD, CBS NEWS CHIEF LEGAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I mean, it's broad and it's very independent.  In his appointment of former FBI Director Mueller, Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein says that he will be able to investigate any possible contacts or links with the Russian government and the Trump campaign and any matters that arose during the investigation or may arise out of the investigation.  That's a broad charge to Mr. Mueller. And he has complete independence, practically speaking.  DICKERSON: And so that seems to be the basket in which people would put this question of cover-up that Senator Feinstein was talking about, that idea that anything arising from the investigation. Is that the way you read it?  CRAWFORD: Absolutely, any of those matters.  It's confined to these allegations. He can't go off on some tangent and investigate all other matters. But it's broad and it's wide-ranging.  And I think I want to make this point, too. It's going to be absolutely confidential. And I think that's why we're going to see such a difference in the investigations that are going on, on Capitol Hill.  DICKERSON: And confidential meaning not as leaky as we have been maybe having in some of the discussions before because of Mueller's reputation.  CRAWFORD: Sure. And it's -- he's a former prosecutor. There will be former prosecutors. DICKERSON: Jeff, give me a sense of Comey's allies and what this talk about him, the president calling him a nut job and so forth, how that's affected the kind of response in the building. And just a lot of these leaks are probably coming from those people.  PEGUES: Well, he has a lot of allies.  And that's why they were stunned by this move and the way that it happened so publicly. He wasn't informed privately. This happened on live TV, essentially. And there were a lot of people in the FBI, both current and former FBI employees, who were offended by that, because one thing about James Comey they know, you might quibble with some of his decisions, but you don't attack his character.  And that's what the White House was doing consistently and, frankly, still doing that. And so there are a lot of people who are offended by that. And that's where you see some of these leaks coming out.  And though there's a special counsel now, I think these leaks are going to continue, because they're coming from people who feel that it is their patriotic duty to counter the White House denials.  So, I suspect, even though Bob Mueller will seal up the investigation, there are people outside of government who are briefed or have been briefed on the details of this investigation already, and they will push back against these White House denials.  DICKERSON: Jan, help me understand the threshold for obstruction of justice, which is what people are talking about here, with respect to the president and this investigation.  CRAWFORD: Well, first of all, I think it's important to keep in mind that President Trump is not going to be tried in court for obstruction of justice.  There will not be charges brought against President Trump because the Constitution -- it's an open question whether a sitting president can be charged in court with obstruction of justice. Remember, Richard Nixon was an unindicted co-conspirator.  This goes to a political question. And if former Director Mueller finds there is some evidence of obstruction, that goes into Congress. They can start impeachment proceedings against President Trump for potential obstruction of justice. That's what President Clinton and President Nixon were brought into impeachment proceedings for.  But they have to show intent. And that's a very difficult thing to show. It's not that this looks bad, it was a stupid thing to say, it may have been offensive to FBI employees. There has to be that Trump intended to obstruct this investigation. That's difficult to show.  And I think, based on what we've seen so far, there's not that evidence. And that's what these kind of investigations you are going to see from the special counsel. They will look at all that.  DICKERSON: Right. They have to get in his head, essentially.  CRAWFORD: Right, which may be difficult.  DICKERSON: Right.  (LAUGHTER)  CRAWFORD: But it's not easy to prove, and so that's what they're going to looking at, the intent.  DICKERSON: And, Jeff, give me the sense of this, the meaning in the Oval Office with the Russian leaders.  There was two things. There's the Comey conversation and also but there was this classified intelligence that was supposedly a part of that conversation. What have you heard about that?  PEGUES: Well, that's an image that will haunt this White House for quite some time.  There are people in the intelligence community, both current and former, law enforcement community, who saw the image and they were offended by it.  Keep in mind that was a meeting that Vladimir Putin called for. That's what he wanted. And in those images, you see the president laughing and joking with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, who is a central character in this investigation. And so, for a lot of people, especially former intelligence officials, that was a real slap in the face. And now you hear more of these revelations coming out of this meeting. And that's why you hear these leaks as well, because people want to expose what they believe is the truth.  DICKERSON: All right. Thanks so much, Jeff and Jan.  And we will be back in a moment.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Coming up: What do Americans think about President Trump's job performance and the firing of FBI Director James Comey.  That's next in our FACE THE NATION Nation Tracker.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: And we will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION, so stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.  Over the last few months, CBS News, along with YouGov, has been tracking Americans for our Nation Tracker and monitoring their views on the Trump administration, Congress and the country, including the investigations into Russia and the Trump campaign. CBS News elections director Anthony Salvanto joins us to discuss the latest findings.  All right, Anthony, before we get into the great four groups that you've figured out many months ago, the four different kinds of -- of Americans, let's start first with the broad picture. What do your findings show?  ANTHONY SALVANTO, CBS NEWS ELECTIONS & SURVEYS DIRECTOR: Well, big picture is, majority disapproval of the way the president is handling all things related to the FBI and the Russia investigation. You find a majority who say that they think there should be a special prosecutor and concern about the possibility of sharing intelligence with Russia. Also that if there are tapes of conversations between the president and former director Comey, that those tapes should be released.  But then once you dig in, you say, well, how does all of that, the majority one way or the other, affect the support groups that the president has or doesn't have. Look, we've always known that there are hardcore supporters and hardcore detractors. The real play here is these folks in the middle who have been wondering sort of which president was going to show up over these months. Was it the savvy businessman who was going to make Washington work, or was it the candidate who they thought was impulsive and whose judgement they questioned? And you see as this Russia investigation plays into those feelings, that's where it starts to move the needle.  DICKERSON: Yes, it was fascinating to hear Senator Rubio say this is -- the White House is behaving just like the campaign. I don't know why people are surprised.  Let's go through your four groups here. First we'll start with the believers. These are the -- these are the big Trump fans.  SALVANTO: Yes, these are the firmest supporters. Now, their numbers have dwindled a little bit. They're about a fifth of the country. But what's gotten smaller has also gotten a little more concentrated. These folks strongly support the president and they see a witch hunt. They think that this president is under unfair pressure from what they call the establishment that is pushing back against him the way it does not do with -- it did not do with previous president, and that he needs their support, now more than ever, to fight against that.  Also you see they're taking this very personally which is striking to me in that they said when they see people criticize the president, they feel like they're also being criticized along with him. That he speaks for them. That he speaks for the working class in ways that others don't.  Beyond that, and you see their -- there are prescriptions for what the president ought to do now and they say the president should have more power. That he should be able to stop this investigation if he wants to. That he should be able to do what he wants and not what the congressional Republicans want and, you know, an interesting sort of side note, they think that government officials should be -- should swear a loyalty oath to the president, as well as the Constitution, not just the Constitution alone. And those prescriptives are very different from other groups, including his other supporters.  DICKERSON: Let's go then into the second group, the conditional supporters.  SALVANTO: Yes, these folks don't have that same emotional connection with the president. They're more what I would call transactional, which is, they're support him but they want a policy agenda enacted. And what we see here is that they're increasingly worried that won't happen. That this controversy will bog him down. They're more supportive of the idea not just of a special prosecutor but that the GOP Congress should push back against President Trump as a check when needed. And so their view here is, things need to get done and they're worried -- they're increasingly worried that those policy things that they want won't get done. And so they're looking more to the Republican Congress to sort of keep pushing that through.  DICKERSON: Right. The people want to see the trade, the economy. Those policy specifics --  SALVANTO: Right.  DICKERSON: Don't necessarily have that in their bones connection.  OK. Now, what about -- what about the third group, the curious voters?  SALVANTO: Yes. These are folks we've watched all -- all along, people who wanted to support the president. They were looking for a reason. Don't necessarily agree with him on all the policies, but thought, well, if he can change Washington, we'll come along. But what we're seeing now is that they're dropping away. That they're becoming more hard in their support. And what -- what is associated with that is an increasing feeling of nervousness that they say that they feel this is back to the idea that -- that this relates -- this investigation relates to the president's judgement and temperament. Well, they feel that those things are declining. That they -- they give worse ratings to his judgment now and so they're becoming hard in their support, not necessarily interested in seeing the president tied up in controversy, but they definitely did think that -- they would have hoped he would have reached out across the aisle instead of being bogged down in this. But that said, everyone that we re-interviewed increasingly nervous, saying that's the word they consistently use, that they're getting more and more nervous about what the administration is doing. So this is pushing them away. They could have been, but right now it doesn't look like they're coming back.  DICKERSON: And then the final group are the resisters, the never- Trumpers, the group that's just not listening to anything.  SALVANTO: Yes. And for these folks, this is confirming all their suspicions. They overwhelmingly think that there was wrongdoing. They think that the president did try to stop the investigation, not just talk about it with -- with former Director Comey. And what you see there is that they -- their numbers are actually growing a little bit. They've gone up now to 40 percent of the country. That's because those folks who were on the fence are sort of coming over to that firmer opposition, in part because of all of this and that -- that nervousness. But what you don't see yet is if people think, well, this means that Democrats can run as a check on President Trump in the next election, not yet because the country only splits on the idea of whether a Democratic controlled Congress would be a check on the president or whether it would just bring more gridlock, which is not what they wanted.  DICKERSON: All right, Anthony, wonderful as always. Thank you so much.  And we'll be right back with our political panel.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: We're joined now by CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer. She's with us from Tehran, Iran, where reformer President Hassan Rouhani was just re-elected and where they are watching President Trump's visit to the Middle East very closely.  ELIZABETH PALMER, CBS NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning.  The election here was really a referendum on the reformist agenda that President Rouhani had been pursuing for the past four years, which resulted in unprecedented negotiations with the west and then, of course, the nuclear deal. The question now is whether President's Rouhani and Trump will choose to go beyond that and seek further agreement of some kind.  For his part, Rouhani has won, decisively enough, to push forward with more international links, but he faces constant resistance inside Iran from powerful hardliners. They point out that President Trump's first trip abroad is to Iran's archenemies Saudi Arabia and Israel, and they say it's proof that the U.S. can't be trusted.  In Washington, the White House has amped up its condemnation of Iran recently for its military program, especially its interference in the Syrian war and its latest missile test. On the campaign trail, President Trump called the nuclear deal disastrous, but he has, for now, decided to stick with it.  The bottom line is that the U.S. and Iran do share some common interests, fighting ISIS, certainly, and stabilizing the Middle East. So the thing to watch for in the coming months behind all the aggressive rhetoric is the emergence of some kind of diplomatic negotiations, either covert or overt, between Washington and Tehran.  DICKERSON: Thanks, Elizabeth.  President Trump just concluded his speech in terrorism in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where he said the United States is prepared to stand with the Muslim world in pursuit of common interests, including fighting terrorism.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: This is not a battle between different faiths, different sects or different civilizations. This is a battle between barbaric criminal who seek to obliterate human life and decent people all in the name of religion.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: To discuss this speech and all the week's news, we turn now to our political panel. Ed O'Keefe is a CBS News contributor and covers politics for \"The Washington Post,\" David Ignatius is a columnist at \"The Washington Post,\" Molly Ball covers politics for \"The Atlantic,\" and Ramesh Ponnuru is senior editor of \"The National Review.\"  David, I want to start with you. Just jump in on that -- on the speech. What do you make of this trip?  DAVID IGNATIUS, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": The -- the speech was the -- the capstone. The president didn't say anything surprising, but the language was very different from the Trump we know of the campaign. He was really inviting partnership, not drawing sharp lines.  The White House has worked very hard to prepare this trip. And for all of the questions about the flip-flops and the difference between Trump then and Trump now, I think, you know, you need to stand back and look at the symbolic importance of this. A president who really did represent many Americans who were suspicious, angry at Saudi Arabia and the problems of -- in the Middle East that are represented are seeing their hero go to Saudi Arabia and embrace the Saudi leadership. Similarly, the Saudis have gathered Arab and Muslim countries who were very suspicious of the United States to Riyadh to meet and embrace this American president. Behind it is a (INAUDIBLE) -- an antipathy toward Iraq. That's -- that's important. But I think the -- the Trump administration is also make a bet that the younger Saudi leadership, headed by the Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, that this is a change agent ready to try to move into a different era for Saudi Arabia and the region. They are taking advantage of that. And I actually think that's smart.  DICKERSON: Molly, as David points out, this is quite a distance from the president who not only campaigned on a Muslim ban, but then who also had very critical things to say about Saudi Arabia, about Hillary Clinton's relationship with Saudi Arabia and who, on the question of radical Islam, called it -- or, excuse me, called it radical Islamic terrorism. And if you didn't use that phrase, it was proof that you misunderstood the entire biggest most important threat to America. Now he's in a different place.  MOLLY BALL, \"THE ATLANTIC\": And he is not, in fact, using those three words in the speech today. I think, as David said, a very important decision has been made by the administration about what kind of president Trump is going to be with regard to the Muslim world and it is not candidate Trump at all. And I think it also follows on the sequence of national security decisions and appointments we've seen this administration make, which are much more on the sort of traditionally hawkish side of the Republican Party, rather than the more isolationist or transactional or sort of America-first ideology that he espoused during the campaign. This is -- this is a rather conventional type of play for an American president to make to say, we are looking for areas of cooperation. We are not judging people on the basis of their religion. That was not candidate Trump at all.  DICKERSON: Ramesh, give me your take and also -- this is happening in a larger context, which is a lot of confusion about which -- which is the President Trump? Is it the one that Molly described who is, on things from NATO to dealing with China has, on the foreign policy front, really shaved off the rough edges of his campaign rhetoric, yet domestically, obviously, is having challenges. So where do you see this in the evolution of understanding the president?  RAMESH PONNURU, \"THE NATIONAL REVIEW\": I do think that this speech -- it's pretty -- pretty easily in a mainstream foreign policy tradition. We've now had three presidents post 9/11 who have made a distinction between the people we are fighting against and the mainstream of Islam. I think what was new here was Trump himself speaking respectfully and admiringly about Muslims and Islam. That we haven't seen.  The focus on the terminology, radical Islamic terrorist, versus the remarks that he actually talked about, he said \"Islamic terrorism,\" he said \"Islamisism,\" the prepared remarks called them \"Islamist terrorist groups,\" I do think that the focus on that has been somewhat overblown on the part of both parties with one side saying, oh, if you use those words you're going to offend all Muslim, another side saying, you've got to name the enemy in order to win. These terms all seem pretty much identical as far as I can tell.  DICKERSON: Right, although it's true that the president, as a candidate said, unless the president, Obama at the time, used that express, he should resign. So he was putting a lot of weight on it.  The other thing he put weight on in this particular trip, Ed, was the idea that this deal with the Saudis would lead to, as the president said, hundreds of billions of dollars in investments into the United States and jobs, jobs, jobs. He may be overseas, but he's keeping the eyes own the ball here at home.  ED O'KEEFE, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": He may be overseas and he may be overselling. In fact, if you look at the details of this, as we did in \"The Post\" today, you know, Lockheed Martin, for example, is selling them $28 million worth of military equipment, and that will boost 450 jobs at the Sikorsky plant in Connecticut. There's a $7 billion deal with GE for technology and training programs, but that's going to create 250 high-tech jobs in Saudi Arabia.  Where we may see most of the investment come from is this deal being put together by the Blackstone Investment Firm. The ink isn't actually dry on it yet. They haven't finished the deal. And the negotiating of it began during the Obama year. But what they're looking to do is get about a $40 billion fund put together for infrastructure projects, a lot of which will be spent here in the states. So Saudi money may end up helping to build new projects in the states. If you can't get an infrastructure deal from here in Washington, he may get one thanks to Riyadh.  DICKERSON: Right.  O'KEEFE: And that is the irony.  But, look, he brought about 50 corporate executives with him with the hope that they would either finalize deals or put some new ones together. It looks like that's happening to some extent. And it's a demonstration of the kind of diplomacy that the administration thinks they can do, economic diplomacy, which helps the countries they're visiting and obviously would have a benefit back here.  DICKERSON: Right.  Molly, let's switch back here. Did something turn this week in terms of the investigations and the challenge the president has on the Russia front?  BALL: It's almost hard for me to remember where this week began because every day has felt like a year given the incredible pace of new developments, the explosion of all of these scandals. It's hard to believe that it was less than two weeks ago that Director Comey was fired. But -- so something turned in that things happened and really important things were learned, right? The appointment of the special prosecutor. A very important turn in the saga. But if you're talking about the sentiment of the Congress in particular, I spent most of my week talking to Republicans on Capitol hill and their staff and people around the Congress and there was a feeling that this idea that some sort of dam broke and that they're now ready to really go after the president, that's a little bit overblown. They really do still -- they're very nervous when -- when Anthony was talking about the -- the nervous Trump curious voters out there in the country, that was very much the vibe I got from Capitol Hill Republicans. They really still want him to be something that he hasn't been so far. They are incredibly nervous by all of these things happening. And there was actually a sense of relief at the appointment of a special prosecutor because for a lot of Republicans in Congress, that took a load off of their shoulders, put it in somebody else's hands and now they can all say, we trust him, we respect him, it's up to him and, whew, we don't have to do that.  DICKERSON: Right.  What did you make of the week, Ramesh?  PONNURU: Molly was saying that the last week had felt like a year and I think specifically it felt like the seventh year of an administration where often the Washington atmosphere is one where the White House is enveloped by scandal and it's just sort of consumed by this kind of controversy. What's different, of course, is that this is not even the seventh month of this administration. It hasn't even fully staffed itself. And we've got this kind of -- kind of atmosphere.  But it's a weather pattern that's confined to D.C. I don't think that it is yet true that the country at large feels that way. And one of the things that's happening with congressional Republicans is, look, they've got this feeling in the pit of their stomach. They wish the president would act in different ways, but they are keenly aware that the vast majority of Republican voters across the country, including the voters in their districts, still supports this president. And you will see a pattern where the House Republicans who are in swing seats are more nervous. The senators who are in blue or purple states are more nervous. But the bulk of Republicans don't fit into either of those categories and they're nervous but they're still going to be supporting this president.  DICKERSON: Ed, they're nervous and what about the agenda? Are they nervous about that too?  O'KEEFE: Yes.  DICKERSON: They're nervous about an unpredictable president, but what about the future in terms of getting stuff done?  O'KEEFE: I mean it's important to -- to reiterate what the speaker said at one point or actually twice this week, which was, you know, you may think Washington's consumed by scandal, but we are still doing the nation's business here. There were meetings among Republicans to get ready for health care with the CBO's estimates on that House bill expected this week. That allows the senate to really get to work on health care for real now. They were starting it put together plans for tax reform, which, of course, is really the big item on the wish list for Republicans. But they do worry that the more of this that there is, the worse off they become. There were a few moments this week I think where Republicans -- as much as they -- and I agree with Ramesh, may not take this as a danger sign quite yet, all of them, where I think they realize they have to take it seriously at least. John McCain, Richard Burr, among others, when asked in the immediacy of the aftermath of these stories coming out confronted by reporters and were a bit flippant about it at first. Once they went back to their offices and actually read the stories, they realized how serious it was and went to great lengths to make sure that people understood -- they understood how serious it is. They'll be worrying about that while they're trying to get other things done.  DICKERSON: David, your thoughts on the meeting between the president and the -- and the Russia foreign minister and -- and ambassador. There were two parts of that meeting. One, the president's comments about James Comey. But then there was this question of whether classified intelligence was -- was given to the Russians in the meeting. What do you make of that?  IGNATIUS: The president has the authority to declassify intelligence. That's one of the powers the president has is to share sensitive information with foreign leaders. It's used often to good effect. We need to know more about that. The meeting just felt unseemly. Thee smirking figure of -- of the Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov and the White House kind of dismissing reporters, what are you doing here, I mean this -- this is our country.  But I thought more generally, John, this crazy week with the appointment of Robert Mueller as a special counsel, you could almost hear an exhale. Whoo, you know, here comes somebody who I -- I haven't found anybody who says anything negative about Robert Mueller. He is -- he is an outstanding figure. He's respective. He -- one thing we're going to have to deal with in our business, he doesn't leak. So he's going to conduct this investigation quietly. If there's something that was done wrong, he's going to find it out. If you're sitting in the White House, you have to recognize, this is a serious prosecutor. So I think we're now in -- in what -- in what my friend Steve Hadley likes to call regular order. You know, we're in a more calm, stable period. Steve, a former national security adviser, knows what it's like for things to be bumping around. Less of that maybe now.  DICKERSON: Ramesh, I was struck by Sean Spicer's argument about James Comey. In -- in explaining what the president meant when he was talking to the Russians, he said that -- that because of Comey's grandstanding and politicizing of the investigation into Russia, it made negotiations harder with Russia. What did you make of that?  PONNURU: Well, it seems like an admission against interests on the part of the president. One that would tend to confirm the dark suspicions of his critics that he went after Comey because Comey was getting in the way of his attempts to curry favor with the Russians and was getting closer to finding things out that the president doesn't want to get out. That it doesn't necessarily mean that because we don't -- it's just hard to say, particularly with this president, what things mean.  The other thing that's interesting about this is, this is -- this administration has ping ponged back and forth in its explanations of why it fired James Comey. It's absolutely within the president's authority to do it. Nobody doubt s that. But they keep acting like guilty people in the way they can't settle on one simple explanation for it.  DICKERSON: Right.  All right, we're going to have to leave it there. Thanks to all of you.  And we'll be back in a moment with thoughts on presidents and the press.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: This week, President Trump reflected on his place in history.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: Look at the way I've been treated recently, especially by the media. No politician in history, and I say this with great surety, has been treated worse or more unfairly.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: Actually, there's plenty of competition for that title. President John Adams was labelled a hermaphroditic character by a journalist who was so rough on Adams that he threw him in jail. A newspaper published that Jefferson was dead and when caught in the lie said they were just trying to make readers feel better. Abraham Lincoln was called a gorilla and an idiot and a newspaper called for his assassination.  The press was more partisan then, but even in modern times, President Trump is in good company with feeling aggrieved. Here's a Trump-like comment from a recent president, cleaned up a bit. \"I have fought more darn battles here for more things than any president has in 20 years, and not gotten one darn bit of credit from the knee-jerk liberal press, and I am sick and tired of it. you get no credit around here for fighting and bleeding.\"  Was that Richard Nixon? He did douse the press in expletives, but, no, that was Bill Clinton.  President Lyndon Johnson said the presidency was like being a donkey in a hail storm, sometimes you just have to stand there and take it.  President Donald Trump has challenged so many traditions of the office and public life, but by complaining about his shabby treatment in the press, President Trump is a very traditional president.  Back in a moment.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: That's it for us today. Thanks for watching. Tune in next week for a special Memorial Day book panel. We'll be joined by Sally Mott Freeman, author of \"The Jersey Brothers,' and Lynne Olson, author of \"Last Hope Island.\"  Until then, for FACE THE NATION, I'm John Dickerson.",

            "article_content": "The Trump stock market rally continues to roll on, fueled by excitement over the administration\u2019s bold economic plans. So when Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night, anticipation is high that he\u2019ll provide updates and details on his agenda. But along with the bull market euphoria, an undercurrent of unease is growing that he may not be able to deliver, at least anytime soon. Or if he does, the moves will prove ineffective. Pushing through ambitious legislation never is easy on Capitol Hill, and numerous Wall Street pros fret that President Trump won\u2019t be able to surmount a host of obstacles.\u00a0 The prospect of Trumpian economic stimulus has helped buoy the stock market since Election Day. \u201cPeople want to believe,\u201d said Alfredo Martinez, chief investment officer of HighTower Boca Raton. \u201cMaybe too much is priced in,\u201d meaning investors\u2019 hopes may have exceeded what\u2019s politically possible.\u00a0 The stimulus plan and regulatory cutback the administration aims for, Douglas Kass of hedge fund Seabreeze Partners told Politico, is \u201clikely to provide a lesser and later contribution to economic and profit growth than the consensus expects. I don\u2019t think it should be friendly to the markets.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 To Larry Fink, head of asset management at Black Rock (BLK), a delay in the Trump plan would harm the stock market. \u201cI see a lot of dark shadows that could impact the direction of the marketplace,\u201d he said at a recent conference. Of course, when Mr. Trump addresses Congress Tuesday night, any optimism about economic stimulus might trigger an upward move in stocks on Wednesday. The question is whether the market will have staying power if his proposals bog down.\u00a0 Dealing with the intricacy of the changes that Mr. Trump wants -- involving taxes, public works spending, health care and the federal budget -- is challenge enough. To make the problem even more formidable, add in a stalwart cadre of budget hawks, meaning congressional Republicans who are alarmed at the growing federal budget deficit, and a politically powerful force of special-interest lobbyists. On Monday, the White house released a budget outline that intends to cut domestic spending to make way for higher military outlays -- and presumably give the president some leeway with the budget hawks to get his stimulus program through. Here are the possible pitfalls that could waylay Mr. Trump\u2019s ambitions: Tax overhaul.\u00a0This is the linchpin of the entire program. Reducing federal taxes and eliminating loopholes has widespread support in Congress, particularly among the president\u2019s fellow Republicans. The trouble is that enormous legions of lobbyists are mobilizing to save their favorite provisions, ranging from homebuilders to importers to private equity firms. These groups also are generous campaign contributors, so lawmakers pay attention to their views. A key player in this drama is House Speaker Paul Ryan, who could be Mr. Trump\u2019s best ally on economic stimulus or end up as a brake on his efforts. The Wisconsin Republican has his own tax plan, and the White House is putting the finishing touches on its version. \u00a0\u00a0 Ryan\u2019s plan is controversial stuff that already has aroused staunch opposition to some of its provisions. He envisions doubling the standard tax deduction, for instance. This would shrink the benefit to homeowners who itemize their tax returns and deduct mortgage interest from incomes.\u00a0 Similarly, Ryan wants to enact a \u201cborder adjustment tax,\u201d which would slap a 20 percent levy on imports, with exports owing nothing. And there\u2019s the call to squelch the lower rate on \u201ccarried interest,\u201d the fees that private equity managers charge clients. \u00a0 The Ryan plan, a lot of which Mr. Trump has embraced earlier, is far from a slam dunk, especially in the Senate. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, has said only 10 Republican senators are in favor of the border tax. Infrastructure spending. Mr. Trump seeks a $1 trillion program to rebuild the nation\u2019s aged and deteriorated roads, bridges, harbors, tunnels and other parts of the physical framework so vital to the economy\u2019s functioning. The idea is a winner with the public: A Gallup poll last year found that 75 percent of Americans agree that more federal money should go to infrastructure overhaul.\u00a0 While the administration hasn\u2019t yet fleshed out all the details of its plan, its first task is to reassure the budget hawks that the public works spending won\u2019t deepen government red ink -- the national debt is expected to top $20 trillion very soon. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, has said that he wanted to avoid \u201ca $1 trillion stimulus.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 To the budget hawks, infrastructure spending too often means money-wasting boondoggles, and they blocked Barack Obama\u2019s efforts to pump up public works outlays.\u00a0 For instance, New York City\u2019s long-delayed Second Avenue subway, which finally opened New Year\u2019s Eve after almost 10 years of construction, costed $1.7 billion per kilometer of track, the most expensive in history for a rail project.\u00a0 During last year\u2019s election campaign, Mr. Trump talked about partnering with private developers, using tax credits as an incentive, to build a chunk of the projects. He has spoken of tapping fresh tax revenue from faster energy production -- which he expects from removing regulatory hurdles -- and from bringing back corporate cash stashed overseas.\u00a0 Such an approach has drawn fire from Democrats, who contend that private developers would only want to invest in things that bring them a return, such as a toll road. They wouldn\u2019t be interested in mass transit and water systems, Democrats charge. \u201cA program of tax cuts isn\u2019t going to get the job done, no matter how large,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said.\u00a0 Health care revamp.\u00a0The White House and congressional Republicans have indicated a desire to deal first with repealing and replacing Obamacare. Since its enactment in 2010, the health law has been No. 1 on the GOP hit list, with numerous votes to undo it passing in a Republican-controlled Congress, only to be vetoed by President Obama. But now, Republicans are in charge on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, so they own the issue.\u00a0 Most of them want to keep popular facets of the Affordable Care Act, such as its ban on insurers refusing to cover people with preexisting medical conditions. And they want to end unpopular features, such as mandates that individuals obtain health insurance and that large employers offer it, with penalties for noncompliance. The risk, though, is that Republicans will end up slashing or outright removing coverage for some 20 million Obamacare beneficiaries -- a large number of them working-class Americans who voted for Mr. Trump. At town hall meetings in their districts, Republican lawmakers recently have run into raucous opposition to dismantling Obamacare.\u00a0 Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week, the president said the law covered too few people and removed coverage for those who had plans that didn\u2019t meet ACA crieria. \u201cThe bottom line -- we\u2019re changing it,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make it much better. We\u2019re going to make it less expensive. We\u2019re going make it much better.\u201d He also said on Monday that he\u2019ll be offering more specifics in his address to Congress Tuesday evening.\u00a0 Budget deficit. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan organization that opposes government fiscal excess, has warned that Mr. Trump\u2019s ambitious plans will radically enlarge the federal budget deficit. At this point, the debt held by the public is 77 percent of U.S. GDP, twice as large as the historical average. To budget hawks, this situation is a clear and present danger. Under current law, that debt-GDP ratio will reach 89 percent in 10 years, the group said -- and if Mr. Trump gets all he wants in terms of stimulus, it could go much higher. \u201cPolicymakers need to reduce the debt, not add to it,\u201d the CRFB said in a statement. To Mr. Trump, however, his stimulus will yield a higher economic growth rate, which in turn will generate more tax revenue and thus won\u2019t produce a bloated national debt. Democrats respond that previous such exercises -- namely Republican tax cuts under Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush -- didn\u2019t deliver the promised bonanza and did lead to more debt.\u00a0 At the same time, Mr. Trump has vowed to keep his hands off two major entitlements for older citizens: Social Security and Medicare, which together with Medicaid (government-subsidized health care for the poor) ate up almost half of federal spending in 2016, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Nevertheless, the president remains undaunted about the prospects for the U.S. under his plans. \u201cGreat optimism for future of U.S. business, AND JOBS,\u201d he tweeted recently, noting that the market continued to climb. \u201cBig tax & regulation cuts coming!\u201d\u00a0 Larry Light is a veteran financial editor and reporter who has worked for the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Business Week, Money, AdviceIQ and Newsday.",

The fast food executive announced his withdrawal in a statement Wednesday afternoon. \u201cAfter careful consideration and discussions with my family, I am withdrawing my nomination for Secretary of Labor,\u201d Puzder wrote. \u201cI am honored to have been considered by President Donald Trump to lead the Department of Labor and put America\u2019s workers and businesses back on a path to sustainable prosperity.\u201d President Donald Trump has insulted everyone from\u00a0federal judges, to fellow Republicans, to\u00a0Meryl Streep. He\u2019s even taken a shot at the Pope. But he\u2019s seemed to bend over backward to avoid criticizing\u00a0Vladimir Putin. \u201cObviously there is something going on here,\u201d said Peter Wehner, and he wants to know why. Wehner worked for Ronald Reagan and both Bush administrations writing speeches and generating policy ideas. Wehner is now with the conservative\u00a0Ethics and Public Policy Center. When the president spoke of\u00a0illegal leaks of classified information, he was right, of course.\u00a0 \u201cThese people have committed a potential federal felony in talking to the reporters, and that ought to disturb us,\u201d says CBS News senior national security analyst Fran Townsend, who was Homeland Security Adviser under President George W. Bush. \u201cThere\u2019s sort of a base level of this we\u2019ve come to expect out of Washington.\u201d But the amount of classified information that\u2019s being leaked right now? Townsend says \u201cfrankly, I find it stunning.\u201d\u00a0 Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has embarked on his first official trip to Bonn, Germany for the G-20 Foreign Ministers\u2019 Summit where he will dive into diplomacy with a series of group sessions and one-on-one meetings.\u00a0 As President Trump has repeatedly cast his administration as one that will ring in a new era for U.S.-Russian relations, all eyes will be watching as Tillerson meets with with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov for the first time. In meeting with Lavrov, Tillerson will advocate for pragmatic and constructive cooperation where interests overlap, according to senior State Department officials. Countering ISIS and terrorism are possible avenues for cooperation.\u00a0 President Trump has offered the job of national security adviser to Vice Admiral Robert Harward, according to sources close to the situation, CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett reports. President Trump\u00a0launched a Twitter offensive against the U.S. intelligence community, following a report released Tuesday night that some campaign officials had repeated contact with Russian intelligence officers before the 2016 presidential election. The president pilloried the New York Times report, which cited intelligence sources, as \u201cnon-sense\u201d and a \u201ccover-up\u201d for Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed presidential campaign. He also accused members of the intelligence community of \u201cillegally\u201d handing over information to the news media. Meanwhile, Democratic senators\u00a0planned an emergency meeting\u00a0Wednesday morning to discuss the latest Russia reports and Michael Flynn\u2019s resignation. Sources tell Major Garrett that Mr. Trump has offered the post of National Security Adviser to Robert Harward, a former Navy SEAL and former deputy commander of U.S. Central Command. Harward has not yet accepted the job. Garrett also reports that Labor Secretary nominee Andy Puzder is expected to withdraw. News: Source very close to Labor Secretary nominee Andy Puzder tells me he expects Puzder to withdraw. \"He's very tired of the abuse.\" President Trump called on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Wednesday to temporarily freeze construction of settlements, which its government has been rapidly expanding in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. At\u00a0a joint news conference between the two leaders\u00a0from East Room of the White House, Mr. Trump said that he is asking Israel to \u201chold back on settlements for a little bit.\u201d Netanyahu responded, \u201cwe\u2019ll try.\u201d Mr. Trump then commented that his reaction didn\u2019t sound too optimistic. The prime minister was later asked to respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s request, and he said that the issue of settlements is \u201cnot the core of the conflict, nor does it drive the conflict.\u201d President Trump welcomes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House. They\u2019ll held a joint news conference at noon, shortly after Netanyahu arrived.\u00a0 Iranian aggression in the Middle East, the Iranian nuclear deal, Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the conflict in Syria are issues that will likely dominate the agenda when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meets with President Trump at the White House Wednesday. The visit will be key in reviving the U.S.-Israel relationship, which experienced one of its lowest points less than two months ago\u00a0when the Obama administration abstained during a U.N. Security Council vote on a resolution that demanded an end to Israeli settlement construction. --By Rebecca Shabad The Trump administration suggested Tuesday that peace between the Israelis and Palestinians may not come in the form of a two-state solution - a position that could represent a dramatic shift from former President Barack Obama, who said\u00a0he saw no alternative. Speaking to reporters ahead of President Donald Trump\u2019s meeting Wednesday with\u00a0Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a senior White House official said Mr. Trump is eager to begin facilitating a peace deal between the two sides and hoping to bring them together soon. Palestinians are puzzled by this suggestion. 11:50 a.m. Netanyahu arrives 12 p.m. Joint news conference 12:40 p.m. Oval Office meeting 1:45 p.m. Lunch The president host the Rubios for dinner this evening. This comes a day after the Christies came for lunch. The president met with retailers to talk about the challenges facing them. He told them he\u2019s cutting regulations \u201cby massive amounts\u201d and \u201cin just about every industry.\u201d He also mentioned a plan to change the tax code would be coming soon. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a massive tax plan that is coming along really well,\u201d he told the retailers. \u201cIt will be submitted in the not too distant future. It will be not only good and simpler, it will be, you\u2019re talking about big numbers of savings.\u201d \u00a0And, he added that he planned to lower rates \u201cvery, very substantially for virtually everybody in every category. Including personal and business.\u201d \u00a0Here\u2019s the list of participants: Nominee Neil Gorsuch meets more senators -- Johnny Isakson at 10:30 a.m., Patrick Leahy at 11:30 a.m. and Jeanne Shaheen at 2 p.m. Late last night,\u00a0National Security Adviser Michael Flynn resigned.\u00a0 Flynn said in his resignation letter that during the course of his duties as incoming national security adviser he held \u201cnumerous\u201d phone calls with foreign counterparts, ministers and ambassadors that were \u201cto facilitate a smooth transition and begin to build the necessary relationships\u201d between President Trump, his advisers and foreign leaders. \u201cUnfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador,\u201d he said. \u201cI have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology.\u201d Sunday, on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d White House policy adviser Stephen Miller assessed the administration\u2019s ability to handle the frantic pace:\u00a0\u201cto say that we\u2019re in control would be a substantial understatement.\u201d\u00a0 Today, National Security adviser Michael Flynn resigned. Sunday, a friend of the president, Newsmax editor Chris Ruddy who had\u00a0just shared a late night drink at the White House, went on CNN\u2019s\u00a0Reliable Sources\u00a0and said Chief of Staff Reince Priebus was in over his head. Administration-friendly Breitbart\u00a0reported Tuesday that a list of possible replacements for Priebus is being evaluated as a part of a staff shake-up. The reports of such a shakeup are not just appearing in administration-allied organs, but also\u00a0here,\u00a0here,\u00a0here\u00a0and\u00a0here. A look at\u00a0the developments in Flynn\u2019s recent past\u00a0-- from his travel to Russia months before the election through his resignation just over three weeks into his tenure as national security adviser The White House is\u00a0considering three candidates\u00a0to serve as President Trump\u2019s national security adviser after\u00a0Gen. Michael Flynn\u2019s resignation from that position\u00a0Monday night. Officials have floated three names, including retired Lt. General Joseph Keith Kellogg, Jr., who\u2019s been named acting national security adviser in the interim. \u00a0Former CIA Director David Petraeus and Vice Admiral Bob Harward, who\u2019s a retired Navy SEAL and a former deputy commander of CENTCOM, or U.S. Central Command, are the other two names. Canadian citizens Fadwa Alaoui and her cousin Fadela Boutaleb were off on one of their quick shopping trips across the border, this time to celebrate Alaoui\u2019s 5-year-old son\u2019s last chemo treatment. But\u00a0when they arrived at the U.S. border in Highgate Springs, Vermont, the women say they were asked repeated questions about their religion, illegal under us law. Hillary Clinton late Monday\u00a0weighed in on Twitter\u00a0on the resignation of Gen. Michael Flynn as President Trump\u2019s national security adviser. The 2016 Democratic presidential nominee retweeted a tweet from her longtime aide, Philippe Reines, who joked about Flynn\u2019s situation, alluding to him and his son spreading the conspiracy theory known as \u201cPizzaGate\u201d that accused Clinton and her former campaign manager of running a child sex slave ring out of Comet Ping Pong, a pizza restaurant near Washington, D.C. Sen. Armed Services chairman\u00a0John McCain responded\u00a0to \u201cthis Flynn situation\u201d at the Capitol today. \u201cI think there is significant dysfunction in the national security apparatus of the Trump administration,\u201d McCain said, according to CBS News\u2019 Alan He. \u201cWhen you see they don\u2019t know who\u2019s in charge, this Flynn situation, the whole environment is one of dysfunction in the Trump administration as far as national security concerned.\u201d Earlier, House Speaker Paul Ryan said that Mr. Trump made the right call on Flynn. \u201cI think the president made the right decision to ask for his resignation. You cannot have a national security adviser misleading the vice president and others,\u201d he told reporters, according to CBS News\u2019 Catherine Reynolds. \u201cSo I think the president was right to ask for his resignation, and I believe it was the right thing to do.\u201d \u00a0 The president has lunch with Chris and Mary Pat Christie, 12:30 p.m. President Trump signs H.J.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel has sparked protests across the Middle East. The move made good on one of Mr. Trump's campaign promises, but also reversed decades of policy that aimed to balance the interests of Palestinians and Israelis in the region. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley\u00a0joined \"Face the Nation\" Sunday to answer questions about Mr. Trump's decision. We also discussed North Korea. What follows is a transcript of the interview with Haley that airs Sunday, December 10, 2017, on \"Face the Nation.\" JOHN DICKERSON: We turn now to U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. She joins us from New York. Welcome, Madam Ambassador. I want to start, well, you've seen the violence in response to the U.S. decision on the embassy. There's a lot of tension in the Middle East. With all that's going on and all that the U.S. has to deal with there, why was this a priority, and in America's national interest, to make this move right now? NIKKI HALEY: Good morning, John. Well first of all, this is a move the American people have asked for, for 22 years. And six months ago, the Senate overwhelmingly, again, asked for the embassy to be moved. And I think you have to look at the fact that every presidential candidate, Republican or Democrat, has all said that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and the embassy should be moved. President Trump's the only one that had the courage to actually do that. And so what this does is, basically, do what we do in almost every other country, which is put the embassy in the capital city. And Jerusalem is where the prime minister is, the president is, the parliament, the Supreme Court. It makes sense for our embassy to be there. JOHN DICKERSON: Given all that's happening in the world, why is it a priority to do this right now? And why is it worth paying the price of the increased violence? NIKKI HALEY: Because it's the right thing to do. It is absolutely the right thing to do. And look, for the last 22 years, everyone around every president has said, \"Just wait, just wait, just wait.\" And President Trump's not going to wait anymore. JOHN DICKERSON: But explain why it's the right thing to do. NIKKI HALEY: It's the right thing to do because it's just reality. Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. They have said that. When the American people say they want something, it is -- it's their will that we're supposed to follow. JOHN DICKERSON: But in this case, the U.S. is, critics believe, changing its role. It's stepping in more forcefully on the side of Israel, and that that sends a signal that it's not going to make things better. So explain how we get from this move to a better outcome and whether all this violence isn't going to delay a better outcome. NIKKI HALEY: Well, first of all, I think that when you recognize the truth, when both parties recognize reality, peace comes. And that's just -- that's just the true reality of the situation. We are living in the reality that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. But if you notice when the president spoke, he made it very clear. He didn't talk about boundaries, he didn't talk about borders, he didn't get into any of that because the final status of Jerusalem is between the Palestinians and the Israelis. It's not for the Americans to decide. So we are doing what we do in every other country. Israel should be no different. And then we're going to continue to support the peace process. You know, courage breeds leadership. What you saw was a courageous move by the president. And of course any time you have to use courage, any time you have to go against the status quo, you're going to have people saying the sky is falling. But the sky is not falling. If anything, what we're going to see is both sides are going to come to the table. They're going to decide what they think Jerusalem should look like. And we're going to support that process. JOHN DICKERSON: Of course, people would -- the rebuttal would be that aggressive moves in the Middle East have often cost the United States a lot in blood and treasure. Let me ask you this question on a negotiating standpoint. One of the criticisms is the president gave up a bargaining chip that could be used in negotiation. Another view is the president has now given the Israelis something, and now he can ask something from them in return. Which of those two do you subscribe to? NIKKI HALEY: So neither one of those is right. The president took Jerusalem off the table. That's what he did. Because that's something that we have always, people have said, used that as a bargaining chip. Let's be clear. The last 22 years, that was a bargaining chip, and it got us nowhere closer to peace. What he did was take it off the table. Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. Take that off the table. Tell both sides to come together and say, \"Okay, you decide how you want to split up Jerusalem. You decide if you're going to create boundaries or borders there.\" And let them decide. There are going to be naysayers, John, that say, \"You shouldn't do this, you shouldn't do this.\" But they also thought -- they also questioned the president when he first decided to strike for chemical weapons in Syria, and that was true leadership. They said the same thing when we started to push North Korea and push sanctions. That was true leadership. This, again, will go down in history to show he made the move that finally got the two parties to come to the table. And-- JOHN DICKERSON: Let me-- NIKKI HALEY: --it's okay for naysayers, but we know, at the end of the day, this was the right thing to do. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about North Korea. Lindsay Graham, South Carolina Senator, said the U.S. should start moving civilians out of South Korea. What's your response to that? NIKKI HALEY: Well, I think we're watching North Korea very carefully. And, you know, if you look at the last ballistic missile launch, it had advanced quite a bit, compared to the missile before. And it's a concern. And what we will tell you is North Korea is the biggest threat we have right now, but we're not going to let that stop us. We're going to continue to be forceful. We're going to continue to have the international community join us, as they have. And we're going to make sure that we do everything we can to denuclearize North Korea. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about a domestic issue here. There's a cultural shift going on in America right now. You saw it, three members of Congress kicked out of Congress because of sexual behavior, misdeeds. You were the first woman Senator of South Carolina. What do you think of this cultural moment that's happening? NIKKI HALEY: You know, I am incredibly proud of the women who have come forward. I'm proud of their strength. I'm proud of their courage. And I think that the idea that this is happening, I think it will start to bring a conscience to the situation, not just in politics, but in, you know, we've seen in Hollywood and in every industry. And I think the time has come. JOHN DICKERSON: Of course I'm wrong, you were the governor, first governor of South Carolina. Given that consciousness, how do you think people should assess the accusers of the president? NIKKI HALEY: Well, I mean, you know, the same thing, is women who accuse anyone should be heard. They should be heard and they should be dealt with. And I think we heard from them prior to the election. And I think any woman who has felt violated or felt mistreated in any way, they have every right to speak up. JOHN DICKERSON: And does the election mean that's a settled issue? NIKKI HALEY: You know, that's for the people to decide. I know that he was elected. But, you know, women should always feel comfortable coming forward. And we should all be willing to listen to them. JOHN DICKERSON: Ambassador Nikki Haley, thanks so much for being with us. NIKKI HALEY: Okay. Thanks, John.",

            "article_content": "Editor's note: This story originally ran on the 50th anniversary of JFK's assassination. It has been half a century, and so many lifetimes ago. Yet the images from November 1963 remain haunting, blurred into our national consciousness. Fifty years later, CBS News relives that drama -- in the moment -- as it unfolded before a world in shock. Bob Schieffer | CBS News: When the President came to Texas, I was a young newspaper reporter covering the crime beat for the Fort Worth Star Telegram. With JFK and his elegant wife Jackie heading our way, for us it was the biggest story of the year. Little could we know history was about to be made. Time stopped cold, in that dark moment, on a Dallas street. The horror of the assassin's shots shattered dreams, and echoed through the decades, coloring our politics, and lives. It was also a watershed moment for American television news, led by CBS News anchorman Walter Cronkite.With the death of a president came the birth of live coverage. America shared a national tragedy, as it happened. Because of television we thought we knew JFK and his family more intimately than any of his predecessors, the man friends simply called, \"Jack.\" Voice of John F. Kennedy: I was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1917. I have eight brothers and sisters and they...I'm the second oldest, And it was a great pleasure growing up in a large family. I think it makes a tremendous difference. Voice of Rose Kennedy: His father would go out and watch the sailboats...and then he'd say, \"Why are your sails flapping while the other one was straight? And the other one won the race and you didn't.... If you're gonna race, why do it right and come in a winner. Second place is no good. Sandy Socolow | Walter Cronkite's producer: John F. Kennedy ... was brought up in an ultra-rich way. Very well educated. ... Very good-looking. Very personable. ... He was extraordinarily self confident. Schieffer: Sure he was playing the media. ... But the fact is he was just so good at it... that it worked. ... And who could blame him? 1960 Kennedy-Nixon presidential debate rehearsal: Kennedy:It's a pleasure to be here tonight to participate in this program which opens up a series of discussions... is that about the right tone of voice. Richard Nixon: Think I better shave. Walter Cronkite on the air 1960: And the popular vote ... 84 percent of the precincts counted now ... give Kennedy just a little margin over 50 percent of the vote... Nixon almost 50 percent of the vote. One of the closest elections in our nation's history has been record in this year of 1960. Walter Cronkite | CBS News (1993):  Kennedy -- seemed to be -- leading us into a new era of - of -- youthful exuberance ... over the fun of life, the fun a country could have being itself, being important in the world.  We were dancing on clouds. Schieffer: It was just the difference in night and day.He was the Technicolor President and we had sort of seen the presidency in black and white up until that point. ...Suddenly we had this young handsome president and this gorgeous wife and these beautiful children ... and he is the first president that we came to really know, and we came to know his family and that was because of television. Schieffer: In those days presidents didn't travel very much and it was a major event. ... They decided to come to Texas because they thought they could raise money there. ... The people were so excited. Schieffer: The relationship between Lyndon Johnson and John Kennedy was very complex.They were partners. Were they ever friends? Robert Caro | Author andhistorian: Not really. Schieffer: They decided to fly from Fort Worth to Dallas, which is literally...only 30 miles. They flew over. Air Force One lands at Love Field. Bob Huffaker | Former KRLD radio reporter: Well the day began gray and cold... there was a misting rain falling and the temperature was cold. Suddenly at mid-morning the skies opened up and it was a beautiful ... blue ... spring-like day. Caro: We see it, the great plane is gleaming silver in the background, everything is bright under a bright Texas sun, and you hear the television announcer \"There she is...\" Reporter: ...and there's Mrs. Kennedy, the first lady stepping from the plane. Wearing a bright pink suit with a dark fur collar and a matching pink hat, and the president wearing a dark suit.  Caro: They hand Jackie at the bottom of the stairs this bouquet of roses. Reporter: She does makes a very striking picture as she clutches the huge bouquet of bright red roses... Caro: He takes Jackie and they walk along the fence. And someone said there was no brighter moment in the Kennedy presidency then that moment at Love Field in Dallas. Schieffer: They decided because the skies had cleared to take the bubble-top off the presidential limousine. Reporter: And the president will be riding in the open ... that car was flown in here last night from Washington ... Huffaker: The crowd cheered as the President and his beautiful wife came past us. Reporter: And now the ticker tape and uh ... other confetti and such is beginning to flow from the windows and the crowd at our point is surging forward. There is a big cheer going up... Schieffer: As they turned to go into the main downtown area, Nelly Connally, who was John Connally's wife ... Governor Connally's wife, turned to the president and said, \"Well Mr. President, you can't say Dallas doesn't love you.\" Reporter: ... and here is the President of the United States ... and what a crowd... what a tremendous welcome he is getting now. Huffaker: The crowd just surged out from their points on the sidewalk and filled the street from curb to curb Caro: Then they turn off Main Street into this open grassy area, Dealey Plaza, and there's a sharp cracking sound. ...John Connally, I remember saying to me, \"I was a hunter. I knew the moment I heard it, it was the crack of a hunting rifle.\" Abraham Zapruder film: I was down on this freeway early ... and even the freeway was jammed pack with spectators waiting their chance to see the president as he made his way toward the trade mart ... it appears as though something has happened in the motorcade route ... something I repeat has happened in the motorcade route. Schieffer: Well, it was just pandemonium. It was just a terrible moment. Caro: So the three cars -- the cars with President Kennedy, the Secret Service car and Johnson's car squeal up the ramp to an expressway ... and then off the expressway and into the emergency bay at Parkland Hospital. Reporter: There has been a shooting ... Parkland Hospital has been advised to stand by for a severe gunshot wound. Cronkite (1993): Looking right at it when the bells rang, five bells for a bulletin ... Shots rang out while the president's motorcade drove through the streets of Dallas ... And with that I turned around and shouted: \"Let's get on the air, lets get on the air!\" Well in those days we didn't keep a camera hot. Socolow: And he couldn't get on the air on television. You never saw Cronkite. You saw a card on the screen. Cronkite on the air: Here is a bulletin from CBS News. In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas. Huffaker: This was the day that the news went live on television. Cronkite on the air: The first reports say the President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting. Schieffer: People were crying. People were just walking around with a blank look on their face. \"What does this mean? What's happened?\" Walter Cronkite on the air: This is Walter Cronkite in our newsroom. There has been an attempt, as perhaps you know now, on the life of President Kennedy. He was wounded in an automobile driving from Dallas Airport into downtown Dallas, along with Governor Connally of Texas. They've been taken to Parkland Hospital where their condition is as yet unknown. Dr. Kenneth Salyer: I'm Dr. Kenneth Salyer. And on Nov. 22, 1963, I was on neurosurgery call at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, Texas. ... A nurse ran into the room and said \"the President's been shot.\" Schieffer: And what did you do? Dr. Salyer: When I walked in, my colleagues were at the top of the table in trauma room one ... The president ... had a large, huge jagged injury of the right side of his skull, with pieces missing.   Schieffer: Was he alive? Dr. Salyer: He was still breathing ... and we were trying to intubate him, get a tube into his windpipe, trachea. ... But it wouldn't go past this wound. Cronkite on the air: We have not been told their condition. At Dallas, in a downtown hotel room, a group had been gathered to hear President Kennedy and was waiting his arrival. Let's switch down there now where Eddie Barker of KRLD is on the air. Eddie Barker reporting: As you can imagine there are many stories that are coming in now as to the actual condition of the president. One is that he is dead. This cannot be confirmed.  Schieffer: Did you think this was survivable? Dr. Salyer: I didn't make that assessment at the moment I was taking care of him. ... This is a major, high velocity injury. Huffaker: As I was standing in the crowd, two priests brushed past me... Voice of Bob Huffaker | KRLD Radio: President Kennedy is on the inside of Parkland Hospital and two priests have just been sent in to the room with the president. Dr. Salyer: As I looked up in the room, in the far back of the room is Mrs. Kennedy. ... blood splattered on her dress.But she was just observing everything, wasn't talking. Cronkite (1993): My God, who, what, why?Surely the president won't die.I mean, that can't be. He won't die, surely. Schieffer: How long did that go on? Dr. Salyer: It seemed like forever. But it was really probably less than 30 minutes. Cronkite on the air:From Dallas, Texas, the flash apparently official: President Kennedy died at 1:00 p.m. central standard time, 2:00 eastern time, some 38 minutes ago[takes off glasses, pauses.] Socolow: He stopped in his tracks. ... tough man who understood the momentousness of what he was charged with doing. Cronkite (1993): It was disbelief that it could have happened, that it had happened. Dr. Salyer: As I was looking at Mrs. Kennedy and everyone started to exit the room and she came over. We had covered him up ... and she laid on his chest. And took a ring off, and put onto his finger. ... And I thought it was a very touching moment. Socolow: As the news spread people stopped what they were doing to go to the radio, mostly, but also to television. ... It was the first instance of wall-to-wall news coverage. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.: It was one of the most shocking things I'd ever heard.Frankly I was very upset and couldn't adjust to it and could hardly believe it in the beginning. Penny Robinson to Charles Kuralt: Nobody could believe it.It's too... there's no words to express what happened at all. Charles Kuralt | CBS News 1963: It's true that there are no words to express it and that feeling is obvious all around us on the streets of Los Angeles. Richard Nixon: Today millions of people throughout the world are trying to find words adequate to express their grief and their sympathy to his family. Man on the street, NYC:We are sorry.Deeply moved over this incident.This is a dark day in the history of America. Edward Kennedy: I do want to say how appreciate both my parents have been for the tremendous outpouring of thoughtfulness and prayers that have come from all Americans from all parts of the country. Man on the street: Someone to do this must be mentally deranged.No clear-thinking human person would ever think of doing something like that. Dan Rather | CBS News Dallas reporting: These are scenes at a building across the street from the scene where President Kennedy was shot. ... Some empty cartridges have been found in that building. ... Perhaps out of one of those open windows is where the assassin of President Kennedy is believed to have fired the fatal shots. Dan Rather (2008): After the initial hammer to the heart that an assassination of the president, the reality of that sinks in, then it was \"focus on the story.\" Because if you don't do that, then you're at some risk of just falling apart emotionally. Cronkite on the air: In Dallas -- a Dallas policeman just a short while ago was shot and killed while chasing a suspect. Schieffer: And a policeman named J.D. Tippit saw a man walking down the street. And called him over to the police car. And when he did, Oswald walked up and shot him at point-blank range. Dan Rather reporting: This is 24 year-old Lee H. Oswald. ... Now here is the gun police say was used to kill the president. ... Oswald first was charged with killing the policeman, police say that have at least one eyewitness to that. Oswald: I really don't know what this situation is about.Nobody has told me anything except I'm accused of, uh, murdering a policeman. Reporter:Did you kill the president? Oswald: No, I have not been charged with that. In fact nobody has said that to me yet. The first thing I heard about it was when the newspaper reporters in the hall asked me that question. Schieffer: And I drove down to The Star Telegram... And a woman called in and said, \"Is there anyone there who can give me a ride to Dallas?\" And I said, \"Well lady, you know, we're not running a taxi here. And beside, the president has been shot.\" And she said, \"Yes ... I think my son is the one that they've arrested.\" Marguerite Oswald: I spoke a few words to Lee and he says \"Mother don't worry about a thing ...\" Schieffer: And it was Lee Harvey Oswald's mother, Marguerite Oswald. We wrote down the address, and went out and picked up her.And we drove her to Dallas ...It was my first really big scoop. Caro: The agents say to Johnson, \"We've gotta get out of here.\" Johnson says, \"No, I'm not leaving without Mrs. Kennedy.\" They say to him, \"Mrs. Kennedy won't leave without her husband's body.\" He says, \"then we'll go to Air Force One and we'll wait there until she comes aboard with the coffin. But I'm not leaving Dallas without her.\" Dan Rather reporting: Mrs. Kennedy back the way she had come, in an ambulance now which bore her husband's body. Caro: When they get Johnson on the plane they draw the window shades. They're afraid of snipers. Nobody knows at this moment if this was the beginning of a conspiracy. Schieffer: Air Force One is still on the ground at Love Field. Johnson has literally taken command? Caro: He walks into the center of the room and begins giving orders ... who he wants there.Particularly he wants Mrs. Kennedy there. Cronkite on the air: We just got word from our reporters out there at the airport ... that Lyndon B.Johnson has been sworn in as the President of the United States. Caro: Mrs. Kennedy has come aboard with her husband's coffin, and it's put in the rear section. Schieffer: Mrs. Kennedy would not change clothes.She said \"I want them to see what they have done to him.\" Caro: Lady Bird Johnson says, \"That immaculate woman -- her skirt was caked with blood.\" And Lyndon Johnson asks her to be present at the ceremony, and she was to say, \"For the sake of history I should.\" Schieffer: The picture said exactly what Johnson wanted it to say. And that is \"The United States is still on course. We have had the death of a President. But the country and the constitution still lives.\" Robert Caro: Lyndon Johnson takes the oath of office on Air Force One. His hand comes down, he says: \"Now let's get airborne.\" On this flight across the United States, you have, this plane carrying two presidents, one dead and one alive. No matter how long America's history is, this will always be one of the most dramatic and defining moments in it. Reporter: President Lyndon Johnson has arrived at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. This is film, or tape, of that arrival. (Background: \"Live, live, live!\") It is live. It is live, right now. Caro: And this great silver plane comes gliding out of the darkness. Reporter: This is one of the most unique and tragic moments in the history... Caro: The minute the front door opens, Robert Kennedy runs up the front steps to the plane. Pushes past Lyndon Johnson without even looking at him. Doesn't acknowledge him. And, comes up to Jackie, and says: \"Jackie, I'm here.\" Reporter: I'm watching a turn-over in government, at the highest office. And now we can see what we believe to be a coffin containing the body of President Kennedy being moved from Air Force One. Caro: And when the coffin comes out, right behind it, are Jackie Kennedy and Bobby Kennedy. Reporter: This is a scene at Andrews Air Force Base. With a casket of -- carrying the body of President Kennedy is being transferred to an ambulance. Socolow: Nobody understood, at the time, what this event meant for television news. Television news, suddenly became important. Reporter: Behind it comes, Mrs. Kennedy and Robert Kennedy.... And now President Johnson is coming down the ramp, out the back door. Schieffer: Johnson had this innate sense of command. He knew that the country had to know that there was continuity. It was a sad moment, but it was a great moment in the history of the country because it said: there is still a president. Caro: There is no presidential podium, there's no presidential seal, all they've done is put this bunch of microphones on the bare tarmac. President Lyndon Johnson: We have suffered a loss that cannot be weighed. For me, it is a deep personal tragedy. I know that the world shares the sorrow that Mrs. Kennedy and her family bear. I will do my best, that is all I can do. I ask for your help ...and God's. Schieffer: The ... speech was poignant, but it was brilliant in its brevity. Cronkite (1993): We had a whole new world out there. Lyndon Johnson was not going to be John Fitzgerald Kennedy by any means. Reporter: At 4:30 this morning Mr. Kennedy's body was returned to the White house. George Herman was on hand when it arrived. George Herman reporting: President John F. Kennedy comes back to the White House for the last time. Cronkite on the air: There will be a particularly poignant time for the Kennedy family next week.The two Kennedy children, uh, both have birthday's next week. John,3, November the 25th, and Caroline, 6, on November the 27th. An entire nation has almost come to a stop today, uh, in the wake of the horrible news. Huffaker: I had never seen anything like I saw when I arrived on that Saturday morning after the assassination. The entire hallway was filled with, probably, perhaps as many as a hundred reporters. Cronkite on the air: We reported to you on the arrest of that individual in Dallas. He is being grilled now.He is said to be 24-years-old. The name has been given for him by Dallas Police as Leo H. Oswald. Reporter: Has he confessed sir? Has he made a statement? Official: He has not confessed.He has made no statement.Charges of murder have been accepted against him. Dan Rather reporting: Oswald, has admitted nothing. After further questioning, he was formally charged with the President's death. That gun is a powerful military rifle, which police found in the building from which the President is believed to have been shot. Schieffer: Lee Harvey Oswald was on the sixth floor of the Texas school book depository when he shot the President. He had a birds-eye view. If you go and look out that window, where he was, you realize you didn't have to be a very good shot. Dan Rather reporting: Lee Oswald espouser of leftist causes: an active member of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, an avowed admirer of Russia and of Cuba's Fidel Castro, a man who once lived in Russia. Reporter: What did you do in Russia? Oswald: A policeman hit me. Huffaker: We knew that Oswald was the most hated suspect, of the 20th Century. Reporter: Chief, do you have any concern for the safety of your prisoner In due of the high feeling among the people of Dallas over the assassination of the president.  Police Chief: No, but precautions ... necessary ... precautions will be taken of course. Schieffer: On that Sunday, the plan was to transfer Oswald from the Dallas City Jail where he had been questioned and where he had been kept, and transfer him to the county jail. Harry Reasoner, CBS News, on the air: This is how things stand at this hour. In Washington it is not long until the time for the transfer of the body of President Kennedy from its repose at the White House to the rotunda of the Capitol where it will lie in state. In Dallas Lee Oswald, the man accused of the assassination of the president is to be moved from one jail to another. We will have a direct report. Rather (2008): This was something ... brand new.. Covering this kind of tragedy, nobody had done it on television before. Harry Reasoner on the air: Let us go now to the White House and Robert Pierpoint. Dan Rather (2008): Nobody knew how to do it and in terms of coverage ... everybody in television ... we were making it up as we went along. Harry Reasoner on the air: We are now switching to Dallas where they are about to move Lee Oswald and where there is a scuffle in the police station...  Reporter: We are going to switch now to Bob Huffaker, down in the basement of the court house who is close to the scene. Go ahead Bob. Bob Huffaker: Lee Harold Oswald, has been shot. The situation is now that Lee Harold Oswald has been shot. The man who saw the shot fired, said it was fired by a man wearing a black hat, a brown coat... Huffaker: I had looked and seen Oswald grimace, grasp his stomach and fall. And I knew, that, what we had feared, had actually taken place. Harry Reasoner: We have, we got our tape. We have re-racked the video tape that shows that whole scene of confusion. Schieffer: Suddenly, these two detectives walk out, with Oswald between them, and someone just walks up and sticks a gun in Oswald's side and shoots him. Reporter: This is the basement floor of the Dallas City Hall ... Schieffer: And again it's just this total what in the world happened. How could this have happened? Socolow: From a journalists point of view, there were so many questions to be answered. Who was the murder? Why did he do it? Reporter: And you knew him? Officer: Yes,sir. Bob Huffaker: And he is a resident of Dallas, is he not? Officer: Yes, Sir. Cronkite (1993): The police, uh, captured a man at the scene who reporters saw shoot Oswald and have booked him.They say his name is Jack Ruby, or Rubenstein. Huffaker: The operator of a seedy, strip club in downtown Dallas. BobHuffaker reporting: Here comes Oswald, he, he is ashen and unconscious... and now the ambulance is coming out... the ambulance with Lee Harvey Oswald who was shot. Cronkite (1993): He was taken to Parkland Hospital and died an hour and 15 minutes after he was shot, in a emergency room just 10 feet from the room where President Kennedy had died almost exactly 48 hours before. Schieffer: That weekend was unlike anything that had ever happen in television or in journalism, uh, in this country. I never felt that way until 9/11. Bob Schieffer: The day Oswald was to be transferred to the county jail in Dallas, I was sent to cover his arrival. As we know he never got there. Instead, his murder fueled a firestorm of suspicion about a possible conspiracy. Was Jack Ruby sent to silence the president's assassin? Even after all these years,a new CBS News poll shows most Americans - 61 percent-- don't believe Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. Reporter: It appears as though something has happened in the motorcade route - something, I repeat, something has happened in the motorcade route.  Schieffer:From the moment the sound of those shots were heard people began to wonder ...was there a conspiracy? Reporter:... Parkland Hospital has been advised to stand by for a severe gunshot wound... Schieffer: Those ... who were down on Dealey Plaza ... didn't know what had happened. Reporter: Something is wrong here, something is terribly wrong... Caro:It's an atmosphere of uncertainty. As Air Force One is heading to Washington, the Mexican border is being sealed because we're afraid of conspirators getting away. Philip Shenon:Within hours of the assassination, Bobby Kennedy took the director of the CIA out on to his lawn and asked the question bluntly, \"Did you kill my brother?\" Schieffer:And his answer? Shenon: His answer was no. In his new account of the Kennedy assassination, Philip Shenon, a former investigative reporter for the New York Times, explores why many suspected an international conspiracy. Shenon:There was terrible suspicion at that time about the Soviet Union, about Cuba, about the larger Communist threat.... Fidel Castro knows, in the fall of 1963, that the Kennedy Administration is trying to kill him. And so ... it was an obvious suspicion that Castro would be involved in Kennedy's death. Before the week was out, President Johnson decided that to quell America's fears, a high level commission to investigate the assassination was necessary. Reporter: The seven members of the Warren Commission headed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court...  Shenon: In September, 1964, after... 10 months of investigation ... the Warren Commission determined ...that there was no evidence of a conspiracy and that it appeared Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone gunman in Dealey Plaza. Yet the Warren Commission itself would come under intense scrutiny.Four separate government investigations, 33 television reports from CBS News alone, and of course, Hollywood. After 50 years, what do we finally know? Was the president really killed by a lone gunman in Dealey Plaza? The best record of the assassination to stand the test of time is Abraham Zapruder's famous 26 \u00bd seconds of 8mm film photographed just steps from the president's motorcade. From his perch, what did Abraham Zapruder see? For 38 years Dale Myers, a professional computer animator, has researched the assassination. Ten years ago, utilizing new computer technology, he was able to take the 8mm film -and analyze it frame by frame - believing it might solve the mystery of whether there was a second shooter in Dealey Plaza. Dale K. Myers: The Zapruder film was the only film that captured the entire shooting from start to finish ... Most people don't realize how small the Zapruder film is. An 8mm film is actually smaller than a postage stamp ... And this makes it very difficult to see what's going on, especially when the film is projected in real time.... I thought there's a way now with the technology to take my computer models and match the Zapruder film exactly, frame-for-frame ... to finally once and for all isolate what's happening in the car as the shots are fired.\" Schieffer: To make its lone gunman conclusion work, the Warren Commission maintained that a single bullet hit President Kennedy and then wounded Gov. Connally. Critics dismissed it as a \"magic bullet theory.\" Even Gov. Connally never accepted it. Gov. John Connally (1992): To me it's just inconceivable that the first shot that went through his neck, entered my back. I don't believe that, I never will believe that. They can't run enough tests to make me believe that. Myers:Kennedy, when he emerges from behind the sign, he's obviously hit as the hands come up in a very dramatic fashion.So the problem that conspiracy theorists point out is they say, \"Well, the time lag between this and the moment when Gov. Connally they claim is hit is too short for a single gunman to be firing two rounds.\"So they say, \"This must be a conspiracy.\" ... which meant that ... there was a second shooter in the plaza. The shooting as we now understand it some almost 50 years later -- there were three shots fired. ... Zapruder begins filming right here. First shot is fired, bang. Second shot is fired, bang.... And the third and fatal shot is fired here, bang.... The reality is, is the president wasn't hit by the first shot.No one was. The first shot missed and Myers' analysis shows what happened with the second shot. Myers:At frame 222 Connally is not injured. 223, but at 224 ... we can see the right shoulder buckle and start to drop. ...This is a very dramatic change in body position. ... He's clearly been hit. ... We know the bullet has emerged right here in the coat area.And so we can actually see this on camera, the lapel suddenly blow open and then the dramatic reaction of the governor after that. So again, in real time, it's very clear that they both react at the same time.... the two men are ... hit by the same bullet. This computer technology confirms the controversial single-bullet theory. And by rotating the Zapruder footage in three dimensions, Myers can demonstrate why the single bullet had to pass through Kennedy and hit Connally. Myers:If you take the entrance wound on Kennedy's back and connect it with a straight line and project that line forward, it hits Governor Connally who's seated directly in front of him.It has to hit Connally. ...Otherwise, you get a real magic bullet, a bullet that exits Kennedy's throat and vanishes into thin air. But there's more -- computer analysis now allows us to investigate the source of the single bullet. Myers: So we take the back wound on Connally. We take that as a straight line back to Kennedy's throat wound and then just project it ... rearward and see where it takes us.And I was really a little bit surprised after all the conspiracy talk to find it goes right back through the southeastern corner of the Texas School Book Depository. Twenty-First Century technology concludes Oswald was the only shooter. And despite all the theories and all the investigations over the last 50 years, no one has yet produced credible evidence of a conspiracy behind Oswald. So why do so many people still refuse to believe a single person did this? Shenon:It's just-- a difficult concept for folks that one young, unstable man, with a $21 rifle could change the world. [Pauses] And yet it happened. As rumors and uncertainty spread, one thing was certain: America, and much of the world, was united in unimaginable grief. The president had been assassinated. The drama that was about to unfold in Washington played like an epic tragedy, and television broadcast live images that would be branded into our nation's memory. Reporter: John Fitzgerald Kennedy, 35th President of the United States, leaving the White House for the last time.  Bob Schieffer:I was always struck by, just what seemed like overwhelming grief that people seemed to be experiencing. Caro: So the caisson is pulled up to the front of White House. Then they put the coffin on it, put the flag on top of it.Then all of a sudden there she is in the door way. Reporter: Mrs. Kennedy, Caroline, and John ... Caro: Her face is behind the veil. She's holding a little figure in each hand in a sky blue coat -her son and her daughter.She moves forward toward the limousine and Robert Kennedy...His face is also unforgettable... ravaged face, uh, comes out behind her. Reporter: President Johnson, has gotten into the car with the Kennedy family. Caro: I mean, here's Lyndon Johnson and Robert Kennedy, two men who hate each other.They're going to be riding behind the body of Robert Kennedy's brother.In this long, slow procession. The caisson pulls away. Reporter: President John Kennedy... his body in the casket moving down Pennsylvania Avenue now, up toward Capitol Hill. Caro: Then they go into the rotunda. Schieffer:People felt like they knew the Kennedy's. We had seen their family.And, so we felt like we were losing someone who was very close to us. Reporter: The line... 40 blocks long... estimated by police at 500,000. Schieffer: There was this one moment where, uh, Caroline reaches up under the flag.To be, obviously trying to be closer to her father. And it wasn't enough just to put her hand on the flag. Charles Collingwood | CBS News reporting: So great is the crush outside the capitol... waiting to get in.That people who have not been in line at 10 O'clock can't possibly go by the coffin before it is born away at 10 O'clock tomorrow. Reporter: Mrs. Kennedy followed the casket on foot to St. Matthews Church. Cronkite (1993): It really happened.The President of the United States dead, and there he lied. It had happened, it was over, it was done, and we were about to bury it. Bury something of our past along with that man. Schieffer:I think the picture that most people will remember, is this tiny little boy, in his little boy suit -uh, and he puts his hand up... and he salutes.it's hard for me to think of it even today and not be touched by that. Caro: It's all the pomp and majesty that a republic can muster. Schieffer:You had the rider less horse. Caro: The great black horse. Schieffer: You heard the sound of the drums... It was a soft sound. Solid. Caro: It was like it burned it into our consciousness. Schieffer:It was overwhelming... It was overwhelming. Caro: When you see these images, even today, you feel this is a watershed moment in American history...Really never to be forgotten. Schieffer:So many parts of our culture changed because of that weekend. I truly believed it was the weekend that America lost its innocence. America was never quite the same after that day.A nation that had been brimming with confidence suddenly felt a new vulnerability.How could this have happened? Would it have been different had Kennedy lived? We can never know. But that weekend was only the beginning of one of the most tumultuous and violent decades in the country's history.A decade that would see more assassinations, Vietnam, bloody riots, and Watergate -- which would bring down and force the resignation of a very different president.It would be a time when we would question our leaders our institutions and everything we had taken for granted for so long. John Kennedy would have been 96 years old this year, but in our memory he remains forever young.

            "article_content": "We hear a lot these days about big partisan divides in public opinion, but Americans are also telling us they're fed up with partisanship in general, and often displeased with their own parties. That doesn't mean that they're ready to give up on partisanship themselves, though.\u00a0 This study shows party attachments have remained very stable in 2017, with neither Republicans nor Democrats able to draw many independents over to their side so far. Democrats aren't becoming Republicans en masse, nor are Republicans becoming Democrats, and the few who have vacillated between parties aren't as likely to vote in the first place -- which sheds light on why today's politics often seems dominated by partisans. With the CBS News Nation Tracker, we have a panel study that \u2013 unlike most polls \u2013 goes back and re-interviews a nationally representative sample of thousands of people to see whether their minds have changed on the top issues of the day, and if so, why.\u00a0 This makes the Nation Tracker useful for explaining movement in public opinion. In each interview, we also ask respondents' party identification. We've interviewed people up to five times over the course of this year, giving us a chance to directly see whether individuals switch parties or not, as well as the characteristics of switchers. Overall, 91 percent of respondents identified with the same party in their most recent interview as they did the first time we talked to them this winter. The chart below shows a great deal of stability among Democrats, Republicans, and independents alike. In each group, most chose the same party the first time we interviewed them and the most recent time (the last round coming in July). The net shifts that did take place are small. Only 5 percent of initial independents identified as Democrats the last time we interviewed them. A similar 6 percent of initial independents had switched to the GOP, meaning that neither party had a real edge in its ability to draw independents over the course of these months. Switching from one of the major parties to the other is rarer still. Just 3 percent of initial Republicans became Democrats, and just 2 percent of initial Democrats went the other way to become Republicans. This indicates that party identification is stable for the vast majority of people \u2013 about nine in ten \u2013 even over several months of news and political developments. However, those who switch parties look quite different from those who stick with their initial group. Switchers are younger than non-switchers are. At 55 percent, most switchers are under age 45, compared to only 41 percent of non-switchers. Switchers' relative youth hews to the idea that they have not formed lasting or immovable partisan attachments. Switchers also tend a bit more to be male and racially diverse. In a separate question from which party they currently identify with, most switchers report that they have considered themselves independents at some point before in their lives. Six in ten switchers said there was a point in time that they were independents, in some cases, before the Nation Tracker began, compared with just four in ten non-switchers. Switchers were also less likely to say their friends and family share their political views, suggesting they have social networks that are more politically diverse. Switchers were also less likely to rate both Democrats and Republicans in extreme terms. Only one in six rate these groups as \"Least favorable\" on a five-point scale, as compared to about a quarter of non-switchers. Importantly, switchers were also less likely to have cast a vote in the 2016 presidential election, likely reflecting their lower levels of politicization. Only 54 percent of switchers turned out last year, compared to 64 percent of non-switchers. As other studies of turnout have shown, this suggests that more deeply-rooted partisans are more likely to participate in politics, a phenomenon that is contributing to the divisions that we see today. Now that we've seen the kind of people who switch, here's a closer look at the switches that occurred and their direction. We have based this analysis on all the party switches we saw take place any time we did an interview with someone. Some people contributed multiple switches to this analysis if they switched parties more than one time over the period we talked to them, while others only switched once in that period. (The fact that some people vacillated so much is interesting in itself.) As the chart below shows, most of the switches involve moving in or out of the independent category. Among all switches, 24 percent were independent to Republican, while 21 percent were Republican to independent. Democrat-to-independent switches and independent-to-Democrat switches are another 20 percent and 19 percent, respectively. Switches between the major parties happens much less: 9 percent Republican-to-Democrat and 8 percent vice versa. And across all switches, moving rightward happens slightly more than moving leftward. Again, we should stress that these are the total switch choices observed, not individuals, so this chart informs us about the way that people switch, not the aggregate totals for any given party. In terms of an ideological label, Republicans who switched to independent actually called themselves more conservative than independents who switched to Republican. Aside from the label, these groups appeared equally conservative on many issues, such as health care and a border wall, indicating that there are more people who might hold conservative views on some particular policy issues than there are Republican identifiers. Democrat-to-independent switches and independent-to-Democrat switches came from groups differing by age and certain cultural views, suggesting that the ranks of Democratic identifiers may be increasingly dependent on age and cultural issues. Most independent-to-Democrat switches came from people who are under 45, while most Democrat-to-independent switches came from people 45 or older. In fact, this young group of people becoming Democrats is the main reason switchers as a whole tend to be young. The net effect could be to reinforce the Democratic Party's advantage among younger Americans.\u00a0 All told, rightward switchers were older, whiter, and more educated than leftward switchers. Leftward switchers were more likely to call themselves lower or working class. About a third of switchers actually switched parties more than once (which amounts to 4 percent of everyone we interviewed at least twice). Instead of drifting in the same direction, most of these multiple switchers \"came home,\" meaning they returned to their original group. Many partisans flirted with the independent label at some point before going back to their party. The graphic below shows the four most common paths taken by the multiple switchers. One in five of them switched from Republican to independent and then back to Republican. Slightly fewer switched from Democrat to independent and back. Overall, seven in ten multiple switchers had come home by their final interview. There was indeed more vacillation between categories on the right side of the political spectrum. People who started out as Democrats were more likely to switch only once (usually to independent) than those starting out as Republicans. Whether people switch just once or multiple times, a plurality ended up as independents. For those interested in polling methodology, all this also adds to the body of evidence that incorporating partisanship in a poll's sample weighting is a sensible idea. We see here that partisanship is a relatively stable parameter at the individual level \u2013 as is often the case in the aggregate \u2013 at least over this kind of time period. This analysis also has implications for understanding and measuring partisan splits we see in polls on key attitudes, too, such as approval of the President.\u00a0 For instance, CBS News polling shows that President Trump's approval rating among Democrats is the same now as it was just after he took office: about one in ten Democrats approve of the job he is doing. Republican support remains strong, but is being closely watched by observers.\u00a0 Because partisan identification itself is strong, we know that the composition of those partisan subgroups is giving us comparable measures between polls. If partisanship was unstable, people might be moving in and out of those subgroups along with their views on the President, but we see that they are not, so this makes tracking his ratings among the partisans very reliable. And any aggregate changes we may see in Presidential approval down the road among Republicans or Democrats is likely to reflect true changes in opinion, rather than movement in party identification.

            "article_content": "President Trump called for unity in defending and preserving Western civilization while pressing Russia to halt their support of \"hostile regimes\" as he addressed the people of Poland on Thursday.  Speaking in Krasinski Square, near the site of the 1944 Warsaw uprising against the Nazis, Mr. Trump spent much of his speech devoted to applauding the spirit and strength of the Polish people, using their repeated takeovers and occupations as a metaphor for standing up in the face of global threats.  \"The triumph of the Polish spirit over centuries of hardship gives us all hope in which good conquers evil and peace achieves victory over war,\" Mr. Trump said. Urging the crowd to all \"fight like the Poles\", Mr. Trump said, \"Our freedom, our civilization and our survival depend on these bonds of history culture and memory and more than ever. Poland is in our heart and its people are in that fight.\" He added, \"I declare today for the world to hear the West will never, ever be broken, our values will prevail, our people will thrive and our civilization will triumph.\" It was also Mr. Trump's most forceful language to date toward the Russian government, calling on Russia to cease its destabilizing activities in Ukraine and elsewhere. He also called on them to drop support for \"hostile regimes\" in Syria and Iran. After delivering that broadside before a friendly Polish crowd, Mr. Trump then extended an invite to Russia to join the community of responsible nations to defend against terrorism.  CBS News' Margaret Brennan reports the language will resonate with Russian President Vladimir Putin who has been long been selling the idea of partnership with the U.S. to fight extremism in places like Syria. Mr. Trump never mentioned Putin by name but he is laying the groundwork for tomorrow's meeting. Mr. Trump also doubled down on his calls for NATO members to pay their fair share in defense spending, a campaign promise he reiterated during his first meeting of NATO states in Brussels two months ago. \u00a0 \"My administration has demanded all members of NATO finally meet their full and fair financial obligation. As a result of this insistence, billions of dollars more have begun to pour into NATO, people are shocked.\"  \"Words are easy but actions are what matters,\" added Mr. Trump. \"For its protection, everyone knows this, Europe must do more.\" Mr. Trump arrived in Warsaw Wednesday evening after tweeting about global trade deals shortly before he departed Washington. During his brief visit, he participated in a joint press conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda, in which he said that he's considering some \"pretty severe\" options in response to North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missile test this week. Mr. Trump will travel to Hamburg, Germany to take part in the G-20 summit of world leaders, and to have his first highly-anticipated meeting with Putin. The two leaders have spoken on the phone but have not yet formally met in person. They'll meet Friday on the sidelines of the summit.  Protests to greet Trump, fellow leaders at G-20 He'll also be meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping during the summit, days after North Korea successfully tested an intercontinental ballistic missile. Mr. Trump had been counting on China to help contain the North's nuclear ambition but has been disappointed. He tweeted this week, \"So much for China working with us - but we had to give it a try!\"  Leaders will also tackle trade and climate change during the summit. See live updates of the speech below: Mr. Trump doubled-down on his call for NATO members to pay their fair share in defense spending, a campaign promise he reiterated during his first meeting of NATO states in Brussels two months ago. \u00a0 \"My administration has demanded all members of NATO finally meet their full and fair financial obligation. As a result of this insistence, billions of dollars more have begun to pour into NATO, people are shocked.\"\u00a0 Mr. Trump urged NATO members to \"stand firmly behind Article 5, the mutual defense commitment.\" \"Words are easy but actions are what matters,\" added Mr. Trump. \"For its protection, everyone knows this, Europe must do more.\" In expanding the Western civilization's defense, it is a commitment of will, not just money, Mr. Trump said. \"Do we have desire to preserve civilization in face of those who would subvert and destroy it?\" \u00a0He closed his speech in saying, \"We can have the largest economies and the most lethal weapons but if we don't have strong families and strong values then we will be weak and we will not survive.\" Urging the crowd to all \"fight like the Poles\", Mr. Trump said, \"Our freedom, our civilization and our survival depend on these bonds of history culture and memory and more than ever, Poland is in our heart and its people are in that fight.\" He added, \"I declare today for the world to hear the west will never, ever be broken, our values will prevail our people will thrive and our civilization will triumph.\" Mr. Trump said the best became great \"not because of paperwork and regulations\" but because they allowed people to chase their dreams and pursue their destinies.\u00a0 \"Americans, Poles, and the nations of Europe value individual freedom and sovereignty. We must work together to counter forces, whether they come from inside or out, from the South or the East, that threaten over time to undermine these values and to erase the bonds of culture, faith and tradition that make us who we are,\" he said. He added as allies, \"We put faith and family in front of government and bureaucracy.\" Mr. Trump called the transatlantic bond between U.S. and Europe stronger than ever, but said there are \"dire threats\" to our way of life.\u00a0 \"America and Europe have suffered one terror attack after another, were going to get it to stop,\" Mr. Trump said.\u00a0 Lauding the work done during his overseas trip to Saudi Arabia, Mr. Trump added, \"We must stand united against these shared enemies to strip them of their territory, their funding, their networks, and any form of ideological support.\u00a0 While we will always welcome new citizens who share our values and love our people, our borders will always be closed to terrorism and extremism of any kind.\" In a rare move, Mr. Trump also urged Russia to cease its \"destabilizing activities in Ukraine and elsewhere in its support in hostile regimes including Syria and Iran\" and instead \"join the community of responsible nations in our fight against common enemies and in defense of civilization itself.\" Mr. Trump reflected on past invasions of Poland, calling the Nazi occupation \"brutal\" and \"hell on earth.\" Mr. Trump took a moment to acknowledge and applaud veterans of the Warsaw Uprising. \"What great spirit,\" said Mr. Trump of the living heroes. \"There is a courage and a strength deep in the Polish character that no one could destroy,\" Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump embraced the spirit of Polish strength, saying as those sought to \"demolish freedom your faith, your laws, your identity, indeed the very essence of your culture and humanity yet through it all you never lost that spirit.\" \"Your oppressors tried to break you but Poland could not \u00a0be broken,\" he added. \"In dark days you may have lost your land, but you never lost your pride.\" Mr. Trump said. \"Poland lives, prospers and prevails in the face of hardships.\"\u00a0 He added, \"the triumph of the Polish spirit over centuries of hardship gives us all hope in which good conquers evil and peace achieves victory over war.\" Mr. Trump called Poland a symbol of hope since the beginning of the United States, adding that the two nations hold a special bond only shared between those who have fought, bled and died for freedom. Mr. Trump thanked Polish-Americans for support in the 2016 election. Reflecting on the backdrop of the Warsaw uprising memorial, Mr. Trump embraced a Poland that is \"safe strong and free.\" \"America is eager to expand our partnership with you, we welcome stronger ties of trade and commerce,\" said Mr. Trump. He added the U.S. is committed to securing access to alternate forms of energy so that way the Polish people are never \"hostage\" to a single supplier of energy.\u00a0 Mrs. Trump greeted the crowd, thanking them for welcoming them to their country. Mrs. Trump reflected on visiting a science center with local children, saying it's mission was to inspire people to observe, experiment ask questions and seek answers.\u00a0 Mrs. Trump said Mr. Trump's focus remains on the \"safety and security of the American people.\"\u00a0 \"People should be able to lead their lives without fear no matter what country they live in. that is my wish for all of us around the world,\" added Mrs. Trump. Mr. Trump lays a ceremonial wreath at the site of 1944 Warsaw uprising against the Nazis. Polish residents chanted as President Trump took the stage to deliver remarks that are billed to be in defense of Western civilization and unity among Europe and the United States in the face of current events. \u00a0White House officials said the speech will portray Poland as a \"symbol and metaphor for the sacrifices to preserve a civilization.\" Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

            "article_content": "Amid the ongoing dirge for businesses the internet has decimated, books occupy a special place. From the parchments of the ancient Greeks to the Gutenberg Bible to the worldwide spread of lending libraries, books were arguably one of the primary engines of civilization's growth, spreading knowledge and delight to humanity.\u00a0 So laments about their decline resonate deeper than the nostalgic regrets inspired by, say, the demolition of a beloved local sports stadium. The number of paper-bound books bought has tumbled over the past decade as bookstores have closed down. Robert Gleason, executive editor of Tor Books, last month stood in the middle of Book Expo America, the largest U.S. book fair, \u00a0and remarked, \"This used to be so much more crowded.\" But there's some evidence that the long, sad slump in book purchases has hit bottom. Sales are creeping upward. And, yes, there may even be a rebound taking shape, however modest, among independent booksellers, whose ranks have been pared harshly. Of course, in addition to digital competition for people's time, another factor in books' slide may have been increased consumer thriftiness in the aftermath of the Great Recession. So an improving economy should be a help to book sales. \u00a0 \"This is a tough business,\" said Otto Penzler, who founded a small publishing house called Mysterious Press and also runs the Mysterious Bookshop in New York City. \"But everybody's business is better than five years ago,\" referring to booksellers. \u00a0 After peaking in 2008 with 778 million printed books sold in the U.S., sales tumbled to 591 million in 2012, a 24 percent drop, Nielsen BookScan figures show. But starting four years ago, book sales began inching upward again, to 674 million sold last year. Print books in 2016 showed a 3.3 percent rise in unit sales, marking the fourth straight year of increases.\u00a0 Indeed, this is still about 100 million books shy of the peak, and the U.S. population has grown, meaning there are more non-readers of printed material than before. In per capital terms, this boils down to 2.55 books bought for each American a decade ago, versus 1.96 today.\u00a0 There's an important nuance to all this, however: The advent of e-books, which chewed into mass-market paperback sales starting around 2010. Both are more portable and cheaper than hardcovers (which cost around $27) or trade paperbacks (which are the same dimensions as hardbacks and go for around $15). Mass-market paper sells for around $7 and e-books about $9. Yet e-books, propelled by Amazon's Kindle reader and other such devices, have leveled off in popularity. According to the\u00a0Pew Research Center, \u00a0the share of adults who have read a book over the previous 12 months were 71 percent for print and 17 percent for e-books in 2011, and 65 percent for print and 28 percent for e-book in 2016. Print books have maintained the same mid-60s levels for the past three years, while e-books have stayed in the high-20s. Meanwhile, independent bookstores have come back somewhat, although the gains leave them far short of their glory days. Over the past eight years, the number of bookstores, most of them independent, increased by 25 percent to 1,757. (This figure doesn't include chains like Barnes & Noble.) By the American Booksellers Association's reckoning, the peak for bookshops around the U.S. was in 1989, at 3,300. In the 1990s, many closed up from the onslaught of big-box sellers like Barnes & Noble (BKS) and Borders. Then a new force came on the scene -- Amazon (AMZN) -- which not only sank more independent bookstores but also forced Borders out of business in 2011, closing 1,150 branches, and hobbled Barnes & Noble. To be sure, any comeback for print may not be an unalloyed blessing for physical bookstores. Industry blogger Jane Friedman noted in a post this spring that if \"print is indeed 'back,' it's because of Amazon.\" She pointed out that the online retailer's print sales increased 15 percent in 2016, while those of Barnes & Noble declined by 6 percent, along with large merchandisers like Target (TGT) and Walmart Stores (WMT). \u00a0 Still, \"The industry is holding its own,\" said Lorraine Shanley, president of Market Partners International, a publishing consulting firm. What should help it this year, she said, is a spate of big-name authors such as Scott Turow, Stephen King and Ken Follett, whose latest works are out, or soon will be. \"A lot were postponed from the last third of 2016, because nobody wanted to publish a big book and compete with the election,\" she said. Such best-sellers are like the tentpole action movies that Hollywood produces, which help the rest of the industry. Certain segments of the book world are doing quite well, such as children's titles. James Patterson, the prolific thriller author, has even jumped in with a juvenile line.\u00a0 All that said, what's remarkable is that in the face of society's enormous shift to the internet for information, print-format books and individual bookstores that sell them have staged a fitful, if undeniable, comeback. Why has the counter-trend occurred? To Neil Nyren, editor-in-chief of the G.P. Putnam's Sons publishing house, it's simply a matter of \"people deciding they like to read books\" in a paper format. \"Not long ago, the digerati were telling us it all was going electronic, but that hasn't happened.\"\u00a0 Perhaps this is because most schools still use physical textbooks, so even young people are steeped in the culture of turning pages and dog-earing them. \"The book market is healthy when a lot of young readers are buying books,\" bookseller Penzler said. The Book of the Month Club, long associated with aging readers of middlebrow tastes, has been revamped to appeal to the younger set -- and quite successfully. It delivers hardbacks to subscribers, and enhances the experience with active social media interactions. As for the return of independent physical bookstores, that may be a result of the \"locavore\" trend, which lauds small neighborhood merchants who provide the personalized service and friendliness absent from major emporiums, whether online or in a mega-store.\u00a0 Editor Nyren enjoys going to small bookshops where the staff is knowledgeable and enthusiastic about volumes they stock. \"I'll buy the stuff they like,\" he said. \"It's better than having an algorithm pick it for me.\"\u00a0 Larry Light is a veteran financial editor and reporter who has worked for the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Business Week, Money, AdviceIQ and Newsday.",

            "article_content": "GAZIANTEP, Turkey -- They are veterans of Syria's rebellion, trying for years to bring down President Bashar Assad. But these days they're doing little fighting with his military. They're struggling to find a place in a bewildering battlefield where several wars are all being waged at once by international powers. Syria's civil war has become a madhouse of forces from Turkey, the United States, Syrian Kurds, the Islamic State of Syrian and Iraq (ISIS) group, al Qaeda as well as Assad's allies Russia, Iran, Lebanon's Hezbollah, Iraqi and Afghan Shiite militias - all with their own alliances and agendas. Syrian rebel factions, battered by defeats and as divided as ever, reel around trying to find allies they can trust who will ensure their survival. \"We have become political dwarfs, fragmented groups which hardly have control over the closest checkpoint, let alone each other,\" said Tarek Muharram, who quit his banking job in the Gulf to return home and join the rebellion in 2011. Over the years he fought alongside several different rebel groups, including ones backed by the United States. Now he has now joined the alliance led by the al Qaeda-linked Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. Rebel leaders have limited options - none of them good. They can line up behind Turkey, which is recruiting factions to fight its own war in Syria against Syrian Kurds primarily, as well as ISIS militants. Or they can ally themselves with al Qaeda's affiliate, the strongest opposition faction. It leads a coalition that is still battling Assad and dominates the largest cohesive rebel territory, encompassing the northwestern province of Idlib and nearby areas. Or they can try to go it alone. Despite differences with Washington, all of them hope for support from the United States. But they feel it has abandoned them after deciding to arm and finance Kurdish-led militias to fight ISIS. They see an enemy in ISIS but also potentially in the Kurds, who have carved out their own territory across northern Syria. Now in the fight against ISIS, the Kurds could capture Sunni Arab-majority regions like Raqqa and Deir el-Zour, to the alarm of the mainly Sunni Arab rebels. The Associated Press spoke to a series of veteran rebels who move between Syria and Turkey and found them desperate for resources and support but intent on fighting for years to come. Nothing blurs Muharram's vision and determination to fight Assad. Not the loss of his beloved Aleppo. Not the hours he and his comrades now spend in a small apartment in the southern Turkish city of Gaziantep, watching TV and smoking, waiting for the next battle.  The fall of Aleppo was a watershed moment. It cost the rebels there their strongest base, their resources, their homes. Uprooted, they needed new allies.  \"We had reached a dead end,\" said the 39-year-old Muharram. So he and his group, Noureddine el-Zinki, which was once backed by the U.S., joined al Qaeda's alliance.  The move caused many of his group to break away. But for Muharram, anything else would have required too many concessions. Turning to Turkey or US would mean becoming \"a mercenary fighting whomever the sponsor wants, whatever the dollar dictates.\" He would have had to take part in Russian-backed negotiations, \"giving up the revolution's principles ... and accepting Assad for a longer period,\" he said.  Muharram said he has his personal differences with al Qaeda. He pointed out that he doesn't always pray, for example, and he smokes. He sports a wolf-head tattoo on his arm, something militants frown on.  But he said the al Qaeda-led alliance has kept its weapons pointed in the right direction, against Assad. He and the 50 men he commands would drop their guns rather than be pushed to fight it.  The alliance has financial clout and can provide services in its territory. It has the resources of Idlib's and neighboring rural parts of Aleppo province to sustain the fight without relying on outsiders - farmland, water wells, supplies of fuel and weapons. Its fighters are mainly locals and well-disciplined, and the few foreign fighters including Afghans and Chinese don't interfere in residents' affairs, unlike the foreign jihadis of IS.  Both Turkey and the Kurds so far avoid a fight with al Qaeda-linked militants. But if Turkey is tempted to move against the alliance, Muharram said, it has pressure cards, including a border crossing with Turkey and territory near a Kurdish enclave, a potential thorn in Ankara's side.  The fight to remove Assad is far from over, he said.  \"The revolution will end with a ballot box. There is no legitimacy for a new Syria without elections.\" He defended his hometown of Daraya outside Damascus for years under a bloody, destructive siege by Assad's troops. But finally resistance collapsed, and last summer he and his fellow fighters were forcibly displaced north to Idlib.  It was a humiliating and disorienting move for Capt. Saeed al-Nokrashi and the 700 men in his faction, Shuhada al-Islam, part of the U.S-backed Free Syrian Army umbrella.  Idlib was strange territory, and dangerous - not because of Assad's forces or airstrikes, but because of Idlib's overlords, the al Qaeda-linked group.  The militants immediately kidnapped some of his best fighters.  \"This was to pressure us to join them, and if we do, they will protect us,\" al-Nokrashi said, speaking at his home in the southern Turkish town of Reyhanli and holding his 6-year-old son, born during the Daraya fighting.  The fighters were eventually freed. But the incident highlighted the more complicated world they were in.  \"Our confrontation was only with the regime. Now the choices are many.\"  The threats are, too. ISIS is a concern, as are the Syrian Kurdish forces, who he said are trying to \"create a separate state in the north.\" Then there are pro-Assad Iran and Shiite militias.  Al-Nokrashi's fighters are languishing in Idlib. They struggle to make ends meet and are focused on their families, reunited after long separations during the siege. Some have opened food shops, bringing the Damascus area's cuisine to Idlib.  A few of his fighters joined al Qaeda-linked group. The others have to deal with its pervasive security agencies that monitor all factions closely - \"just like the regime's security agencies,\" said al-Nokrashi, a former Syrian army officer.  Al-Nokrashi tried turning to diplomacy. He attended one session of the Russia-backed talks in the Kazakhstan capital Astana, where rebel commanders were received with much fanfare and sat briefly in the same room as the government delegation. He became disillusioned and boycotted the following meeting.  But he may have found his refuge. In recent weeks, the U.S., Turkey and Western and Gulf countries backed a new attempt at a coalition against Assad known as the Northern Front Operation Room. So far, 17 factions have joined, al-Nokrashi said.\u00a0 He drives around the Turkish seaside city of Iskenderun with another car of Syrian bodyguards and aides behind, fearing attack even here.  Lt. Col. Ahmed al-Saoud, commander of the U.S.-backed Division 13, has been living almost permanently in Turkey since al Qaeda's affiliate attacked him and his group in Syria last year. When he tried to return home in April, an ambush by the group's fighters was waiting for him. He survived, but one of his commanders was killed.  Al-Saoud's claim to fame has been his relentless fight against the radical group, which has tried to gain a foothold in his hometown, Maaret Numan, in Idlib. His anti-extremist stance got him arrested by ISIS in 2013, until protests forced the militants to release him - a sign of his support base in the area.  Al-Saoud, a defector from Assad's military, has received Western aid from the start. He feels let down that the U.S. is throwing its weight behind Kurdish militias.  \"We can't be temporary allies for a certain stage and then they drop or back me as they please,\" al-Saoud said.  What particularly miffed him, he said, is when U.S. troops deployed to create a buffer between Kurdish fighters and Turkish troops in northern Syria. \"Aren't we worthy of defending?\" he said.  He fears U.S. support will only deepen the Kurds' determination for self-rule, leading to the division of Syria, in the process boosting support among Sunni Arabs for al Qaeda.  During a recent AP visit to his home in Turkey, al-Saoud was constantly on the phone with his commanders back home, who in his absence are trying to understand shifting alliances and battlegrounds.  Al-Saoud also has joined the Northern Front Operation Room. But he is skeptical.  It is led by Islamist factions, minimizing the role of more secular groups like his. He fears the coalition will cost him his direct contact with the Americans and his independence, pull him from the fight against al Qaeda and diminish his prestige - his \"charisma,\" as he puts it.  \"My aim is a Syria free of Assad and of terrorism,\" he said. \"We will remain the popular face of this fight.\"\u00a0",

President Donald Trump's first foreign trip is in the books. It ended with a pep rally for U.S. troops stationed in Italy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This will be nine days, and I think we hit a home run, no matter where we are. (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: But ,along with the hits, there were some diplomatic errors, and some not-so-happy allies were left questioning the president's commitment to NATO and a global pact on climate change. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: All of us will be more safe and secure if everyone fulfills their obligations the way they are supposed to, right? (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: But with last week's suicide bombing at a concert in Manchester came a new sense of unity and urgency among allies to fight terrorism, but how? We sat down with Mr. Trump's secretary of defense, James Mattis, in his first formal interview since taking the job. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAMES MATTIS, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: We are going to move in an accelerated and reinforced manner, throw them on their back foot. (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: And the secretary's thoughts about the threat from North Korea? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATTIS: It would be a catastrophic war if this turns into combat. (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: We will have a report from Iraq. And we will look at another war with filmmaker Ken Burns, who will preview his upcoming project, \"The War in Vietnam.\" Plus, the president returns to new questions about son-in-law Jared Kushner's contacts with the Russians and his own effort to influence the investigation. We will have plenty of analysis on all of the news coming up on FACE THE NATION. Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I am John Dickerson. We begin with an update on the war in terror, as Iraqi forces continue their final push to get ISIS out of Mosul. Our Charlie D'Agata is on the front lines and filed this report earlier. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHARLIE D'AGATA, CBS NEWS FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT: More than seven months into the battle to recapture Mosul, and it has come down to this, Iraqi forces closing in on the Old City from three sides, but, as they advance, the progress is being measured by feet, rather than full city blocks. Iraqi and American forces have been firing heavy artillery and mortars. This came as a surprise, considering the U.N. estimates there may be as many as 200,000 civilians still trapped inside densely populated neighborhoods. More than 700,000 people have already fled since the offensive to retake Mosul began last October. In January, the Iraqi government declared that Eastern Mosul had been recaptured. The campaign to take back Western Mosul began a few weeks later with joint Iraqi forces pushing in from the north, south and west, now finally encircling the Old City. It is at the very heart of the ISIS stronghold here in Mosul, home to the al-Nuri Mosque, where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi first declared the caliphate, the so-called caliphate, nearly three years ago. U.S. airstrikes, so crucial in the fight so far, have become less effective in the maze of narrow streets and apartment blocks where ISIS gunmen open fire from homes, with residents effectively held prisoner, trapped inside. A team of American medical volunteers told us they are bracing for a surge of patients as this new offensive gets under way. While the defeat of ISIS at this point seems inevitable, the only question now is how much fight is left for the militants. (END VIDEOTAPE) DICKERSON: Charlie D'Agata reporting from Mosul. The offensive in Mosul is taking place as American forces are picking up the tempo against ISIS in all theaters. We sat down with Defense Secretary James Mattis at the U.S. military academy at West Point Saturday and asked him about the new strategy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTIS: Our strategy right now is to accelerate the campaign against ISIS. It is a threat to all civilized nations. And the bottom line is, we are going to move in an accelerated and reinforced manner, throw them on their back foot. We have already shifted from attrition tactics, where we shove them from one position to another in Iraq and Syria, to annihilation tactics, where we surround them. Our intention is that the foreign fighters do not survive the fight to return home to North Africa, to Europe, to America, to Asia, to Africa. We are not going to allow them to do so. We are going to stop them there and take apart the caliphate. DICKERSON: Explain what it means to be moving in an annihilation posture, as opposed to attrition. MATTIS: Well, attrition is where you keep pushing them out of the areas that they are in, John, and what we intend to do by surrounding them is to not allow them to fall back, thus reinforcing themselves as they get smaller and smaller, making the fight tougher and tougher. You can see that right now, for example, in Western Mosul, that is surrounded, and the Iraqi security forces are moving against them. Tal Afar is now surrounded. We have got efforts under way right now to surround their self-declared caliphate capital of Raqqa. That surrounding operation is going on. And once surrounded, then we will go in and clean them out. DICKERSON: One of the things you mentioned in this new accelerated tempo is that the president has delegated authority to the right level. What does that mean? MATTIS: When you are in operations, the best thing you can do at the top level is get the strategy right. You have to get the big ideas right. You have to determine, what is the policy, what is the level of effort you are willing to commit to it, and then you delegate to those who have to execute that strategy to the appropriate level. What is the appropriate level? It's the level where people are trained and equipped to take decisions, so we move swiftly against the enemy. There is no corporation in the world that would, in a competitive environment, try and concentrate all decisions at the corporate level. But I would point out here that we have not changed the rules of engagement. There is no relaxation of our intention to protect the innocent. We do everything we can to protect the civilians. And actually lowering, delegating the authority to the lower level allows us to do this better. DICKERSON: After the annihilation has been done, does that mean you can't let it fall back into ISIS hands? MATTIS: Once ISIS is defeated, there is a larger effort under way to make certain that we don't just sprout a new enemy. We know ISIS is going to go down. We have had success on the battlefield. We have freed millions of people from being under their control. And not one inch of that ground that ISIS has lost has ISIS regained. It shows the effectiveness of what we are doing. However, there are larger currents, there are larger confrontations in this part of the world, and we cannot be blind to those. That is why they met in Washington under Secretary Tillerson's effort to carry out President Trump's strategy to make certain we don't just clean out this enemy and end up with a new enemy in the same area. DICKERSON: You served under President Obama. You are now serving President Trump. How are they different? MATTIS: Everyone leads in their own way, John. In the case of the president, he has got to select the right people that he has trust in to carry out his vision of a strategy. Secretary Tillerson and I, we coordinate all of the president's campaign. We just make certain that foreign policy is led by the State Department. I inform Secretary Tillerson of the military factors. And we make certain that then, when we come out of our meetings, State Department and Defense Department are tied tightly together, and we can give straightforward advice to the commander in chief. DICKERSON: President Trump has said, to defeat ISIS, he has said that there has to be a humiliation of ISIS. What does that mean? MATTIS: I think, as we look at this problem of ISIS, it is more than just an army. It is also a fight about ideas. And we have got to dry up their recruiting. We have got to dry up their fund-raising. The way we intend to do it is to humiliate them, to divorce them from any nation giving them protection and humiliating their message of hatred, of violence. Anyone who kills women and children is not devout. They have -- they cannot dress themselves up in false religious garb and say that somehow this message has dignity. We're going to strip them of any kind of legitimacy. And that is why you see the international community acting in concert. DICKERSON: When should Americans look to see victory? MATTIS: This is going to be a long fight. The problems that we confront are going to lead to an era of frequent skirmishing. We will do it by, with, and through other nations. We will do it through developing their capabilities to do a lot of the fighting. We will help them with intelligence. Certainly, we can help train them for what they face. And you see our forces engaged in that from Africa to Asia. But, at the same time, this is going to be a long fight. And I don't put timelines on fights. DICKERSON: What about civilian casualties as a result of this faster tempo? MATTIS: Civilian casualties are a fact of life in this sort of situation. We do everything humanly possible, consistent with military necessity, taking many chances to avoid civilian casualties, at all costs. DICKERSON: Under this new aggressive posture, what can be done that would not have been done, say, six months ago? MATTIS: Probably the most important thing we are doing now is, we are accelerating this fight. We are accelerating the tempo of it. We are going to squash the enemy's ability to give some indication that they're -- they have invulnerability, that they can exist, that they can send people off to Istanbul, to Belgium, to Great Britain, and kill people with impunity. We are going to shatter their sense of invincibility there in the physical caliphate. That is only one phase of this. Then we have the virtual caliphate that they use the Internet. Obviously, we are going to have to watch for other organizations growing up. We cannot go into some kind of complacency. I am from the American West. We have forest fires out there. And some of the worst forest fires in our history, the most damage were caused when we pulled the fire crews off the line too early. And so we are going to have to continue to keep the pressure on the enemy. There is no room for complacency on this. DICKERSON: A hundred civilians were killed after a U.S. bomb hit a building in Mosul in Iraq. Is this the result of this faster tempo? Is this the kind of thing Americans needs to get used to as a natural byproduct of this strategy? MATTIS: The American people and the American military will never get used to civilian casualties. We will -- we will fight against that every way we can possibly bring our intelligence and our tactics to bear. People who had tried to leave that city were not allowed to by ISIS . We are the good guys. We are not the perfect guys, but we are the good guys. And so we are doing what we can. We believe we found residue that was not consistent with our bomb. So we believe that what happened there was that ISIS had stored munitions in a residential location, showing once again the callous disregard that has characterized every operation they have run. DICKERSON: Help people understand what a conflict with North Korea would be like and how it would be different. MATTIS: A conflict in North Korea, John, would be probably the worst kind of fighting in most people's lifetimes. Why do I say this? The North Korean regime has hundreds of artillery cannons and rocket launchers within range of one of the most densely populated cities on earth, which is the capital of South Korea. We are working with the international community to deal with this issue. This regime is a threat to the region, to Japan, to South Korea, and in the event of war, they would bring danger to China and to Russia as well. But the bottom line is, it would be a catastrophic war if this turns into combat, if we are not able to resolve this situation through diplomatic means. DICKERSON: North Korea has been testing missiles. Are they getting any better at their capability? MATTIS: We always assume that, with a testing program, they get better with each test. DICKERSON: You say North Korea is a threat to the region. Is North Korea a threat to the United States? MATTIS: It is a direct threat to the United States. They have been very clear in their rhetoric. We don't have to wait until they have an intercontinental ballistic missile with a nuclear weapon on it to say that now it has manifested completely. DICKERSON: What is the line in North Korea that, if the regime crosses that line, in your view, the U.S. should take action? MATTIS: I would prefer not to answer that question, John. The president needs political maneuver room on this issue. We do not draw red lines unless we intend to carry them out. We have made very clear that we are willing to work with China, and we believe China has tried to be helpful in this regard.  DICKERSON: Give me a sense, if you can, of the time when you think North Korea gets to the point of no return. MATTIS: We consider it a direct threat even today, the North Korean threat. As far as that specific threat, I don't want to put a timeline on it. At this time, what we know, I would prefer to keep silent about, because we may actually know some things the North Koreans don't even know. DICKERSON: Let me switch to NATO. The president recently met with NATO leaders. He didn't mention the commitment in NATO, the so-called Article 5 commitment, an attack on one is an attack on all. Why not? MATTIS: I think, when President Trump chooses to go to NATO personally and stand there alongside the other more than two dozen nations in NATO, that was his statement, not words, actions. DICKERSON: But the president seems to need convincing on the power and importance of the NATO alliance. Do you have to convince him of how important NATO is? MATTIS: We have had good talks about it, John. In my initial job interview with the president, he brought up his questions about NATO. And my response was that I thought that, if we didn't have NATO, that he would want to create it, because it's a defense of our values, it is a defense of democracy. He was very open to that. Obviously, he had to make a decision about whether or not he was going to nominate me to be the secretary of defense. And although I immediately showed him that my view on that was rather profoundly in support of NATO, he at that point nominated me. DICKERSON: What do the Russians want? MATTIS: Beats me. Right now, Russia's future should be wedded to Europe. Why they see NATO as a threat is beyond me. Clearly, NATO is not a threat. But, right now, Russia is choosing to be a strategic competitor, for any number of reasons. But the bottom line is, NATO is not a threat. And they know it. They have no doubt about it. DICKERSON: You have said that Russia is trying to break apart NATO. Is there -- is the United States going to take any action to deal with Russia as a threat to NATO, either in helping in the Balkans or any other way? MATTIS: Right now, we are dealing with Russia, attempting to deal with Russia under President Trump's direction, in a diplomatic manner. At the same time, while willing to engage diplomatically, we are going to have to confront Russia when it comes to areas where they attack us, whether it be with cyber, where they try to change borders using armed force. And that is admittedly a strategically uncomfortable position, engaging diplomatically, trying to find a way out of this situation, but confronting them where we must. And we are going to continue in this mode, and, hopefully soon, our diplomats will work their magic and start moving us out of this quandary we find ourselves in. DICKERSON: Let me ask you about the Paris climate accords. The president is going to make a decision on this. MATTIS: I was sitting in on some of the discussions in Brussels, by the way, where climate change came up, and the president was open, he was curious about why others were in the position they were in, his counterparts in other nations. And I am quite certain the president is wide open on this issue as he takes in the pros and cons of that accord. DICKERSON: What keeps you awake at night? MATTIS: Nothing. I keep other people awake at night. (END VIDEOTAPE) DICKERSON: Secretary of Defense James Mattis. We will have more of our interview later in the broadcast. And we will be back in one minute with filmmaker Ken Burns. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: And we are back with filmmaker Ken Burns, whose new documentary, \"The War in Vietnam,\" will air starting September 17 on PBS. Ken is here to give us a preview on this weekend where we honor those who were lost in the service of their nation. And, Ken, I want to do something we don't normally do, which is, we're going to take a look at the trailer first, and then talk about it. So sweeping and powerful. I want to ask you about the journey you took in making this. Did you go in thinking, oh, it is this way, and come out thinking, no, it is really this way? KEN BURNS, DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER: I think every film that we tackle is like that, where you have that conventional wisdom, the superficial sense of what took place. You know, you say the 1920s, you think flappers or gangsters, and if you go into it, it is a little bit more complicated than that. For those of us who worked on this project, and particularly Lynn Novick, who is the co-director with me, we go in confident that we know something. And I think the 10 years that we spent working on it is almost daily humiliation of what we didn't know, John. And that's a good thing, because then you free yourself from the tyranny of that conventional wisdom, the tyranny of the kind of binary yes and no that besets our current media culture and our larger computer world, that we think it is all black, all right or all wrong. And what you find out in war is that it is possible for a thing and the opposite of that thing to be true at the same time. And it is not saying that the dates of the Battle of Gettysburg change from July 1, 2, and 3. It just means, if you have the passage of time, you have perspective. And with perspective and new scholarship, you can gain new insight. And if we think, as I believe we do, that a good deal of the divisions we experience today in our country were born, the seeds were planted, the virus started in Vietnam, then it may be possible, if we can get off that binary sort of position that we are all in, to be able to kind of unpack and then relearn the war, we might be able to address some of the things that beset us today, this lack of civility in civil discourse, the things that threaten us perhaps greater than any enemy. DICKERSON: A huge dose of perspective is what you are talking about. BURNS: This is what history offers. I mean, we think of documentaries as all about the urgency and fuss and fire of a contemporary issue, but it is often histories, that -- that tortoise that keeps going and comes going as the hare gets tired and sits down and sleeps. And I think you find -- if I said, well, John, Lynn and I have been working for 10 years on a film about mass demonstrations taking place all across the country, it is about asymmetrical warfare, in which the greatest military on earth is having a hard time figuring out what to do, it is about a White House concerned about leaks, it is about huge document drops in front of the American public, and an activated free press, you would say, you have abandoned history and you are talking about the contemporary moment. But those are just a handful of the themes that are about Vietnam, so they offer us a prism through which to see where we are now, as well as what happened then. DICKERSON: I want -- you and Lynn Novick talked to so many people, including members of the Vietcong. And I want to play a clip of one of those perspective-enhancing moments. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I witnessed Americans dying. When one was killed, the others stuck together. They carried away the body, and they wept. Americans, like us Vietnamese, also have a profound sense of humanity. (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: What was amazing in watching this is that you have the sense of humanity from perspective, and then you have soldiers, American soldiers, who said how much they hated in the moment. BURNS: So, I think what happens, the first casualty of war, people say, is the truth. But it is also, we have to objectify the enemy and turn them into nothing. We have to say that they are subhuman. And what we felt is that the Vietnam story is the story about three countries, the United States, our enemy, North Vietnam, and a third country, which, oh, by the way, disappeared in the course of this story, which we still really don't like to talk about them. But we felt, if we could go back and interview dozens and dozens of Americans across the spectrum of beliefs and geography and experiences, but also talk to Vietcong guerrillas and South Vietnamese marines and South Vietnamese civilians and diplomats and protesters of their own government, and then North Vietnamese civilians and North Vietnamese soldiers, you would have the ability to triangulate the story of this most important event, I think the most important event in the second half of the 20th century for Americans. You could triangulate this story and come to some better understanding. And there's -- and it is not just policy. It isn't just the binary stuff. It is also the emotional stuff, the deeply -- this is like Shakespeare's Rialto speech, you know, in which someone is -- you don't expect a Vietcong soldier to be saying that about Americans. We expect Americans to say the same thing. DICKERSON: Ken, I'm going to have to stop you there. But we're lucky enough to be looking forward to seeing you and your co-director, Lynn Novick, again in September to hear more about the film right on the eve. Thanks so much for being with us. BURNS: Thank you. DICKERSON: Back in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: You can keep up with the news of the week by subscribing to the FACE THE NATION Diary podcast. Find us on iTunes or your favorite podcast platform. We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: And we will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. President Trump's nine day trip to five countries has come to its conclusion. In his first overseas travel as president, Mr. Trump made some new friends, but had some uncomfortable moments with the old. In Jerusalem Mr. Trump became the first sitting president to visit the Western Wall, one of the holiest sites in Judaism. Tuesday, the president condemned the suicide bombing attack in Manchester, England. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: So many young, beautiful, innocent people, living and enjoying their lives, murdered by evil losers in life. I won't call them monsters, because they would like that term. (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: Intelligence about that attack was leaked by the U.S., which infuriated the British Prime Minister Theresa May. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: I will make clear to President Trump that intelligence that is shared between our law enforcement agencies must remain secure. (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: Wednesday, President Trump visited Vatican City, where he and his family met with Pope Francis, someone he'd clashed with during the campaign. As for pope, he lobbied the president on climate change. And it was off to Brussels, where the president, who had made a point of not lecturing in Saudi Arabia, delivered a lecture to NATO allies. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TRUMP: NATO members must finally contribute their fair share and meet their financial obligations. (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: Foreign leaders who had gathered at a 9/11 memorial commemorating when NATO members stood with America didn't know quite what to make of it, or what to make of the handshake with the French president, which turned into some kind of a contest, or the president's moving aside the prime minister of Montenegro, the newest member of NATO, to get the front spot in a photo-op. The final stop on the overseas tour was Sicily, where President Trump met with leaders of the G-7 Friday to talk terror and climate change. President Trump was the odd man out when he refused to bow to pressure to keep the United States in the Paris climate change agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The president says he'll make an announcement soon on whether to pull out of the Paris agreement. To talk about the president's trip and the problems he is facing on his arrival back in Washington, we're joined by Susan Page. She's the \"USA Today's\" bureau chief in Washington. Jeffrey Goldberg is an editor and is the editor in chief of \"The Atlantic.\" Michael Morell is the former deputy director of the CIA and a CBS News senior national security contributor. And Margaret Brennan, our White House and senior foreign affairs correspondent is just off the overnight flight back from the president's trip. We have extra coffee and the first question goes to you, Margaret. Let's go back to Saudi Arabia. What was -- what was the president's goal there with that speech, that choreographed visit? MARGARET BRENNAN, CBS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: That was fascinating. I flew in on Air Force One to Riyadh with the president and saw what was amazing pomp and circumstance. I mean he was welcomed as if he were a king by the king of Saudi Arabia. Trumpets, jets, you know, with flags everywhere, children greeting him. And this was really Saudi pulling out all the stops because they are embracing him in a way that, because, in fact, they so deeply resented President Obama. And President Trump's message clearly throughout those two days was, I'm not him. And so a lot of that resentment goes back to the outreach to Iran, it goes back to the failure to take military action in Syria, it goes back to calling for Hosni Mubarak to step down in Egypt. A lot of deep-seated anger there. To the extent that these Saudi allies, who are in many ways the protectors of Islam, are willing to overlook some of the president's rhetoric when he has said at times, Islam is at war with us. He has said he wanted to ban Muslims. All of that was put aside. And in this room full of more than 50 Muslim leaders from all around the world, the president said, our values and interests are aligned here. We see Iran as our enemy. We are with you on that and you need to help us win this war on terror. And it contrasts so -- so deeply with what President Obama did back in 2009 with his outreach to the Muslim world in Cairo, where he reached out to young people, President Trump reached out to the leaders.  DICKERSON: Right. And, Mike, what do you make of that strategic shift, that all focus now on Iran based on this strategy? MICHAEL MORELL, FORMER ACTING CIA DIRECTOR: So I think it's positive. I -- I think he accomplished something on this part of the trip. He reassured Saudi Arabia and the Sunni Arab allies there that we will have their back on Iran, which they see is an existential threat to them. They didn't believe that President Obama had their back. They now believe President Trump does. That's a huge change. That's positive for U.S. influence in the region and for our national security in the region. I think that was a success. DICKERSON: Jeffrey, your thoughts? JEFFREY GOLDBERG, \"THE ATLANTIC\": There -- there's a flip side to this, of course, which is that the Arab leadership, after so many years of Obama, they're positively giddy about the arrival of Donald Trump. And when they are giddy, like any other leaders, they might over step. And the danger, of course, is initiating a confrontation with Iran that the U.S. really doesn't want to be involved with at any given moment. They have enough to worry about on the North Korea file. And so -- and so the trip inadvertently maybe has -- has -- has upped the chances of a confrontation sooner rather than later with Iran in the Gulf, where -- which is already essentially an American lake where -- where -- where the American Navy is in charge of security for the Gulf nations. The Gulf nations want a confrontation between Iran and the United States. BRENNAN: The other thing I would say is a risk there is the -- President Trump saying, I'm not going to lecture you. DICKERSON: Yes. BRENNAN: And has made this virtue his policy of not lecturing on human rights. And when you are selling $110 billion in weapons, not the first U.S. president to sell heavy weaponry to Saudi, it also comes with this implicit -- when he's saying, we're with you against terrorists, who exactly are all these leaders calling terrorists and are we going to be happy necessarily with the use of force? DICKERSON: Susan, one thing that struck me about the president's speech and also the contradiction that Margaret mentioned in terms of what candidate Trump had said, I mean he had said that basically the 9/11 attackers came from Saudi Arabia. He pointed at Saudi Arabia as the -- as the origin point now in a very different place. That seems like the message, which is, he's very transactional. He's willing to put aside things he may have said in the past because he's got a new focus. That seemed to be the core of this, this is a transaction. SUSAN PAGE, \"USA TODAY\": That's right. And willing even to temper his language. You remember how often he ridiculed Barack Obama for refusing to say \"radical Islamic terrorism,\" a phrase that he didn't say on this trip, and in his willingness to confront Iran, not to acknowledge the elections in Iran last week, which were in effect really positive for the United States. The moderate Iranian candidate, the incumbent won big in Iran, a sign that Iran may be willing to live up to the nuclear agreement, wants to get closer to the -- wants to get closer to the west. That was -- that was not acknowledged. And clearly a sign that human rights concerns that Barack Obama would raise in a place like Saudi Arabia, off the table. MORELL: We -- we -- it's just important here that we remember that the Iranians, for years, and probably now more than they ever have before, are messing with the region. They are -- they are funding, training, providing counsel to terrorists, to insurgents throughout the region. This is -- this is a serious threat, not only to the nations there, but to the United States, right? So it is time that we pushed back and it is time that we worked with our Arab allies to push back. There are risks, right, that we're going to have to face and that we're going to have to mitigate, but doing nothing, as we were doing before, just gives the Iranians open running room. GOLDBERG: The -- there's a -- a quick point on -- on Iran. There's a way of calibrating our relations with this part of the world. We don't -- we want to stand with our allies, the Saudis, et cetera, against Iran, because Iran is the prime state sponsor of terrorism in -- in the world. That's the State Department. That was Barack Obama's State Department saying that. You want to do that without -- without creating conditions for unnecessary war. We also have to recognize that that election was a reality TV show version of an election. The people who were running were picked by the unelected supreme leader of Iran to run. So it is no -- it may be slightly more democratic than Saudi Arabia, but not by much. DICKERSON: Margaret, let me ask you, let's go over to the NATO meeting. This was a -- a much different kind of reception. BRENNAN: Yes. DICKERSON: And the president, after not lecturing and making a point of not lecturing with the Saudis, was -- nevertheless had a few lessons and things he would like the NATO leaders to do. BRENNAN: Exactly. There were protests in Brussels, a city that on the campaign trail the president called a hellhole. People were not giving him a warm reception in Europe and I think all of the people planning this trip very well knew they wanted the president's first trip abroad to begin with a warm embrace instead of the outcry that -- that resulted when he went to Europe. But at the NATO meeting, I think, you know, what the president is saying is essentially a more blunt version of what Barack Obama said and before that, that NATO members need to spend more on their own defense. But his mischaracterization of exactly how that funding mechanism works and his very blunt words from the podium there will also, while it may prod and get that result he wants, it may also make it politically more difficult for the leadership there, the people who are leading the democratic nations that we are aligned with militarily here, to convince their own public to stand and support the U.S. in the same way. There is a political cost to some of that. But I did -- you know, it was notable that the president didn't really talk about Russia, which, of course, countering Russian power in Europe was the premise for the foundation of NATO. DICKERSON: Mike, the -- one of the things that came up on this trip after the bombing in Manchester, there was this information that was leaked. How damaging was that to the information and intelligence sharing between the United States and Great Britain? MORELL: So now we've had two leaks of intelligence information provided to the United States by our allies that has been -- that has been given to others, right? This leak, given to the public, and President Trump's briefing to the Russian foreign minister of -- of the previous intelligence information. So we now have two. We have two data points. Now we have a line, right? Now we have a trend. And the rest of the world is watching this. And the rest of the word provides us intelligence information. And if they have a concern that we're not going to be able to protect that, they are going to be careful in what they provide. In fact, they'll -- they'll -- they'll hold back their most sensitive information. So this is very damaging, right? GOLDBERG: But they're also dependent on our intelligence, though, to a great degree. Isn't it -- it's a two-way street. MORELL: It's a two-way street. It's a two-way street, but they will hold back, I guarantee you. Absolutely, this is damaging, right? And there's two aspects of it. One is, a president who -- who apparently didn't know what he was doing, right, wasn't careful, wasn't properly briefed, whatever. DICKERSON: In the Oval Office. MORELL: In the Oval Office. And then, a week, right, from -- from -- from law enforcement or intelligence or somebody in the White House, right, there is a leak that -- that caused the second damage. And -- and the president is absolutely right, these leaks, which have -- which have grown in number -- I mean it's always been a problem but -- but they are bigger now than they've ever been before in number -- is a very serious problem. DICKERSON: Susan, let's look at the trip in its totality before we come back home. It was a nice break for the president because things were going -- it was a pretty tough ten days before this trip. Now he faces them. Put the trip in context with the rest of the Trump presidency. PAGE: People in the White House say it was the most effective, best nine days he's ever put together in a row, and it was in part because he was able to change the conversation from the conversation that he left in Washington and the conversation that he comes back to. You know, it was during the -- the flight over when Margaret was on Air Force One that the story broke that he had called FBI Director Comey a nut job and said that -- and said that he was relieved by -- some of the pressure on him from the Russian investigation had been relieved by -- by firing him. And when he came back the first question he got when he got off the plane was about the stories -- the stories about Jared Kushner have -- trying to establish a back channel communications with Russia. So this was an opportunity to change the conversation there. He didn't change the conversation here. DICKERSON: He's back now and seems to have a buffer on his Twitter stream. He's had -- went from not tweeting to having about ten launched this morning. Jeffrey, why not create a back channel to the Russians? We have common interests in Syria. Jared Kushner -- why isn't that just kind of what you do when you're a -- GOLDBERG: You know, sometimes thinking outside the box is overrated, as -- when you're -- when you're actually dealing with your adversaries. The idea of going to the Russian embassy to establish a channel that's outside the -- the realm of -- out of the American national security apparatus or a transition official is -- I mean, let's put it -- put it bluntly, if you put this in a satirical novel people would say, t hat's a little bit too much. It's a bad idea for any number of reasons. Even the Russians understood how bad an idea it was and were probably thinking this is not plausible. This is an attempt by the Americans to spy on us, because, remember, the Russian embassy is an intelligence base of operations for the Russians in America, so why would you possible do that. Also, there's an assumption that -- that -- that this was meant to talk about Syria. That that's -- that's their assertion. I don't know what the purpose of this -- this outreach was, but it just seems to be a foolhardy endeavor. DICKERSON: Mike, the administration officials are saying, look, this was an attempt to get around kind of the clotted normal relationships, have a conversation with the -- with the Russians. Planes are flying at the same time in Syria. Maybe we can work something out so we're not bumping into each other. MORELL: Yes. So I didn't see this as an attempt to open a back channel. I think that's a misnomer. It was an attempt to open a front channel. It was an attempt to have Mike Flynn talk regularly to the Russian ambassador. That seems appropriate to me, the incoming national security advisor talking to our allies and adversaries. That seems OK to me. What's -- what's strange here is why ask for the secrecy. Why ask for the security of using their communications? What are you trying to hide? And was this -- was this -- was this approach blessed by the president-elect and the vice president-elect? Was there a strategic discussion? Was Jim Mattis involved? He was nominated already, I believe, or he was on the verge of being nominated. So was there a strategy to do this? Those are the questions I would like to have answered. DICKERSON: Margaret, final question to you. There are stories and reporting about changes in the White House. What can you tell us about the staff changes, if there are any, coming? BRENNAN: Well, there's a lot of talk, but I feel like there always is. DICKERSON: Yes. BRENNAN: And when we come back from this trip and the president now back at the White House, we are expecting him to not only speak with his own lawyers, but we are expecting him to make some of these decisions that they said were punted, not only the Paris climate change agreement, but what happens with his own communications team. On this trip, we heard very little from them. They weren't front -- in front of cameras. They weren't explaining things. They actually didn't even put the president out there for a press conference. Very unusual. He was the only one of the seven G-7 ministers, or heads of states, to not answer questions. They are really trying to rein in communication. So whether Sean Spicer remains the spokesperson, whether they changed the method of communication, which they have been recently, putting orders, advisors to the president out there to try to change the topics back to more substance, less about headlines, that may be an approach, but, frankly, it only goes so far because someone needs to answer those questions. And that level of secrecy that we keep gesturing to inhibits what they would like to see as ending the story. DICKERSON: Right. And the chief communicator is always still the president. Thanks to all of you. And we'll be right back in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: Former FBI Director James Comey is expected to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee next month and will -- and hopefully will be able to answer some of the questions that have been raised about his dealings with the president. We turn now to Benjamin Wittes, editor of -- of the legal blog, Lawfare at the Brookings Institution. Welcome. Let me start before we get to the Comey testimony about the Jared Kushner story. Just, what's your take of it? Put it in some perspective for us. BENJAMIN WITTES, BROOKINGS INSTITUTION: Well, it's hard to know what to make of it. I mean it's a -- it's a -- it's a shocking set of allegations. It's not clear what they thought they were doing or what it means. If I were an FBI counterintelligence agent, I would be very interested in it. And it -- it is the latest in a long series of revelations that put the president's claims that there's nothing between him and Russia in a kind of head scratching relief. DICKERSON: Yes. The -- and -- and the -- what Jared Kushner seems to be doing was getting around the existing order of things. Get your -- give me -- back to the question of James Comey, who's somebody you've known for a while. What if the president was just saying -- the president just didn't know the rules. Was trying to get around the -- you know, he's got this investigation going on and he just says to James Comey, you know, it was just -- not obstruction, but just a president who is unfamiliar with politics, just didn't know what was going on. WITTES: Well, so, you know, one -- one possibility here is that we have, you know, a series of interactions that are each in and of themselves just expressions of the president's frustration with, you know, the circumstances he finds himself in with respect to the press and -- and an investigation and -- and interests in -- in the Russia stuff. As a general matter, you're actually not allowed to obstruct investigations, even when you don't believe that they have merit. And so the question of whether the aggregate of those interactions amounts to an obstructive pattern of behavior really doesn't depend on how the president feels about the merits of the underlying claim that there's something untoward about his relationship with Russia. DICKERSON: And does it matter about whether he knew this is just not the thing -- the kind of thing you're supposed to do when you're a president with your FBI director? WITTES: Well, so, look, I mean, obstruction as a general matter is a -- is a specific intent defense. So it actually really does matter what he meant to do. And I -- I think we should all be careful about making assumptions about what the president meant. What we have right now is a series of press accounts that are mostly, with the exceptions of the one that are based on conversations with me, they're -- they're mostly, you know, anonymously sourced. And so I think it's the better part of valor for everybody to reserve judgment until we have, you know, some set of -- of clear facts given under oath. And that's actually the significance of the fact that -- that the Senate Intelligence Committee wants the former FBI director's testimony. DICKERSON: And that testimony, is there any chance that might bump into the special counsel and, therefore, former Director Comey might not be able to say everything he knows? WITTES: Well, so, look, I -- I think that the former Director Comey, I am certain would not want to say anything that would impair the investigation, and I -- I suspect he would have -- he would sort of de-conflict with Mueller about any investigative equities that might be ongoing. I say that not having, you know, talked to him about it or -- or -- or inquired specifically. So I -- you know, I'm really sort of speaking my own opinion there, but that's the kind of thing he would do. In addition, he, while in office, has been very careful not to, you know, divulge anything classified in the context of his testimony. And I would expect he would do the same thing here. With, you know, the -- so -- but then I actually don't believe that there is a broad problem from Mueller's point of view with his testifying.  DICKERSON: His testifying. All right. WITTES: That's just a guess, but that's what I think. DICKERSON: All right. Ben, we've run out of time, I'm afraid. Thanks. We'll be right back with our -- a little more of our interview with Secretary of Defense Mattis. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: Finally on this weekend where we honor sacrifice and duty, we return to our conversation with Defense Secretary Mattis. We asked him about his concerns that one of the biggest challenges facing America today is its lack of unity. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DICKERSON: You mentioned in \"The New Yorker\" what you were worried about political -- the lack of political unity in America. MATTIS: Well, you know, I'm at West Point is where we're talking together, John, and you -- you look at these young people that graduated today, over 900 of them, from all walks of life, every religion probably in America is represented, every state is represented. And these people come together with an enthusiasm for protecting this experiment in democracy that we call America. And it takes people, I believe, with a fundamental respect for one another, with a fundamental friendliness toward one another that I worry is starting to slip away in our country. We still have it in the military. It's a diverse force. It's a force that can work together under the worst conditions. And I -- I just hope we can find our way back to engaging with one another, arguing strongly with one another, and then going down and having a root beer together or something and -- and having a good laugh about it as we work together for the best interests of the next generation of Americans who are going to inherit this country. DICKERSON: More than 40 years ago you enlisted and then today you speak as the secretary of defense at West Point. What's that like going from those two different ends in your -- in the span of your career? MATTIS: You know, it's a -- it's humbling, to tell you the truth, because as you go up, you realize how little of an exercise good judgment you really do, that it falls on the shoulders of very, very young people to carry this out inside the Department of Defense. I was an infantry officer in the Marines and the infantry are named because they're young infant soldiers, young soldiers, how they got their name. They're very young. And so it's really a humbling sense of just how great our younger generation is, how selfless it is, and what they are willing to commit, basically, signing a blank check payable to the American people with their very lives to protect it. And that's really what I've come away from this job with, is a deeper sense of -- of just being humbled by the commitment of others. (END VIDEOTAPE) DICKERSON: Our full interview with Secretary Mattis is available on our website, facethenation.com. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: That's it for us today. Thanks for watching. See you next week.",

            "article_content": "As President Donald Trump continues to craft his foreign policy doctrine, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice offers insight on America's problems on the international stage.\u00a0 Rice, the author of a new book \"Democracy: Stories from the Long Road to Freedom,\" sat down with CBS News' chief Washington correspondent and host of \"Face the Nation,\" John Dickerson, to discuss Russia and the growing tensions between the U.S. and North Korea.\u00a0 What follows is a full transcript of the interview, which aired Sunday on \"Face the Nation.\" JOHN DICKERSON: And joining us now is former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. She's got a new book out. It's titled \"Democracy: Stories from the Long Road to Freedom.\" Welcome, Madam Secretary. RICE: Thank you. JOHN DICKERSON: Very good to have you here. CONDOLEEZZA RICE: Great to be with you. JOHN DICKERSON: Senator Manchin and I were just talking about Russia so I'll start there with the question to you, which is: help Americans, who have heard all the political talk of Russia, how should Americans think about Russia and America's national security interests? CONDOLEEZZA RICE: Well, we have to think about Russia in terms of the last several years under Vladimir Putin. And I think what we're seeing is a president of Russia who has established authoritarianism at home and assertiveness and aggressiveness abroad. He really believes that he is re-establishing Russian greatness, that he has Russia back in the game. But the most important thing is that he hasn't seemed to respect certain lines in doing that. And the most important thing is to re-establish that the United States is going to defend its allies in NATO under Article 5: \"An attack upon one is an attack upon all,\" that the United States will not countenance the Russian military threatening our forces by flying very close to our ships or to our planes. I think rebuilding the Defense budget has helped to send that signal. And by the way, the strike in Syria has helped us send the signal that the United States is going to get leverage back in the Middle East. And so this is a dangerous time with the Russians, but it could also be, once we've established the ground rules, there are many things we need to cooperate with the Russians on including, by the way, the most vexing problem of North Korea, where they too can't be too comforted by a reckless North Korean leader with missiles and nuclear weapons that can reach Russia, as well as eventually the United States. JOHN DICKERSON: I want to get to North Korea in a second. But you write in your book about Russia being a tide that has gone deep into Europe when it's powerful and receded when it's weak. Where is America in terms of breaking that tide? I mean, is it halfway there, quarter of the way there? CONDOLEEZZA RICE: Well, we've always hoped that the Russians would see their role in the world as one built on the respect that comes from economic power, from soft power. But unfortunately, it's turned to military power again to establish itself. And I do think that we've begun to say to the Russians, for instance, what President Obama did to put rotating forces in the Baltic States and in Poland. That was a good message to the Russians that certain things are not acceptable. The strike in Syria was a good message. But we need to continue to send strong messages about Ukraine and other places that we're not going to countenance a Russia that aggressive against allies and states that shouldn't be threatened by their neighbors. JOHN DICKERSON: On North Korea, what should America not countenance? What is the tipping point for--? CONDOLEEZZA RICE: A lot has happened, John, in the last several years. This is now a different regime than even under Kim Jong-Il, the father. Kim Jong-Un is reckless, maybe even a bit unstable. He has made improvements in his nuclear capabilities that look as if he's getting closer to a deliverable nuclear weapon. And perhaps, I don't know what they're telling the president because I don't have the intelligence, but three, five years, the ability to reach the United States, that cannot be countenanced by any American president, I don't care who's in the White House. In order to deal with that you have to change the Chinese calculus, and I think that's what the administration's trying to do. They've worried most about the collapse of the regime, and their long border, and instability on their border. But you have to say to them, \"Even if you have to take very tough steps that might ultimately collapse the regime, you have to take steps. Because we will if you don't.\" And I think that's the message that you're starting to see. JOHN DICKERSON: In your book you are making the case for democracy. We have a president who talks about \"America first;\" we have a lot of Americans who are wary of U.S. entanglements overseas. Make the case for democracy to those who would be in the more, \"Hey, let's just not fuss with the overseas stuff.\" CONDOLEEZZA RICE: Well, the first thing is to remember what democracy promotion is not. It is not what we did in Iraq and Afghanistan. Those were security issues that we felt we had to solve, and then we said, \"Once we've overthrown those dictators we need to give those people a chance toward democracy.\" But most of democracy promotion is really about supporting those within their countries that want to have the simple freedoms that we have: the right to say what you think, to worship as you please, to be free from the knock of the Secret Police at night; places like Liberia, and Ukraine, and other places that are trying to get there. Now, Americans should recognize that of course we're going to defend our interests. But in the long run, our interests are better served when we have democracies that don't hire child soldiers, that don't harbor terrorists as a matter of state policy, that don't traffic in human beings, that don't start wars with one another. The quintessential example of this is that we took a risk after World War II that a democratic Germany would never threaten its neighbors, that a democratic Japan would never threaten its neighbors. And now not only have they not threatened their neighbors, they are firm allies and they are pillars of international stability. Democracy takes time. One of the points that I make in the book is, took us a long time. That first American Constitution counted my ancestors as three-fifths of a man. That first American Constitution didn't provide my father the right to vote in 1952 in Birmingham, Alabama. But I took an oath of allegiance to that same constitution as a black woman secretary of state with a Jewish woman Supreme Court justice swearing me in. Democracy takes time and we have to be a little bit more patient, and a little bit more helpful in speaking out for those who are still trying to get there. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about that because President Trump, whether it's Erdo\u011fan in Turkey, or el-Sisi in Egypt, or Putin in Russia, the sound of freedom does not seem to come often in conversations with him. Is there a cost from that? CONDOLEEZZA RICE: Well, I think it's early in the administration. There's something about the presidency that you recognize over time the tremendous not just responsibility, but the weight that it carries. And of course we're going to have to deal with the president of Egypt, of course we're going to have to deal with the president of Turkey. But it's well to remember, too, that our interests and our values suggest that when countries that we have good relations with and want good relations with actually reform before there are revolutions, our interests are served too. And I think that if the United States-- democracy promotion actually is very often not very expensive; it's supporting elections, supporting the building of civil societies, supporting a free press abroad. So I have no problem with the president meeting with those leaders; he has to. But we always need to speak for our values as well, and our values are the belief that we were endowed with certain rights by our creator. It can't be true for just us and not for them. JOHN DICKERSON: Final question. Is this president, like all presidents, is bristling against the constraints of democracy that you write a lot about in here. That has caused him to say critical things of the judiciary, of the press, and of Congress and the pace with which they work. How does that play for other countries that say, \"You see, you've got a messiness over there. Don't come tell us about how to do this?\" CONDOLEEZZA RICE: Well, there's no doubt that presidents get to be president, and then they realize that the founding fathers put all kinds of constraints on the presidency -- Congress, courts, civil society, a press, not to mention Americans who are kind of ungovernable anyway, and it can be frustrating. But I think that when I talk to others who are thinking that I say, \"It's also safest when the executive is actually constrained.\" That's what the founding fathers understood. They also understood that democracies are not perfect. We are imperfect, but our message to the world -- in many ways our best message to the world is that you just get up every day and you keep working to overcome those imperfections. And when you do that you get a chance to enjoy these amazing liberties. And so I'm very grateful to the founding fathers for having given us these institutions. I hope we can encourage others to have the same. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Secretary Rice, thank you so much for being with us. CONDOLEEZZA RICE: Thank you. JOHN DICKERSON: And we'll be back with our political panel. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",

            "article_content": "On his 100th day in office Saturday, President Trump spoke to CBS News' chief Washington correspondent and host of \"Face the Nation,\" John Dickerson, about his accomplishments at the traditional milestone and beyond, before flying to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to give a speech at a rally.  What follows is a full transcript of the interview, which aired on CBS earlier Sunday. Additional coverage of the interview will air Monday on \"CBS This Morning,\" broadcasting live from the White House.  JOHN DICKERSON: Mr. President, you and the administration said to North Korea, \"Don't test a missile.\" They have tested a missile. Is the pressure not working?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I didn't say, \"Don't test a missile.\" He's going to have to do what he has to do. But he understands we're not going to be very happy. And I will tell you, a man that I've gotten to like and respect, the president of China, President Xi, I believe, has been putting pressure on him also. But so far, perhaps nothing's happened and perhaps it has. This was a small missile. This was not a big missile. This was not a nuclear test, which he was expected to do three days ago. We'll see what happens.  JOHN DICKERSON: You say, \"Not happy.\" What does that mean?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I would not be happy. If he does a nuclear test, I will not be happy. And I can tell you also, I don't believe that the president of China, who is a very respected man, will be happy either.  JOHN DICKERSON: Not happy mean military action?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't know. I mean, we'll see.  JOHN DICKERSON: The Chinese, our allies, have been allies with North Korea. How are you sure that they're not using this as a way to test you?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You can never be sure of anything, can you? But I developed a very good relationship. I don't think they want to see a destabilized North Korea. I don't think they want to see it. They certainly don't want to see nuclear on -- from their neighbor. They haven't liked it for a long time. But we'll have to see what happens.  The relationship I have with China, it's been already acclaimed as being something very special, something very different than we've ever had. But again, you know, we'll find out whether or not President Xi is able to affect change.  JOHN DICKERSON: Why do--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I hope he is.  JOHN DICKERSON: Why do these missiles keep blowing up?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I'd rather not discuss it. But perhaps they're just not very good missiles. But eventually, he'll have good missiles.  JOHN DICKERSON: You don't want to discuss it because maybe we have something to do with it?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I just don't want to discuss it. And I think you know me very well, where you've asked me many times over the last couple of years about military. I said, \"We shouldn't be announcing we're going into Mosul.\" I said, \"We shouldn't be announcing all our moves.\" It is a chess game. I just don't want people to know what my thinking is. So eventually, he will have a better delivery system. And if that happens, we can't allow it to happen.  JOHN DICKERSON: What do you make of the North Korean leader?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I have -- I really, you know, have no comment on him. People are saying, \"Is he sane?\" I have no idea. I can tell you this, and a lot of people don't like when I say it, but he was a young man of 26 or 27 when he took over from his father, when his father died. He's dealing with obviously very tough people, in particular the generals and others.  And at a very young age, he was able to assume power. A lot of people, I'm sure, tried to take that power away, whether it was his uncle or anybody else. And he was able to do it. So obviously, he's a pretty smart cookie. But we have a situation that we just cannot let -- we cannot let what's been going on for a long period of years continue. And frankly, this should've been done and taken care of by the Obama administration. Should've been taken care of by the Bush administration. Should've been taken care of by Clinton.  JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you a question about the presidency. George W. Bush said this about being president. He said, \"You think one thing going in, and then the pressures of the job or the realities of the world are different than you thought.\" Do you agree?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think I can agree with that. I love doing it. I'm, you know, thoroughly enjoying it. It's always a challenge, like life itself is a challenge. But it's something that I really love and I think I've done a very good job at it.  JOHN DICKERSON: You said in an interview with Reuters that you thought it would be easier. Why?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, it's a tough job. But I've had a lot of tough jobs. I've had things that were tougher, although I'll let you know that better at the end of eight years. Perhaps eight years. Hopefully, eight years. But I'll let you know later on. I think we've done very well with foreign policy. I think we've done very, very well with relationships with other leaders.  I think we're doing great on trade deals. It's set. And I think we're doing well. I mean, our country is being out-traded at every single point. We're losing tremendous amounts of money on trade. And I think actually, I've been very consistent. You know, it's very funny when the fake media goes out, you know, which we call the mainstream media which sometimes, I must say, is you.  JOHN DICKERSON: You mean me personally or?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, your show. I love your show. I call it\u00a0Deface the Nation. But, you know, your show is sometimes not exactly correct. But when they talk about currency manipulation, and I did say I would call China, if they were, a currency manipulator, early in my tenure. And then I get there. Number one, they -- as soon as I got elected, they stopped. They're not -- it's not going down anymore, their currency.  JOHN DICKERSON: But that had been true before. That had been true--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No.  JOHN DICKERSON: --during the campaign, sir.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, not true to the extent that we're talking about. Much more important than that, as to when, but, you know, it did stop. And I was talking about it all during the campaign. And I would say that I was the one that got them to stop. But forget that.  JOHN DICKERSON: You were the one who got China--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He is working with us--  JOHN DICKERSON: --to stop manipulating their currency?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think so, during the campaign I talked about.  JOHN DICKERSON: Even if they were doing it before?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, they were doing it before. I mean, there was no question. I mean, they were absolute currency manipulators before. But somebody said, \"Oh, you didn't call him a currency manipulator.\" Now, you and I are just talking about how he's working -- I believe that President Xi is working to try and resolve a very big problem, for China also.  And that's North Korea. Can you imagine if I say, \"Hey, by the way, how are you doing with North Korea? Also, we're going to announce that you're a currency manipulator tomorrow.\" So the mainstream media never talks about that. They never say that. And that's, you know, unfortunate. It's just--  JOHN DICKERSON: Let me--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --it's just one of many things, John.  JOHN DICKERSON: You're a negotiator. If you need something from somebody, you need China to help you with North Korea, doesn't that send a message to China, \"We're not going to bug you about human rights, about intellectual property. In the South China Sea we're not going to put too much heat on you\"? Aren't you breaking one of your own negotiating rules?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. I think that, frankly, North Korea is maybe more important than trade. Trade is very important. But massive warfare with millions, potentially millions of people being killed? That, as we would say, trumps trade.  JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Okay? You understand what I'm saying. And if I can use trade as a method to get China, because I happen to think that China does have reasonably good powers over North Korea. Now, maybe not, you know, ultimate, but pretty good powers. Now, if China can help us with North Korea and can solve that problem--  JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --that's worth making not as good a trade deal for the United States, excuse me, right?  JOHN DICKERSON: What do you know now on day 100 that you wish you knew on day one of the presidency?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, one of the things that I've learned is how dishonest the media is, really. I've done things that are I think very good. I've set great foundations with foreign leaders. We have you know -- NAFTA, as you know, I was going to terminate it, but I got a very nice call from a man I like, the president of Mexico.  I got a very nice call from Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada. And they said please would you rather than terminating NAFTA --\u00a0 I was all set to do it. In fact, I was going to do it today. I was going to do as we're sitting here. I would've had to delay you. I was going to do it today. I was going to terminate NAFTA. But they called up and they said, \"Would you negotiate?\" And I said, \"Yes, I will negotiate.\"  JOHN DICKERSON: That's all you've learned, about the media? You knew from the campaign about the media. You said it all the time --  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, no, but the media didn't cover it that way. The media said, oh, I didn't terminate NAFTA.  JOHN DICKERSON: So--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: First of all, if you look at my statements, I said--  JOHN DICKERSON: No, no, I meant--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: \"If I'm not able to renegotiate NAFTA, I will terminate NAFTA.\" Well, I'll make that statement right now.  JOHN DICKERSON: Here's a question.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If I'm not able to renegotiate NAFTA, we will terminate NAFTA.  JOHN DICKERSON: Let's step back a minute.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Okay.  JOHN DICKERSON: Presidents have to learn how to adapt. Every president comes into the job, it's different than they expect, they must adapt. Surely, you've learned something else other than that the media is dishonest.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, no, I'm just saying--  JOHN DICKERSON: And how do you adapt?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --it was one of my disappointments.  JOHN DICKERSON: Give me another thing you learned that you're going to adapt and change because all presidents have to at this stage.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think things generally tend to go a little bit slower than you'd like them to go.  JOHN DICKERSON: Why?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Just a system. It's just a very, very bureaucratic system. I think the rules in Congress and in particular the rules in the Senate are unbelievably archaic and slow moving. And in many cases, unfair. In many cases, you're forced to make deals that are not the deal you'd make. You'd make a much different kind of a deal.  You're forced into situations that you hate to be forced into. I also learned, and this is very sad, because we have a country that we have to take care of. The Democrats have been totally obstructionist. Chuck Schumer has turned out to be a bad leader. He's a bad leader for the country. And the Democrats are extremely obstructionist.  All they do is obstruct. All they do is delay. Even our Supreme Court justice, as you know, who I think is going to be outstanding, Justice Gorsuch. I think that it was disgraceful the way they handled that. But, you know, I still have people, I'm waiting for them to be approved. Our chief trade negotiator. We can't get these people through.  JOHN DICKERSON: I want to get to--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They are obstructionists. And you know what that's hurting? It's hurting the country.  JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about health care -- Tucker Carlson interviewed you about six weeks ago when you were in the middle of health care negotiations. And you agreed with him that the health care bill wasn't going to help your supporters. That those who lived in rural areas, the older, were going to get hurt by that bill. And you told him--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me, the health care bill is going to help my supporters.  JOHN DICKERSON: Well, hold on. Let me just finish the question, if I may, sir--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Otherwise, I'm not going to sign it. I'm not going to do it.  JOHN DICKERSON: Well, this is why I wanted to ask you. You said to Tucker, \"We will take care of our people, or I am not signing it.\" You said you were going to negotiate.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, that's what I just said.  JOHN DICKERSON: So tell me what in the bill you've been negotiating to get--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But let me--  JOHN DICKERSON: --in that helps your supporters. I'm just trying to get the details of how your people--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Let me just tell you.  JOHN DICKERSON: --will be helped.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Pre-existing conditions are in the bill. And I just watched another network than yours, and they were saying, \"Pre-existing is not covered.\" Pre-existing conditions are in the bill. And I mandate it. I said, \"Has to be.\"  JOHN DICKERSON: So--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have, we're going to have lower premiums. And before you start there, let me just tell you something. Obamacare is dead. Obamacare right now, all the insurance companies are fleeing. Places like Tennessee have already lost half of their state with the insurance companies. They're all going. Obamacare, John, is dead. Okay, because we're being -- we're being compared to Obamacare. Just, so. Obamacare doesn't work--  JOHN DICKERSON: I just want to compare you to your own.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: One thing. No, no, it's important. I've got to compare it.  JOHN DICKERSON: No, no, but I want--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But you were saying about Obamacare.  JOHN DICKERSON: No, but I'm not. I'm asking what--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: With Obamacare--  JOHN DICKERSON: --you're going to do.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --the premiums are too high. The deductibles are through the roof, so you never get to use it. But more importantly, it's dead.  JOHN DICKERSON: So but in the bill, as it was analyzed, there were two problems. One, and you talked about this with Congressman Robert Aderholt, who brought you the example of the 64-year-old who under Obamacare the premiums--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But that was a long time ago, John.  JOHN DICKERSON: But has that been fixed?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Totally fixed.  JOHN DICKERSON: How?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: How? We've made many changes to the bill. You know, this bill is--  JOHN DICKERSON: What kind though?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --very much different than it was three weeks ago.  JOHN DICKERSON: Help us explain because there are people--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The bill--  JOHN DICKERSON: --out there wondering what kind of changes.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Let me explain. Let me explain it to you.  JOHN DICKERSON: Okay.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: This bill is much different than it was a little while ago, okay? This bill has evolved. And we didn't have a failure on the bill. You know, it was reported like a failure. Now, the one thing I wouldn't have done again is put a timeline. That's why on the second iteration, I didn't put a timeline.  But we have now pre-existing conditions in the bill. We have -- we've set up a pool for the pre-existing conditions so that the premiums can be allowed to fall. We're taking across all of the borders or the lines so that insurance companies can compete--  JOHN DICKERSON: But that's not in--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --nationwide.  JOHN DICKERSON: --this bill. The borders are not in--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Of course, it's in.  JOHN DICKERSON: --this bill. It's in that third bill, right, because--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's in the second phase.  JOHN DICKERSON: Okay.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's called phase one, phase two. And that's, in effect, second phase, which will get approved, which will quickly get approved.  JOHN DICKERSON: Let me--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But let me just explain something. There will be such competition. Right now, there's no competition. There will be such competition by insurance companies so that they can get health care and the people taking care of health care.  JOHN DICKERSON: So--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The other thing we're going to have is groups. Groups of people can negotiate. What's going to happen is the competition is going to drive down the premiums. In my opinion, much, much more than people understand.  JOHN DICKERSON: So what you've just described is the bill that you previously had said you worried wouldn't help your people. And here's why I ask. You said, \"Pre-existing conditions.\"  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, there were things in the other bill, the first version, which were not as good.  JOHN DICKERSON: Okay.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But when I watch some of the news reports, which are so unfair, and they say we don't cover pre-existing conditions, we cover it beautifully.  JOHN DICKERSON: Although--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'll tell you who doesn't cover pre-existing conditions. Obamacare. You know why? It's dead.  JOHN DICKERSON: In one of the fixes that was--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's not going to be here.  JOHN DICKERSON: In one of the fixes it was discussed pre-existing was optional for the states--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure, in one of the fixes. And they're changing it--  JOHN DICKERSON: --oh, okay. So it'll--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --and changing.  JOHN DICKERSON: --be permanent?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Of course.  JOHN DICKERSON: Okay. Well, that's a development, sir. So you're saying it's going to be pre-existing to everybody?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: John, this has evolved over a period of three or four weeks. Now, we really have a good bill. I think they could have voted on Friday. I said, \"Just relax. Don't worry about this phony 100 day thing. Just relax. Take it easy. Take your time. Get the good vote and make it perfect.\"  JOHN DICKERSON: Just to--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Most importantly, we're going to drive down premiums. We're going to drive down deductibles because right now, deductibles are so high, you never -- unless you're going to die a long, hard death, you never can get to use your health care--  JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you something--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --because the deductibles are so high.  JOHN DICKERSON: Okay. So what I hear you saying is pre-existing is going to be in there for everybody, it's not going to be up to the states?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Pre-existing is going to be in there and we're also--  JOHN DICKERSON: And it's not up to the states?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --going to create pools.  JOHN DICKERSON: Okay.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And pools are going to take care of the pre-existing.  JOHN DICKERSON: But on that crucial question, it's not going to be left up to the states? Everybody gets pre-existing, no matter where they live?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, but the states--  JOHN DICKERSON: Guaranteed?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --are also going to have a lot to do with it because we ultimately want to get it back down to the states.  JOHN DICKERSON: Okay. Is it a guarantee?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Look, because if you hurt your knee, honestly, I'd rather have the federal government focused on North Korea, focused on other things, than your knee, okay? Or than your back, as important as your back is. I would much rather see the federal government focused on other things--  JOHN DICKERSON: Let me.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --bigger things. Now, the state is going to be in a much better position to take care, because it's smaller.  JOHN DICKERSON: People out there with pre-existing conditions, they are worried. Are they going to have the guarantee of coverage if they have a pre-existing condition or if they live in a state where the governor decides that's not a part of the health care, or that the prices are going to go up? That's the worry. The American Medical Association says--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We actually--  JOHN DICKERSON: --it could effectively make coverage completely unaffordable for people.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --we actually have, well, forget about unaffordable. What's unaffordable is Obamacare, John.  JOHN DICKERSON: So I'm not hearing you, Mr. President, say there's a guarantee of pre-existing conditions.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We actually have -- we actually have a clause that guarantees.  JOHN DICKERSON: Okay, excellent. We got there.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have a specific clause--  JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --that guarantees.  JOHN DICKERSON: --about your tax plan.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Go ahead.  JOHN DICKERSON: Tax plan came out this week. It's got some big deficit numbers. You've said that's going to be made up by growth. Congressional--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, not only growth. It's going to be made up by better trade deals. It's going to be made up--  JOHN DICKERSON: Let me.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --by many different, reciprocal tax. As an example, we have countries where if we make a product and we send it to that country, they charge us 100% tax. If they make the same product and send it to us, we charge them nothing. You think that's smart? It's not.  JOHN DICKERSON: Look--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're going to come up with reciprocal taxes and lots of other things on those countries. But I view that more in trade. We're also going to fix all of our trade deals. We're going to have a very wealthy country again.  JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you this, Mr. President. Congress may not go along with--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Always.  JOHN DICKERSON: --so they're going to try and find some spending. Let me ask you about the question of Medicare. They're going to want, in Congress, to make up on the spending side, to change Medicare. Will you allow that?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You're not going to have to do it.  JOHN DICKERSON: But, sir, will you allow it?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You're not going to have to do it. I'm just telling you we are--  JOHN DICKERSON: Does President Donald Trump want them not to do that?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I would much prefer them not to do that, that's right.  JOHN DICKERSON: It sounds as if, having covered you in the campaign, it sounds like you're leaving the door open. On the campaign, you were quite clear. You said, \"I'm the guy who's not going to touch Medicare.\"  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Okay, then let me more clear. I'm not going to touch it, because I said it. Now, waste, fraud and abuse, I'm going to touch. If there's something in Medicare that's been abused, I will touch that. There are certain things, as you know, that have been absolutely abused. There are certain provisions in Medicare that are horrible and abusive and there's been terrible things happening. So that kind of stuff, I will absolutely touch.  JOHN DICKERSON: So if I--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But the concept of Medicare, I'm not touching.  JOHN DICKERSON: For me, if I have it now, or if I'm going to have it in the future, it's not getting cut?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Waste, fraud and abuse.  JOHN DICKERSON: And that's it?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And if there are things within Medicare that are being abused, I will touch that also.  JOHN DICKERSON: Other than that, it's tightened up?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's right. That's what it is. But here's what we do. We're going to grow. The numbers just came out for Obama's last year. 1.6 GDP. That means nothing. That's, like, 1% GDP. So I have gotten to know as you know, I really get along with a lot of other countries. So I talk to the heads of countries. \"How are you doing?\" \"Not well, not well.\" \"Why?\" \"GDP is 8%. GDP is 9%. We are doing poorly.\" GDP -- Our GDP is, like, 1%.  JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about your tax returns, sir. When your Treasury secretary was asked about whether you were going to release them, Secretary Mnuchin said, \"The president has no intention.\" Is that right?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I never spoke to him about it. Honestly, he's never asked me about it. I said, number one, I'm under audit. Right now, I'm under audit. After the audit is complete. It's a routine audit, but I have a very big tax return. You've seen the pictures. My tax return is probably higher than that from the floor. When you look at other people's tax return, even other wealthy people, their tax return is this big. My tax return is this high.  JOHN DICKERSON: I just wanted to make sure--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm under routine--  JOHN DICKERSON: --you weren't changing.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --audit. And I think it's a very unfair thing because I have been under audit almost, like, since I became famous, okay?  JOHN DICKERSON: Have you--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Not just political. I mean, I have been under audit, I'll bet you 12 or 13 or 14 years in a row. Now, I have friends that are wealthy people.  JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They've never been audited.  JOHN DICKERSON: You--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And I think it's very unfair.  JOHN DICKERSON: You first said that you were under audit, were going to wait till that was done, about 14 months ago. That seems like a long time. When do you think this might happen? Are you asking them?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It could happen soon. I don't know. I mean, I think--  JOHN DICKERSON: When? Give me a sense of--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --it's pretty routine, to be honest with you. But then I'll make a decision.  JOHN DICKERSON: A member of Congress suggested that a condition for getting tax reform would be releasing your tax returns. What do you think about that?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Oh, I don't know who did that. I mean, I don't care who did that. These are the people, you know, the great obstructionists.  JOHN DICKERSON: So you're not buying that deal.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Look where they are. Look where the Democrats have ended up. Hey, John, they had everything going. Now they don't have the presidency, they don't have the House, they don't have the Senate, and Schumer's going around making a fool out of himself.  JOHN DICKERSON: You said yesterday on FOX that Russia is a phony story. Which part of it is phony?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The concept of Russia with respect to us is a total phony story.  JOHN DICKERSON: Meaning the Trump campaign?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Of course, it's a total phony story. In fact, I just heard where General Flynn got his clearance from the Obama administration.  JOHN DICKERSON: But you don't mean--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me. I didn't realize this, when he went to Russia, it was 2015 and he was on the Obama clearance. When General Flynn came to us, as you now know, he already had the highest clearance you can have. I think the same clearance as the president of the United States would have. He had this really high clearance. And, by the way, they're so devastated because this only came up two days ago.  JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you this, sir.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Why wasn't this reported months ago?  JOHN DICKERSON: I--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But I watched one of your other competitors, and they were devastated--  JOHN DICKERSON: Look--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --by this news, because you know what? That kills them. That's the end of that subject.  JOHN DICKERSON: You don't think it's phony that they, the Russians, tried to meddle in the election? You believe that?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That, I don't know. I don't know.  JOHN DICKERSON: That you don't know or you do know?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I have a problem. You have Podesta, who, by the way, I understand has a company with his brother in Russia. Hillary's husband makes speeches in Russia. Hillary did a uranium deal with Russia. Nobody ever talks about that. But I don't know--  JOHN DICKERSON: You don't--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --because the F.B.I. was not allowed by Podesta to go in and check all of the records on their servers and everything else that you would normally have to check. That's number one.  Number two, knowing something about hacking, if you don't catch a hacker, okay, in the act, it's very hard to say who did the hacking. With that being said, I'll go along with Russia. Could've been China, could've been a lot of different groups.  JOHN DICKERSON: So President Donald Trump is ambivalent--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But it could've--  JOHN DICKERSON: --about or not ambivalent, you're not just not sure?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. We have to find out what happened. I'd love to find out what happened.  JOHN DICKERSON: But you don't think it's the Russians--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I can tell you one thing. Had nothing to do with us. Had nothing to do with this, and everyone knows it. And by the way, even my enemies on your show said, \"We haven't found anything that the Trump campaign did wrong.\"  JOHN DICKERON: But--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Do you agree with that?  JOHN DICKERSON: But there is agreement in the intelligence communities and other places and investigative communities on the Hill that Russia was--  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm okay with it.  JOHN DICKERSON: --involved in the election.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Honestly, John, I'm okay. But why didn't Podesta and the Democrats, why didn't they allow the F.B.I. to eject the server? They hired some company who somebody said some pretty bad things about, to go and check their server and give the information. So they were hacked. Why didn't they -- the Democrats allow the F.B.I.? They told the F.B.I., \"We are not going to allow you to do it.\" Why did they do that? Why did they do that, John? Why wouldn't they let the F.B.I. go in and check? And by the way, why didn't the F.B.I. complain about it?  JOHN DICKERSON: Mr. President, I think we're going to have to end it there.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The president of the United States of America, President Donald Trump!  (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: It was back to the comfort of a campaign rally for the president, as he marked his 100th day in office.  But, before that celebration, among the die-hard supporters in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, we sat down with the president at the White House for a wide-ranging interview, everything from the North Korea threat:  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I would not be happy. If he does a nuclear test, I will not be happy.  DICKERSON: Not happy mean military action?  TRUMP: I don't know. I mean, we'll see.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: To what he thinks of his new job.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: I love doing it. I'm, you know, thoroughly enjoying it. It's always a challenge, like life itself is a challenge. But it's something that I really love and I think I've done a very good job at it.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: Next, we traveled with him to a factory, where he signed the 32nd executive order of his presidency and said hi to some supporters.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: Thank you.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We love you!  TRUMP: Thank you.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: And this was a day to love his job and list his accomplishments.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: I am signing away. I have signed 29 new bills, a record not surpassed since the Truman administration. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: With no critics in sight, the president returned the love.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: The future belongs to all of you. So, with hope in our souls and patriotism in our hearts, I say these words to you tonight on 100 days of devotion, hard work and love for our great country.  Together, we will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America prosper again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again.  Thank you. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you.  (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: And at the end of the day, a private celebration with the staff on Air Force One.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  (APPLAUSE)  TRUMP: Congratulations to everybody. We all deserve it. This was a tough go, and it was really fun. And I just want to congratulate everybody.  And now we are going to do a great job for the American people. Thank you.  (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: The 100th day of the Trump administration, its highs and its lows, coming up on FACE THE NATION.  Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I am John Dickerson on this 101st day of the Trump administration.  We begin with our wide-ranging interview with the president, taped yesterday in the Roosevelt Room at the White House. We asked him about the news that North Korea had fired yet another test missile late last week, how he has changed his thinking on China, and what he has learned in his first 100 days in office.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  DICKERSON: Mr. President, you and the administration said to North Korea, Don't test a missile.  They have tested a missile. Is the pressure not working?  TRUMP: Well, I didn't say, don't test a missile.  He's going to have to do what he has to do. But he understands we're not going to be very happy. And I will tell you, a man that I've gotten to like and respect, the president of China, President Xi, I believe, has been putting pressure on him also.  But, so far, perhaps nothing's happened. And perhaps it has. This was a small missile. This was not a big missile. This was not a nuclear test, which he was expected to do three days ago. We'll see what happens.  DICKERSON: You say, not happy. What does that mean?  TRUMP: I would not be happy. If he does a nuclear test, I will not be happy. And I can tell you also, I don't believe that the president of China, who is a very respected man, will be happy either.  DICKERSON: Not happy mean military action?  TRUMP: I don't know. I mean, we'll see.  DICKERSON: The Chinese, our allies, have been allies with North Korea. How are you sure that they're not using this as a way to test you?  TRUMP: You can never be sure of anything, can you?  But I developed a very good relationship. I don't think they want to see a destabilized North Korea. I don't think they want to see it. They certainly don't want to see nuclear on -- from their neighbor. They haven't liked it for a long time. But we'll have to see what happens.  The relationship I have with China, it's been already acclaimed as being something very special, something very different than we've ever had. But, again, you know, we'll find out whether or not President Xi is able to effect change.  DICKERSON: Why do...  TRUMP: I hope he is.  DICKERSON: Why do these missiles keep blowing up?  TRUMP: Well, I'd rather not discuss it. But perhaps they're just not very good missiles. But, eventually, he'll have good missiles.  DICKERSON: You don't want to discuss it because maybe we have something to do with it?  TRUMP: I just don't want to discuss it. And I think you know me very well, where you've asked me many times over the last couple of years about military. I said, we shouldn't be announcing we're going into Mosul. I said, we shouldn't be announcing all our moves.  It is a chess game. I just don't want people to know what my thinking is. So, eventually, he will have a better delivery system. And if that happens, we can't allow it to happen.  DICKERSON: What do you make of the North Korean leader?  TRUMP: I have -- I really, you know, have no comment on him. People are saying, is he sane? I have no idea.  I can tell you this. And a lot of people don't like when I say it, but he was a young man of 26 or 27 when he took over from his father, when his father died. He's dealing with obviously very tough people, in particular the generals and others.  And, at a very young age, he was able to assume power. A lot of people, I'm sure, tried to take that power away, whether it was his uncle or anybody else. And he was able to do it. So, obviously, he's a pretty smart cookie.  But we have a situation that we just cannot let -- we cannot let what's been going on for a long period of years continue. And, frankly, this should've been done and taken care of by the Obama administration. Should've been taken care of by the Bush administration. Should've been taken care of by Clinton.  DICKERSON: Let me ask you a question about the presidency.  George W. Bush said this about being president. He said: \"You think one thing going in, and then the pressures of the job or the realities of the world are different than you thought.\"  Do you agree?  TRUMP: I think I can agree with that. I love doing it. I'm, you know, thoroughly enjoying it. It's always a challenge, like life itself is a challenge.  But it's something that I really love. And I think I've done a very good job at it.  DICKERSON: You said in an interview with Reuters that you thought it would be easier.  Why?  TRUMP: Well, it's a tough job. But I've had a lot of tough jobs.  I've had things that were tougher, although I'll let you know that better at the end of eight years, perhaps eight years, hopefully eight years. But I'll let you know later on. I think we've done very well with foreign policy. I think we've done very, very well with relationships with other leaders. I think we're doing great on trade deals. It's set. And I think we're doing well. I mean, our country is being out-traded at every single point. We're losing tremendous amounts of money on trade.  And I think, actually, I've been very consistent. You know, it's very funny when the fake media goes out, you know, which we call the mainstream media, which, sometimes, I must say, is you. But when...  (CROSSTALK)  DICKERSON: Do you mean me personally, or...  TRUMP: Well, your show. I love your show. I call it \"Deface the Nation.\" But, you know, your show is sometimes not exactly correct.  But when they talk about currency manipulation -- and I did say I would call China, if they were, a currency manipulator early in my tenure. And then I get there. Number one, they -- as soon as I got elected, they stopped. They're not going -- it's not going down anymore, their currency.  DICKERSON: But that had been true before. That had been true...  TRUMP: No.  DICKERSON: ... during the campaign, sir.  TRUMP: No, not true to the extent that we're talking about.  But much more important than that as to when, but, you know, it did stop. And I was talking about it all during the campaign. And I would say that I was the one that got them to stop. But forget that.  DICKERSON: You were the one who got China...  TRUMP: He is working with us...  DICKERSON: ... to stop manipulating their currency?  TRUMP: I think so, during the campaign. I talked about -- it was of our many...  DICKERSON: Even if they were doing it before?  TRUMP: No, they were doing it before. I mean, there was no question. I mean, they were absolute currency manipulators before.  But somebody said, oh, you didn't call him a currency manipulator. Now, you and I are just talking about how he's working. I believe that President Xi is working to try and resolve a very big problem for China also. And that's North Korea.  Can you imagine if I say, hey, by the way, how are you doing with North Korea? Also, we're going to announce that you're a currency manipulator tomorrow. So, the mainstream media never talks about that. They never say that.  And that's, you know, unfortunate. It's just one of...  DICKERSON: Let me ask you this.  TRUMP: It's just one of many things, John.  DICKERSON: You're a negotiator. If you need something from somebody, you need China to help you with North Korea, doesn't that send a message to China, we're not going to bug you about human rights, about intellectual property, in the South China Sea, we're not going to put too much heat on you? Aren't you breaking one of your own negotiating rules?  TRUMP: No.  I think that, frankly, North Korea is maybe more important than trade. Trade is very important. But massive warfare with millions, potentially millions of people being killed? That, as we would say, trumps trade.  DICKERSON: Let me ask you...  TRUMP: OK? You understand what I'm saying.  And if I can use trade as a method to get China -- because I happen to think that China does have reasonably good powers over North Korea. Now, maybe not, you know, ultimate, but pretty good powers. Now, if China can help us with North Korea and can solve that problem...  DICKERSON: Let me ask...  TRUMP: ... that's worth making not as good a trade deal for the United States, excuse me, right?  DICKERSON: What do you know now, on day 100, that you wish you knew on day one of the presidency?  TRUMP: Well, one of the things that I've learned is how dishonest the media is, really.  I've done things that are, I think, very good. I have done -- I've set great foundations with foreign leaders. We have, you know -- NAFTA, as you know, I was going to terminate it, but I got a very nice call from a man I like, the president of Mexico.  I got a very nice call from Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada. And they said, please, would you -- rather than terminating NAFTA -- I was all set to do it. In fact, I was going to do it today. I was going to do it as we're sitting here. I would've had to delay you. I was going to do it today. I was going to terminate NAFTA.  But they called up and they said, would you negotiate? And I said, yes, I will negotiate.  DICKERSON: That's all you've learned about the media? You knew from the campaign about the media. You said it all the time.  TRUMP: No, no, but the media didn't cover it that way. The media said, oh, I didn't terminate NAFTA.  (CROSSTALK)  TRUMP: First of all, if you look at my statements, I said...  DICKERSON: No, no, I meant...  TRUMP: ... if I'm not able to renegotiate NAFTA, I will terminate NAFTA. Well, I'll make that statement right now.  DICKERSON: Here's a question.  TRUMP: If I'm not able to renegotiate NAFTA, we will terminate NAFTA.  DICKERSON: Let's step back a minute.  TRUMP: OK.  DICKERSON: Presidents have to learn how to adapt. Every president comes into the job, it's different than they expect. They must adapt.  (CROSSTALK)  DICKERSON: Surely, you've learned something else, other than that the media is dishonest.  TRUMP: No, no, I'm just saying...  DICKERSON: And how do you adapt?  TRUMP: ... it's one of the -- it was one of my disappointments.  DICKERSON: Give me another thing you learned that you're going to adapt and change, because all presidents have to at this stage.  TRUMP: Well, I think things generally tend to go a little bit slower than you'd like them to go.  DICKERSON: Why?  TRUMP: Just a system. It's just a very, very bureaucratic system.  I think the rules in Congress, and in particular the rules in the Senate, are unbelievably archaic and slow-moving and, in many cases, unfair. In many cases, you're forced to make deals that are not the deal you'd make. You'd make a much different kind of a deal. You're forced into situations that you hate to be forced into. I also learned -- and this is very sad -- because we have a country that we have to take care of. The Democrats have been totally obstructionist. Chuck Schumer has turned out to be a bad leader. He's a bad leader for the country. And the Democrats are extremely obstructionist.  All they do is obstruct. All they do is delay. Even our Supreme Court justice, as you know, who I think is going to be outstanding, Justice Gorsuch, I think that it was disgraceful the way they handled that.  But, you know, I still have people, I'm waiting for them to be approved, our chief trade negotiator. We can't get these people through.  DICKERSON: I want to get to...  TRUMP: They are obstructionists. And you know what that's hurting? It's hurting the country.  DICKERSON: Let me ask you about health care.  Tucker Carlson interviewed you about six weeks ago, when you were in the middle of health care negotiations. And you agreed with him that the health care bill wasn't going to help your supporters, that those who lived in rural areas, the older were going to get hurt by that bill.  And you told him, you said...  (CROSSTALK)  TRUMP: Excuse me. The health care bill is going to help my supporters.  DICKERSON: Well, hold on. Let me just finish the question, if I may, sir.  TRUMP: Otherwise, I'm not going to sign it. I'm not going to do it.  DICKERSON: Well, this is why I wanted to ask you. You said to Tucker, \"We will take care of our people, or I am not signing it.\"  You said you were going to negotiate.  TRUMP: Well, that's what I just said.  DICKERSON: So, tell me what in the bill you've been negotiating to get...  TRUMP: No, but let me just -- let me tell you.  DICKERSON: ... in that helps your supporters. I'm just trying to get the details of how your people... TRUMP: Let me just tell you.  DICKERSON: ... will be helped.  TRUMP: Preexisting conditions are in the bill. And I just watched another network than yours, and they were saying, preexisting is not covered.  Preexisting conditions are in the bill. And I mandate it. I said has to be. So, we have -- we're going to have lower premiums. And before you start there, let me just tell you something. Obamacare is dead. Obamacare, right now, all the insurance companies are fleeing. Places like Tennessee have already lost half of their state with the insurance companies. They're all going.  Obamacare, John, is dead, OK, because we're being -- we're being compared to Obamacare. Just so -- Obamacare doesn't work.  DICKERSON: I just want to compare you to your own...  TRUMP: One -- one thing. No, no, it's important. I've got to compare it.  DICKERSON: No, no, but I want to...  (CROSSTALK)  TRUMP: ... saying about Obamacare.  DICKERSON: No, but I'm not. I'm asking about what...  TRUMP: With Obamacare...  DICKERSON: ... you're going to do.  TRUMP: ... the premiums are too high. The deductibles are through the roof, so you never get to use it. But, more importantly, it's dead.  DICKERSON: So -- but, in the bill, as it was analyzed, there were two problems. One -- and you talked about this with Congressman Robert Aderholt, who brought you the example of the 64-year-old, who under Obamacare, the premiums -- the premiums would go up for...  (CROSSTALK)  TRUMP: But that was a long time ago, John. You're talking about a long time...  DICKERSON: But has that been fixed?  TRUMP: Totally fixed.  DICKERSON: How?  TRUMP: How? We've made many changes to the bill. You know, this bill is...  DICKERSON: What kind, though?  TRUMP: ... very much different than it was three weeks ago.  DICKERSON: Help us explain, because there are people...  TRUMP: The bill...  DICKERSON: ... out there who wonder what kind of changes.  TRUMP: Let me explain. Let me explain it to you.  DICKERSON: OK.  TRUMP: This bill is much different than it was a little while ago, OK?  This bill has evolved. And we didn't have a failure on the bill. You know, it was reported like a failure. Now, the one thing I wouldn't have done again is put a timeline. That's why, on the second iteration, I didn't put a timeline.  But we have now preexisting conditions in the bill. We have -- we've set up a pool for the preexisting conditions, so that the premiums can be allowed to fall. We're taking across all of the borders or the lines, so that insurance companies can compete...  DICKERSON: But that's not in...  TRUMP: ... nationwide.  DICKERSON: ... this bill. The borders, it's not in this bill.  TRUMP: Of course it's in.  DICKERSON: It's in that third bill, right, because it's...  TRUMP: It's in the second phase.  DICKERSON: OK.  TRUMP: It's called phase one, phase two.  And that's, in fact, second phase, which will get approved, which will quickly get approved.  DICKERSON: Let me...  TRUMP: But let me just explain something.  There will be such competition. Right now, there's no competition. There will be such competition by insurance companies, so that they can get health care and the people taking care of health care.  DICKERSON: So...  TRUMP: The other thing we're going to have is groups. Groups of people can negotiate.  What's going to happen is, the competition is going to drive down the premiums, in my opinion, much, much more than people understand.  DICKERSON: So, what you've just described is the bill that you previously had said you worried wouldn't help your people. And here's why I ask. You said, preexisting conditions...  TRUMP: No, there were things in the other bill, the first version, which were not as good.  DICKERSON: OK.  TRUMP: But when I watch some of the news reports, which are so unfair, and they say we don't cover preexisting conditions, we cover it beautifully.  DICKERSON: Although...  TRUMP: I'll tell you who doesn't cover preexisting conditions. Obamacare. You know why? It's dead.  DICKERSON: In one of the fixes that was...  TRUMP: It's not going to be here.  DICKERSON: In one of the fixes, it was discussed preexisting was optional for the states.  TRUMP: Sure, in one of the fixes. And they're changing it...  DICKERSON: Oh, OK. So it would be permanent?  TRUMP: ... and changing it.  Of course.  DICKERSON: OK.  TRUMP: This is...  (CROSSTALK)  DICKERSON: Well, that's a development, sir. So you're saying it's going to be preexisting for everybody?  (CROSSTALK)  TRUMP: John, this has evolved over a period of three or four weeks.  Now, we really have a good bill. I think they could have voted on Friday. I said, just relax. Don't worry about this phony 100-day thing. Just relax. Take it easy. Take your time. Get the good vote and make it perfect.  DICKERSON: Just to inform...  TRUMP: But we're going to -- most importantly, we're going to drive down premiums. We're going to drive down deductibles, because, right now, deductibles are so high, you never -- unless you're going to die a long, hard death, you never can get to use your health care...  DICKERSON: Let me ask you...  (CROSSTALK)  TRUMP: ... because the deductibles are so high.  DICKERSON: OK.  So, what I hear you saying is preexisting is going to be in there for everybody; it's not going to be up to the states?  TRUMP: Preexisting is going to be in there. And we're also...  DICKERSON: And it's not up to the states?  TRUMP: ... going to create pools.  DICKERSON: OK.  TRUMP: And pools are going to take care of the preexisting.  DICKERSON: But on that crucial question, it's not going to be left up to the states? Everybody gets preexisting, no matter where they live?  TRUMP: No, but the states...  DICKERSON: Guaranteed?  TRUMP: ... are also going to have a lot to do with it...  DICKERSON: OK.  TRUMP: ... because we ultimately want to get it back down to the states.  DICKERSON: It's a guarantee?  TRUMP: Look, because, if you hurt your knee, honestly, I'd rather have the federal government focused on North Korea, focused on other things than your knee, OK, or than your back, as important as your back is.  I would much rather see the federal government focused on other things...  DICKERSON: Let me... TRUMP: ... bigger things.  Now, the state is going to be in a much better position to take care of, because it's smaller.  DICKERSON: People out there with preexisting conditions, they are worried.  Are they going to have the guarantee of coverage if they have a preexisting condition, or if they live in a state where the governor decides that's not a part of the health care, or that the prices are going to go up? That's the worry.  The American Medical Association says...  TRUMP: We actually...  DICKERSON: ... it could effectively make coverage completely unaffordable for people.  TRUMP: Yes, we actually have -- well, forget about unaffordable. What's unaffordable is Obamacare, John.  (CROSSTALK)  DICKERSON: So, I'm not hearing you, Mr. President, say there's a guarantee of preexisting conditions.  TRUMP: We actually have -- we actually have a clause that guarantees.  DICKERSON: OK, excellent. We got there.  TRUMP: We have a specific clause...  DICKERSON: Let me ask you...  TRUMP: ... that guarantees it.  DICKERSON: ... about your tax plan.  TRUMP: Go ahead.  DICKERSON: Tax plan came out this week.  It's got some big deficit numbers. You've said that's going to be made up by growth. Congressional...  TRUMP: Well, not only growth. It's going to be made up by better trade deals. It's going to be made up...  DICKERSON: OK. Let me...  TRUMP: ... by many different -- reciprocal tax.  As an example, we have countries where, if we make a product and we send it to that country, they charge us 100 percent tax. If they make the same product and send it to us, we charge them nothing. You think that's smart? It's not.  Look, we're going to come up with reciprocal taxes and lots of other things on those countries. But I view that more in trade. We're also going to fix all of our trade deals. We're going to have a very wealthy country again.  DICKERSON: Let me ask you this, Mr. President. Congress may not go along with...  TRUMP: Always.  (CROSSTALK)  DICKERSON: So, they're going to try and find some spending.  Let me ask you about the question of Medicare. They're going to want, in Congress, to make up on the spending side, to change Medicare. Will you allow that?  TRUMP: You're not going to have to do it.  DICKERSON: But, sir, will you allow it?  TRUMP: You're not going to have to do it. I'm just telling you, we are going...  DICKERSON: Does President Donald Trump want them not to do that?  TRUMP: I would much prefer them not to do that. That's right.  DICKERSON: It sounds if -- having covered you in the campaign, it sounds like you're leaving the door open. On the campaign, you were quite clear. You said, I'm the guy who's not going to touch Medicare.  TRUMP: OK, then let me more clear. I'm not going to touch it, because I have said it.  Now, waste, fraud and abuse, I'm going to touch. If there's something in Medicare that's been abused, I will touch that.  DICKERSON: Right.  TRUMP: There are certain things, as you know, that have been absolutely abused.  There are certain provisions in Medicare that are horrible and abusive, and there's been terrible things happening. So, that kind of stuff, I will absolutely touch.  DICKERSON: So, if I...  TRUMP: But the concept of Medicare, I'm not touching.  DICKERSON: For me, if I have it now, or if I'm going to have it in the future, it's not getting cut?  TRUMP: Waste, fraud and abuse.  DICKERSON: And that's it?  TRUMP: And if there are things within Medicare that are being abused, I will touch that also.  DICKERSON: Other than that, it's tightened up?  TRUMP: That's right. That's what it is.  But here's what we do.  DICKERSON: Yes.  TRUMP: We're going to grow. The numbers just came out for Obama's last year, 1.6 GDP. That means nothing. That's, like, 1 percent GDP. So, I have gotten to know, as you know, and getting -- I really get along with a lot of other countries. So, I talk to the heads of countries. How are you doing? Not well. Not well. Why? GDP is 8 percent. GDP is 9 percent. We are doing poorly. GDP -- our GDP is like, 1 percent.  (END VIDEOTAPE)  DICKERSON: When we come back, President Trump on the progress of releasing his tax returns and whether he really believes Russia tried to meddle in the last election.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: You notice now they are using -- everybody is using the word fake news? Where did you hear it first, folks?  (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)  (END VIDEO CLIP)  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: And we are back with more of our interview with President Trump.  This week, his treasury secretary was asked a familiar question when he unveiled the president's tax plan.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  QUESTION: Will the president release his tax returns so that...  (CROSSTALK)  STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: The president has no intention. The president has released plenty of information. And I think he has given more financial disclosure than anybody else.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: We asked the president about that.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  DICKERSON: Let me ask you about your tax returns, sir.  When your Treasury secretary was asked about whether you were going to release them, Secretary Mnuchin said, \"The president has no intention.\"  Is that right?  TRUMP: Well, I never spoke to him about it. Honestly, he's never asked me about it.  I said, number one, I'm under audit. Right now, I'm under audit. After the audit is complete -- it's a routine audit, but I have a very big tax return. You've seen the pictures. My tax return is probably higher than that from the floor.  When you look at other people's tax return, even other wealthy people, their tax return is this big. My tax return is this high.  DICKERSON: I just wanted to make sure...  TRUMP: I'm under routine...  DICKERSON: ... you weren't changing.  TRUMP: ... audit. And I think it's a very unfair thing, because I have been under audit almost, like, since I became famous, OK?  DICKERSON: Have you...  TRUMP: Not just political. I mean, I have been under audit, I'll bet you 12 or 13 or 14 years in a row.  Now, I have friends that are wealthy people.  DICKERSON: Let me ask you...  TRUMP: They've never been audited.  DICKERSON: You...  TRUMP: And I think it's very unfair.  DICKERSON: You first said that you were under audit and were going to wait until that was done about 14 months ago. That seems like a long time. When do you think this might happen? Are you asking them?  TRUMP: It could happen soon. I don't know. I mean, I think it's...  DICKERSON: What's -- give me a sense of...  (CROSSTALK)  TRUMP: ... pretty routine, to be honest with you.  DICKERSON: OK.  TRUMP: But then I'll make a decision.  DICKERSON: A member of Congress suggested that a condition for getting tax reform would be releasing your tax returns. What do you think about that?  TRUMP: Oh, I don't know who did that. I mean, I don't care who did that. These are the people, you know, the great obstructionists.  DICKERSON: So, you're not buying that deal?  TRUMP: Look where they are. Look where the Democrats have ended up.  Hey, John, they had everything going. Now they don't have the presidency, they don't have the House, they don't have the Senate, and Schumer's going around making a fool out of himself.  (END VIDEOTAPE)  DICKERSON: And in a moment, why President Trump is still skeptical of reports that Russia tried to influence the American election.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Next week, we will check in with a group of Pennsylvania residents about what is going on with their country and their government.  Plus, we will sit down with former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. She has got a new book out, \"Democracy: Stories From the Long Road to Freedom.\"  And we will be back in a moment.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: We have got a lot more of FACE THE NATION coming up in a moment, more of our interview with the president, plus our political panel, and Charlie Rose and Norah O'Donnell, my colleagues who I will be with at the White House tomorrow.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION and the final part of our interview yesterday with President Trump. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  DICKERSON: You said yesterday on Fox that Russia is a phony story. Which part of it is phony?  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The concept of Russia with respect to us is a total phony story. Now -  DICKERSON: You mean in the Trump campaign?  TRUMP: Of course it's a total phony story. In fact, I just heard where General Flynn got his clearance from the Obama administration.  DICKERSON: but you don't mean it's -  TRUMP: Excuse me. And when he went to Russia, I didn't realize this, when he went to Russia, it was 2015, and he was on the Obama clearance. When General Flynn came to us, as you now know, he already had the highest clearance you can have. I think the same clearance as the president of the United States would have. He had this really high clearance.  And, by the way, they're so devastated because this only came up two days ago.  DICKERSON: Let me ask you this, sir.  TRUMP: Why - why wasn't this reported months ago? But I watched one of your other competitors and they were devastated by this news -  DICKERSON: Look -  TRUMP: Because, you know what, that kills them. That's the end of that subject.  DICKERSON: You don't think it's phony that they, the Russians, tried to meddle in the election? You believe that.  TRUMP: That I don't know. I don't know.  DICKERSON: You don't know or you do know?  TRUMP: Well, I have a - a problem. You have Podesta, who, by the way, I understand has a company with his brother in Russia, Hillary's husband makes speeches in Russia, Hillary did a uranium deal with Russia, nobody ever talks about that, but I don't know because the FBI was not allowed by Podesta to go in and check all of the records and their servers and everything else that you would normally have to check. That's number one. Number two, knowing something about hacking, if you don't catch a hacker, OK, in the act, it's very hard to say who did the hacking. With that being said, I'll go along with Russia. It could have been China. It could have been a lot of different groups. But it could have been -  DICKERSON: So President Donald Trump is ambivalent about - or not ambivalent, you're just not sure? TRUMP: No, I'm not - no. We have to find out what happened. I'd love to find out what happened.  DICKERSON: But you don't think it's the Russians necessarily (ph)?  TRUMP: I can tell you one thing, it had nothing to do with us. It had nothing to do with this. And ever knows it. And, by the way, even my enemies on your show said, we haven't found anything that the Trump campaign did wrong.  DICKERSON: But -  TRUMP: Do you agree with that?  DICKERSON: But there is agreement in the intelligence communities and other places and investigative communities on The Hill that - that Russia was involved in the election.  TRUMP: I'm OK with that. Honestly, John, I'm OK. But why didn't Podesta and the Democrats, why didn't they allow the FBI to check the server.  DICKERSON: Look -  TRUMP: They hired some company who somebody said some pretty bad things about to go and check their server and give the information. So they were hacked. Why didn't they allow - why didn't the Democrats allow the FBI - they told the FBI, we are not going to allow you to do it. Why did they do that? Why did they do that, John? Why wouldn't they let the FBI go in and check? And, by the way, why didn't the FBI complain about it?  DICKERSON: Mr. President, I think we're going to have to end it there.  TRUMP: Thank you.  (END VIDEOTAPE)  DICKERSON: More of our interview will air on CBS \"This Morning\" tomorrow morning in a live broadcast from the White House.  We turn now to our political panel for some analysis on this very newsy last 100 days. Julie Pace is White House correspondent for the Associated Press, Ed O'Keefe covers politics for \"The Washington Post\" and is a CBS contributor. We're also joined by our CBS White House team, White House and senior foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan and chief White House correspondent Major Garrett.  And, Major Garrett, I'm going to start with you.  MAJOR GARRETT, CBS NEWS CORRESPONDENT: OK.  DICKERSON: One hundred days. You've been to all of those Trump rallies. GARRETT: Sure.  DICKERSON: There was another one last night. Give us your sense of where things are.  GARRETT: Well, let me just talk about the interview, because I think there were two very important things that were said that caught my ear. One, the president went out of his way to a certain context praise Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, calling him a smart cookie. How that will be translated in North Korea I'm not sure, but the people who are the Trumpologists will say that's nearest to high - the highest praise the president can give anyone that he respects. It's a signal from this president that he is trying to, at least on a personal level, take the volatility possibly out of this budding relationship. Point one.  Point two, on the domestic front, he called the Senate rules unbelievably archaic, slow moving and unfair. What is the singular accomplishment of this administration in its first 100 days? Filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court. How was it done? By changing the rulings of the Senate to a straight 51 vote, majority vote. What is blocking and will block this president and his agenda in the Senate going forward? Sixty votes. There is active, constant conversation, this White House, on legislation in the Senate, shifting it through the rules from 60 to 51, simple majority. And those words from the president range loudly in my ear as to what his intentions are and where we may see these issues and the debate about Senate rules going.  DICKERSON: And let me ask you about Major's point on the filibuster, which is really interesting. Mitch McConnell doesn't want to change the filibuster - wants to keep that 60 vote threshold. But the rally that I was at last night and the - the - the thing that Donald Trump has created can over run Mitch McConnell --  ED O'KEEFE, CBS NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: If -  DICKERSON: To Major's point -  O'KEEFE: I'm glad - I'm glad you heard what I heard because I - I really remember this past week, Lindsey Graham telling me, you know, there's no support for that. I don't like it. We're going to block it. But you're right, if he keeps this up, if he brings it up in these interviews, if he gets his base to support, to call their senators, the Republican senators, and say, you have to make this change, what's to say it won't happen?  They understand in the Senate that you do this and they basically become a smaller, older, more - better compensated version of the House and - and there are a lot of senators who don't want to be a part of that. And it could be a real showdown should that happen at some point in the next year, two years. There were some who thinking this - the debate doesn't ultimately happen for another decade, but there are others who see what the president is saying and saying, it could happen a lot sooner.  DICKERSON: Margaret, let me get your take on the president's foreign policy views, either with respect to North Korea or the other countries that he's engaged with. He - he puts that in the win column. He has a lot of things in the win column, but he puts that pretty high up, his interaction with other leads - foreign leaders. How do you access his diplomacy?  MARGARET BRENNAN, CBS NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think it's - it's not a fully formed thought yet, right? You have the beginnings of policies and you haven't seen them actually play out. It's interesting to hear the president consistently in his tweets, in the interview, praise as well the leader of China, Xi Jinping, a man who is very careful with his diplomacy, very careful with his words and what he says is his policy. Very different than the president we have there. And to have him consistently really kind of publicly shame China is a new twist on essentially the old Obama policy, which was, put more pressure on China to try to reign in their client in Pyongyang, to consistently say every time Kim Jong-un does this, it's embarrassing not me, it's embarrassing Xi Jinping, is a new approach. It's interesting to see that.  The smart cookie comment, wow, yes, how do you translate that? But I think that expression of empathy and that opening towards negotiation, the question I have is, when you're going in the State Department and cutting 2,000 heads, when you're cutting their budget by 30 percent, who's leading those negotiations? Who within the administration is going to take the road map that the president is starting to try to place here?  DICKERSON: I thought it was interesting also to hear the president talk about the power relationship in North Korea.  BRENNAN: Yes.  DICKERSON: This is a president who pays attention to the power and other powerful leaders and how they get around maybe their judiciary senators (ph) -  BRENNAN: And he specifically mentioned the uncle. That was really interesting too.  JULIE PACE, ASSOCIATED PRESS: Yes.  DICKERSON: Yes.  BRENNAN: A man who he had killed in 2013 by artillery fire.  DICKERSON: Right.  GARRETT: And the president has some experience with inner office rivalries.  PACE: Just a bit.  BRENNAN: We haven't - we haven't gotten there yet. Let's -  DICKERSON: Julie, pick - pick up on - on this. You interviewed the president. Got a lot of coverage for that interview. You know, he traveled a road this week in terms of some of the things he said, he seemed to be at pains in our interviews to say, I love the jobs. It's not as hard as other things I've done. Whereas in other interviews he talked about its enormity. Where - what do you think of where he is at 100 days.  PACE: I think it's so interesting because you see President Trump going back and forth between these two views of the job. On the one hand he is still supremely confident in his own abilities, his own ability to push through a pretty ambitious agenda, to overhaul Washington, and to live up to the hopes of his supporters. On the other hand, you see him wrestling with, I think, the reality of his presidency, which is that this is not going to be easy, and he is dealing with institutions that don't change. Not only do they not just not change quickly, they don't change at all in some cases. So you see him going back and forth.  I think the question that I have looking forward in his presidency is, what can he take away in terms of lessons learned? Can he adapt to this city, how can he adjust his White House team, how can he adjust his legislative strategy? We haven't really seen any indications on that front yet.  O'KEEFE: Although there are - there are some glimmers of hope. We were exploring this subject this week for a story that's in today's paper and Susan Collins said, look, you know, at the beginning, we weren't hearing from anyone at the White House. They didn't have a staff in place who was capable of talking to legislators about legislation. But she said, on Thursday, I had a 45 minute conversation with the head of the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services. We talked about my concerns in the House GOP health care plan, which based on what the president said today may need to be rewritten yet again, but she said, I got 45 minutes with her and she listened to me and she took notes and we laid out my specific concerns.  She said the other thing that's going on that people don't realize, the vice president's holding small dinners with senators at his house on Wednesday nights now, both parties, trying to get them to talk to each other and get a sense of what is possible in Washington. She said this is all very encouraging and it needs to continue.  DICKERSON: We're going to take a break quickly here. I want to stay with this idea of adaptation and talk to you two about that when we get back. But let's take a break. Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: And we're back with our panel.  Major, pick up on this idea of lessons learned.  GARRETT: So I would say the last 30 days have been vastly different than the first 60, 65 to 70, because the White House is better organized. It has a better flow of information. It has a better decision-making process. It has also done something that President Trump, when he was a candidate and alluded to, and we've begun to see it, which is the empowering of cabinet secretaries. Giving them an autonomy the previous White Houses, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, essentially took away from cabinet secretaries. Made them subservient to every wish and inclination and communications fine pointery from the West Wing. Cabinet secretaries are coming to the White House briefing on their own agenda, in their own words, with their own people. And if this trend continues and there is a re-empowering of cabinet secretaries, I think it's a significant shift for the way the executive branch functions and it may work for this president in his organizational model as well. That's something I've definitely seen signs of in the last 30 days.  DICKERSON: That's interesting.  Margaret, in that model sometimes what happens though is you have cabinet secretary who - so you have a U.N. ambassador who says one thing, a secretary of state who says one thing and a president who says one things and sometimes people are confused when there's not a consistent voice. Is that a challenge to that model?  BRENNAN: It's a challenge for every single one of our allies and some of our adversaries. I can't tell you how often the question is asked, well, which one is the actual policy, because nuance is - is what they're looking for and often you get just outright contradiction.  I think some of the interesting things there that you picked up on in your exchange with the president, he pretty much is explicitly telling you, we are - we cut a quid pro quo with China. That's our China policy, OK? I'm not going to criticize you for currency manipulation, something I said you did, they did in the past and they're widely assumed to have stopped. You know, putting pressure on the U.N. in 2014, he is saying they stopped because I told them to. That's interesting, but that's the quid pro quo policy for China.  What is it towards every other issue and every other challenge? And why, at the end of your interview on Russia, did he return to some of his old language, where I thought particularly after that serious strike we had started to see the president have a new view of Vladimir Putin and his meddling. But he returned to that, in many ways, a denial of the election hacking that 16 U.S. agencies said happened.  DICKERSON: Yes. He does seem to be in that very position.  Julie, let me ask you about the president's decision on NAFTA this week. How much of a reversal was that? And then, more broadly, what do we know about when and how the president changes his mind?  PACE: I think there's a lot more that we need to know about the NAFTA decision. Margaret and I were talking about this earlier. That it's a bit confusing about how this all evolved. On the one hand you had White House officials who were pushing this idea that there was going to be an order from the president to terminate NAFTA, and they were happy to have that message out there. Then, within hours, you have phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Canada and the president is trying to say, I'm now in a stronger position because I threatened termination. I'm now in a stronger position as we move forward with renegotiating the deal. We don't know what he wants to renegotiate in the deal necessarily. We don't know that he necessarily is in a stronger position. We don't know who called who in some cases with these foreign leaders. And I think more broadly for his trade policy, it leaves open a lot of questions about how forceful he's going to be in terms of looking through these deals and trying to put U.S. workers in a stronger position. He made that - that quick step to pull the U.S. out of TPP. That was a promise kept for him. But I think NAFTA is a much bigger challenge. He's hearing that not just from Capitol Hill but from within his own administration, from some of these cabinet secretaries who are saying, you might want to be careful as you move forward here.  GARRETT: Chiefly Wilbur Ross -  DICKERSON: Explain that.  GARRETT: Who delivered that message directly to the president, sent a memo to Congress essentially taking a much softer approach to a renegotiation of NAFTA than the president articulated or certainly Steve Bannon has driven within the West Wing.  BRENNAN: And while the president says renegotiation begins now, they haven't even gotten the authority from Congress to do so.  PACE: Right.  BRENNAN: So it's - it's - it's not clear beyond the PR what's actually happening yet.  GARRETT: But in the billboard sense it sends a message to the rest of America's future and potential trading partners, he's serious about this nationalist approach. If he's willing to pick a fight with Canada and Mexico, considering where they positioned themselves, two and three as our trading partners, then he means what he says, at least in taking a reexamination of all existing trade and all future trade. And at the billboard level, which this president likes to communicate at, that's an important message.  DICKERSON: Right.  The - the - Ed, tell me about what you think is going to happen with health care. It - it's at - well -  O'KEEFE: Well, just as we sit here, actually, I was getting some guidance from a senior Republican congressional aide on what the president was saying there and they - and they believe there is more than one way to address the problem of covering pre-existing conditions, that there will be various ways for it to be done and not necessarily what the president was saying there. He's saying, one way or another, they're going to be taken care of is essentially the early interpretation of what he told you.  Look, they - they were counting votes into late last week. It is not dead again quite yet. But it's also not clear when they would hold a vote. The House is in this coming week and their primary responsibility, as it was last week, is to keep the government open. Then they're on break for another week when they're probably going to go home and get yelled at again about this. And so it may be now late May until the House actually takes this up again, which leaves plenty of time to renegotiate things and - and try to figure out whether, in fact, there is enough support for it.  DICKERSON: Major, 30 seconds on the president's tax plan and - and - and where you see it going from here with Congress (INAUDIBLE).  GARRETT: Health care is vitally important to it at this tactical level. The conservative groups oppose the original bill, the House bill, on health care. They're for it now. Why? Because their donors told her, we can't - told them, we can't get to tax reform until we get health care. That alliance keeps health care alive -  DICKERSON: Yes.  GARRETT: And keeps tax reform alive. And until they're fully dead and buried by the president's words, you've got to keep an eye on them.  DICKERSON: All right. Thanks to all of you for being here with us today. And we'll be back in a moment with Norah O'Donnell and Charlie Rose. Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Joining us are CBS \"This Morning\" co-anchors Norah O'Donnell and Charlie Rose, in town preparing for tomorrow's broadcast at the White House.  And I get to ask you guys questions. Usually I'm at this - I'm at this table -  NORAH O'DONNELL, CBS \"THIS MORNING\" CO-HOST: That's right, we usually have this flipped around.  DICKERSON: Yes. Exactly.  O'DONNELL: That's good. (INAUDIBLE).  CHARLIE ROSE, \"CBS \"THIS MORNING\" CO-HOST: We're on your turf, so you have at it.  DICKERSON: Yes. Yes.  Charlie, what do you want to know about this administration? If there's a question at the heart of it, what is it for you?  ROSE: Well, clearly, Donald Trump is a man - there are many Donald Trumps. We know that. Clearly he has changed the presidency. But I want to know how the presidency has changed him and the opinions he has changed and what impact they will have on his future and the country's future.  DICKERSON: Yes. Norah, what's your - what's your feeling about - he - the president seems in one hand, in some of his interviews, reflective and saying it's harder than I thought. And on the other hand, it's going great. It's wonderful. It's better than ever. What do you -  ROSE: That's why there are many Donald Trumps.  DICKERSON: Right. Exactly.  O'DONNELL: It was a great interview, John, by the way, great interview.  DICKERSON: Thank you.  O'DONNELL: I thought, once again, you know, trying to get an answer out of Donald Trump is lying like trying to pin Jello to the wall. It's hard. And his lack of facility with understanding what might be in the new repeal and replace Obamacare is part of the frustration. So we want to know so much, but I'm not sure the president is in a position to tell us that much.  I think the key question I have is, who is driving policy inside the White House on the domestic front, on the national security front? And we know that there are multiple centers of power. But it affects relations with Congress. And I've said this before but I'll say it again, that Republicans have a historic opportunity for change. It is so rare for the party to control the executive and the legislative branch. It has only happened six years in the past 70 years. George W. Bush had four of them. They can do a lot. They're missing an incredible opportunity if they're not working together with leaders on The Hill. And it appeared yesterday from your interview, and I'm curious your take too, is it wasn't clear that the president had a full understanding of what is in the Republican's repeal and replace, their current form of that bill.  DICKERSON: I think he wants to get things done. And think, particularly in going to the rally, you see - and he connected with that energy and he wants to get things done for those people. And I think the details are - as long as they match up with those people, that's what -  ROSE: That's jobs and growth.  DICKERSON: That's what he wants. Yes.  ROSE: Jobs and growth.  O'DONNELL: I -  ROSE: The - turning to foreign policy just for a second. It is - I'm amazed at how he talks about Xi Jinping, the leader of China, the way he does. He's his new best friend.  DICKERSON: Yes.  ROSE: And he's going to help him. Does Xi Jinping feel the same way? Is that a genuine relationship that can make a difference?  DICKERSON: Yes. He seems, when he talks about foreign leaders, he just - he understands power, goals. It's very tactical and very transactional. And - Norah, what were you going to say?  O'DONNELL: Well, I was going to say, it reminded me - someone once said, don't confuse effort with accomplishment. And the president, in that rally that you, I know, went with him last night, you know, he is the champion of the forgotten man and woman.  DICKERSON: Yes.  O'DONNELL: But does he know how his policies will affect the forgotten man and woman? What are - what are those policies? And I think that's really the journalistic challenge that we face over the coming year is - is not only learning what his intent is, because I don't think it's entirely clear, and also then what becomes the process of the actual legislation when something comes out (INAUDIBLE) -  ROSE: And does he mean it when he says, anything that affects them I will not sign.  DICKERSON: Yes.  ROSE: If it makes their life more difficult, I will not sign.  The interesting thing for me is - is how did you see him differently and what did you think you came away with in terms of what he was saying on health care?  DICKERSON: Well, on health care, I think it is, you know - I think he wants the - a result and if they can tell him, look, this result is what you're getting, then he's good with it, which is, it's going to be good for my people and it's an accomplishment and we can move on. And as Major pointed out, there is this connection with health care and taxes. Health care has to happen first to lower the budget base line so that you can do more with taxes.  But one thing I was struck about, Norah, to your point is, is that at that factory we went by, he is out there swinging every day for those gays who wear boots with steel toes on them. And as long as they see him swinging for them, I think they are 95 percent of the way there, and the details, which are so crucial, as you quite rightly point out because they'll matter in the end, but I think they will wait a long time until they need the details.  O'DONNELL: They'll wait. They'll wait to - to accomplish those things.  DICKERSON: Yes.  O'DONNELL: We're going to be inside the East Room of - of the White House tomorrow and I know you'll join us as we're broadcasting live, our show, CBS \"This Morning.\" And we're going to have at the table a number of the president's senior foreign policy advisors and economic advisors, and I know we want to get a sense for ourselves is, when you go inside the White House is, is how they're - who they're operating and how he's going to continue to do just that.  DICKERSON: Right. Exactly.  Well, I'm really looking forward to it tomorrow with both of you.  O'DONNELL: And you have - you have parts of your interview that you didn't air this morning, right?  DICKERSON: We do. We have - exactly. We have much more of our interview, both at the White House and then on the road with him yesterday, in and around his various things. So we'll be able to dissects all of that.  O'DONNELL: Thanks for having us.  DICKERSON: I can't think of two people I'd rather do it with.  ROSE: Thank you, John.  DICKERSON: Thanks to both of you.  O'DONNELL: Yes. And Gayle will be with us as well, yes.  DICKERSON: Yes, well, Gayle too, but -  O'DONNELL: Yes.  DICKERSON: Thanks, y'all.  O'DONNELL: Thank you.  DICKERSON: And we'll be right back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: That's it for us today. Thanks for watching FACE THE NATION. And I'll see you tomorrow morning on CBS \"This Morning.\" I'm John Dickerson.  END",

            "article_content": "Rex Tillerson, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for secretary of state, is testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at his confirmation hearing. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, is the chairman of the panel and Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, is the committee\u2019s top Democrat.\u00a0 Catch up on all of the key highlights here: 6:01 p.m. Reporters approached Rubio in the hallway outside the hearing room and asked him about his position on Tillerson so far.\u00a0 \u201cMany of his answers were concerning to me, and there\u2019s a chance now to submit some questions in writing, which we\u2019ll do as well and we\u2019ll go back and consider everything. I\u2019ll read through it again and I\u2019ll make a decision here very soon,\u201d Rubio said.\u00a0 Asked if he\u2019s leaning one way or the other, he said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t characterize it that way quite yet. I mean it\u2019s clear I;m concerned about some of his answers and encouraged by a few others. We\u2019ll wait over the next couple of days and then we\u2019ll make a decision.\u201d\u00a0 Rubio said he\u2019s prepared to stall the nomination in committee if he decides to oppose Tillerson: \u201cI\u2019m prepared to do what\u2019s right.\u201d\u00a0 5:45 p.m. Tillerson is asked if he would advise Mr. Trump that waterboarding and torture is illegal and immoral. \u201cI think others have opined on that sufficiently,\u201d Tillerson said, referring to Jeff Sessions and Gen. James Mattis. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t disagree with what they said...I agree with what they said.\u201d 3:35 p.m. Tillerson was asked about his stance on the Paris climate agreement that was negotiated under the Obama administration.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re better served by being at that table than leaving that table,\u201d Tillerson said, which stands in direct contrast to Mr. Trump\u2019s previous remarks in which he said he\u2019d want to \u201ccancel\u201d the deal. 3:18 p.m. Shaheen asked Tillerson to share his view on Mr. Trump\u2019s original proposal to ban Muslims from entering the U.S.\u00a0 \u201cNo, I do not support a blanket-type rejection of any particular group of people,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Asked if he would support a U.S. registry for Muslims, Tillerson said, \u201cI would need to have a lot more information over how such an approach would be constructed.\u201d\u00a0 He also added that if such a registry were used as a tool for vetting, he said it would probably extend to other groups. 2:45 p.m. Rubio asked Tillerson about the Obama administration\u2019s new policies regarding travel to and business with Cuba. Tillerson said he would do a complete review of recent executive orders from President Obama.\u00a0 Asked if he would advise Mr. Trump to veto a bill seeking to lift the U.S. embargo on Cuba, Tillerson said, \u201cIf confirmed, yes, I would.\u201d\u00a0 Tillerson, however, did not give Rubio an answer regarding whether Cuba belongs on the U.S. state sponsors of terrorism list. 2:31 p.m. After some questions from Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, the hearing has now moved into a second round of questions from lawmakers. 1:32 p.m. The hearing has recessed until 2:15 p.m.\u00a0 1:28 p.m. In an exchange with Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, Tillerson said that unless there\u2019s an agreement that Ukraine accepts, the U.S. won\u2019t recognize Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014. 1:20 p.m. Tillerson is asked about the Iranian nuclear deal and said if confirmed, he would do a \u201cfull review of that agreement as well as any number of side agreements that, as I understand, are part of that agreement.\u201d Tillerson said that he\u2019d like to know whether Iran is complying with the agreement and would like to review the ability to verify that Iran is complying. He added that no one disagrees with the objective that Iran shouldn\u2019t have a nuclear weapon. He said, however, that the current deal freezes Iran\u2019s ability to progress with developing a nuclear weapon, but he said it doesn\u2019t deny Iran the ability to buy one.\u00a0 \u201cWhat comes at the end of the agreement,\u201d Tillerson said, is what he\u2019d like to evaluate. 1:15 p.m. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Delaware, asked Tillerson if he views RT as Russian propaganda and asked how he would use the State Department to push back against those efforts.\u00a0 Tillerson suggested the U.S. should use the opportunity to communicate facts to the people of Russia to counter \u201calternative reporting of events\u201d that are presented to Russians by outlets that are controlled by Moscow.\u00a0 1:08 p.m. Barrasso asked Tillerson to comment on the Obama administration\u2019s decision to abstain during the vote on the U.N. Security Council resolution regarding Israeli settlements last month. \u201cIsrael is, has always been and remains our most important ally in the region,\u201d Tillerson said.\u00a0 The resolution, he said, was \u201cnot helpful\u201d and undermines the prospects for direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Tillerson said that Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s subsequent speech about the importance of still pursuing the two-state solution was \u201cquite troubling because of the attacks on Israel.\u201d\u00a0 1:06 p.m.\u00a0Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyoming, brings up the fight against ISIS and Tillerson said the defeat of the terror group requires advanced capabilities in U.S. communication tools to disrupt the group\u2019s communication tools like the Internet. Tillerson also made the point that defeating ISIS in Iraq and Syria won\u2019t get rid of the group once and for all. \u201cIt will simply morph to its next version,\u201d he said.\u00a0 12:55 p.m. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, asked Tillerson about whether he agrees with Mr. Trump that NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) were big mistakes. Tillerson said Mr. Trump\u2019s issue that he has with NAFTA is that it\u2019s been in place for a few decades now. \u201cI do not oppose TPP,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cI share some of his views...whether the agreement that was negotiated serves all of American interests at best.\u201d Merkley asked about a report from USA Today this week that said a subsidiary of Exxon did business with Iran, bypassing U.S. sanctions against Iran, under Tillerson\u2019s leadership. Asked if he had any memory of this situaton, Tillerson said, \u201cI do not.\u201d 12:45 p.m. During an exchange with Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, Tillerson seemed to echo what Mr. Trump has said about the Iraq war in the end and said it didn\u2019t achieve goals like stability in the Middle East and security even though he said it was well-intentioned. \u201cThe decision to go into Iraq...upon reflection, did not achieve those objectives,\u201d Tillerson said.\u00a0 12:33 p.m. Sen. Ed Markey, D-Massachusetts, asked Tillerson if he would support increasing sanctions against Russia if it they hurt ExxonMobil, which Tillerson has worked for for 41 years.\u00a0 Tillerson said that if he\u2019s confirmed, he would consult first with the president and other agencies. He said there would be \u201cno space\u201d between the president and the administration in those decisions.\u00a0 \u201cIf confirmed, I only serve in the interest of the American people,\u201d Tillerson said.\u00a0 Markey brought up Tillerson\u2019s announcement to recuse himself in issues involving Exxon and noted that that statutory limit only applies for one year. Asked if he would recuse himself for the remainder of his tenure as seretary of state, Tillerson said that for any matter after the first year that involves Exxon, he would \u201cseek the guidance of the ethics counsel\u201d and honor their advice. 12:18 p.m. Murphy asked Tillerson about the dossier of unsubstantiated information that intelligence agencies presented to Mr. Trump that said Russia had compromising information on the president-elect. Asked if he\u2019s been briefed on those allegations, Tillerson said, \u201cI have not.\u201d Asked if Mr. Trump has been briefed, Tillerson said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Asked if ExxonMobil has had business relationships with Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Paul Manafort or Carter Page, Tillerson said, \u201cNot that I\u2019m aware of.\u201d Asked if the FBI should be allowed to investigate the allegations for accuracy, Tillerson said, \u201cI think I would leave that to those agencies to determine.\u201d 12:14 p.m. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, asked Tillerson how the U.S. can deter cyberattacks if the Trump administration sends a message that countries can get away with them if there are no sanctions against those people.\u00a0 \u201cWhat I was intending to convey is I need to be fully informed as to what all the options are,\u201d Tillerson said, commenting on Murphy stating that Tillerson said he wouldn\u2019t support mandatory sanctions.\u00a0 Tillerson explained that it\u2019s possible that other options are more effective than sanctions, but that they can sometimes serve as a powerful tool.\u00a0 12:04 p.m. Sen. Todd Young, R-Indiana, a freshman senator, said that in a private meeting with Tillerson, the nominee said that a disparity existed between U.S. and European sanctions on Russia. Young said his office contacted the Congressional Research Service, which said that both sanctions regimes are \u201cbroadly similar.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI was speaking in terms of the sector I was involved in at the time,\u201d Tillerson said, which was natural gas development.\u00a0 Tillerson said that the E.U. sanctions had a grandfather provision and the U.S. sanctions did not have grandfathering.\u00a0 Young asked also Tillerson about the possible damage done by Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be telling the boss how to communicate with the American people,\u201d Tillerson said. 11:54 a.m. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, Hillary Clinton\u2019s vice presidential running mate, asked Tillerson if he is aware of any financial connections between Mr. Trump or his associates with Russian individuals or organizations. \u201cI have no knowledge,\u201d Tillerson said.\u00a0 Kaine asked what he would say if he substituted Turkey or another country with Russia, Tillerson said, \u201cI have no knowledge.\u201d\u00a0 The Virginia Democrat then asked how Congress and the nation is supposed to judge actions by the president-elect and whether they would benefit him personally. \u201cThat\u2019s a question that others will have to address,\u201d Tillerson said. 11:49 a.m. The hearing resumed and Corker went back to the discussion over Exxon\u2019s involvement with U.S. sanctions imposed against Russia. Tillerson agreed with Corker\u2019s statement that Exxon did not lobby against sanctions, but that the company helped go through the details of what the sanctions would do.\u00a0 \u201cI never lobbied against the sanctions,\u201d Tillerson said, adding that he\u2019s not aware that Exxon lobbied against the sanctions either.\u00a0 Tillerson explained that the sanctions imposed against Russia took immediate effect and Exxon was in the middle of drilling a well. He said he had to quickly engage with the State Department and Treasury Department and explain that pulling out of the well project would put lives and and the environment at risk. The administration eventually granted a temporary exemption, but Tillerson said that Exxon was going to comply with sanctions. \u201cThe characterization that ExxonMobil lobbied against the sanctions is just not accurate,\u201d Tillerson said. 11:40 a.m. The hearing has recessed for a five-minute break. 11:38 a.m. Tillerson said that the \u201cgreat and most complex threat\u201d that the U.S. is facing today is in the cybersecurity realm. He said that the U.S. is \u201cextraordinarily vulnerable\u201d and has not built sufficient defensive infrastructure.\u00a0 He said that the administration should \u201cput in place a comprehensive strategy for dealing with cybersecurity and cyber threats.\u201d That policy should encompass, he said, what are the appropriate norms for cyber behavior, the appropriate use for cyber information and what would be an acceptable response when those norms are violated.\u00a0 11:33 a.m. In an exchange with Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colorado, Tillerson said, \u201cDiplomacy will be ineffective if it\u2019s not backed up by the threat of force.\u201d\u00a0 Tillerson said that he would maintain U.S. sanctions against North Korea and criticized the Obama administration for what he described as a failure \u201cto enforce existing sanctions regimes\u201d including those overseen by the United Nations. 11:22 a.m. Sen. Tom Udall, D-New Mexico, asked what Tillerson would do as secretary of state in terms of issues involving ExxonMobil, which Tillerson has headed as its CEO.\u00a0 \u201cIf confirmed as secretary of state, I would recuse myself from those issues,\u201d Tillerson said.\u00a0 Udall asked if Tillerson would take calls from the new chairman of Exxon and he didn\u2019t directly answer. He said that in his prior role, he never called the secretary of state directly, but instead called deputies or ambassadors.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve made clear in my disclosures that obviously there\u2019s a statutory recusal period on any matters that come before the State Department that might deal with ExxonMobil,\u201d Tillerson said. Udall pressed Tillerson on his views on climate change and he said that Mr. Trump has\u00a0asked about his views on climate change and that he feels free to express himself. Corker pressed Tillerson further on climate change. Tillerson said that he came to the conclusion a few years ago that the risk of climate change does exist and it\u2019s significant enough to merit actions. He said the U.S. has done a pretty good job combatting it so far. Asked if he believes human activity has led to climate change, Tillerson said that the increase in greenhouse gas emissions \u201care having an effect.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cOur ability to predict that effect is very limted,\u201d he said. 11:08 a.m. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, said that he has introduced an authorization for the use of military force (AUMF) to target the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) with Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia and he asked Tillerson where he stands on such a proposal.\u00a0 Tillerson said that Mr. Trump has indicated in broad terms during his campaign and in other comments that he believes it\u2019s important that the U.S. does not lightly go into conflicts. The president-elect, Tillerson said, would \u201cseek the engagement of Congress\u201d and \u201csupport of Congress\u201d in certain situations abroad and added that it\u2019s \u201cmuch more powerful when the United States shows up with everyone aligned.\u201d 10:56 a.m. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-New Hampshire, asked Tillerson about the Trump administration\u2019s stance on current U.S. sanctions against Russia.\u00a0 Tillerson said he would want to \u201ckeep the status quo until we are able to develop what our approach will be.\u201d Shaheen also asked if Tillerson would commit to maintaining a U.S. program to support expanded access around the world to quality familiy planning services and reproductive services and ensuring that it\u2019s not conflated with access to abortion. Tillerson said that he understands that the U.S. invests $500,000 a year in those programs, which he said is important, but he didn\u2019t exactly answer her question. 10:49 a.m. During an exchange with Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, Tillerson explained that Russia has sought to re-establish its role in the global world order since the fall of the former Soviet Union. Tillerson said that Russia was not in a position to assert that for most of the last two decades. \u201cI think that\u2019s now what we\u2019re witnessing...[the] assertion on their part in order to force a conversation,\u201d Tillerson said about Russia\u2019s role in the global world order. In what seemed like a surprising statement Tillerson then said, \u201cWe aren\u2019t likely to ever be friends...our value systems are starkly different.\u201d\u00a0 Tillerson said that the U.S. needs to move Russia from being an adversary always to being an adversary at times and a partner at times. 10:36 a.m. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, the former top Democrat on the panel, has begun questioning Tillerson. Menendez noted that Tillerson received the Order of Friendship award from Russia and had direct and personal access over the course of his tenure at ExxonMobil with Putin. Menendez said that Exxon employed D.C.-based lobbyists to lobby against sanctions against Russia after its invasion of eastern Ukraine.\u00a0 Menendez said that sanctions are one of the most essential diplomatic tools in the U.S. arsenal and he pointed out that while Tillerson said during the hearing that sanctions are a \u201cpowerful tool,\u201d his previous comments indicate otherwise.\u00a0 Asked if he has changed his view on sanctions, Tillerson said, \u201cWhen sanctions are imposed, they are, by design, going to harm American business.\u201d\u00a0 He added that sanctions are \u201ca powerful tool\u201d and that the U.S. must design them, target and enforce them well. Tillerson claimed that Exxon \u201cnever directly lobbied against sanctions...not to my knowledge.\u201d 10:31 a.m. Rubio said that Putin has ordered the murder of dissidents, political opponents and journalists and asked Tillerson if he agrees with that assessment.\u00a0 \u201cI do not have sufficient information to make that claim,\u201d Tillerson said, adding that sometimes such incidents occur when people speak up for freedom under oppressive regimes. \u201cIn terms of assigning specific responsibilities, I would need to have sufficient information.\u201d 10:27 a.m. Rubio asked Tillerson if he would advise Mr. Trump to reverse sanctions the U.S. has imposed on Russia for its cyberattacks.\u00a0 \u201cIf confirmed, senator, I would want to examine it, all aspects of it,\u201d Tillerson said. Asked if Putin is a war criminal, Tillerson said, \u201cI would not use that term.\u201d Rubio began discussing Russia\u2019s bombing of Aleppo and argued that Putin\u2019s government has conducted war crimes in Aleppo, but Tillerson said those were very critical charges that he\u2019d have to look at more. 10:22 a.m. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, a 2016 GOP presidential candidate, has begun questioning Tillerson. He asked Tillerson if he believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin worked to influence the 2016 election, denigrate Hillary Clinton as the Democratic presidential nominee and worked to help Mr. Trump\u2019s chances.\u00a0 Tillerson said he has not received any classified briefings yet because he has not received his clearance yet, but that he did read the unclassified report that the intelligence community released last week on Russia\u2019s interference in the election. \u201cThat report clearly is troubling and indicates that all of the actions you just described were undertaken,\u201d Tillerson said. 10:17 a.m. Cardin asked Tillerson if Russia has a legal claim to Crimea.\u00a0 \u201cNo, sir,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cThat was a taking of territory that was not their\u2019s.\u201d\u00a0 Cardin said that in Tillerson\u2019s opening statement, he argued that the Obama administration was ineffective in preventing Russia from further encroaching in eastern Ukraine. Cardin asked Tillerson what he would have recommended if he were secretary of state at the time.\u00a0 \u201cIn terms of the taking of Crimea, my understanding is that it caught a lot of people by surprise,\u201d said Tillerson, who then said it was the administration\u2019s weak response after Russia\u2019s taking of Crimea that led to Russia coming across the border into eastern Ukraine.\u00a0 \u201cI would have recommended that the Ukraine had called its military assets that it had available, put them on the eastern border,\u201d Tillerson said, adding that the U.S. should have supplied them with weapons and offered air surveillance to Ukraine.\u00a0 Tillerson said that Russian leadership would have understood a \u201cpowerful response\u201d such as a more robust supply of U.S. military assets. 10:10 a.m. Corker said that he plans to interject in the hearing with questions and allows Cardin to begin his questioning of Tillerson. Cardin asked Tillerson if he agrees that that the creation of stable, democratic-free societies including basic human rights is in long-term national security interest. \u201cWithout question,\u201d Tillerson said. Cardin asked if Russia falls in that category and Tillerson said, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d Tillerson said that he supports that Magnitsky law that allows Congress to work to sanction Russia and would comply with that law if confirmed as secretary of state. 10:05 a.m. Tillerson continued his opening statement by condemning China for its actions in the South China Sea, but also said its economic interests are intertwined with those of the U.S. He then said that Russia poses a \u201cdanger\u201d to the U.S. and he criticized the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy.\u00a0 \u201cWe must also be clear-eyed about our relationship with Russia. Russia today poses a danger, but it is not unpredictable in advancing its own interests. It has invaded Ukraine, including the taking of Crimea, and supported Syrian forces that brutally violate the laws of war. Our NATO allies are right to be alarmed at a resurgent Russia,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Tillerson said that the U.S., under Mr. Trump\u2019s leadership, will try to find common ground with the Russian government, but he also said that the U.S. must hold Russia accountable for its actions. \u201cWhere cooperation with Russia based on common interests is possible, such as reducing the global threat of terrorism, we ought to explore these options. Where important differences remain, we should be steadfast in defending the interests of America and her allies. Russia must know that we will be accountable to our commitments and those of our allies, and that Russia must be held to account for its actions,\u201d he said.\u00a0 10:02 a.m. As part of his opening statement, Tillerson said that the U.S. must hold both allies and the nation\u2019s enemies accoutable.\u00a0 \u201cWe cannot look the other way at allies who do not meet their obligations; this is an injustice not only to us, but to longstanding friends who honor their promises and bolster our own national security. And we must hold those who are not our friends accountable to the agreements they make,\u201d he said.\u00a0 He argued that the U.S. must be \u201chonest\u201d about \u201cradical Islam.\u201d \u201cIt is with good reason that our fellow citizens have a growing concern about radical Islam and murderous acts committed in its name against Americans and our friends,\u201d he said. \u201cRadical Islam poses a grave risk to the stability of nations and the wellbeing of their citizens.\u201d If confirmed as secretary of state, Tillerson said he would ensure that the State Department does its part to support Muslims around the world \u201cwho reject radical Islam in all its forms.\u201d\u00a0 9:54 a.m. Tillerson has begun his opening statement. He said he comes before the committee at a \u201cpivotal time\u201d and the U.S. faces \u201cconsiderable threats,\u201d which he suggested includes Russia. He argued that American leadership must be reasserted. \u201cChina has emerged as an economic power in global trade, and our interactions have been both friendly and adversarial. While Russia seeks respect and relevance on the global stage, its recent activities have disregarded American interests. Radical Islam is not a new ideology, but it is hateful, deadly, and an illegitimate expression of the Islamic faith. Adversaries like Iran and North Korea pose grave threats to the world because of their refusal to conform to international norms,\u201d Tillerson said.\u00a0 \u201cAs we confront these realities, how should America respond? My answer is simple. To achieve the stability that is foundational to peace and security in the 21st century, American leadership must not only be renewed, it must be asserted.\u201d Tillerson appeared to channel Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d by arguing for a need in improving U.S. leadership internationally and projecting it as a superpower.\u00a0 \u201cQuite simply, we are the only global superpower with the means and the moral compass capable of shaping the world for good,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we do not lead, we risk plunging the world deeper into confusion and danger. But we\u2019ve stumbled. In recent decades, we have cast American leadership into doubt. In some instances, we have withdrawn from the world. In others, we have intervened with good intentions but did not achieve the stability and global security we sought.\u201d 9:41 a.m. Cardin, the panel\u2019s top Democrat, has begun his opening statement. He said that there\u2019s no question that Tillerson has an \u201cimpressive record\u201d but there\u2019s a difference between leading a company and government decision-making.\u00a0 \u201cYet, I would offer, having a view from the C-Suite at Exxon is not at all the same as the view from the seventh floor of the Department of State. And those who suggest that anyone who can run a successful business can, of course, run a government Agency do a profound disservice to both,\u201d Cardin said. He said he wants\u00a0to focus on \u201chuman rights, democracy, good governance, anti-corruption and civil society support\u201d and expressed concern with how Tillerson would deal with those issues. \u201cMr. Tillerson, leaves some troubling questions about how you view these issues and how you as Secretary of State intend to approach them. Cardin mentioned that he introduced legislation on Tuesday that would \u201cimpose enhanced sanctions on Russia,\u201d which has already received bipartisan support from key lawmakers. He added that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with Tillerson\u2019s prepared remarks that failed to mention Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. \u201cWe need to stand up to this bully in Moscow and increase the cost for his behavior,\u201d Cardin said. \u201cSo I was disappointed that in your prepared opening remarks submitted to the Committee yesterday there was no mention about the direct, confirmed cyberattack by Russia on America.\u201d Cardin also slammed Mr. Trump for his comments about Israel on Twitter.\u00a0 \u201cI also need to stress that our important partner in this part of the world \u2013 Israel \u2013 needs more than tweets about how \u201cgreat\u201d our relationship is going to be,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope we will hear today a concrete vision with specific proposals for the way forward in strengthening this strategic partnership.\u201d 9:26\u00a0a.m. Outside of the hearing before it began, Corker commented to reporters on the reports about Trump and the intelligence community presenting unsubstantiated compromising information that Russia has on the president-elect. \u201cIt\u2019s as we all talked about before, we live in a world where it\u2019s hard to discern what is real and what isn\u2019t,\u201d Corker said about the reports. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have committees to delve into those kind of things...I have no way of knowing the veracity of the charges in the document but we do live in a world where let\u2019s face it a lot of that kind of thing is happening.\u201d 9:27 a.m. Corker begins his opening statement, which he appears to be doing off the cuff. He\u2019s listing all of what he considers the foreign policy failures under the Obama administration, speaking about the emergence of the Arab Spring in 2011, President Obama\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d that he never followed through on, Russia\u2019s taking of Crimea and the destabilization of eastern Ukraine and China redrawing the map in South China Sea.\u00a0 He said that the U.S. has been withdrawing in its leadership role in the world, which he called a \u201crecipe for further chaos.\u201d The hearing was interrupted briefly by chants from protestors inside the room. Corker said Tillerson had never met Mr. Trump until he was considered for secretary of state.\u00a0 9:11 a.m. Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, former Sen. Sam Nunn, R-Georgia and former Defense Secretary Bob Gates are introducing Tillerson before opening statements from the chairman, top Democrat and Tillerson himself. Tillerson, a longtime CEO of ExxonMobil, hails from Texas. Cornyn called Tillerson \u201cuniquely qualified\u201d to lead the State Department. \u201cWithout a doubt, Rex Tillerson is an inspired choice by President-elect Trump for this critical position. The depth and breadth of his experience as an accomplished and successful business leader and skilled negotiator give him a solid understanding of our current geopolitical and economic challenges, making him uniquely qualified to serve in this important office,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Cruz said the U.S. needs a secretary of state who \u201cunderstands that America is exceptional.\u201d Cruz said the Obama administration has used the United Nations to circumvent Congress. The former presidential candidate said he looks forward to having a president and secretary of state who will \u201cvigorously defend U.S. sovereignty.\u201d\u00a0 Nunn said that Russia\u2019s values differ from America\u2019s values and \u201cthese fundamental differences are very important.\u201d He added that Russia deploys hundreds of nuclear warheads that could be used for ballistic missiles. Nunn called Tillerson\u2019s business experience \u201cvery relevant to the world today\u201d and \u201can asset.\u201d\u00a0 Gates said Tillerson\u2019s leadership of a major corporation will allow him to \u201clead the department with skill and respect for the professionals.\u201d Gates said that the new administration \u201cmust thread the needle\u201d between pushing back against Putin\u2019s bullying and Russia\u2019s meddling in other countries and prevent a further downward spiral in the U.S.-Russia relationship. 9:05 a.m. The hearing has begun. Corker said four people will first introduce Tillerson and then he and Cardin will deliver their opening statements and then Tillerson will deliver his. Corker said the panel will take a break at 1 p.m. for 45 minutes. 9:00 a.m. Senators are expected to grill Tillerson on his relationship with the Russian government and its president, Vladimir Putin. There could also be questions regarding his position on the Iranian nuclear deal, sanctions against Russia, Israel and more.\u00a0 CBS News\u2019 Alan He contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "Congress has four days left to hatch an agreement on federal funding or the government will shut down on Saturday, although for now, one major issue has been put aside.\u00a0 Until Monday, the biggest sticking point had been funding for the border wall, but the White House is conceding on that demand, deferring that fight until later this year, when funding for 2018 comes up, according to senior administration officials, CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett reported Monday. \u00a0Other areas of disagreement involve funding Obamacare subsidies and defense spending.\u00a0 Republican and Democratic appropriators have been negotiating for weeks over an omnibus package that would fund the government through the rest of the fiscal year, or Sept. 30. Lawmakers are likely to pass a short-term continuing resolution (CR) to buy more time, maybe a week, to reach a comprehensive deal on funding the government.  \u201cI think it all depends on whether the president agrees with the Republican leadership that getting a deal is better than not and that a government shutdown will be a black eye,\u201d said Steve Bell, senior adviser at the Bipartisan Policy Center.\u00a0 Democrats have significant leverage in the talks because Republicans need 60 votes to advance a spending bill in the Senate. There are currently 52 Republicans and 48 Democrats in the upper chamber.  President Trump has been insisting that the government will not shut down on his watch, though the White House had been simultaneously demanding until Monday that the Republican-controlled Congress ensure that funding for the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border be included in the spending package. But during a reception with conservative media Monday night, the president reportedly suggested that he would be willing to push the issue of wall funding to September.\u00a0 In mid-March, the Trump administration asked Congress for $3 billion in additional funding for the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s border protection activities. Of that amount, $1.4 billion would go to Custom and Border Protection procurement, construction and improvements, including $999 million for the first installment of the border wall.  Democrats had firmly said that they will oppose any funding for a border wall. Even Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, said a few weeks ago on \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d that Congress would keep the government open and suggested that lawmakers wouldn\u2019t fulfill the border wall request this year.  \u201cThe big chunk of money for the wall, really, is...next fiscal year\u2019s appropriations because they literally can\u2019t start construction even this quickly,\u201d he said. Jim Dyer, principal at the Podesta Group who previously served as the the House Appropriations Committee\u2019s staff director, said it\u2019s too early to be funding the wall, and he predicted that there would be no funding for a border wall \u201cuntil somebody has some idea of what the comprehensive plan is for securing the border.\u201d Other hurdles in the spending negotiations have been whether to fulfill the White House\u2019s supplemental request for $30 billion more for the Defense Department. If it isn\u2019t fully funded in the base portion of the budget, lawmakers could pour the remaining money into the overseas contingency operations (OCO) fund, which is used to finance U.S. military operations overseas. Critics of OCO have called it a \u201cslush fund\u201d or a \u201cblank check\u201d for wars. Mr. Trump had also threatened to deny payments to health insurers under Obamacare, and Democrats have insisted they must be included in the spending legislation. These payments help low-income people enrolled under Obamacare with out-of-pocket expenses.  The White House had also asked Congress to cut $18 billion from non-defense domestic programs in the spending measure. Lawmakers are expected to ignore this request, especially since appropriators are now seven months into the new fiscal year and have been working on their 2017 spending bills for nearly a year.  Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney is to blame, Dyer said. \u201cMulvaney has got to understand that if he wants a bill, he needs 60 votes in the Senate. He can\u2019t get 60 votes by being a hard-ass,\u201d he said. \u201cTo drop an $18 billion dime on these people seven months into the fiscal year, it\u2019s fiscally irresponsible.\u201d  Saturday not only happens to be the day the government could shut down, but it\u2019s also Mr. Trump\u2019s 100th day in office. After three bumpy months and few legislative accomplishments to point to, the president is looking for a win. The 16-day government shutdown provoked by Republicans in October 2013 might not have hurt them in the 2014 midterm elections, but another shutdown could be harmful for their 2018 prospects.  \u201cI think it will continue to disappoint the Republican base, and I think it\u2019s something they really want to avoid,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThey need a victory real bad and keeping the government open...that, I think, will be portrayed as a victory.\u201d  And while shifting blame may have worked better in the past, this time, Republicans are more vulnerable.  \u201cThe Republicans have quite properly made a great deal of the fact that they control all the levers of power -- they control the executive and legislative branch,\u201d Dyer said, adding that it\u2019s \u201cnot credible\u201d to blame the shutdown on the minority. He added that funding the government for fiscal 2018, which begins Oct. 1, will be worse with the need for a new budget deal to lift spending caps and the need to lift the debt ceiling on the agenda. \u201cThis is painless and easy\u2026.[Fiscal 2018] is not going to be painless and easy,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "IRBIL, Iraq -- Iraqi Kurds\u00a0cast ballots on Monday in their autonomous region and in a wide sweep of captured territories on whether to seek independence from Baghdad, a\u00a0historic vote\u00a0that has also raised tensions and fears of instability. The referendum is non-binding and will not immediately bring independence, but it would mark a definitive stance by the Kurds to break away, and Kurdish leaders say they will use a \"yes\" vote to press for negotiations with Iraq's central government to win statehood. From Ankara, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened military intervention in Iraq in response to the vote, stressing that Kurdish independence was unacceptable to his country and that this was a \"matter of survival.\" The Iraqi Kurdish push for independence has been made even more combustible because Kurdish forces captured extensive territories in fighting with the Islamic State of Syria and Iraq (ISIS) group in the past year. Those territories run from northwest Iraq across the country to the Iranian border on the east - including the\u00a0oil-rich city of Kirkuk. Baghdad claims those territories, but the Kurds say they are part of their zone and residents there are participating in Monday's vote. More than 3 million people are expected to vote across the three provinces that officially make up the Iraqi Kurdish autonomous region and in the disputed territories, according to the Independent High Elections and Referendum Commission, the body overseeing the vote. Lines began forming early in the day at polling stations across Irbil, the Kurdish regional capital. Tahsin Karim was one of the first people to vote in his Irbil neighborhood. \"Today we came here to vote in the referendum for the independence of Kurdistan,\" he said. \"We hope that we can achieve independence.\" The Kurdish region's president, Masoud Barzani, also voted at a polling station packed with journalists and cameras. On the eve of the referendum, Barzani said he believed the vote would be peaceful, though he acknowledged that the path to independence would be \"risky.\" \"We are ready to pay any price for our independence,\" he said. The referendum is being carried out despite mounting opposition from Baghdad and the international community. The United States, a key ally of Iraq's Kurds, has warned the vote will likely destabilize the region amid the fight against IS. The Iraqi central government has also come out strongly against the referendum, demanding on Sunday that all airports and borders crossings in the Kurdish region be handed back to federal government control. In a televised address from Baghdad on Sunday night, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said that \"the referendum is unconstitutional. It threatens Iraq, peaceful coexistence among Iraqis and is a danger to the region.\" \"We will take measures to safeguard the nation's unity and protect all Iraqis,\" he added. Turkey said on Monday that it doesn't recognize the referendum and declared its results would be \"null and void.\" Erdogan, speaking at a conference in Ankara, pointed to Turkish military exercises underway along Turkey's border with the Iraqi Kurdish region and said that \"our military is not (there) for nothing.\" \"We could arrive suddenly one night,\" he said, adding that Turkey would take political, economic as well as military measures against Iraqi Kurds' steps toward independence. He also suggested that Turkey could halt oil flows from a pipeline from northern Iraq. Ankara called on the international community and especially regional countries not to recognize the vote either and urged Iraq Kurdish leaders to abandon \"utopic goals,\" accusing them of endangering peace and stability for Iraq and the whole region. On Saturday, Turkey's parliament met in an extraordinary session to extend a mandate allowing Turkey's military to send troops over its southern border if developments in Iraq and Syria are perceived as national security threats. Initial results from the poll are expected on Tuesday, with the official results to be announced later in the week. At his press conference, Barzani also said that while the referendum will be the first step in a long process to negotiate independence, the region's \"partnership\" with the Iraqi central government in Baghdad is over. He detailed the abuses Iraq's Kurds have faced by Iraqi forces, including killings at the hands of former leader Saddam Hussein's army that left more than 50,000 Kurds dead. Iraqi Kurds have long dreamed of independence - something the Kurdish people were denied when colonial powers drew the map of the Middle East after World War I. The Kurds form a sizable minority in Turkey, Iran, Syria, and Iraq. In Iraq, they have long been at odds with the Baghdad government over the sharing of oil revenues and the fate of disputed territories like Kirkuk. The Kurds have been a close American ally for decades, and the first U.S. airstrikes in the campaign against ISIS\u00a0were launched to protect Irbil. Kurdish forces later regrouped and played a major role in driving the extremists from much of northern Iraq, including Mosul, the country's second largest city. But the U.S. has long been opposed to Kurdish moves toward independence, fearing it could lead to the breakup of Iraq and bring even more instability to an already volatile Middle East. In Baghdad, residents strongly criticized then referendum, saying it would raise sectarian tensions and create an \"Israel in Iraq.\" An Arabic newspaper headline said \"Kurdistan into the unknown,\" a reference to the name Kurds use for their region. \"This is a division of Iraq,\" said journalist Raad Mohammad while another Baghdad resident, Ali al-Rubayah, described the referendum as a \"black day in the history of the Kurds.\" Lawyer Tariq al-Zubaydi said the referendum was inappropriate amid the \"ongoing threat of terrorism and Islamic State\" militants. \"The country is going through a difficult period, this requires a coming together of our efforts, he said. \"A unified country is better for all.\" Voting was also underway on Monday morning in Kirkuk. The oil-rich city has large Kurdish, Arab, Turkmen and Christian communities and has seen some low-level clashes in the days leading up to Monday's vote. \"I feel so great and happy, I feel we'll be free,\" said Suad Pirot, a Kirkuk Kurdish resident, after voting. \"Nobody will rule us, we will be independent.\"",

            "article_content": "As President Donald Trump pressed for funding to start building his much-ballyhooed border wall, Wall Street has been scaling a wall of its own, lifting the Nasdaq above 6,000 for the first time and pushing the S&P 500 up more than 6 percent this year. On Monday and Tuesday, the stock market rallied, with investors cheered by election results in France, corporate earnings and thoughts of tax cuts ahead. The threat of a government shutdown on Saturday did little to dampen sentiment, even though an appropriations bill that has been funding government operations since December lapses Friday at midnight. \u201cThere are so many questions that investors face right now, but we tend to climb a wall of worry,\u201d said Jim Russell, a principal and portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor, which manages $18.7 billion of assets for clients. \u201cMarkets are likely to sag a bit should it look like the government will indeed shutdown. Stocks simply do not mix well with uncertainty.\u201d As lawmakers worked to negotiate a spending bill that would avert a shutdown on the 100th day of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, several contentious issues entered the mix, including the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and funding for the Mexican border wall. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s eagerness for a major accomplishment in his first 100 days has thrown a wrench into the process,\u201d Oxford Economics economists Nancy Vanden Houten and Gregory Daco, wrote in a note to clients.\u00a0 A shutdown could cost the economy 0.1 percentage points of GDP growth, or $6 billion, per week, they estimate. Still, investors believe a shutdown will be avoided, even if the odds of one have increased. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten used to deadlines approaching and an 11th hour extension or deal being cut,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. \u201cThe market probably anticipates something like that happening.\u201d Friday\u2019s midnight deadline had Republican and Democratic leaders saying they wanted to avoid the pitfalls that shut down the government in 2013 and nearly did so in 2015. They said they had a compromise in the works, but then the White House entered the mix. President Trump, who has threatened to shut down funding for subsidies to the ACA if Democrats didn\u2019t agree to fund a wall, added his tweets to the debate, sending conflicting signals while also appearing to back off on his demand that money to build his wall be included in the funding legislation Congress is trying to formulate. By late Tuesday, congressional leaders hadn\u2019t yet released the text of their spending measure. It remains to be seen whether lawmakers would opt for a short-term extension to give themselves time to pass a bigger plan to keep government agencies operating through Sept. 30, the end of fiscal 2017. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how this ends,\u201d offered Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cOur base case is that a short-term spending measure likely will be passed in order to prevent a shutdown, but the bigger picture of the budget process for fiscal 2018 -- starting Oct. 1 -- is anyone\u2019s guess.\u201d The odds of a shutdown rise the further the issue gets kicked down the road, believes Goldman Sachs analyst Alec Phillips. \u201cWhile congressional Republicans and the White House might be willing to accept lower defense spending and higher domestic spending than they would like for the remainder of the current fiscal year, they\u2019re much less likely to accept spending bills for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1 unless they increase defense spending and reduce nondefense spending, and fund some of the president\u2019s other initiatives such as increased border enforcement,\u201d Phillips wrote in a note. Mr. Trump plans to introduce a tax plan on Wednesday, but his desire to restart health care legislation could push any tax measures into next year. \u00a0 The market, said Wunderlich\u2019s Hogan, \u201cdoesn\u2019t react well to a government shutdown, and it doesn\u2019t react well a \u00a0a pro-business policy agenda getting pushed out to 2018.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Trump is finishing his first year in office with a bang, with Congress passing legislation to overhaul the nation's tax code. And despite his low popularity and his drama-filled White House, Mr. Trump has done what many of his predecessors haven't: he's fulfilled many campaign promises.  The House and Senate approved the GOP-sponsored tax plan last week, which includes a repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate. In early December, the Supreme Court allowed his proposed travel ban to take effect amid a series of legal challenges.  Soon after his inauguration, Mr. Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to serve as a Supreme Court justice to fill the seat left vacant by Justice Antonin Scalia who died in February 2016. The Senate confirmed him in April in a 54-45 vote in a simple up-or-down majority vote. Senate Republicans had successfully invoked the so-called \"nuclear option\" to get him confirmed, effectively terminating the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees. \u00a0 With the help of the Republican-controlled Congress, the president celebrated the GOP-sponsored tax plan last week and signed the bill into law on Friday. Specifically, it lowers the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and roughly doubles the standard deduction, from $6,350 to $12,000 for individuals, and from $12,700 to $24,000 for married couples filing jointly. It also keeps seven individual tax brackets, among other things. The Supreme Court said in early December that the latest version of Mr. Trump's travel ban could take effect. In September, he had signed a new proclamation that places new restrictions on travel to the U.S. as his previous ban was set to expire. The latest ban in effect applies to Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.  Mr. Trump has been keen on reversing much of what was implemented under the Obama administration. For example, the president signed memoranda that attempted to renew the process for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which was halted by Mr. Obama, and the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline. Within his first few days in office, Mr. Trump signed a presidential memoranda that withdrew the U.S. from the giant trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was negotiated by President Obama. He had also announced his intentions to renegotiate NAFTA, as he had promised to do during the election. Mr. Trump also\u00a0rolled back part of Obama's policies that normalized U.S. relations with Cuba and pulled out of the Paris climate accords. He also reversed a number of regulations with the help of congressional Republicans. While President Trump directed the Department of Homeland Security to begin work on his proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, construction has yet to begin. Prototypes for the border wall were completed in October and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said at the time that it would soon begin testing them. The administration may be preparing for the wall, but Congress has not allocated funding for it. Funding has been repeatedly blocked by Democrats whose votes Republicans need for spending bills in the Senate. Spending legislation requires 60 votes to advance in the upper chamber and Republicans only have 52 members. It's unclear if Mr. Trump will ever have funding approved for the wall, especially with lawmakers approaching the 2018 midterm elections. Congress was not able to deliver Mr. Trump a full repeal of the 2010 health care law, even under the budget reconciliation process that only requires a simple majority vote for certain legislation in the Senate. To deal with that setback, the administration has done everything in its power to dismantle Obamacare itself. The president, for instance, announced in October that he would end cost-sharing subsidies paid to insurers under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). In the tax measure, Congress also repealed the law's individual mandate. Infrastructure appears to be next on Mr. Trump's agenda. As he signed the tax bill, he told reporters, \"Infrastructure is by far the easiest. People want it \u2013 Republicans and Democrats. We're going to have tremendous Democrat support on infrastructure as you know. I could've started with infrastructure \u2014 I actually wanted to save the easy one for the one down the road. So we'll be having that done pretty quickly.\" And Democratic support is not optional -- he will need their support to pass an infrastructure bill, since the legislation will not be passed using the budgetary tool that allowed Republicans to pass their tax bill with a simple majority. The president often talked about rebuilding the nation's \"crumbling\" roads, highways and bridges during the 2016 campaign, but the White House has not yet presented a concrete plan. In his initial response to\u00a0the Amtrak train derailment in Washington state, President Trump pointed to his forthcoming infrastructure plan. The tweet did not take into account that the accident had, in fact, occurred on a newly constructed section of track when it derailed -- not on one that was in disrepair.

            "article_content": "DETROIT - The threat from President Donald Trump to tax Mexican-made cars sold in the U.S. would throw the industry into disarray, analysts said, forcing some uncomfortable choices. Manufacturers could raise car prices or swallow the cost. They could stop selling Mexican-made cars in the U.S. but risk losing customers. Or move production to the U.S. but make less money. \u201cI don\u2019t think the auto industry would turn up its feet and die, but it would be a terrible shock. It would create mayhem with their profitability,\u201d said Marina Whitman, a business professor at the University of Michigan and a former vice president at General Motors (GM). Before he was to host a breakfast meeting early Tuesday with the heads of General Motors, Ford Motor (F) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU), Trump demanded on Twitter that automakers build new factories in the U.S. \u201cI want new plants to be built here for cars sold here,\u201d his tweet said. He has warned of a \u201csubstantial border tax\u201d on companies that move manufacturing out of the country and promised tax advantages to those that produce domestically. For more than two decades, Mexico has been an oasis for the auto industry, offering cheap labor and access to dozens of markets through free-trade deals. Whitman said Detroit automakers can\u2019t build small cars profitably in the U.S., where a unionized auto worker can make $58 an hour in wages and benefits. By comparison, a Mexican auto assembly worker makes a little more than $8. That helps explain why automakers have announced $24 billion in Mexican investments over the last six years, according to the Center for Automotive Research, a Michigan think tank. In all, $50.5 billion in vehicles and $51 billion in auto parts were shipped to the U.S. from Mexico in 2015, U.S. government data show. Mexico\u2019s auto sector, while still smaller than the U.S., is growing at a faster clip. Mexican production capacity is expected to rise 49 percent to 5.5 million vehicles by 2023, according to LMC Automotive, a forecasting firm. U.S. capacity will grow 13 percent to 14.2 million vehicles in the same period. But Mr. Trump could change that. In frequent tweets targeting the auto industry, he has proposed both a 35-percent tariff on Mexican-made imports and a \u201cborder tax,\u201d which would tax companies\u2019 imports. That\u2019s forcing automakers to consider a number of options. Stay the course Abandoning Mexico and moving production to the U.S., as Trump demands, would cost the industry billions and scuttle plans that are years in the making. Audi (VLKAY), for example, just opened a plant in Mexico that it decided to build five years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to turn on your heels quickly in the auto industry,\u201d said Laurie Harbour-Felax, a manufacturing consultant and president of Harbour Results. In recent weeks, Volkswagen, GM, Toyota (TM) and BMW have all said they won\u2019t shift their production plans, while stressing the amount they\u2019ve invested in the U.S. BMW, for example, said it\u2019s proceeding with a $1 billion plant in Mexico that will make the 3 Series sedan starting in 2019. The German automaker also noted that its SUV plant in South Carolina is its largest plant worldwide. Mr. Trump\u2019s border tax would hurt some automakers more than others. Volkswagen, for example, imports 32 percent of the vehicles its sells in the U.S. from Mexico, according to LMC. But Honda (HMC) imports just 11 percent, and that\u2019s expected to fall this year after it moves production of the CR-V SUV from Mexico to Indiana. Pivot on production In early January, Ford made the surprise announcement that it would halt construction of a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico slated to build the compact Focus. It also announced plans to invest $700 million of that savings into a Michigan plant where it will make new electric and autonomous cars. Ford said declining sales of small cars, not President Trump, influenced the Mexico plant decision, and the company will still make the Focus in Mexico at a different plant. But Ford CEO Mark Fields noted that Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to lower corporate taxes and ease regulations would make it more attractive to do business in the U.S. Fields also said he\u2019s not worried about the possibility of tariffs Other execs appear more nervous. Speaking to reporters at the Detroit auto show, Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne said his company might withdraw from Mexico altogether if tariffs got too high. \u201cThose plants were designed, built and purposed at a time when NAFTA was alive and well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the perils associated with the business that we run.\u201d President Trump can\u2019t place tariffs on companies or groups of companies without congressional approval, said Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics. But he could fashion tariffs that hurt some companies more than others by, for example, picking and choosing from the dozens of import classifications for vehicles and parts. Sell elsewhere Automakers could stop selling some Mexican-made cars in the U.S. altogether, but that would cost them customers. They could also try to sell the cars elsewhere. Mexico has free-trade agreements covering 45 countries, including deals with the European Union, Japan and South America. By comparison, the U.S. has agreements with 20 countries. Nissan Motor (NSANY), the biggest producer in Mexico, made more than 823,000 vehicles in the country in 2015. Forty-six percent were shipped to the U.S., but another 17 percent went to other countries, including Canada and Saudi Arabia. Nissan could tweak those numbers if U.S. tariffs were prohibitive. \u201cAll carmakers will adapt to the new rules, if there are new rules,\u201d Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn said this month in Detroit. Pass the cost If Mr. Trump imposes tariffs, automakers could try to pass along the cost to U.S. customers. But that would raise the price tag of relatively affordable cars like the $17,000 Nissan Sentra or the $21,000 Chevrolet Trax by thousands of dollars. Even a U.S.-built vehicle like the Toyota Camry would cost more. Jim Lentz, CEO of Toyota North America, said 25 percent of the Camry\u2019s parts are imported, and tariffs on those parts would add roughly $1,000 to the cost of the car. Automakers could swallow the cost of the tariff, but it would hurt their bottom lines. Dustin Blanchard, 31, who works for a software startup in Austin, Texas, drives a 2007 Nissan Sentra that he bought for $18,000. His car was made in Mexico, but he didn\u2019t think much about that when he bought it. \u201cThe parts all come from everywhere. Domestic brands are made overseas, and Japanese cars are made here,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s so interconnected that you don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s a patriotic duty to buy a Ford or something.\u201d But a 35-percent tariff would have added $6,300 to the cost of his Sentra, which would have put it out of his reach. Blanchard has thought more about NAFTA\u2019s impact since the election. When he recently drank a Mexican Coke, he says, he half-joked that he better enjoy it while he can. \u201cIt\u2019s something I had taken for granted,\u201d he said, \u201cthat free trade was here to stay.\u201d",

            "article_content": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Saudi Arabia and three other Arab countries severed ties to Qatar on Monday and moved to cut off land, sea and air routes to the energy-rich nation that is home to a major U.S. military base, accusing it of supporting regional terror groups. Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates made no demands of Qatar as their decision plunged the international travel hub into chaos and ignited the biggest diplomatic crisis in the Gulf since the 1991 war against Iraq. The foreign minister for Libya's eastern-based government announced it would cut diplomatic relations with the country as well, and Al-Arabiya reported that the Maldives was making a similar move. Yemen's internationally recognized government, which no longer holds its capital and large portions of the country, cut relations with Qatar and said it supports the decision by the Saudi-led coalition to end Qatar's participation in the war on the Houthis there. \u00a0 Qatar, which will host the 2022 FIFA World Cup and is home to some 10,000 American troops, criticized the move as a \"violation of its sovereignty.\" It long has denied supporting militant groups and described the crisis as being fueled by \"absolute fabrications\" stemming from a recent hack of its state-run news agency. Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, through which the tiny Gulf nation imports most of its food, sparking a run on supermarkets. The four countries began withdrawing their diplomatic staff from Qatar as regional airlines announced they'd suspend service to its capital, Doha. The move came just weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump visited Saudi Arabia and vowed to improve ties with both Riyadh and Cairo to combat regional terror groups and contain Iran. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the move was rooted in longstanding differences and urged the parties to resolve them. #Qatar regrets the decision by #Saudi Arabia, the United Arab #Emirates and #Bahrain to sever relationshttps://t.co/jbYvp6BUqS pic.twitter.com/zTWuD4v7Q3 Saudi Arabia said it took the decision to cut diplomatic ties due to Qatar's \"embrace of various terrorist and sectarian groups aimed at destabilizing the region\" including the Muslim Brotherhood, al-Qaida, the Islamic State of Syria and Iraq (ISIS) and groups supported by Iran in the kingdom's restive Eastern Province. Egypt's Foreign Ministry accused Qatar of taking an \"antagonist approach\" toward Cairo and said \"all attempts to stop it from supporting terrorist groups failed.\" The countries all ordered their citizens out of Qatar and gave Qataris abroad 14 days to return home to their peninsular nation, whose only land border is with Saudi Arabia. The countries also said they would eject Qatar's diplomats. All the nations also said they planned to cut air and sea traffic. Doha-based satellite news network Al-Jazeera reported trucks carrying food had begun to line up on the Saudi side of the border, apparently stranded. The Qatar Stock Exchange fell more than 7 percent. Qatar Airways, one of the region's major long-haul carriers that routinely flies through Saudi airspace, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Some of its flights were going through Iranian airspace Monday. Saudi Arabia said it would begin blocking all Qatari flights at midnight. Qatar's Foreign Affairs Ministry said there was \"no legitimate justification\" for the countries' decision, though it vowed its citizens wouldn't be affected by it. \"The Qatari Government will take all necessary measures to ensure this and to thwart attempts to influence and harm the Qatari society and economy,\" it said. Premier UAE airlines Etihad and Emirates announced they would suspend flights to Qatar, as did budget carriers Air Arabia and FlyDubai. Bahrain's Gulf Air and Saudia joined them. Saudi Arabia also said Qatari troops would be pulled from the ongoing war in Yemen. Yemen's internationally backed government, which no longer holds its capital and large portions of the country, also cut relations with Qatar, as did the Maldives. FIFA, international soccer's governing body, said it remained in regular contact with Qatar, declining to elaborate. Qatar is home to the sprawling al-Udeid Air Base, which is home to the forward headquarters of the U.S. military's Central Command. It wasn't clear if the decision would affect American military operations. Central Command officials and the Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In Sydney, Tillerson said he didn't believe the diplomatic crisis would affect the war against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. \"I think what we're witnessing is a growing list of disbelief in the countries for some time, and they've bubbled up to take action in order to have those differences addressed,\" he said. \"We certainly would encourage the parties to sit down together and address these differences.\" Before Monday, Qatar had appeared unperturbed by the growing tensions. On May 27, Qatar's ruling emir, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, called Iranian President Hasan Rouhani to congratulate him on his re-election. The call was a clear, public rebuttal of Saudi Arabia's efforts to force Qatar to fall in line against the Shiite-ruled nation, which the Sunni kingdom sees as its No. 1 enemy and a threat to regional stability. Qatar shares a massive offshore gas field with Iran. The crisis began in late May when Qatar alleged that hackers took over the site of its state-run news agency and published what it called fake comments from its ruling emir about Iran and Israel. Its Gulf Arab neighbors responded by blocking Qatari-based media, including Al-Jazeera. Qatar long has faced criticism from its Arab neighbors over its support of Islamists. The chief worry among them is the Muslim Brotherhood, a Sunni Islamist political group opposed to monarchical rule. Gulf countries led by Saudi Arabia fell out with Qatar over its backing of Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi, a Brotherhood member who was overthrown by the military in 2013. In March 2014, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain recalled their ambassadors from Qatar over the rift. Eight months later, they returned their ambassadors as Qatar forced some Brotherhood members to leave the country and quieted others. Qatar denies funding extremist groups. However, it remains a key patron of the Islamic Hamas movement, which rules the Gaza Strip. Western officials also have accused Qatar of allowing or even encouraging funding of Sunni extremists like al-Qaida's branch in Syria, once known as the Nusra Front. Mr. Trump nevertheless met with Qatar's emir during the Saudi conference last month. \"We are friends, we've been friends now for a long time, haven't we?\" Mr. Trump asked at the meeting. \"Our relationship is extremely good.\"",

            "article_content": "The spokesman for President Vladimir Putin tells CBS News that there is \"an atmosphere of Cold War\" between Russia and the West, but he says the United States is to blame for taking \"not a peaceful approach\" in its defense of NATO allies. Dmitry Peskov sat down with CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer on Wednesday for an hour-long interview that touched on everything from FBI Director James Comey's sudden firing to Russia's alleged interference in elections from the U.S. to Germany. Palmer asked Peskov whether the two global powers were edging toward a new Cold War, given Moscow's plans for massive military exercises on Europe's eastern border this autumn, the expected deployment of U.S. Patriot missile systems to Baltic countries in response, and Russia's move to position Iskander missile batteries in the outpost of Kaliningrad. \"We have some elements look like an atmosphere of cold war,\" said Peskov, \"but I would like to draw your attention to your words; we have our Iskander missiles on our soil in Kaliningrad, and you have American missiles in the territory of Baltics. This is a huge difference. So, it's not Russian missiles in Mexico. It's American missiles in Baltics.\" The prospect of U.S. Patriot surface-to-air missile batteries in the Baltics (they aren't there yet), specifically Lithuania, arose Wednesday as Secretary of Defense James Mattis met the leader of that nation and vowed to help defend its border in light of the Russians massing troops and hardware on the other side ahead of the September war games. Asked specifically whether the U.S. would send Patriots if requested by Lithuania, Mattis said the U.S. would \"make those decisions in consultation with the Lithuanian government,\" before insisting that both Russia \"and the world knows this is defensive not offensive, and we will only deploy defensive systems to make sure sovereignty is respected.\" Asked to clarify whether Russia would view U.S. military hardware in Baltic states -- which have expressed serious concerns of a potential Russian invasion in light of Moscow's annexation of Crimea and its ongoing role in the unrest in eastern Ukraine -- as a \"provocation,\" Peskov chose not to use the term when he spoke with Palmer. He said that, in Russia's view, the U.S. bolstering of NATO forces in Eastern Europe is, \"not a peaceful approach, not a constructive approach when you're getting your military infrastructure closer to our borders, we feel it as a threat to our security, and we feel ourselves necessary to re-balance the situation and take some counter-measures.\" Lithuania, like neighbors Estonia and Latvia, have been nervous since the Crimea annexation and have pressed the U.S. and other NATO allies to stand up in their defense. The cries prompted then-President Obama to order the largest U.S. troop deployment to Europe since World War II. There are now about 4,000 American service members, and some tanks, fanning out across seven Eastern European nations, from Poland up to Estonia.  \"We have waited for you for a very long time,\" Polish Defense Minister Antoni Macierewicz told U.S. troops as they arrived in his country in Januray. \"We waited for decades, sometimes feeling we had been left alone, sometimes almost losing hope, sometimes feeling that we were the only one who protected civilization from aggression that came from the east.\"\u00a0 Moscow flatly rejects all allegations of aggression \"from the east.\" Peskov reiterated in his interview with CBS News Russia's stance that the Crimea invasion was legal, and that the peninsula adjacent to Ukraine is \"our territory and it's not a subject for any bargaining.\" He told Palmer that the annexation was \"performed in strict accordance with international law\u2026 it was self-determination.\" Palmer pressed Peskov harder, noting that even if the people of Crimea did wish to become part of Russia, the annexation was carried out following an illegal invasion of a sovereign state that Moscow refused to acknowledge at the time.  \"With tactics like that, why should the world believe anything you say?\" Palmer asked Putin's spokesman.  He insisted the Russian troops that were unofficially deployed to Ukraine were just there, \"trying to secure the situation.\"  \"So why lie about it?\" pressed Palmer.  Peskov replied that, at the time and given the circumstances on the ground, it was \"quite normal.\" Tucker Reals is the CBSNews.com foreign editor, based at the CBS News London bureau.",

            "article_content": "During Donald Trump\u2019s whirlwind first week in office, one thing was apparent: He\u2019s dead serious about putting his hard-line prescriptions for the U.S. into practice -- ideas that would alter the American economic landscape, for good or ill.\u00a0 The result could be a topsy-turvy country where an activist government -- the traditional hallmark of Democrats -- is trying to impose conservative goals while also forcing Republicans to swallow things like higher federal spending and budget deficits.\u00a0 In addition, it\u2019s an America where the customary, if sometimes dysfunctional, norms no longer apply. These include free trade, corporate liberty to send jobs where the cost is lowest and a tax code laden with deductions. \u201cThis is a case of government on your back, micromanaging,\u201d said economist Dennis Hoffman, a professor at Arizona State University who has voted for both Republicans and Democrats in national contests. \u201cThe government will tell you who you can hire and who you can source your products from.\u201d With his party holding majorities in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, Mr. Trump likely will get much of what he wants, in some form. At the congressional Republicans\u2019 gathering in Philadelphia on Thursday, the president\u2019s ideas met with approval and applause. Even his call for a $1 trillion program to rebuild the nation\u2019s infrastructure seems to be gaining traction among Republican budget hawks. This comes despite past GOP opposition to such a plan pushed by President Barack Obama -- which Republicans derided as a budget-busting boondoggle. On trade, jobs and taxes, his first week showed Mr. Trump is keeping his word from the election campaign. While his tough prescriptions could bring better deals for U.S. consumers and taxpayers, they carry large potential downsides.\u00a0 With trade, the new president\u2019s goal is to reverse the nation\u2019s deficit with the rest of the globe. Now, America imports more goods and services than it exports. His method is as tough as it is straightforward: Renegotiate trade treaties and, failing that, impose high tariffs on imports. Such a confrontational course risks higher prices for U.S. consumers and a disruption of global trade that could harm the U.S. economy.\u00a0 By the same token, his campaign to increase American job growth could prove enormously costly in terms of the federal deficit and the national debt.\u00a0 The same trade-off exists for his plan to slash both corporate and personal tax rates: More money would be in pockets for spending, and Washington would be deeper in red ink.\u00a0 Here\u2019s how Mr. Trump may alter the American economic status quo: Trade. The president\u2019s fight may be with the world, but he has targeted two key offenders to cross swords with, Mexico and China. He has the power to impose tariffs on both, although the risk is that a mutually ruinous trade war would erupt and imports would be costlier for American consumers. In his inaugural address, he lambasted what he sees as one-sided trade that harms U.S. workers. \u201cThe wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and distributed around the world,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Last week, Mr. Trump ordered the construction of a massive wall along the U.S. Southern border border, a notion that was a staple of his campaign oratory, and his press secretary floated the idea of a 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico. The president followed that by picking a Twitter fight with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto that led to a cancellation of their planned meeting.\u00a0 No doubt about it: Mexico sells the U.S. more than it buys from the U.S., to the tune of $61 billion. When the two nations (along with Canada) enacted the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, the U.S. has a $1.7 billion surplus with its Southern neighbor. Now Mr. Trump wants to renegotiate the pact, something the Mexicans are not eager to do.\u00a0 The president has stuck to his campaign trail pledge that he would make Mexico pay for his proposed wall, which is designed to keep its citizens from illegally entering the U.S. However, Mexican politicians and its public don\u2019t want to spend a single peso on such a venture. So lately, Mr. Trump is saying the U.S. will pay to build it and get Mexico to pay up in other ways -- perhaps by using tariff proceeds.\u00a0 The wall won\u2019t be cheap: up to $25 billion. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that amounts to $120 per U.S. household. Meanwhile, China has long enjoyed a huge trade surplus with the U.S., which has grown from around $84 billion in 2000 to $337 billion in 2015. That\u2019s why Mr. Trump has proposed slapping a tariff on Chinese imports of as much as 45 percent, up from the current 3 percent.\u00a0 \u00a0 Amid all this, the president made what appears to be a contradictory move: He withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. The TPP aimed to reduce trade barriers with seven nations on the other side of the Pacific: Japan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, Brunei and New Zealand.\u00a0 Absent from the pact was China, and many viewed the TPP as a means of containing Beijing\u2019s regional regional economic influence. With the TPP all but dead, China is pursuing its own Asia-Pacific trade agreement, excluding the U.S. from the table. But Mr. Trump is convinced -- as was his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton -- that the TPP wouldn\u2019t protect American jobs. Jobs.\u00a0Since overseas production often is cheaper than in the U.S., many domestic multinationals have an incentive to ship jobs elsewhere. One way Mr. Trump is attacking this situation is by proposing to impose tariffs on U.S. companies that build things in other places, then sell them in the U.S. The other way is to publicly shame employers that send jobs offshore. \u00a0 Aside from cheaper labor overseas, the motive to ship the jobs out of America is to get a lower tax bill. Washington taxes them far more -- a maximum 35 percent, although with deductions, it\u2019s lower -- than many foreign governments do.\u00a0 Right now, the U.S. taxes net income for American corporations, regardless of where in the world it is earned. This encourages them to shift production offshore and to keep their profits overseas. For that reason, Mr. Trump wants to lower the U.S. corporate rate. House Republicans, however, are floating a remedy called a \u201cborder adjustment,\u201d which is meant to boost exports and push down imports. The method sounds simple enough: Imports are taxed and exports aren\u2019t. But then it gets complex. Pantheon Economics\u2019 chief economist Ian Shepherson noted that American businesspeople traveling overseas would be taxed on their expenses. At the same time, he asked, \u201cAnd how would foreign tourists receive a credit for their spending in, say, U.S. restaurants?\u201d And some import-dependent American companies, like apparel retailers, would be harmed. As a consequence, Mr. Trump initially rejected the border-adjustment concept as \u201ctoo complicated.\u201d Then on Thursday, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said it was part of a \u201cbuffet\u201d of options the White House would consider. Where the president and Capitol Hill end up remains to be seen, but Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers appear eager to do something. Beyond that, Mr. Trump\u2019s drive to chastise companies that push production overseas has born fruit -- in that several he has criticized have knuckled under. The question is whether one-off attacks, often launched by Mr. Trump on Twitter, will be effective in a vast $19 trillion economy, which would entail zeroing in on hundreds of corporate behemoths.\u00a0 Large enterprises, which are the ones shipping the jobs out, employ around 60 million American workers, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. \u00a0 Economist Peter Morici, a University of Maryland professor, speaking on National Public Radio, cast doubt on the effectiveness of \u00a0Mr. Trump\u2019s targeting these companies. \u201cLet\u2019s lean on General Motors. Let\u2019s lean on Carrier. Let\u2019s lean on United Technologies,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, all the deals in the world are not going to give you the kind of turnaround and jobs growth that he needs. For example, 100,000 more jobs a month would mean a hundred deals a month.\u201d \u00a0 Indeed, the math is daunting. Take Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement Wednesday that Sprint (S) would be\u00a0bringing 5,000 jobs\u00a0back to the U.S. over the next 15 months. The U.S. economy in 2016, though, created 6,000 jobs per day.\u00a0 Taxes. For personal income taxes, Mr. Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, both want to lower tax rates and the number of tax brackets, although they differ on some details. The president would cap deductions at $200,000 for a couple. Ryan would end itemized deductions except for charity and mortgage interest. To be sure, Mr. Trump\u2019s plan, as unveiled during the campaign, would put more money in everyone\u2019s pocket, with wealthier taxpayers benefiting the most. An analysis by the Tax Foundation\u00a0think tank found that those in the top 1 percent of income would gain as much as 16 percent, and those in the 40 percent-60 percent segment would get only 1.3 percent more. Mr. Trump has disputed that analysis. In terms of corporate taxes, the president wants to lower the top rate to 15 percent from the current 35 percent, and Speaker Ryan opts for 20 percent, which he believes would be more fiscally prudent. They also both want to engineer a repatriation of some $2 trillion in U.S multinationals\u2019 profits now stashed oversees, free of the IRS.\u00a0 Their hope is that the money would flow to building new plants and equipment and to hiring more Americans. The trap here is that the funds might instead end up going to stockholders in the form of higher dividends and share buybacks. That would be an economic stimulus, certainly, yet wouldn\u2019t juice businesses and jobs directly.\u00a0 The last time a repatriation happened, in 2004, the government charged a special low tax rate of 5.25 percent and, sure enough, the money corporations brought home went mainly to investors.\u00a0 The one thing that a lower corporate rate would accomplish, said John Maloney, chairman of New York-based M&R Capital Management, is to boost smaller businesses -- which usually aren\u2019t public companies with shareholders and have no overseas operations. \u201cSmall companies are the ones that create most of the jobs,\u201d Maloney said. And they tend to pay higher rates than large corporations, who, thanks to clever uses of deductions and the like, may pay an effective federal tax rate as low as 10 percent. \u201cThe small and midsize businesses don\u2019t have the accounting firepower\u201d from expensive law and accounting firms that the big corporations do, he said. None of this comes cheap. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that enactment of Mr. Trump\u2019s plans would add $5.3 trillion to the national debt, pushing it to 105 percent of GDP from 77 percent now. The president\u2019s team has disagreed with that conclusion, saying the economic bonanza from the president\u2019s program would lead to a torrent of new tax revenue. Whichever is right, the momentum for now seems to be with the Oval Office\u2019s new occupant. And America\u2019s reality may reflect his economic vision, sooner or later.

            "article_content": "President Trump will speak with Russian leader Vladimir Putin over the weekend, senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said in an interview Friday. Asked about reports of an upcoming phone call between Putin and Mr. Trump, Conway confirmed to \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d that it would be taking place Saturday.\u00a0 \u201cThe president continues to talk to leaders of foreign nations,\u201d Conway said, also pointing to the Mr. Trump\u2019s meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May. \u201cThat\u2019s what presidents do.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI assume they will discuss the interests of their respective countries,\u201d she said. The counselor to the president noted that the two leaders will likely talk about \u201cissues where you can find common ground... and where these two nations could maybe defeat radical Islamic terrorism.\u201d The phone call comes after the U.S. intelligence community determined that Russian, at the direction of the Kremlin,\u00a0hacked the 2016 presidential election, with goals to prop up Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign over Hillary Clinton\u2019s. Asked who initiated plans for the phone call, Conway said she wouldn\u2019t divulge that information. \u201cIt also doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to have leaders talking to each other. We have to forge better relationships around the globe.\u201d Despite the push for better foreign relations, Conway, in her interview, also defended President Trump\u2019s plans for a wall along southern U.S. border and his insistence that Mexico pay for its construction.\u00a0 She said one possibility floated for Mexico to foot the bill is to \u201ctax the imports from Mexico anywhere from 5 to 20 percent.\u201d (On Thursday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer initially said the proposal was for a 20 percent import tax.) Another was to have Congressional funding front the funds and have Mexico later reimburse the money.\u00a0 Pressed by \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d co-cost Charlie Rose on whether Mexico could retaliate with a tax of their own on U.S. goods flowing into the country, Conway replied: \u201cPossibly -- they can do what they want, Charlie.\u201d\u00a0 And questioned further by \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d co-host Gayle King on why Mexico would pay for a wall the country does not want, Conway said: \u201cWell they don\u2019t want it, Gayle, because they want to continue to allow people and, I assume, drugs -- since they\u2019re not doing much to stop that -- pouring over our borders.\u201d \u201cMexico should pay for that wall,\u201d Conway added, because \u201cthey get an awful lot through this country,\u201d citing the U.S.\u2019 nearly $60 billion trade deficit with Mexico.",

Two Washington restaurateurs argue you can\u2019t \u2014 and have sued him over it. The plaintiffs are Khalid Pitts and Diane Gross. They allege unfair competition under local law and have filed a lawsuit against Trump personally and the Trump Old Post Office LLC, which operates the Trump International Hotel. The two plaintiffs own Cork Wine Bar, which is in the Logan Circle neighborhood, about a mile and a half away from the hotel. Cork Wine Bar is a well-regarded brick-walled market and wine bar that serves New American small plates. FBI Director James Comey went to Capitol Hill Thursday to brief the Gang of Eight members of Congress on President Trump\u2019s wiretapping allegations, as well as other national security matters, CBS News\u2019 Nancy Cordes reports. Comey met with the Gang of Eight in two separate meetings -- one with the senators and one with the House members. The Gang is composed of the leaders from each party in the House and Senate, as well as the chair and ranking member from the House and Senate Intelligence Committees. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on Thursday struggled with the question of whether President Donald Trump is under investigation by the Department of Justice, saying in a lengthy exchange with reporters that the White House is \u201cnot aware\u201d of any investigation involving the president. On Wednesday, Spicer was asked about the issue in the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s\u00a0allegations about being wiretapped\u00a0at Trump Tower during the 2016 election. He replied that there\u2019s \u201cobviously a lot of concern\u201d about the issue. Later in the briefing, however, an aide handed him a note and he was more definitive in his answer. Vice President Mike Pence said Thursday that former national security adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s work to further the interests of the government of Turkey is \u201can affirmation\u201d of President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to ask for his resignation. Pence told Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier in an interview airing Thursday evening that media reports about Flynn\u2019s work were \u201cthe first I heard of it and I think it is an affirmation of the President\u2019s decision to ask General Flynn to resign.\u201d Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has recused himself from TransCanada\u2019s application for a presidential permit for the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, the State Department says. Republicans on a pivotal House committee scored an initial triumph in their effort to scuttle former President Obama\u2019s health care overhaul, using a pre-dawn vote Thursday to abolish the tax penalty his statute imposes on people who don\u2019t purchase insurance and reshaping how millions of Americans buy medical care. Yet the Ways and Means\u00a0 panel\u2019s approval of health care legislation only masked deeper problems Republican backers face. Hospitals, doctors and consumer groups mounted intensifying opposition to the GOP health care drive, and the White House and Republican leaders labored to rally a divided party behind their high-stakes overhaul crusade. President Trump is nominating former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman to serve as U.S. ambassador to Russia, two sources familiar with the situation have confirmed to CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett. The nomination, like many in the Trump world, has been on the table for weeks and it took some time to complete the paperwork. Before the president nominated Rex Tillerson for secretary of state, Huntsman was\u00a0among the contenders considered for the job. A Wisconsin Democrat will be introducing congressional legislation Thursday aimed at ensuring that taxpayers won\u2019t be paying for President Trump\u2019s southern border wall, CBS News\u2019 Rebecca Shabad reports. The \u201cNo Taxpayer Funding for the Wall Act,\u201d obtained first by CBS News, is sponsored by Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wisconsin, and would prohibit the use of federal funds to build a fence, wall or any other physical barrier along the border with Mexico. \u201cI am not in favor of the wall, but if there is a wall, then I do not want the United States of America to pay for the wall,\u201d Moore said in an interview with CBS, adding that she doesn\u2019t want American taxpayers and consumers harmed by the cost. President Donald Trump\u2019s daughter and son-in-law are renting a house from a foreign billionaire who is fighting the U.S. government over a proposed mine in Minnesota. The Wall Street Journal reports that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner are renting a $5.5 million house in Washington\u2019s Kalorama neighborhood from Andr\u00f3nico Luksic. One of the Chilean billionaire\u2019s companies is suing the federal government over lost mineral right leases for a proposed copper-nickel mine in northeastern Minnesota. President Trump holds a \u201clistening session\u201d with the National Economic Council, 11 a.m.; he\u2019ll have a legislative affairs lunch at 12:30 p.m. and at 4 p.m., he\u2019ll address the U.S. Senate Youth program. Vice President Pence addresses The Latino Coalition\u2019s Make Small Business\u00a0 Great Again summit, 12:15 p.m. The day after\u00a0Republicans introduced their plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, the conservative opposition came swiftly. Throughout the day Tuesday, conservative members from the House and the Senate, as well as conservative advocacy groups voiced their opposition to the bill, deriding it with nicknames like \u201cRyancare\u201d and \u201cObamacare 2.0.\u201d Here\u2019s the calculation for Republican leadership: If it remains the case that no Democrats come forward to support the bill, in the House, Speaker Paul Ryan can\u2019t afford to lose more than 21 votes. In the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has only two votes votes to spare -- and if two Republicans defect, he\u2019ll need Mike Pence to break the tie. Leon Panetta was President Clinton\u2019s chief of staff, the CIA director when Osama bin Laden was killed, and defense secretary under President Obama. That is why Scott Pelley\u00a0asked Panetta for his perspective on President Trump\u2019s various outbursts in recent weeks, including the unproven charge that Mr. Obama ordered surveillance on Trump Tower during the 2016 presidential election. AARP announced its opposition\u00a0to the Republican proposal that would repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), arguing that it would \u201cweaken Medicare\u201d and give special interests a \u201csweetheart deal.\u201d But the group\u2019s primary concern is for people who haven\u2019t yet reached retirement age, highlighting one of the biggest problems with the GOP\u2019s plan to use tax credits in lieu of Obamacare subsidies. As proposed, the plan does not offer enough to help older people pay for what would become much more expensive coverage if the subsidies are scrapped and the GOP\u2019s proposals to relax current age-based caps on premiums go through.\u00a0 President Donald Trump\u00a0appears to becoming more popular, although\u00a0one new poll still has his deep under water. A USA Today/Suffolk University poll released Tuesday has 47 percent of Americans saying they approve of Mr. Trump\u2019s performance, versus 44 percent who do not. The survey, which was conducted last week in the days\u00a0around his well-received address to Congress, gives Mr. Trump particularly good reviews when it comes to his leadership abilities. And today, a majority of voters say Attorney General\u00a0Jeff Sessions should resign, according to a new poll. The poll, conducted by Quinnipiac University, indicated that 51 percent of voters think Sessions should step down, versus 42 percent who say he should stay on. The survey came on the heels of news that\u00a0Sessions did not disclose a fall meeting with the Russian ambassador\u00a0during his confirmation hearings. The top Republican on the House intelligence committee said he has not seen any evidence to back President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0claim that the Obama administration wiretapped him during the 2016 campaign\u00a0and suggested the news media were\u00a0taking the president\u2019s weekend tweets too literally. \u201cThe president is a neophyte to politics \u2014 he\u2019s been doing this a little over a year,\u201d Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told reporters Tuesday. \u201cI think a lot of the things he says, I think you guys sometimes take literally.\u201d Civil rights leaders asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Tuesday to urge President Trump not to move forward with\u00a0an investigation into his unverified claim that several million people voted illegally in the election, Politico reports. The president had been planning for a blue-ribbon panel to launch a probe into the claim. \u201cI asked him to counsel the president against the creation of such a task force and a commission because that commission will be seen to intimidate our communities,\u201d Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said, according to Politico. The Justice Department moved Tuesday to\u00a0dismiss the 9th Circuit appeal\u00a0on President Trump\u2019s original travel ban from late January. On Monday, senior administration officials said that\u00a0the new travel ban\u00a0rolled out that day makes all previous litigation over the original travel ban \u201cmoot.\u201d White House press secretary Sean Spicer previously suggested that the two bans would be litigated on parallel tracks but that isn\u2019t a legally viable option. President Trump meets with Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings about lower prescription drug prices, 2:30 p.m. Mr. Trump has a busy schedule, but at this point, his meetings are closed. He\u2019ll meet with Laurene Powell Jobs at 11 a.m., host a lunch on infrastructure at 12:30, meet with Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings at 2:30. He\u2019ll see Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, Sens. Lisa Murkowski, Dan Sullivan 4 p.m.; meets with conservative leaders on health care, 5:05 p.m.; has dinner with Ted and Heidi Cruz\u00a0 Two House committees -- Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce -- mark up the Obamacare replacement plan, 10:30 a.m.",

            "article_content": "U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said Sunday, in light of a growing number of probes into sexual misconduct against lawmakers, that \"the time has come\" to start bringing \"a conscience\" to the situation surrounding the treatment of women in the workplace as well as on Capitol Hill.\u00a0 When asked what she thinks of the \"cultural shift\" taking place in the U.S., Haley said she is \"incredibly proud of the women who have come forward.\" \"I'm proud of their strength. I'm proud of their courage,\" Haley said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation.\" Haley's comments came after three lawmakers in one week, including Sen. Al Franken, D-Minnesota, Rep. John Conyers, D-Michigan and Rep. Trent Franks, R-Arizona, announced they would step down from office following allegations of sexual misconduct and harassment. When asked to assess similar allegations of misconduct leveled against President Trump during the 2016 campaign, Haley replied, \"Women who accuse anyone should be heard. They should be heard and they should be dealt with.\"\u00a0 \"I think we heard from them prior to the election. And I think any woman who has felt violated or felt mistreated in any way, they have every right to speak up,\" she added. Meanwhile, Haley applauded the president's move in announcing the U.S. recognizes\u00a0Jerusalem as the capital of Israel\u00a0-- a controversial move that has ignited protests in the Middle East.\u00a0 She told CBS News' John Dickerson that Mr. Trump's announcement on Wednesday was \"the right thing to do.\" \"It is absolutely the right thing to do. And look, for the last 22 years, everyone around every president has said, 'Just wait, just wait, just wait.' And President Trump's not going to wait anymore,\" said Haley, calling the president's decision a \"courageous\" one. When asked if Mr. Trump's move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital and begin the early stages of moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to the city would further inflame tensions and disrupt work on the peace process, Haley said, \"I think that when you recognize the truth, when both parties recognize reality, peace comes.\" \"If you notice when the president spoke, he made it very clear. He didn't talk about boundaries. He didn't talk about borders. He didn't get into any of that because the final status of Jerusalem is between the Palestinians and the Israelis. It's not for the Americans to decide.\" She added, \"The sky is not falling. If anything, what we're going to see is both sides are going to come to the table. They're going to decide what they think Jerusalem should look like. And we're going to support that process.\" While the latest move by the administration may impact the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, as Vice President Mike Pence prepares to visit the Middle East, Haley maintains that \"both sides\" will come to table and \"decide what they think Jerusalem should look like.\" \"What he did was take it off the table. Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. Take that off the table. Tell both sides to come together and say, 'Okay, you decide how you want to split up Jerusalem. You decide if you're going to create boundaries or borders there.' And let them decide,\" said Haley.\u00a0 To critics of the president's plan, Haley says the decision \"will go down in history to show he made the move that finally got the two parties to come to the table.\" Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

            "article_content": "Congressional Republicans are preparing a two-week spending bill that would keep the government open past the Dec. 8 deadline, through right before the Christmas holiday, GOP aides confirmed to CBS News.  House Republicans are eyeing a continuing resolution (CR) that would extend funding through Dec. 22.\u00a0 One aide said Republicans then plan to pursue another short-term spending measure to extend funding into January. This plan would require House lawmakers to stick around Washington past their original departure date.  House GOP leaders are expected to present the plan at a closed-door meeting Friday morning. Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, admitted Thursday that time is running out and Congress will likely have to pursue a short-term bill. \"But we're going to obviously have to have a short-term CR. The duration of that CR, we're going to be -- we're in talks with our own members. We're going to be having a conference with our members to go through all of that. So stay tuned on that,\" he said at his weekly press conference.  Ryan acknowledged that Senate Democrats could block a short-term measure, in which case he said they would be blamed for a shutdown.  \"And if the Senate Democrats choose to filibuster that, then they will have chosen to shut the government down, something that we do not want to see happen,\" he said.  An aide to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, declined to comment about the developing plan. Republicans need Democratic votes in the Senate in order to fund the government because 60 votes are needed to advance spending measures in the upper chamber where Republicans only have 52 members.  Congress has less than two weeks to meet the Dec. 8 deadline to pass a new funding bill and avoid a government shutdown. To make matters more complicated, lawmakers need a longer-term deal to lift limits on government spending set by a 2011 law to allow for funding boosts to the military and domestic programs.  This comes after Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, skipped a meeting with their GOP counterparts and President Trump at the White House on Tuesday where they were expected to discuss spending negotiations. The president signaled Tuesday that the government could shut down if Democrats don't agree to his demands on defense spending, his administration's plan to reduce crime and his border wall. Asked if Democrats would be to blame if the government shuts down, Mr. Trump said, \"If that happens, I would absolutely blame Democrats if that happens.\" Congress last passed a government spending package earlier this year, which excluded funding for the border wall. The White House backed off of that demand after realizing Democrats wouldn't agree to it. Mr. Trump appears adamant, however, that he get the financing for wall construction, which makes the chances of a shutdown that much higher.\u00a0 The government last shut down for 16 days in October 2013 after Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, led an unsuccessful charge to defund Obamacare. The shutdown wasn't viewed as detrimental to Republicans because they won control of both chambers in the 2014 midterm elections.\u00a0 The dynamic is slightly different this time around now that Republicans control the White House and Congress. in 2013, they controlled only the House of Representatives.\u00a0 CBS News' Catherine Reynolds contributed to this report.\u00a0 Rebecca Shabad is a video reporter for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President Donald Trump is again coming to the side of GOP Alabama Senate nominee Roy Moore despite calls from other Republican leaders that Moore should leave the race over accusations of decades-old sexual assault.\u00a0 In a pair of tweets Sunday morning, Mr. Trump said \"the last thing we need\" in Alabama and the Senate is a \"puppet\" of the Democratic congressional leadership.\u00a0 Mr. Trump contends Moore's opponent, Democrat Doug Jones -- a former prosecutor -- is \"WEAK\" on crime and border security, \"BAD\" for the military, veterans, gun rights, and itching to raise taxes \"TO THE SKY.\"\u00a0 \"Jones would be a disaster!\" Mr. Trump wrote in one tweet, adding in another that \"Liberal Jones would be BAD!\"\u00a0 The last thing we need in Alabama and the U.S. Senate is a Schumer/Pelosi puppet who is WEAK on Crime, WEAK on the Border, Bad for our Military and our great Vets, Bad for our 2nd Amendment, AND WANTS TO RAISES TAXES TO THE SKY. Jones would be a disaster! I endorsed Luther Strange in the Alabama Primary. He shot way up in the polls but it wasn\u2019t enough. Can\u2019t let Schumer/Pelosi win this race. Liberal Jones would be BAD! Two women have accused the 70-year-old Moore of sexually assaulting or molesting them decades ago, when he was in his 30s and they were teenagers. At least five others have said he pursued romantic relationships when they were teenagers and he was a prosecutor. Moore vehemently denies the allegations.\u00a0 Before departing for his Mar-a-Lago estate ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, Mr. Trump also spoke about Jones and the vacant Alabama Senate seat, telling reporters of the Alabama race, \"we don't need a liberal person in there.\" \"I can tell you one thing for sure, we don't need a liberal person in there, a Democrat, Jones,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I've looked at his record \u2014 it's terrible on crime. It's terrible at the borders. I can tell you, we do not need somebody that's going to be bad on crime, bad on borders, bad with the military, bad with the Second Amendment.\" A spokesman for the Jones campaign could not immediately be reached by phone for comment.\u00a0 Jones is best known for leading the prosecution of two Ku Klux Klansmen who bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham in 1963, killing four girls.  Top Republicans in Congress, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have called for Moore to leave the race, and the Republican National Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee have pulled their support for his campaign.  \"He's definitely trying to throw a lifeline to Roy Moore,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said of Mr. Trump in an interview Sunday with CNN's \"State of the Union.\"  But Graham said that when it comes to Moore, it's unclear \"what winning looks like.\"  \"If he wins, we get the baggage of him winning and it becomes a story every day about whether or not you believe the women or Roy Moore, should he stay in the Senate, should he be expelled. If you lose, you give the Senate seat to a Democrat at a time we need all the votes we can get,\" he said. \"The moral of the story is: Don't nominate somebody like Roy Moore who could actually lose a seat that any other Republican could win,\" Graham said. The special election to fill the seat held by Republican Jeff Sessions, now the U.S. attorney general, will be held Dec. 12.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has closely followed his boss' playbook, encouraging mining and drilling on public lands and reducing the size of national monuments that President Donald Trump called a \"massive land grab\" by his Democratic predecessors. Except, that is, in Montana. In Zinke's home state, the former congressman who has long harbored higher political ambitions is recommending Trump create a new national monument out of the forests bordering Glacier National Park, to the disappointment of a company that wants to drill for natural gas there. A couple hundred miles away, where rocky bluffs line the Missouri River, he decided to leave intact a 590-square-mile (1,528-square-kilometer) monument that for 16 years has stirred the kind of impassioned local opposition that Zinke cited in justifying changes to monuments elsewhere. And he wants to curb mining along Montana's border with Yellowstone National Park. That could discourage development of two proposed mines that supporters say would offer higher paying jobs than tourism. The decision was based on Zinke's belief that \"some places are too precious to mine,\" his spokeswoman said last month. Zinke, a rumored candidate for U.S. Senate in 2018 or governor in 2020, appears to be carving out an exception for Montana from Trump's agenda to open more public lands to natural resources development. Whether it stems from Montana pride or political ambition in a state where conservation has bipartisan appeal, the results have rankled both sides in the debate over managing millions of acres of public lands in the U.S. West. \"It's totally favoritism,\" said Land Tawney, president of the conservation group Backcountry Hunters and Anglers. Tawney is a friend of the president's son, Donald Trump Jr., and his group threw its support behind Zinke's nomination last winter. But he said the Interior secretary's recommendations to scale back four large monuments in the West, including Bears Ears in Utah, represent a \"sellout to industry\" that's putting public land and wildlife at risk. Zinke also called for shrinking two marine monuments in the Pacific Ocean. \"We're happy he recognizes the importance of the Badger Two-Medicine,\" Tawney said, referring to the 203-square-mile (526-square-kilometer) area south of Glacier that Zinke recommends be a monument. \"Places that are very similar in fashion, like Bears Ears, he's not quite protecting. ... You can't talk out of both sides of your mouth.\" Zinke spokeswoman Heather Swift declined to comment on how he came to recommend a monument designation for Badger-Two Medicine or whether he was treating public lands in Montana differently than elsewhere. In recommendations to Trump contained in a recently leaked memo, Zinke noted that the Badger-Two Medicine area is sacred to the Blackfoot tribes of the U.S. and Canada. Zinke also suggested monument status for two other sites: Camp Nelson in Kentucky, a Union supply depot and hospital where black troops and others trained during the Civil War, and the Jackson, Mississippi, home of slain civil rights figure Medgar Evers. Badger-Two Medicine has been the subject of a long-running dispute between the Blackfeet Tribe, which has a reservation next to the proposed monument, and a Louisiana oil and gas company, Solenex, which wants to drill on the land. Zinke's recommendation for the area presents an \"optics problem\" at a time when the Trump administration has criticized the use of the 1906 Antiquities Act to create monuments, said William Perry Pendley, president of the conservative Mountain States Legal Foundation, which is representing Solenex. \"It's terribly disappointing,\" Pendley said. \"What the secretary ought to be sending to the president is a recommendation to repeal the Antiquities Act, to put an end to this issue.\" Pendley compared Zinke's actions to those of President Bill Clinton in 1996, when he halted a gold mine near Yellowstone, and of the Obama administration last year, when it proposed to end new mining claims on 30,000 acres near the park, which Zinke now supports. Zinke has made no secret of his political desires. In his first term in the U.S. House, he raised his hand to become speaker but didn't get chosen after Ohio Rep. John Boehner resigned. Last year, Zinke became an early supporter of Trump and publicly stated his desire to be picked as vice president. In Montana, he's been viewed as a potential contender against U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, a Democrat up for re-election next year whom Republicans consider vulnerable. Analysts say it's not too late for Zinke to jump in. Another possibility arises in 2020 when Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, a Democrat, reaches his two-term limit. Residents in the tiny ranching community of Winifred were disappointed by Zinke's decision to leave intact the nearby Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument, which they have fought since Clinton designated it in January 2001 in one of his last acts in office. When Trump and Zinke arrived in Washington, they seemed to promise the changes the community long sought, said Ron Poertner, a rancher and member of the group Missouri River Stewards. \"We thought, 'Oh, my gosh, somebody has finally seen the light and is going to get this monument business right,'\" Poertner said. \"But there's just one person per mile over here and these liberals and big media can out-organize us in a heartbeat,\" he said. \"If there are any political aspirations, you don't want to tick off where the strength of voting is in Montana.\"",

            "article_content": "CARACAS, Venezuela -- Days before a polarizing vote to start rewriting its constitution, Venezuela is convulsing to a rhythm of daytime strikes and nocturnal clashes. The most recent violence drove the death toll from nearly four months of unrest to 102 on Thursday.  Most of the dead in anti-government protests that began in April are young men killed by gunfire. The toll also includes looters; police allegedly attacked by protesters; and civilians killed in accidents related to roadblocks set up during demonstrations.  The count has been highly politicized, with the opposition and other government agencies reporting varying tolls and causes of death that focus blame on the other side.  The protests began over moves by President Nicolas Maduro's government to restrict the powers of the opposition-controlled National Assembly.  But the mounting deaths of demonstrators have become a separate source of outrage for the young people who march during the day and assemble nightly to fight the police and national guardsmen at improvised barricades across the country.  \"The ones who have fallen fighting repression motivate us to keep fighting,\" said Sandra Fernandez, a 21-year-old university student.  The country's chief prosecutor reported Thursday on Twitter that a 16-year-old was killed at a protest in the capital overnight while a 23-year-old man was slain at a demonstration in Merida state.  The four killings pushed the death toll of the political crisis above the century mark. The oil-rich South American country, which was in the second day of a two-day general strike that shuttered businesses nationwide, has also seen thousands of injuries and arrests.  The bridge that connects Venezuela and C\u00facuta, Colombia, has always been a busy border crossing, but the number of Venezuelans walking into Colombia only increases as the violence and instability in their country intensifies, reports CBS News correspondent Manuel Bojorquez.  The luggage coming through makes the border look like an airport. Thousands of Venezuelans cross daily in search of food, medicine and work. Some return home, but Marcos Gonzales said he can't.  His wife, Liliola Gonzales, and son, who recently had heart surgery, came with him. \"There's no medicine,\" she said. \"He has autism too and needs medication.\"  The death toll in Venezuela appears likely to keep rising in the coming days.  Opposition leaders have called on supporters to convene in the capital Friday at the end of a 48-hour general strike that began Wednesday. On Sunday the government holds a vote that will start a process of rewriting the constitution by electing members of a special assembly to reshape the charter.  The opposition is boycotting that vote, saying the election rules were rigged to guarantee Maduro a majority and arguing that a new constitution could replace democracy with a single-party authoritarian system.  The chief prosecutor's office has released little information about the victims of the unrest, but at least 44 are believed to have been shot while participating in protests. Many of those deaths are blamed on armed motorcycle gangs of government supporters known as \"colectivos\" who are often seen shooting indiscriminately at protesters while police and troops stand by.  \"The level of impunity is extremely high, and that continues on to a situation like this,\" said David Smilde, a Tulane University expert on Venezuela. \"If you look at the violence it would appear that this time around, most of it is coming from pro-government forces, either National Guard and police or 'colectivos' that are aligned with the government.\"  Compared to a spate of protests that left 43 dead on both sides in 2014, Smilde said, \"This time around most of it is coming from government forces, either National Guard and police or 'colectivos' that are aligned with the government.\"  Security forces have been accused of excessive force but have used mostly non-lethal arms, a tactic that has kept protest deaths relatively low in comparison with the overall level of violence in a country with one of the world's highest homicide rates. An average of 78 people a day died violently last year in this country of 31.5 million, according the non-governmental Venezuelan Violence Observatory. According to an AP review of prosecutors' reports, the victims of the political unrest have overwhelmingly been male, with only six women killed. They are also mostly young, averaging 27 years old. The youngest was 14 and the oldest 54. At least 22 were students. A handful were police or soldiers. Sixty-nine of the deaths were from gunshots. Just 21 of the killings have resulted in an arrest or orders for apprehension issued, with nearly half those coming against security forces. Lander's mother, Zugeimar Armas, who has kept her son's room intact since his death in early June, said that regardless of whether her son was killed by the National Guard or an improvised bomb, she blames the government. \"What need does a 17-year-old boy have to be in the streets?\" she asked.",

            "article_content": "President Trump presented ambitious and strong promises and platforms during his campaign to \"make America great again,\" ranging from building a border wall to seeking to prosecute former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\u00a0 But since then, he's made some startling shifts as he approaches the end of his first 100 days in office, disappointing some supporters, while leaving others unfazed. A whopping 96 percent of Mr. Trump's voters said they would vote for him again, according to a recent ABC/Washington Post poll. Here are the positions and promises on which Mr. Trump has done an about-face. President Donald Trump railed against the Export-Import Bank -- the export credit agency wholly owned by the federal government -- which supports exporters by helping foreign entities with loans so that they can purchase American-made products. During his campaign, he called it \"feather bedding for politicians and others.\" But, earlier this month, he said he had changed his mind and now believes the system is good, produces jobs and pays for itself.\u00a0 \"Instinctively, you would say, 'Isn't that a ridiculous thing,'\" Trump told\u00a0The Wall Street Journal. \"But actually, it's a very good thing. And it actually makes money, it could make a lot of money.\" Throughout his campaign, Mr. Trump emphasized avoiding conflicts in the Middle East and focusing on domestic issues, trumpeting an \"America first\" policy stance.\u00a0 But by April, that stance apparently shifted, with Mr. Trump authorizing a strike on a Syrian airbase in response to a deadly chemical weapons attack, and allowing the U.S. military to drop the \"mother of all bombs\" on a network of ISIS tunnels in Afghanistan.\u00a0 In 2013, before entering the 2016 presidential race, Mr. Trump decried the possibility that former President Barack Obama would use military force in Syria without congressional authorization.\u00a0 What will we get for bombing Syria besides more debt and a possible long term conflict? Obama needs Congressional approval. A few weeks back, Mr. Trump authorized an air strike on the Syrian airbase where he said the chemical weapon attack originated. He indicated that watching the deaths of children shifted his perspective.\u00a0 During his 2016 presidential bid, Mr. Trump called NATO \"obsolete.\" But earlier this month, he praised the organization and said he believes the U.S. can accomplish much through its partnership. \"I said it was obsolete; it's no longer obsolete,\" the president said.\u00a0 Later, in an interview with the Associated Press, the president admitted he didn't know much about NATO when he called NATO \"obsolete,\" and said he knows much more now.\u00a0 During his campaign, Mr. Trump insisted Mexico would pay for a wall bordering it and the U.S. to keep out immigrants here illegally.  But in recent weeks, the president has pushed Congress to pay for the wall with American tax dollars.\u00a0 During his campaign against former Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump strongly attacked her credibility and trustworthiness, saying in October 2016 that if he won, he would instruct his attorney general to \"get a special prosecutor to look into your situation\" involving the private email server.\u00a0 But immediately after the election, he reversed course on prosecuting Clinton, saying, \"I don't want to hurt the Clintons, I really don't. ... It's just not something that I feel very strongly about.\" During his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump decried then-President Barack Obama's time on the golf course, saying he wouldn't have time for such leisurely activities in office.\u00a0 \"I'm going to be working for you, I'm not going to have time to go play golf,\" he said at a Virginia rally last year.\u00a0 But Mr. Trump has golfed more than any recent president in his first 100 days \u2014 19 days. Obama, by contrast, didn't golf a single day in his first 100 days on the job.\u00a0 Mr. Trump promised to label China a currency manipulator on day one of his presidency, going as far to say China was \"ripping us off\" as a nation in May 2016.\u00a0 Not only did he fail to do that on his first day in office, but the president did a complete 180-degree turn on the issue earlier this month, saying he would no longer label the People's Republic of China as such. \u00a0 \"They're not currency manipulators,\" Trump said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, adding that he thinks the American dollar is too strong.\u00a0 During his campaign, Mr. Trump called Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen a very \"political\" person, claiming she was keeping interest rates low to help former President Barack Obama. From his remarks, she didn't appear to have a good shot at staying in Mr. Trump's administration when her term is up in February 2018.\u00a0 But, after meeting with Yellen earlier this month, he appeared to change his mind. He told the Wall Street Journal in an extensive interview: \"You know, I like her, I respect her. She's been here [in the Oval Office.] She's been in that seat. I do like the low interest rate policy.\" In other words, it looks like Yellen \u2013 and her low interest rates \u2014 could be here to stay.\u00a0 In May 2014, President Donald Trump said that -- if he ran -- he would \"absolutely\" produce his tax returns. \"If I decide to run for office, I'll produce my tax returns, absolutely,\" he said. \"And I would love to do that.\" Time and again during the campaign, and now during his presidency, Mr. Trump has either dodged or refused to hand them over. On Wednesday, Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin said the president \"has no intention\" of releasing his returns.\u00a0 Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Making good on a Trump campaign promise, the president's administration formally told Congress Thursday that it intends to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. U.S. Trade Rep. Robert Lighthizer sent a letter to congressional leaders that starts 90 days of consultations with lawmakers over how to revamp the pact. Talks with Canada and Mexico can begin after that. The two-page letter offered few details about what changes the administration would seek in the 23-year-old pact, which President Donald Trump has repeatedly called \"a disaster.\" Lighthizer told reporters that any new deal should do a better job of protecting U.S. factory workers and should be updated to reflect new technologies. Last month, White House aides spread word that Trump was ready to pull out of NAFTA. Within hours, the president reversed course and said that he'd seek a better deal first. \"We are going to give renegotiation a good strong shot,\" Lighthizer said. He refused to say whether leaving NAFTA remained an option. The trade agreement has been a lightning rod for criticism since it was being negotiated in the early 1990s. During the 1992 presidential campaign, independent candidate Ross Perot famously predicted a \"giant sucking sound\" as NAFTA pulled U.S. factory jobs south of the border into Mexico. Campaigning last year, Trump vowed to renegotiate NAFTA and pull out of it he couldn't get a better deal. NAFTA took effect in 1994 and led to a big increase in trade among the three countries. American farmers have mostly benefited from the reduction in trade barriers. But the pact did encourage American manufacturers to relocate some operations to Mexico to take advantage of cheaper labor there. Critics blame NAFTA for wiping out U.S. factory jobs, an assertion that's backed up by some research. \"Since the signing of NAFTA, we have seen our manufacturing industry decimated, factories shuttered, and countless workers left jobless,\" U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement. \"President Trump is going to change that.\" In March, the administration circulated an eight-page draft letter on NAFTA that disappointed critics by appearing to keep much of the existing trade agreement in place. Thursday's letter had fewer specifics. Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch, called it \"markedly vague.\" House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi complained that \"the president's vague NAFTA letter is a stark contrast with the aggressive promises he made to hard-working families during the campaign.\" But Republican congressional leaders promised to work with the administration to craft a better deal. \"We look forward to working with the administration to strengthen the agreement in a seamless way and ensure that we retain the current benefits for American workers, farmers and businesses,\" said Texas Republican Rep. Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Mexico and Canada signaled that they welcomed the opportunity to modernize the agreement. Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute, said the United States could seek modest \"technocratic\" changes, including provisions to update NAFTA to reflect technologies that have emerged since the original agreement was negotiated. Or it could take a more aggressive approach, putting pressure on Mexico to reduce the trade gap, perhaps by dropping a value-added tax Mexico slaps on goods coming across the border.\u00a0 Thomas Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, urged the administration to reach a deal quickly. Political pressures in 2018 \u2014 a presidential election in Mexico and congressional elections in the United States \u2014 could make it harder to seal an agreement next year.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump won the presidency by crusading against slow growth in the U.S.economy, as he castigated trade pacts and other culprits he accuses of damaging the American worker's well-being. At the 100-day mark, though, he hasn't scored any major accomplishments on the economic front, although it's not for want of trying. The gold standard for the first 100 days was struck by Franklin Roosevelt, when he assumed the presidency in March 1933 with the nation mired in the Great Depression. Within that time span, FDR got Congress, which was controlled by his fellow Democrats, to set up New Deal programs to aid the millions of unemployed and impoverished Americans: welfare payments, farm subsidies and public works projects. The situation is less dire in 2017 -- the jobless rate was 25 percent in 1933 and is 4.5 percent now -- but Mr. Trump strikes a chord by evoking, as he did in his inaugural address, \"rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation.\"\u00a0 The difference nowadays is that, while the president's party also has congressional majorities, they are more fractious than in Roosevelt's day. And the opposition party has enough votes and enough animus against Mr. Trump that getting things done is immeasurably harder. Meeting the Roosevelt standard has been rather difficult for his successors. Ronald Reagan took until July 1981 to get his signature tax cut through Congress -- and his Republicans ruled one of the two chambers, the Senate.\u00a0 On Wall Street, which is informed by perceived prospects for the U.S. economy and corporate earnings, a lot of enthusiasm remains for Mr. Trump, even though he hasn't yet enacted anything major. \"Based on the S&P 500's performance since Inauguration Day, Wall Street has awarded President Trump an A for anticipation, while Main Street likely gave him a B for benefit of the doubt,\" said Sam Stovall, CFRA's chief investment strategist for U.S. equities.\u00a0 Because of Mr. Trump's pro-business bent, the market has surged since the election. Despite his administration's stumbles, the S&P 500 is up 5.5 percent since his swearing-in. According to Stovall, \"the market is on track to post the third-best 100-day return of any first-term president since WWII, and the second-best under a first-term Republican.\"\u00a0 That puts Mr. Trump behind only John F. Kennedy's 9 percent market increase in 1961 and George H.W. Bush's 7.7 percent in 1989. One of the worst showings was under Reagan in 1981, when the S&P 500 dipped 1.1 percent in the new president's initial 100 days, as doubt was rife he could deliver on his promises. \u00a0 Here's how Mr. Trump has fared economically during his first 100 days: Tax cuts. On Wednesday, the administration unveiled its\u00a0tax plan, which includes huge tax rate cuts for businesses, down to 15 percent from 35 percent for corporations; reduced individual rates; and elimination of the estate and the alternative minimum levies. Although the plan was but a framework, sparse on details, it demonstrated the president's desire to kick-start the slow-growing economy.\u00a0 With growth in GDP inching up at 2 percent or less annually for years (it went up a mere 1.6 percent in 2016), Mr. Trump has called for 5 percent expansions. That level, seldom seen since the late 1990s the tech boom, may be too ambitious, given sluggish U.S. productivity increases. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has suggested 3 percent as more realistic in the near term.\u00a0 Regardless, the administration faces a lot of obstacles. For one, the plan is highly likely to drive up budget deficits, and a strong cohort of fiscal-minded Republicans with a lot of influence in Congress is leery about that prospect. One of them is House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin), whose favorite antidote to lost revenue from tax reductions has been what's called a border adjustment tax. This taxes imports but not exports and is projected to raise $1.1 trillion over 10 years. But while the border tax would plug a hole left by the tax cuts, Mr. Trump is cool toward it.\u00a0 The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group, estimates that the Trump plan would cost the Treasury $3 trillion to $7 trillion over a decade. Right now, the national debt stands at $13.6 trillion, and groups like the CFRB fear that the debt load will increase so much it will crush the economy. Democrats also are massing to oppose a Trump tax cut, which they say favors the wealthy. \"Trump's latest proposal is another gift to corporations and billionaires like himself,\" said Thomas Perez, the Democratic National Committee chairman.\u00a0 Health care.\u00a0The president's inability to get through changes in his predecessor's signature health law was an early defeat that he's seeking to reverse. A new version was slated to go before the House this weekend, in hopes of getting underneath the 100-day wire, but the Republican leadership postponed the vote because they still hadn't mustered enough votes to pass the bill.\u00a0 Health care spending makes up almost a fifth of the economy, and medical costs have escalated relentlessly, although at a slower pace lately. With its aging population, the U.S. stands to devote even more resources to medical care in the future. So the stakes are large. The health law is a visceral issue for many Republicans, who say Obamacare has distorted the nation's health system and is unworkable. Before this year, when Barack Obama was president, the GOP-controlled House voted to overturn Obamacare more than 50 times. This winter, with Republicans in firm control of both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, party leaders in the House crafted a compromise bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, as Obamacare is known. But\u00a0they pulled the measure in March\u00a0in the face of certain defeat in the House. The Freedom Caucus, the party's most vehement conservative bloc, objected that it didn't go far enough to lower insurance costs and to dismantle federal regulation of insurance products. At the same time, moderate Republicans were concerned that it eliminated federal insurance standards and lowered subsidies for buying private insurance -- and also were leery about pushing people off the system. The Congressional Budget Office figured that the bill would leave 24 million more Americans without insurance by 2024.\u00a0 So Mr. Trump is pushing to resurrect the bill, and the latest iteration is designed to please the Freedom Caucus, which seems to be on board this time. For one thing, the measure would allow states to get waivers that would permit them not to cover so-called \"essential health benefits\" under Obamacare, such as maternity and mental health services. The question will be whether moderate Republicans can stomach this, and their qualms were what led to postponing a vote on the new version.\u00a0 Trade.\u00a0The president has considerably softened his tough stance against America's trading partners, particularly Mexico and China, which as a candidate last year he accused of cheating the U.S. and costing millions of Americans their jobs. During the campaign, Mr. Trump railed against the North American Free Trade Act, calling it \"the worst trade deal ever.\" But lately, he has backed off his threat to ditch NAFTA, an agreement struck in 1994 with Canada and Mexico. Instead, he has directed a federal study of abusive practices and has talked about renegotiating the pact. By the same token, Mr. Trump used to say he would declare China a currency manipulator on \"day one\" of his administration. He condemned Beijing for artificially powering its currency exchange rate to make its goods cheaper in the U.S., putting American manufacturers at a disadvantage.\u00a0 Since then, he has heeded others' counsel that China is actually trying to boost its currency, the yuan, to stem capital flight to other nations in search of better returns than at home. In a Twitter post, he has offered Chinese leader Xi Jinping a new trade deal that will be \"far better for them if they solve the North Korean problem.\" How much leverage Xi has over the rogue state on his border is hard to tell, so this is a work in progress. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump is readying possible retaliation against Canada involving its softwood lumber, which he believes is sold at below market value, giving Canadian wood producers a leg up in the U.S. market. After Washington studies the matter, it could hit those wood imports with a 20 percent tariff.\u00a0 Similarly, the president has inveighed against Canada for lowering the price of American milk. These moves by Mr. Trump could signal a strategy of tackling trade issues one by one, rather than via broad deals. Jobs.\u00a0Economic trends are in Mr. Trump's favor, although how much credit he should take for good news on the employment front is arguable. Job creation has been robust for quite some time: Under President Obama, the nation had\u00a075 straight months of job growth, a record stretch.\u00a0In March, job growth slowed\u00a0to 98,000, when economists expected to see 180,000 new positions added. The reason for the pullback has been ascribed to unusually harsh weather. The president can take heart that the unemployment rate is still low at 4.5 percent.\u00a0 Mr. Trump's focus is on manufacturing jobs, which have dwindled -- down 5 million since 1998. Although 882,000 of these jobs have come back since February 2010, as the nation crawled out of the Great Recession, the manufacturing employment picture remains grim. The president pins the blame on unfair foreign competition, although many economists say rising automation is at least an equal villain.\u00a0 One way for Mr. Trump to show progress is to highlight anecdotal victories where he has actually gained or saved jobs for specific Americans. He touts his jawboning efforts to convince several companies to keep factory jobs in the U.S. or expand them.\u00a0 And indeed, employers like Ford Motor (F) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) have pumped up their domestic headcounts after Mr. Trump buttonholed them. In January, Ford scrapped plans for a new plant in Mexico and said it would add 700 jobs in Michigan for hybrid and electric cars. The same month, aerospace company Lockheed said it would increase its workforce in Texas by 1,800.\u00a0 Critics, with some justice, have noted that these much-ballyhooed wins are a tiny fraction of the U.S. workforce, and no one can turn around broad trends with one-off efforts. During the campaign, Mr. Trump regaled the crowds with how much he would get done in his first 100 days. Those goals have proved far tougher to attain that he imagined. Say this for Mr. Trump, however: He isn't the type to give up.

            "article_content": "PANMUNJOM, South Korea\u00a0\u2014 A day after a failed North Korean missile test, U.S. President Donald Trump had a message Monday for the North\u2019s ruler: \u2018Gotta behave.\u201d At the same time, Vice President Mike Pence warned at the Korean Demilitarized Zone that America\u2019s \u201cera of strategic patience is over.\u201d Keeping up the verbal volleying, North Korea\u2019s deputy U.N. ambassador accused the United States of turning the Korean peninsula into \u201cthe world\u2019s biggest hotspot\u201d and creating \u201ca dangerous situation in which a thermonuclear war may break out at any moment.\u201d Pence\u2019s visit to the tense DMZ dividing North and South Korea came at the start of a 10-day trip to Asia and underscored U.S. commitment. It allowed the vice president to gaze at North Korean soldiers afar and stare directly across a border marked by razor wire. As the bomber jacket-clad vice president was briefed near the military demarcation line, two North Korean soldiers watched from a short distance away, one taking multiple photographs of the American visitor. Pence told reporters that Trump was hopeful China would use its \u201cextraordinary levers\u201d to pressure the North to abandon its weapons program, a day after the North\u2019s failed missile test launch. But Pence expressed impatience with the unwillingness of the North to move toward ridding itself of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. Pointing to the quarter-century since the United States first confronted North Korea over its attempts to build nuclear weapons, he said a period of patience had followed. \u201cBut the era of strategic patience is over,\u201d he declared. \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear that the patience of the United States and our allies in this region has run out and we want to see change. We want to see North Korea abandon its reckless path of the development of nuclear weapons, and also its continual use and testing of ballistic missiles is unacceptable.\u201d Trump himself appeared to reinforce the message at the White House, replying \u201cGotta behave\u201d when a CNN reporter asked what message he had for North Korean leader Kin Jong Un. In New York, the North\u2019s deputy U.N. ambassador, Kim In Ryong, said that U.S.-South Korean military exercises being staged now are the largest-ever \u201caggressive war drill.\u201d He said his country \u201cis ready to react to any mode of war desired by the U.S.\u201d In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, speaking to reporters Monday evening, said he hoped there would be \u201cno unilateral actions like those we saw recently in Syria and that the U.S. will follow the line that President Trump repeatedly voiced during the election campaign.\u201d Meanwhile, China made a plea for a return to negotiations. Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said tensions need to be eased on the Korean Peninsula to bring the escalating dispute there to a peaceful resolution. Lu said Beijing wants to resume the multi-party negotiations that ended in stalemate in 2009 and suggested that U.S. plans to deploy a missile defense system in South Korea were damaging its relations with China. Late Monday, Pence reiterated in a joint statement alongside South Korean Acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn that \u201call options are on the table\u201d and said any use of nuclear weapons by Pyongyang would be met with \u201can overwhelming and effective response.\u201d He said the American commitment to South Korea is \u201ciron-clad and immutable.\u201d Noting Trump\u2019s recent military actions in Syria and Afghanistan, Pence said, \u201cNorth Korea would do well not to test his resolve\u201d or the U.S. armed forces in the region. The vice president earlier visited a military installation near the DMZ, Camp Bonifas, for a briefing with military leaders at the joint U.S.-South Korean installation, which is just outside the 2.5-mile wide (4 kilometers) DMZ. Under rainfall, Pence later stood a few meters from the military demarcation line outside Freedom House, gazing at the North Korean soldiers across the border, and then peered at a deforested stretch of North Korea from a lookout post in the hillside. In Tokyo, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, speaking to a parliamentary session Monday, said: \u201cNeedless to say, diplomatic effort is important to maintain peace. But dialogue for the sake of having dialogue is meaningless.\u201d \u201cWe need to apply pressure on North Korea so they seriously respond to a dialogue\u201d with the international community, he said, urging China and Russia to play more constructive roles on the issue. Pence\u2019s visit came amid increasing tensions and heated rhetoric on the Korean Peninsula. While the North did not conduct a nuclear test, the specter of a potential test and an escalated U.S. response has trailed Pence as he undertakes his Asian tour. The Trump administration is hoping that China will help rein in North Korea in exchange for other considerations. Last week, Trump said he would not declare China a currency manipulator, pulling back from a campaign promise, as he looked for help from Beijing, which is the North\u2019s dominant trade partner.",

            "article_content": "SEOUL, South Korea -- Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Friday it may be necessary to take pre-emptive military action against North Korea if the threat from their weapons program reaches a level \u201cthat we believe requires action.\u201d Tillerson outlined a tougher strategy to confront North Korea\u2019s nuclear threat after visiting the world\u2019s most heavily armed border near the tense buffer zone between rivals North and South Korea. Asked about the possibility of using military force against the North, Tillerson told a news conference in the South Korean capital, \u201call of the options are on the table.\u201d As CBS News correspondent Adriana Diaz reported, Tillerson\u2019s trip is a mission to find a solution to the region\u2019s most pressing problem;\u00a0Kim Jong Un\u2019s increasingly aggressive -- and increasingly capable -- military regime. Tillerson said the U.S. does not want a military conflict, \u201cbut obviously if North Korea takes actions that threatens South Korean forces or our own forces, that would be met with (an) appropriate response. If they elevate the threat of their weapons program to a level that we believe requires action that option is on the table.\u201d But he said that by taking other steps, including sanctions, the U.S. is hopeful that North Korea could be persuaded to take a different course before it reaches that point. Hours after Tillerson spoke, President Trump tweeted that North Korea has been \u201cbehaving very badly.\u201d North Korea is behaving very badly. They have been \"playing\" the United States for years. China has done little to help! Past U.S. administrations have considered military force because North Korea\u2019s development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missile to deliver them, but rarely has that option been expressed so explicitly. North Korea has accelerated its weapons development, violating multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions and appearing undeterred by tough international sanctions. The North conducted two nuclear test explosions and 24 ballistic missile tests last year. Experts say it could have a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the U.S. within a few years. Tillerson is mid-way through a three-nation swing throgh Northeast Asia, which began in Japan and will end in China. State Department officials have described it as a \u201clistening tour\u201d as the administration seeks a coherent North Korea policy, well-coordinated with its Asian partners. Earlier Friday, Tillerson touched down by helicopter Friday at Camp Bonifas, U.S.-led U.N. base about 400 meters (438 yards) from the Demilitarized Zone, a Cold War vestige created after the Korean War ended in 1953. He then moved to the truce village of Panmunjom inside the DMZ, a cluster of blue huts where the Korean War armistice was signed. Tillerson is the latest in a parade of senior U.S. officials to have their photos taken at the border. But it\u2019s the first trip by the new Trump administration\u2019s senior diplomat. The DMZ, which is both a tourist trap and a potential flashpoint, is guarded on both sides with land mines, razor wire fence, tank traps and hundreds of thousands of combat-ready troops. More than a million mines are believed to be buried inside the DMZ. Land mine explosions in 2015 that Seoul blamed on Pyongyang maimed two South Korean soldiers and led the rivals to threaten each other with attacks. Hordes of tourists visit both sides, despite the lingering animosity. The Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty, which means the Korean Peninsula remains in a technical state of war. President Donald Trump is seen as seeking to examine all options - including military ones - for halting the North\u2019s weapons programs before Pyongyang becomes capable of developing a nuclear-tipped missile that could reach the U.S. mainland. Central to the U.S. review is China and its role in any bid to persuade Pyongyang to change course. China remains the North\u2019s most powerful ally. While the U.S. and its allies in Seoul and Tokyo implore Beijing to press its economic leverage over North Korea, the Chinese have emphasized their desire to relaunch diplomatic talks - a non-starter for the U.S. under current conditions. Speaking in Tokyo Thursday, Tillerson earlier vowed a tougher strategy to confront North Korea\u2019s nuclear threat. But he offered no details about what would comprise the\u00a0\u201cdifferent approach\u201d to North Korea the U.S. will pursue. He pointedly noted that 20 years of \u201cdiplomatic and other efforts\u201d had failed to dissuade the isolated communist government from developing its nuclear program, which he called an \u201cever-escalating threat.\u201d The U.S. and China also disagree over U.S. deployment of a missile defense system to South Korea. The U.S. says it\u2019s a system focused on North Korea. China sees it as a threat to its own security. Last week, North Korea launched four missiles into seas off Japan, in an apparent reaction to major annual military drills the U.S. is currently conducting with South Korea. Pyongyang claims the drills are a rehearsal for invasion. In Beijing, a North Korean diplomat said Thursday that Pyongyang must act in self-defense against the drills, which he said have brought the region to the brink of nuclear war. He said the drills are aimed at using atomic weapons for a pre-emptive strike against North Korea. Washington says the maneuvers are routine and defensive. During last year\u2019s election campaign, presidential candidate Trump called into question U.S. security alliances and called for Tokyo and Seoul to contribute more for their defense.

            "article_content": "LA CELLE SAINT-CLOUD, France -- Two rival Libyan leaders committed themselves on Tuesday to a cease-fire, working toward presidential and parliamentary elections and finding a roadmap to secure lawless Libya against terrorism and trafficking of all kinds, according to a document released by the French presidency. The meetings at a chateau in La Celle Saint-Cloud, west of Paris, brought together Fayez Serraj, prime minister of the U.N.-backed unity government, and Gen. Khalifa Hifter, the Egyptian-backed commander of Libya's self-styled national army. Macron met separately with each ahead of an encounter between the two Libyans in the presence of U.N.'s newly appointed special envoy for Libya, Ghassan Salame. \"There is political legitimacy is in the hands of Mr. Serraj. There is military legitimacy is in the hands of Mr. Hifter. They have decided to work together,\" Macron said. The 10-point joint declaration that capped the encounter was the first of its kind since Libya spiraled into chaos after the 2011 toppling and killing of leader Muammar Qaddafi. Among the points agreed upon was a commitment to a cease-fire with armed force reserved \"strictly\" for use in counter-terrorism operations. The rivals also \"solemnly commit to work towards the holding of presidential and parliamentary elections as soon as possible.\" The French president said later that the goal is for balloting in the spring. Serraj had said in May that elections would be held in spring. \"The stakes of this reconciliation are enormous. Enormous for the Libyan people, who have been suffering, living with instability and terrorist threats these past years, and it is considerable for the whole region,\" Macron said after the talks. He continued, \"Because if Libya fails, the whole region fails with it, especially directly neighboring countries. And it is process that is essential for all of Europe because if we don't succeed, the consequences affect our countries directly because of the terrorist risk and migration consequences.\" Macron's bid to work toward laying the groundwork for a state with a functioning government and institutions is a priority of his presidency. Talks were centered on creating a propitious climate for elections next year -- which the Libyan prime minister announced plans for in May -- security and military issues, respect for human rights and economic development of the oil-rich nation where residents struggle despite the resources, French officials said. Macron, Salame and Serraj, along with French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, walked into the chateau to begin the first set of talks after shaking hands before Republican Guards in their ornate gear. Hifter arrived later. The encounter was never expected to resolve the knotty problems of Libya, politically fractured and awash in militias and human traffickers preying on migrants who use the Libyan coast as a jumping off point to Europe, mainly Italy. But it was seen as a way to lay the basis for the U.N. envoy to come up with proposals in the weeks and months ahead. Serraj and Hifter met in early May in Abu Dhabi, and the United Arab Emirates said later there had been a \"significant breakthrough.\" Libya TV said the men agreed on holding presidential and parliamentary elections next year. Paris has made clear that the French initiative is not meant to brush aside numerous initiatives by others, including the European Union, the African Union and individual countries, like Morocco. France \"wants to facilitate a political entente\" and \"mark its support for efforts to build a political compromise, under the auspices of the United Nations,\" that includes all actors in the country, a statement Monday by the president's office said earlier. The challenge, it added, is to \"build a state capable of responding to the fundamental needs of Libyans\" with one regular army \"under the authority of civilian power,\" considered necessary for the control of borders and stability within Libya.",

            "article_content": "LONDON --\u00a0Britain's Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May gambled in calling a national election, thinking she could cruise to a big win.\u00a0 She appeared early Friday morning looking shaken, chastened and beaten -- odd for somebody whose party won more seats than any other, perhaps, but as CBS News' Mark Phillips reports, the way British politics works, her party's narrow victory amounted to an effective defeat: She lost her majority in Parliament. Pressure mounted on her to resign, but she refused -- at least for now. Instead,\u00a0 May visited Queen Elizabeth II and informed her that she would seek to form a coalition government with a much smaller party from Northern Ireland.\u00a0 The stunning result throws British politics into chaos and could send Britain's negotiations to leave the European Union -- due to start June 19 -- into disarray. The British pound lost more than 2 cents against the dollar in initial trading as results became clear. Without a majority in Parliament, May's authority is greatly eroded and her Conservative Party will struggle to push through its vision of a \"hard Brexit\"; one that would see Britain unbound from the key tenets of the EU which require, among other things, a free flow of goods and people across state borders. May's vision of Brexit calls for tariffs on EU goods imported into Britain. With 649 of 650 seats in the House of Commons declared, the Conservatives had 318 to the Labour Party's 261. Even if the Conservatives win the remaining seat, a London district, it is impossible for them to achieve the 326 seats needed for an outright majority. Before the election, the Conservatives had 330 seats and Labour 229. In spite of the dramatic losses for the Conservatives, they remained the party with the most votes, and May made it clear she was not abandoning her post. She said she would form a coalition government with the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland. Cutting a deal with the DUP could allow May to remain in the Prime Minister's office, albeit with a far weaker mandate. She insisted, in a statement announcing the effort to form a coaltion with the DUP, that Brexit negotiations would begin as scheduled on June 19 as previously expected. May vowed to form, \"a government that can provide certainty and lead Britain forward at this critical time for our country. This government will guide the country through the crucial Brexit talks that begin in just 10 days and to deliver on the will of the British people by taking the United Kingdom out of the European Union.\"\u00a0 Guenther Oettinger, a German member of the European Commission, said earlier Friday that the election result had left it unclear whether negotiations between the U.K. and Europe on Britain's exit from the union could begin that soon. The EU was hoping for a stable British government to help ensure smooth divorce negotiations ahead of Britain's mandated departure in March 2019.\u00a0 \"We need a government that can act,\" Oettinger told radio station Deutschlandfunk, according to the Reuters news agency. \"With a weak negotiating partner, there's the danger than the negotiations will turn out badly for both sides... I expect more uncertainty now.\"\u00a0 Echoing Oettinger's skepticism about negotiating with what could essentially be a lame-duck government in London, Michel Barnier, the EU official tasked with leading the Brexit negotiations, said Friday that the talks should only begin \"when the U.K. is ready.\" He added, however, that the overall two-year timetable for Brexit to be made official would not change, and that Europe's positions remained clear. As CBS News' Phillips reports, May called this snap election while riding a double-digit opinion poll lead. She built her campaign around her leadership, which she called -- over and over again in campaign appearances -- \"strong and stable.\"\u00a0 But in the weeks leading up to the debate, her opponents labelled her weak and wobbly. She refused to do TV debates, flip-flopped on key policy points, and failed to engage the public in meaningful discussion on the topics of greatest interest, continually falling back on her \"strong and stable\" mantra.\u00a0 In the end, any coalition government May manages to pull together could be so weak that another national election is called -- possibly even this year. \"This is a very bad moment for the Conservative Party, and we need to take stock,\" Conservative lawmaker Anna Soubry said. \"And our leader needs to take stock as well.\" The results confounded those who said Labour's left-wing leader, Jeremy Corbyn, was electorally toxic. Written off by many pollsters, Labour surged in the final weeks of the campaign. It drew strong support from young people, who appeared to have turned out to vote in bigger-than-expected numbers. The overall turnout was 68.7 percent -- the highest since 1997. Corbyn called for May to quit, saying, \"The Prime Minister called the election because she wanted a mandate. Well the mandate she's got is lost Conservative seats, lost votes, lost support and lost confidence. I would think that's enough, to go, actually, and make way for a government that will be truly representative of all of the people of this country.\" Speaking after being re-elected to his London seat, Corbyn said the election result means \"politics has changed\" and voters had rejected Conservative austerity. \u00a0 As she was resoundingly re-elected to her Maidenhead seat in southern England, May looked tense and did not spell out what she planned to do. \"The country needs a period of stability, and whatever the results are the Conservative Party will ensure we fulfil our duty in ensuring that stability,\" she said. Many predicted she would soon be gone. \"Clearly, if she's got a worse result than two years ago and is almost unable to form a government, then she, I doubt, will survive in the long term as Conservative Party leader,\" former Conservative Treasury chief George Osborne said on ITV. The result was bad news for the Scottish National Party, which lost about 20 of its 54 seats. Among the casualties was Alex Salmond, a former first minister of Scotland and one of the party's highest-profile lawmakers. The losses complicate the SNP's plans to push for a new referendum on Scottish independence as Britain prepares to leave the EU. Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the idea of a new independence referendum \"is dead. That's what we have seen tonight.\" May had hoped the election would focus on Brexit, but that never happened, as both the Conservatives and Labour said they would respect voters' wishes and go through with the divorce. May, who went into the election with a reputation for quiet competence, was criticized for a lackluster campaigning style and for a plan to force elderly people to pay more for their care, a proposal her opponents dubbed the \"dementia tax.\" As the polls suggested a tightening race, pollsters spoke less often of a landslide and raised the possibility that May's majority would be eroded. Then, attacks that killed 30 people in Manchester and London twice brought the campaign to a halt, sent a wave of anxiety through Britain and forced May to defend the government's record on fighting terrorism. Corbyn accused the Conservatives of undermining Britain's security by cutting the number of police on the streets. Eight people were killed near London Bridge on Saturday when three men drove a van into pedestrians and then stabbed revelers in an area filled with bars and restaurants. Two weeks earlier, a suicide bomber killed 22 people as they were leaving an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester. Rachel Sheard, who cast her vote near the site of the London Bridge attack, said the election certainly wasn't about Brexit. \"I don't think that's in the hearts and minds of Londoners at the minute, (not) nearly as much as security is,\" said Sheard, 22. \"It was very scary on Saturday.\" Steven Fielding, a professor of politics at the University of Nottingham, said Britain had seen an election \"in which the personal authority of a party leader has disappeared in an unprecedented way.\" \"If she had got the majority she wanted, she would have been a supreme political colossus,\" he said. \"She did not get that and she's a hugely diminished figure. She's a zombie prime minister.\"",

I also had the beer and my laptop. He had the television on, with the second season of Ballers lined up. Our son had hooked us on it the year before, and we\u2019d been saving the shows until tonight -- Election Night. It was November 8, 2016. The polls were about to close in Massachusetts, and we were about to start our Election Night ritual: clicking back and forth between news reports and binge-watching something really fun on television. I had my laptop so I could check on the local races, and my phone so, assuming the night went well, I could make some congratulatory calls. Yeah, until I won my Senate race in 2012 I\u2019d have guessed that a senator would watch election returns like a pro: a big group of people in a war room somewhere, multiple television screens on the walls, phones ringing, people rushing in with last-minute information. Lots of coffee cups and pizza boxes strewn over desks. Someone making pithy remarks about what it means that with 2 percent of Illinois reporting, Duckworth has a four-point lead, and turnout in the Seventh Precinct is high, and so on. In fact, I think I\u2019ve seen that scene in the movies. But not Bruce and me, not tonight. I wasn\u2019t on the ballot this year, so I wouldn\u2019t be huddling with a campaign team. Besides, by this point, there wasn\u2019t anything else I could do to affect the election\u2019s outcome. And with so much on the line, I knew that watching the numbers drift in over the next few hours would be agony. For so many of these races, I\u2019d been out there with the candidates -- cheered them on, given speeches standing next to them, frozen and sweated and stepped in muck right along with them. Hillary Clinton\u2019s race, of course, was the night\u2019s biggest, but I would be chewing my fingernails watching the Senate races as well. There was Catherine Cortez Masto, a former attorney general in Nevada whom I\u2019d worked with while fighting the banks during the housing crisis eight years ago. Katie McGinty, a former environmental policy official in Pennsylvania who was trying to unseat a Republican who seemed to be funded by an endless supply of Wall Street money. Russ Feingold, the former senator from Wisconsin who had been in the trenches with me as we\u2019d fought to save families from predatory lenders fifteen years earlier and was making a strong push to get his old seat back. Maggie Hassan, the governor from just across the border in New Hampshire, where I had gone time after time to help out. Jason Kander, a progressive Democrat in Missouri who was running uphill hard. Tammy Duckworth, a vet in Illinois who had lost both legs in Iraq and, no surprise, turned out to be a fierce campaigner. Kamala Harris, the California AG I\u2019d gone into battle with shoulder to shoulder many times. And so many more. For months, these candidates had put it all on the line. Faces, names, stories -- they all crowded in that night, and I was anxious and hopeful and fearful for every one of them. No, I didn\u2019t want to watch the numbers trickle in with a big group. I just wanted to be at home with Bruce. That night we did what we always did -- toggled back and forth between a television show and the election results. Sitting on the couch eating popcorn, drinking beer, and hoping for the best. Ballers was terrific. The 2016 election, not so much. The first sign of trouble was how quickly several Senate races were called for Republicans. Indiana. Florida. Suddenly candidates we thought would win were struggling -- Russ in Wisconsin and Katie in Pennsylvania. And then it looked like Hillary was in trouble, too. It was like watching a train wreck in slow motion. One car hurtled off the tracks, then another crumpled, then fires and explosions and bodies flying everywhere. As I watched the White House slip away and the Democratic losses mount, I knew that a lot of people would spend weeks analyzing what had gone wrong, how this moment had come to pass. There would be lots of pundits. (\u201cI always knew ...\u201d) Lots of partisans. (\u201cOf course this loss happened because they ...\u201d) Lots of political types certain that they could have done it all much, much better. Sure, there would be endless autopsies of the 2016 campaigns, but as that long night wore on, I found myself thinking less about the political winds and more about how the fallout from this election would deliver one more body blow to so many working families. The television showed crowds of candidates and supporters celebrating or grieving, but what haunted me was the thought that for tens of millions of Americans, life was about to get a whole lot tougher. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Long before I ever came within a hundred miles of politics, I had been a teacher and a researcher. I had spent years tracking what was happening to America\u2019s middle class, what was happening to working families and families that wanted to be working families. It was a great and terrible story. The tale of America coming out of the Great Depression and not only surviving but actually transforming itself into an economic giant is the stuff of legend. But the part that gives me goose bumps is what we did with all that wealth: over several generations, our country built the greatest middle class the world had ever known. We built it ourselves, using our own hard work and the tools of government to open up more opportunities for millions of people. We used it all -- tax policy, investments in public education, new infrastructure, support for research, rules that protected consumers and investors, antitrust laws -- to promote and expand our middle class. The spectacular, shoot-off-the-fireworks fact is that we succeeded. Income growth was widespread, and the people who did most of the work -- the 90 percent of America -- also got most of the gains. In the 1960s and 1970s, I was one of the lucky beneficiaries of everything America was building, and to this day, I am grateful to the bottom of my soul. But now, in a new century and a different time, that great middle class is on the ropes. All across the country, people are worried -- worried and angry. They are angry because they bust their tails and their income barely budges. Angry because their budget is stretched to the breaking point by housing and health care. Angry because the cost of sending their kid to day care or college is out of sight. People are angry because trade deals seem to be building jobs and opportunities for workers in other parts of the world, while leaving abandoned factories here at home. Angry because young people are getting destroyed by student loans, working people are deep in debt, and seniors can\u2019t make their Social Security checks cover their basic living expenses. Angry because we can\u2019t even count on the fundamentals -- roads, bridges, safe water, reliable power -- from our government. Angry because we\u2019re afraid that our children\u2019s chances for a better life won\u2019t be as good as our own. People are angry, and they are right to be angry. Because this hard-won, ruggedly built, infinitely precious democracy of ours has been hijacked. Today this country works great for those at the top. It works great for every corporation rich enough to hire an army of lobbyists and lawyers. It works great for every billionaire who pays taxes at lower rates than the hired help. It works great for everyone with the money to buy favors in Washington. Government works great for them, but for everyone else, this country is no longer working very well. This is the most dangerous kind of corruption. No, it\u2019s not old-school bribery with envelopes full of cash. This much smoother, slicker, and better-dressed form of corruption is perverting our government and making sure that day after day, decision after decision, the rich and powerful are always taken care of. This corruption is turning government into a tool of those who have already gathered wealth and influence. This corruption is hollowing out America\u2019s middle class and tearing down our democracy. In 2016, into this tangle of worry and anger, came a showman who made big promises. A man who swore he would drain the swamp, then surrounded himself with the lobbyists and billionaires who run the swamp and feed off government favors. A man who talked the talk of populism but offered the very worst of trickle-down economics. A man who said he knew how the corrupt system worked because he had worked it for himself many times. A man who vowed to make America great again and followed up with attacks on immigrants, minorities, and women. A man who was always on the hunt for his next big con. In the months ahead, it would become clear that this man was even more divisive and dishonest than his presidential campaign revealed. But on election night, I stared at the television as it sank in that this man was about to become the next President of the United States. The election results kept rolling in, and I knew that plenty of people would be eager to describe the special appeal of Donald Trump and explain all the reasons why he won. But we need more than an explanation of just one election; we also need to understand how and why our country has gone so thoroughly wrong. We need a plan to put us back on track -- and then we need to get to work and make it happen. We need to live our values, to be the kind of nation that invests in opportunity, not just for some of us, but for all of us. We need to take our democracy back from those who would pervert it for their own benefit. We need to build the America of our best dreams. Sitting on the couch with Bruce, I watched Donald Trump say that his presidency would be \u201ca beautiful thing.\u201d No, I thought, it won\u2019t be anything like beautiful. Worse, the man who would soon move into the White House had the capacity to bear down on a middle class that was already on the ropes and deliver the knockout punch. If ever there was a time to fight, this was it. Excerpt from \u201cThis Fight Is Our Fight\u201d by Elizabeth Warren. Copyright \u00a9 2017 by Elizabeth Warren.

            "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump held a free-wheeling, hour-long\u00a0press conference\u00a0at Trump Tower Wednesday morning -- the first formal news conference he\u2019s held since winning the presidency in November. The motivation for the news conference, which was initially scheduled for December but delayed by almost a month, was to outline how he will deal with his complex web of business interests once he\u2019s in the White House, Since his election, Mr. Trump has faced serious questions about who will handle his businesses while he\u2019s in the White House -- and how to avoid the myriad conflicts of interest that could arise when a sitting president owns a business empire.\u00a0 However, much of the press conference ended up focusing on Russian election interference and on reports Tuesday that the\u00a0intelligence community\u2019s classified report on Russian hacking had an addendum\u00a0with unverified details of potentially compromising information that Russia has gathered on the president-elect, and that Mr. Trump was briefed on last week. 12:19 a.m. ET Approximately an hour after the press conference started, Mr. Trump and his family have left the room.\u00a0 12:17 p.m. ET Mr. Trump ignored a question about whether any members of his campaign had had contact with Russian officials during the election season and turned again to the stacks of manila folders next to him. \u201cThese papers are all just a piece of the many, many companies that are being put into a trust to be run by my two sons,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump continued that he hopes he will come back \u201cat the end of eight years\u201d to a company that has been well run, but that if not he will tell his sons \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d 12:16 p.m. ET What is Mr. Trump\u2019s message to Russian President Vladimir Putin on the election-related hacking? \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be doing it, he won\u2019t be doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cRussia will have much greater respect for our country when I\u2019m leading it than when other people have led it. You will see that.\u201d Mr. Trump repeated that \u201cit\u2019s not just Russia\u201d that has been hacking U.S. entities. 12:12 p.m. ET Asked again about the stories on Russia\u2019s compromising information on him, Mr. Trump said the release of those reports is \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do,\u201d he said, referencing his tweet Wednesday morning. Mr. Trump called BuzzFeed, which posted the intelligence memo about Russian information, \u201ca failing pile of garbage,\u201d and also criticized CNN for publicizing the reports on Tuesday. A CNN reporter in the audience attempted to ask a follow-up question, but Mr. Trump repeatedly shut him down.\u00a0 \u201cNo, not you, your organization is terrible. Quiet. Quiet,\u201d he said. As the reporter continued trying to ask a question, talking over another reporter, Mr. Trump continued: \u201cDon\u2019t be rude. Don\u2019t be rude. Don\u2019t. Be. Rude. I\u2019m not going to give you a question. You are fake news.\u201d 12:04 p.m. ET\u00a0On a question about his proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, Mr. Trump said Mexico will \u201creimburse\u201d the U.S. for the wall because he doesn\u2019t want to wait to build it until a deal can be made with Mexico. \u201cI want to get the wall started,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wait a year and a half until I make my deal with Mexico.\u201d As for the form that reimbursement will take, Mr. Trump said it\u2019s more likely it will be through a \u201ctax\u201d than a \u201cpayment.\u201d \u201cThey will reimburse us for the cost of the wall, whether it\u2019s a tax or whether it\u2019s a payment,\u201d he said. \u201cProbably less likely that it\u2019s a payment.\u201d 12:00 p.m. ET\u00a0Asked to discuss his administration\u2019s plan for dealing with the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Trump declined to give any specifics but said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to get health care taken care of in this country.\u201d \u201cObamacare is a complete and total disaster,\u201d he said, citing increased premiums and high deductibles. \u201c...Frankly, we could sit back -- and it was a thought from a political standpoint -- but it wouldn\u2019t be fair to the people.\u201d 11:58 a.m. ET\u00a0Dillon said that in order to ensure that \u201cit is the American people who will profit\u201d going forward, Mr. Trump has directed that all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotels will be donated to the U.S. Treasury.\u201d 11:54 a.m. ET\u00a0Additionally, Dillon said, a position will be created at the Trump Organization for a \u201cchief compliance counsel,\u201d who will help ensure there are no conflicts of interest. To people who suggest Mr. Trump should sell his business, Dillon said that would only \u201cexacerbate\u201d the possibility for conflicts. 11:49 a.m. ET Mr. Trump turned the podium over to Sherri Dillon of Morgan Lewis, a lawyer who has been working on the plan for the Trump business empire. Dillon said Mr. Trump\u2019s business holdings and investments will be put in a trust before Inauguration Day, and that his two adult sons will run the company. Ivanka Trump, whose husband Jared Kushner is set to become a senior adviser to the Trump White House, will have \u201cno further management\u201d role in the company. She also said there will be \u201cno new foreign deals\u201d made during the duration of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, and that domestic deals will be subject to \u201csevere restrictions.\u201d 11:43 a.m. ET\u00a0Mr. Trump said his two sons, Eric and Donald Jr., Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg, will run the Trump Organization while he\u2019s in office, and said the manila folders on the table next to him were \u201csome of the many documents I\u2019ve signed turning over complete and total control.\u201d Still, Mr. Trump asserted that he would have been able to continue running his business from the White House if he wanted to. \u201cI could actually run my business ... and run government at the same time,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like the way that looks but I\u2019d be able to if I wanted to.\u201d 11:40 a.m. ET\u00a0Asked to confirm that some of the allegations that Russia has compromising information about his controversial activities while in Russia are false, Mr. Trump replied: \u201cDoes anyone really believe that story? I\u2019m also very much of a germaphobe, by the way, believe me.\u201d He also reaffirmed what he posted on Twitter Wednesday morning, stating that he has no conflicts of interest with Russia. \u201cI tweeted out that I have no dealings with Russia, I have no deals in Russia, I have no deals that could happen with Russia because we\u2019ve stayed away, and I have no loans,\u201d he said. 11:37 a.m. ET What will Mr. Trump\u2019s stance be toward Vladimir Putin once he takes office? Mr. Trump said he considers Putin\u2019s praise of him to be an \u201casset,\u201d but said he doesn\u2019t yet know that he\u2019ll \u201cget along\u201d with Putin. \u201cIf Putin likes Donald Trump I consider that an asset not a liability because we have a horrible relationship with Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m going to get along with Vladimir Putin,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope I do, but \u2026 do you honestly believe that Hillary [Clinton] will be tougher on Putin than me?\u201d 11:33 a.m. ET\u00a0Asked whether he accepts the intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusion that Russia actively worked to influence the 2016 election, Mr. Trump said he believes Russia was responsible for the hacking -- but stopped short of saying he believed they had an influence on the campaign and its outcome. \u201cAs far as hacking, I think it was Russian,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people and I can say that when we lost 22 million names and everything else that was hacked recently, they didn\u2019t make a big deal out of that, that was something that was extraordinary.\u201d He also blamed Democratic National Committee for getting hacked, saying the committee \u201cwas totally open to be hacked, they did a very poor job.\u201d 11:29 a.m. ET Mr. Trump\u2019s first question was about Russia -- both on the spate of stories yesterday about potentially compromising information as well as the intelligence briefing on Russian hacking he received on Friday. Mr. Trump said he\u2019s not allowed to discuss information that was presented during his intelligence briefing -- but confirmed he did in fact see the memo in question on compromising information, calling it a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d \u201cI saw the information, I read the information outside of that meeting it\u2019s all fake news, it\u2019s phony stuff, it didn\u2019t happen and it was gotten by opponents of ours,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a group of opponents who got together, sick people, and they put that crap together.\u201d 11:23 a.m. ET Next, Mr. Trump took the podium, beginning by saying he used to give press conferences on an \u201calmost daily basis\u201d during the campaign. (This is not true -- he did give press conferences during the campaign, but not nearly that frequently.) He thanked news organizations that did not run stories on Russia\u2019s alleged compromising information about him. \u201cI want to thank a lot of the news organizations, some of whom have not treated me well over the years, a couple in particular, and they came out so strongly against that fake news,\u201d he said. \u201cI have great respect for the news, I have great respect for freedom of the press and all of that, but I will tell you there were some news organizations \u2026 that were so professional, so incredibly professional.\u201d He also intimated that the stories may have come from intelligence agency leaks -- and said it would be \u201ca tremendous blot on their record if they did that.\u201d 11:20 a.m. ET\u00a0Vice President-elect Mike Pence also briefly spoke about the Russia stories, decrying \u201cthe irresponsible decision of a few news organizations to run with a false and unsubstantiated report.\u201d 11:16 a.m. ET\u00a0Incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer took the podium first, calling the stories about unverified reports saying Russia has compromising information about Mr. Trump \u201chighly salacious\u201d and \u201cflat-out false.\u201d He denied that three individuals associated with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign were ever in touch with Russian officials. \u201cFor all the take lately about fake news this political witch-hunt by some in the media is based on some of the most flimsy reporting,\u201d he said. 11:13 a.m. ET President-elect Donald Trump has entered the room. 11:04 a.m. ET\u00a0At around 11 a.m., when the presser was expected to start, staffers began bringing out stacks of manila folders and putting them on a table next to the podium at Trump Tower. It\u2019s unclear what the contents of the folders might be. 10:30 a.m. ET\u00a0Wednesday\u2019s presser, expected at 11 a.m. ET, comes just nine days before Mr. Trump is inaugurated. This is not the first time Mr. Trump has scheduled a press conference to address the future of his business empire. A press conference was previously scheduled for Dec. 15, almost a month before this new date, but Mr. Trump\u00a0canceled that press conference\u00a0three days beforehand, saying his team needed more time to sort out the details. Before Wednesday, Mr. Trump has taken a handful of questions from reporters at gaggles but has\u00a0not held full news conferences. It will be his first full news conference since July 27.

            "article_content": "BARCELONA, Spain -- Spain announced an unprecedented plan Saturday to sack Catalonia's separatist leaders, install its own people in their place and call a new local election, using previously untapped constitutional powers to take control of the prosperous region that is threatening to secede. Catalonia's president responded by making a veiled independence threat, telling lawmakers to come up with a plan to counter Spain's \"attempt to wipe out self-government.\" Even moderate Catalans were aghast at the scope of the move, greeting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's announcement with banging pots and honking cars in the streets of Barcelona, the regional capital. In a televised address late Saturday, Catalan President Carles Puigdemont called Rajoy's plans to replace him and his cabinet an \"attempt to humiliate\" Catalonia and an \"attack on democracy.\" He called on the regional parliament to \"debate and decide on the attempt to wipe out our self-government and our democracy, and act accordingly.\" Puigdemont called Rajoy's move the \"the worst attack\" on Catalan people and institutions since Gen. Francisco Franco's abolishment of Catalonia's regional government in 1939. Barcelona mayor Ada Colau, who opposes independence without a valid referendum, called Rajoy's measures \"a serious attack\" on self-government in Catalonia. Others went further. Catalan parliament speaker Carme Forcadell accused Spain's central authorities of carrying out a coup. \"Mariano Rajoy has announced a de facto coup d'etat with the goal of ousting a democratically elected government,\" Forcadell said, calling it \"an authoritarian blow within a member of the European Union.\" After a special Cabinet session to derail Catalonia's independence movement, Rajoy said he wants the country's Senate to allow central ministers to take over the jobs of all senior members of the Catalan government, including control over the regional police, finances and the public media. Rajoy is also seeking the Senate's approval to assume the power to call a regional election - something that only Catalonia's top leader can do now. The vice president of the Senate says a session next Friday will vote on the measures. Conservative senator Pedro Sanz told reporters a special commission of 27 senators will make a first assessment of the measures Tuesday. He said Puigdemont can appeal the moves by appearing before the commission before noon Thursday or by sending an envoy. Rajoy's ruling Popular Party has an absolute majority in the chamber and is expected to receive wide support from opposition senators for measures to protect Spanish unity. In response, protesters wrapped in red-and-yellow Catalan flags flooded the streets of central Barcelona on Saturday, holding up signs calling for freedom. About 450,000 people joined the protest, according to police, although an anti-secession group put the number at 85,000. The demonstration had originally been called to protest the detention of two pro-independence activists who are awaiting possible sedition charges, but it turned into an outcry over Rajoy's takeover move. \"We are here because the Spanish government made a coup without weapons against the Catalan people and their government institutions,\" said Joan Portet, a 58-year-old protester. Rajoy said he is using Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution in order to \"restore normalcy\" in the country, which faces its most grave institutional crisis in decades with Catalonia's independence movement. He said a new regional election in Catalonia should be held in the next six months. \"There is no country in the world ready to allow this kind of situation within its borders,\" Rajoy said. \"It is my wish to call an election as soon as normality is restored.\" Article 155 allows central authorities to intervene when one of Spain's 17 autonomous regions fails to comply with the law. It's never been applied since the 1978 Constitution was adopted. The slow-burning constitutional crisis over secession escalated this month when regional government officials held a disputed independence referendum on Oct. 1. They then declared that the result -- strongly in favor of independence -- gave them a legal basis for separating from Spain even though the vote itself had numerous problems. The country's Constitutional Court has so far ruled against all moves toward secession, including the Catalan referendum. Albert Rivera, head of the pro-business Citizens party, said he backed Rajoy's measures because Catalonia needs to restore legal security so companies can remain in the region. Hundreds of companies have transferred their registered headquarters out of Catalonia to other areas in Spain, fearing the chaos that independence - or the fight over it - could bring. Basque nationalists and the far-left Podemos party were among those in Madrid opposing the government's move. \"We are in shock about the suspension of democracy in Catalonia,\" said Podemo's Pablo Echenique, vowing to work to oust Rajoy and his conservative Popular Party. Barcelona resident Rosa Isart said the Spanish government's determination to prevent Catalonia from leaving reminded her of Franco's dictatorship decades ago. \"It seems unbelievable that I have to see this again, because of the incompetence of these politicians who don't know how to speak to each other,\" Isart said. Others were sympathetic to Rajoy's plan. Barcelona resident Carlos Assensio agreed with Madrid, given the separatists' refusal to abide by Spain's laws.\t\"If we don't respect the law, this could be a total anarchy,\" said the 65-year-old.",

            "article_content": "MONTGOMERY, Alabama -- Donald Trump Jr. on Thursday stood by his father's declarations that \"both sides\" were to blame after August's racially driven violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a white supremacist killed a counter-protester. President Trump's eldest son said his father was criticized only because of an \"atmosphere of hatred\" on the left that the younger Trump blamed on liberal university campuses and traditional media. \"He condemned ... the white nationalists and the left-wingers,\" Trump Jr. said during the annual fundraising gala for Faulkner University, a private Christian university in Alabama. \"That should not have been controversial, but it was.\" Trump Jr., who was paid as Faulkner's keynote speaker, went on to cite examples of violence on the left. He mentioned antifa, far-left-leaning militant groups that call themselves anti-fascist, for outbursts in Berkeley, California. He alluded to the former Bernie Sanders supporter who shot at Republican congressmen gathering for baseball practice, nearly killing Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana. \"He went out looking for Republicans to kill,\" Trump Jr. said, \"and we're supposed to forget that.\" Trump Jr. did not go into detail about the Charlottesville melee, never mentioning the woman who was killed when a white nationalist drove a car into a crowd of counter-protesters. Besides defending his father, Trump Jr. used much of his 35-minute address to mock the culture on most of the nation's college campuses, which he said teaches young Americans to \"hate their country\" and \"hate their religion\" while squelching conservative voices. He noted instances where conservatives have been denied speaking opportunities or encountered protests upon their appearances. \"Today's conservative speech is violence. Unprovoked liberal violence is self-defense,\" Trump Jr. complained. \"Words have lost their meanings.\" He continued: \"'Hate speech' is that America is a good country ... that we need borders ... anything that comes out of the mouth of the president ... the moral teaching of the Bible.\" He also mocked some universities' focus on diversity, singling out the concept of \"safe spaces\" for women, minorities and LGBT students. He went on to praise two Alabama figures who played defining roles in the civil rights movement: Martin Luther King Jr. and federal jurist Frank Johnson, who enforced many of the Supreme Court's civil rights decisions. Neither Trump Jr. nor his hosts at Faulkner mentioned his place at the center of ongoing FBI and congressional inquiries into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Trump Jr. moved to the fore of the Russia investigation in July amid revelations about a June 2016 meeting he helped arrange with a Russian attorney tied to the Kremlin. Senate Intelligence Committee leaders from both parties this week declared that the issue of Russian meddling has not been settled, despite the president's claims of a \"hoax\" and \"fake news.\" The committee staff has yet to interview Trump Jr., who has admitted he took the meeting with the Russian attorney expecting to get damaging information about his father's general election opponent, Hillary Clinton. Trump Jr. made no mention of Alabama's looming Senate election for the seat previously held by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The president endorsed Sessions' appointed successor, Luther Strange, but GOP voters sided with former Judge Roy Moore, who faces Democrat Doug Jones in a Dec. 12 general election. The address was part of Trump Jr.'s periodic paid speaking schedule that began before his father's election. A Faulkner spokeswoman confirmed the school paid Trump Jr. but declined to disclose his fee. The North Texas Daily, the student newspaper at the University of North Texas, has reported Trump Jr. will be paid $100,000 to speak at a university fundraising event Oct. 24. An archived web page of Trump Jr.'s agency, All American Speakers, shows his speaking fee as \"$50,001 and above.\" NBC News has reported the page was removed from the agency's website after NBC inquiries.",

Luther Strange ahead of Tuesday's Alabama primary election with a new robocall urging voters to turn out for the Republican incumbent. \"Hi, this is President Donald Trump, and I love the people of Alabama and I hope you go out and vote for Luther Strange for Senate. It is so important that you do,\" said Mr. Trump in the call recording, which was also released on Strange's YouTube page.\u00a0 The president goes on to tout his own administration's achievements in the recording, saying \"We've fulfilled so many of our promises everything we've wanted to do we're doing.\" \"Unemployment is at a record low, jobs are flowing back into the country, we have a great Supreme Court Judge in Justice Gorsuch, we are doing things a lot of people said were impossible, but I need Luther to help us out,\" he adds. Mr. Trump ended the recording by telling supporters that Strange is \"helping\" him in the Senate and is \"going to get the tax cuts for us.\" This isn't the first time Mr. Trump has lent his support in the form of a phone call -- ahead of Montana's special House election, Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence recorded calls on behalf of then-candidate Greg Gianforte, in which the two urged voters to step out for the Republican to stop \"liberal Democrats decimating and dismantling all that we've done.\"\u00a0 Mr. Trump previously endorsed Strange in a series of tweets, saying \"Senator Luther Strange has done a great job representing the people of the Great State of Alabama. He has my complete and total endorsement!\" and later tweeting that Strange is strong on border policies, military, tax cuts and law enforcement.\u00a0 Senator Luther Strange has done a great job representing the people of the Great State of Alabama.

            "article_content": "A transcript obtained by the Washington Post\u00a0offered new insight into a January phone call between Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and President Trump soon after inauguration. Beyond the president's requests that Pe\u00f1a Nieto stop publicly refusing to have Mexico pay for Mr. Trump's \"big, beautiful wall,\" the transcript also contains some inaccurate statements.  Here's a look at a few of those president's statements: What Trump said:  \"In the latest election, I won with a large percentage of Hispanic voters. I do not know if you heard, but with Cuba, I had 84 percent, with the Cuban-American vote. But overall generally, I had well over 30 percent and everyone was shocked to see this. I understand the community and they understand me, and I have a great respect for the Mexican people.\"  The verdict on this claim? False  While Mr. Trump did perform somewhat well among Hispanic voters, compared to Republican nominees Mitt Romney in 2012 and Sen. John McCain in 2008, his reach wasn't \"well over 30 percent.\" While Clinton ended up clinching the Latino vote,\u00a0CBS News' exit polling found that Mr. Trump secured 29 percent of the vote in 2016. CBS News' Anthony Salvanto later found that Hispanic turnout surged because there are more new Hispanic voters participating in the election process.\u00a0  President Trump:\u00a0\"We lost a lot of factories in Ohio and Michigan and I won these states \u2013 some of these states have not been won in 38 years by a Republican and I won them very easily.\"  The verdict on this claim? Somewhat true, somewhat false  Mr. Trump did in fact win in Ohio with 51.7 percent, with the help of white male voters (68 percent). His margin in Michigan was razor-thin -- just 0.2 percentage points -- winning 47.5 percent compared to Clinton's 47.3 percent. What Trump said:  \"This is what I have been saying for a year and a half on the campaign trail. I have been telling this to every group of 50,000 people or 25,000 people \u2013 because no one got people in their rallies as big as I did.\"  The verdict on this claim? Mostly false  Crowd size has been a data point Mr. Trump often brings up. While Mr. Trump's rallies over the course of the campaign were well-attended, but the largest turnout, The Post notes, would have been his Mobile, Alabama rally, attended by an estimated 30,000 supporters. This is comparable to former Democratic candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who also saw some high rally turnout. One in Portland attracted around 28,000 people, and another in Los Angeles garnered 27,500 supporters. What Trump said:  \"They are sending drugs to Chicago, Los Angeles, and to New York. Up in New Hampshire \u2013 I won New Hampshire because New Hampshire is a drug-infested den -- is coming from the southern border. So we have a lot of problems with Mexico farther than the economic problem.\" The verdict on this claim? Somewhat true, somewhat false  Mr. Trump did in fact win the New Hampshire Republican Primary, with his closest rivals trailing nearly 20 points behind him, but it was Hillary Clinton who clinched the state in the presidential election. While close, it was Clinton who edged out ahead with 46.8 percent of the overall vote. When it comes to Mr. Trump's claims of the state being a \"drug-infested den\" due to the impact of the country's opioid ongoing crisis, Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan called his comments about New Hampshire \"disgusting.\"  .@realDonaldTrump's comments about New Hampshire are disgusting.

            "article_content": "Alabama's Senate candidates are making final campaign pushes before tomorrow's special election. Republican Roy Moore gave a rare sit-down interview over the weekend. Democrat Doug Jones rallied his supporters, campaigning with New Jersey Senator Cory Booker. The politically deep-red state has not sent a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 25 years. President Trump is endorsing Moore, who has repeatedly denied allegations of sexual misconduct. Whoever is elected to the Senate will significantly affect the president's legislative agenda in the new year. While Moore holds a slight edge over Jones in recent polls, some analyses are calling this race too close to call in what has become an unlikely battleground state. With just 24 hours to Election Day, these campaigns are focused on one thing: turnout.\u00a0 Congressman Cedric Richmond, a Democrat from Louisiana, stirred up volunteers working to get out the vote. \"When you think you can't knock another door, just knock one more door,\" he said. With just hours until voters head to the polls in Alabama, volunteers for Democrat Doug Jones are scrambling to rally support. Volunteer Monica Whatley told CBS News' Manuel Bojorquez, \"I think there are a lot of Republicans that don't know what to do.\" President Trump has stepped up his support for Roy Moore, holding a rally in Pensacola, Florida, just miles from the Alabama border; and recording a robocall urging voters to choose the GOP candidate. \"Roy is a conservative who will help me steer this country back on track,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If Alabama elects liberal Democrat Doug Jones, all of our progress will be stopped cold.\" Alabama's senior senator, Republican Richard Shelby, says he wrote in another Republican when he cast his ballot early. \"I couldn't vote for Roy Moore,\" Shelby said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"The state of Alabama deserves better.\" At least nine women have made allegations of sexual misconduct against Moore, including claims he tried dating them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. In a local TV interview on Sunday, Moore once again dismissed the allegations. \"I do not know them,\" he aid. \"I had no encounter with them. I never molested anyone.\" Conservative Alabama voters speaking to Republican pollster Frank Luntz seemed unconvinced by the accusations. Several members of his focus group expressed their belief that Moore's accusers were being paid.  One participant, Scottie Porter, said, \"Forty years ago in Alabama, there's a lot of mommas and daddies that'd be thrilled that their 14-year-old was getting hit on by a district attorney.\" While Jones has held more than half a dozen public campaign events across the state over the past week, Moore hasn't appeared on the campaign trail since last Tuesday. The Republican candidate is scheduled to a hold a rally this evening, where he will again be joined by President Trump's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon.",

            "article_content": "One of the first lessons I learned as a young GOP political flack was this: Nothing is good or bad, except by comparison. Democrats hoping to beat Judge Roy Moore and pick up that Alabama senate seat are likely to re-learn that lesson one week from today.  The hard way.  On paper, Judge Roy Moore's campaign is a fiasco. He's been credibly accused of sexual misconduct with minors. Multiple accusers have laid out a pattern of sexual pressure on women over whom the former District Attorney had power. And his campaign has taken the unusual step of aggressively calling the alleged victims liars, political plotters, or both. \"Don't attack women who are possible victims of sexual assault\" is one of those other things I learned as a campaign consultant. Add the daily media savaging of Moore's candidacy and the current conversation about sexual harassment and Democrats should be on the verge of victory, right? Only they're not. The latest RealClearPolitics polling average has Moore leading Democrat Doug Jones by an average of 2.6 percent, almost doubling his margin for most of November, when the news of alleged sexual misbehavior broke. More significant for Moore is that the most recent polls tend to give him the larger leads. The latest CBS News poll reflects the broader trend: While the race is neck-and-neck among Alabama registered voters in general, \"Moore leads 49 percent to 43 percent among the likely voters who are most apt to vote on Dec. 12,\" CBS reports. The poll also finds more than 80 percent of Republicans plan to vote for their party's candidate and \"a higher number of Moore's backers call themselves definite voters than do Jones' backers\" As one Republican politico told me not long ago: \"Moore's voters have Election Day circled in red on the kitchen calendar.\"  So, the candidate with the most baggage is also the one with the most passionate support. Sound familiar? If you were watching the Trump campaign last year, it should. The interesting question is how Moore went from a candidate who appeared on the verge of dropping out of the race to next week's likely winner. Some pragmatic analysts point to the mechanics of the election\u2014there simply wasn't enough time after the allegations surfaced for the GOP to replace Moore on the ballot\u2014and that's certainly part of the story. But more significant is that first lesson: comparisons. And the Moore campaign has benefitted from some very helpful ones in the past two weeks. For tough-on-crime southern conservatives, there's a lot to like about former prosecutor and Democratic candidate Doug Jones' record. As a U.S. attorney, he convicted Ku Klux Klan bombers and Olympic Park terrorist Eric Robert Rudolph. But after that, it's hard to find natural overlap between the red-state Alabama voters and Jones. Jones is pro-abortion in a very anti-abortion state. Nearly 60 percent of Alabamans told CBS News they think abortion should be illegal. Jones also opposes the Trump border wall, another idea that's popular in deep-red Alabama. \"Who was an Obama delegate?\" Judge Moore's wife, Kayla, likes to ask on the campaign trail. \"Who is for full-term abortion? Who is for more gun restrictions? Who is for transgender bathrooms?\"  It's not a winning comparison for Jones in Alabama. If Democrats had nominated a more centrist, or even a pro-life candidate, this race might look different. But they didn't. It's not just Moore's campaign that's helping voters get over the character questions. Democrats have lent a hand as well. In the weeks since the disturbing allegations that Moore may have used physical force against women in the 1980, and may even have had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl, a slew of allegations have arisen against both Democratic office-holders and liberal media figures.  Worse for Doug Jones, Democratic leadership has not handled the issues well. Sen. Al Franken offered a few confusing apologies but is back at work with little pressure to resign. The longest-serving man in Congress, Rep. John Conyers, was called an \"icon\" by Nancy Pelosi soon after allegations of sexual harassment were made public (she has since changed her position and called on Conyers to resign, which he did on Tuesday). Compared to the behavior voters would like to be able to expect from elected officials, Judge Moore's actions seem all-but-unforgiveable. But compared to the current crop of scandals from across the partisan aisle, Moore is just another bad actor among many.  In addition, the confusing messages from Democrats on the broader issue of sexual harassment create a climate in which its easier for voters to justify support for a candidate like Moore. Perhaps the most astonishing number from the CBS News poll: 71 percent of Republicans claim they believe the allegations against Roy Moore are false -- an invention of Democrats, the media, or both. Based on the number of allegations and the thorough reporting, this may seem like an mind-bendingly high level of self-deception. But in 1999, just after the impeachment and acquittal of President Bill Clinton, when knowledge of his bad behavior was at its peak, his job approval among Democrats hit 92 percent. This is the power of partisanship: If you can get your voters to compare you to your opponents based on party, they can often find a way to believe what they must to give you their support. Over the weekend, Donald Trump hit the highest \"disapproval\" number for a president ever recorded by Gallup: 62 percent. But apparently nobody told Alabama, where he's got a 57 percent approval rating among all voters and a staggering 96 percent approval among Republicans. Judge Moore has always been the \"Trump\" candidate in Alabama, even when Trump endorsed his opponent Luther Strange in the primary. Moore has the anti-establishment, shoot-from-the-hip Trump style and Alabama Republicans knew it. President Trump has now publicly thrown his support behind Moore, even calling him from the White House on Monday to offer a \"Go get 'em, Roy!\"\u00a0  It's true that Moore's lead is very small for a Republican in Alabama. It's true that Trump beat Hillary Clinton there by nearly 30 percent. So compared to other Republicans, Moore is struggling. The problem for Democrats is that he isn't running against a Republican.

            "article_content": "The former director of the Office of Government Ethics is suggesting that Kellyanne Conway, the counselor to the president, likely violated the Hatch Act by attacking Roy Moore's Democratic opponent in a TV interview.  Walter Shaub tweeted Wednesday that he has filed a complaint with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, which he said investigates Hatch Act violations. Under the Hatch Act, federal government employees may not use their official title \"while engaged in political activity.\"\u00a0 I have filed a complaint with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, which investigates Hatch Act violations. https://t.co/Mrm8al9nZz A day earlier, Shaub wondered if Conway was identified by her official White House title in a Fox News interview earlier this week and whether the special counsel's office has commented on what she said. He posted a letter from July 2016 to then-President Obama that said that Julian Castro, as secretary of Housing and Urban Development, violated the Hatch Act by \"advocating for and against Presidential candidates while giving a media interview\" in April of last year. Shaub resigned as the head of the ethics office in July. Was she identified by her official title while advocating against that candidate? Has OSC commented on what she did? (e.g., \u201cviolated the Hatch Act by advocating for and against . . . candidates while giving a media interview\u201d) pic.twitter.com/qYpa0eXxFZ In an interview on Fox News earlier this week, Conway attacked Moore's Democratic opponent, Doug Jones and was asked by Fox News' \"Fox & Friends\" whether she was saying Alabamans should vote for Moore. \"Folks, don't be fooled. He'll be a vote against tax cuts. He is weak on crime. Weak on borders. He's strong on raising your taxes. He is terrible for property owners,\" Conway told Fox & Friends. \"And Doug Jones is a doctrinaire liberal, which is why he's not saying anything and why the media are trying to boost him.\" Co-host Brian Kilmeade asked her, \"So, vote Roy Moore?\" \"I'm telling you, we want the votes in the Senate to get this tax bill through,\" Conway responded, and she went on to say that if the media were really concerned about the allegations, then Sens. Al Franken and Bob Menendez, both Democrats, would be out of office. The chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, Richard Painter, also tweeted that Conway violated the Hatch Act.\u00a0 This is an official interview. She has violated the Hatch Act by using her position to take sides in a partisan election. That is a firing offense.  And for her this is strike two. https://t.co/U4kjbLu4NT Conway came under fire in March for promoting Ivanka Trump's clothing brand in a TV interview but a White House ethics lawyer said she was cleared and said she had \"acted inadvertently.\"\u00a0 In a statement Wednesday, White House principal deputy press secretary Raj Shah rejected the idea that Conway advocated for or against the election of a candidate. \"Ms. Conway did not advocate for or against the election of a candidate, and specifically declined to encourage Alabamans to vote a certain way. She was speaking about issues and her support for the President's agenda. This election is for the people of Alabama to decide,\" he said.\u00a0 Rebecca Shabad is a video reporter for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "HILDALE, Utah -- In a place where political contests are virtually unknown, the campaign signs offer the latest hint that a polygamous group is losing its grip on this remote red rock community straddling the Utah-Arizona border.\u00a0 \"For Hildale mayor vote Donia,\" reads one sign featuring Donia Jessop, a candidate pictured with a contemporary hairstyle and a red business suit.\u00a0 The signs hanging from fences and walls are unusual because elections here have long been decided behind the scenes by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, a Mormon offshoot that has made its home among the rocks for more than a century and hand-picked men to run unopposed.  Just five years ago, Jessop was a member of the group also known as the FLDS. She wore the sect's traditional prairie dresses and her hair in a conservative up-do. Now she is among a swelling number of former members who have returned to buy foreclosed homes, open businesses and try to turn Hildale into a place that resembles a typical Western town, not a cloistered religious community.\u00a0 The competitive elections scheduled for Tuesday could deal a crushing blow to traditionalists if the 367 registered voters elect Jessop and the non-FLDS candidates for two city council seats. It would be another in a series of recent changes to shake up Hildale and its sister city, Colorado City, Arizona, which have a combined population of nearly 7,800.\u00a0 The government-ordered evictions of sect families from nearly 150 homes forced many members to seek refuge in trailers around town or in different cities across the West. The town governments and the police are being watched closely by court-appointed monitors after a jury found them guilty of civil rights violations. And a food-stamp fraud case led 10 people to plead guilty and exacerbated a leadership void.  Jessop and other former sect members hail the changes as long-overdue progress that will help the community break free from the reign of sect leader Warren Jeffs, who is serving life in prison in Texas for sexually assaulting underage girls he considered brides.  \"The things that were happening in the church were so destructive. And now that destruction can stop, and we can start to rebuild,\" Jessop said. \"This city is completely at a standstill until we change the city government.\"  But FLDS members believe the town they built is being destroyed. Norma Richter, a 50-year-old mother of 13 kids, said the changes overtaking the town feel like a \"cultural cleansing,\" echoing a common refrain among church members and sympathizers.  At the heart of the split is Jeffs, who has been jailed in Utah or Texas continually since 2006.  His followers consider him a prophet and believe he was the victim of religious persecution based on fabricated allegations. Former sect members and outsiders consider him a dangerous man who tore apart families and committed sex crimes.  Jeffs is \"a very sick man\" who controls the people through \"fear of not making it to the highest celestial kingdom of glory,\" Jessop said. She notes that it was he and other leaders who set the evictions in motion more than a decade ago when they opted not to challenge in court allegations of mismanagement of the church trust, leading Utah and Arizona governments to take it over.  His supporters are steadfast in their beliefs. Jeffs is \"still is the only man on this earth that can receive revelation from heavenly father for the people,\" FLDS member Lori Barlow said. \"That's a pretty important link to me.\"  Authorities say Jeffs still sends some guidance from prison, but Richter says followers have not heard his voice for years and that it's unclear who is in charge of the church locally.  One of Jeffs' brothers, Lyle Jeffs, ran the day-to-day operations until last year, when he was arrested in the food-stamp case. He fled home confinement while awaiting trial and was captured in South Dakota after a year on the run. He faces up to five years in prison.  Amid the leadership void, and with so few people left in town, followers no longer meet for regular worship services, Richter said. Marriages that are arranged by the religion's prophet are on hold until Jeffs returns, Richter said.  Members of the FLDS believe the evictions were accelerated this year to clean out voter rolls and rig the elections to usher in the outside candidates. The evictions stem from an order by a Utah state judge who became fed up with people not paying $100-a-month occupancy fees.  Sect members refused to pay the fees because they believe the money was being used by attorneys overseeing the church trust to take legal action against the FLDS. They also believe the trust should still belong to them.  Across town, many large houses with enough room for plural families stand empty as a community board in charge of the trust works out redistribution of the evicted homes. Others are in disrepair, a result of an edict from Jeffs in the early 2000s, when he ordered a halt to all construction in the Utah-Arizona community to focus on building a compound in Texas.  After seeing so many of her fellow church members evicted, Barlow and her husband want to buy a home but fear they won't find anything suitable in other towns in the region for their five kids and 14 cows.  \"Everything I ever needed was here,\" Barlow said. \"The very idea that I'm looking to buy a house somewhere else is shocking to me.\"  When authorities recently served an eviction notice at the sect's meetinghouse, Barlow and Richter hugged and cried as they recalled the building's history and all the funerals and services held inside. The trust leaders made a deal to stave off eviction, but it served as more evidence of the sect's waning power.  Other signs of the sect's dwindling presence abound. Public elementary and high schools that reopened several years ago are now bustling with some 500 kids, despite most FLDS families home-schooling their children.  Women and girls in prairie dresses used to be seen all around town - pumping gas, riding horses and chatting. Now they are harder to find. Several new businesses are opening, including a brewery and hotels.  Incumbent Mayor Philip Barlow, a member of the FLDS and lifelong Hildale resident, said people are coping with change by \"doing what they have to do.\" He acknowledges that having a challenger is new but says he will accept whatever the voters decide.  Jessop wants to make the town an accepting place for everyone. She said she would love to rekindle fond memories of growing up there with her two mothers and 25 siblings.  \"I would love to see families reunited,\" she said. \"I want them to stay. ... They are my sisters, my brothers, my aunts, cousins, uncles. They are my people.\"  Polygamy is a legacy of the early teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but the mainstream Mormon church abandoned the practice in 1890 as Utah moved toward statehood. State law prohibits polygamy in Utah today, but prosecutors have long had a policy of not enforcing it against consenting adults unless there is another crime involved such as child abuse, domestic violence or fraud.  Jessop left the FLDS four years ago with her husband and 10 kids over unrest about how Jeffs was running the group. She and her husband later brought a \"sister wife\" into the family, and the two women now raise their children and run the family business together.  When she returned, Jessop bought one of the foreclosed houses and reopened a corner gas station as a convenience store. If elected, she would be the town's first female mayor.  Richter said FLDS members won't cower no matter what happens at the ballot box.  \"We have a very good man as a leader, but we follow a religion,\" she said. \"They have not conquered us. They can take everything, but they can't conquer our spirit.\"\u00a0",

            "article_content": "MANCHESTER, England -- Embattled British Prime Minister Theresa May promised to restore the \"British Dream\" Wednesday, in a nightmare speech that saw her plagued by a cough and interrupted by a prankster, while parts of the backdrop fell down as she was speaking. In a mishap-prone Conservative Party conference address, May vowed economic help for struggling families for whom \"the British Dream that has inspired generations of Britons feels increasingly out of reach.\" But a speech intended to strengthen her tenuous grasp on leadership was chaotically interrupted by a comedian who handed May an unemployment form. The party said it was reviewing security after the breach. It was a shambolic end to a troubled convention. The Conservatives are in a sour mood after June's snap election - called three years early in hopes of bolstering the party's majority in Parliament - saw May's government reduced to a minority administration. The poor result has left May weakened and struggling to unite a government divided over Brexit and other issues. May needed a strong speech to help fight off rivals to her job, including ambitious Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. But things did not go to plan. May struggled with a cough and a hoarse voice that forced her to pause repeatedly. Midway through the speech a prankster walked up and handed May a P45 - the form given to people being laid off in Britain. As he was bundled away by security, the joker - identified in media reports as comedian Simon Brodkin - said \"Boris told me to do it.\" May's office said there would be a thorough investigation. Police said the man, who was briefly detained \"to prevent a breach of the peace,\" had legitimate accreditation for the high-security conference. Brodkin, whose stage name is Lee Nelson, has pulled off other high-profile stunts including showering international soccer federation president Sepp Blatter with money during a 2015 press conference. As May neared the end of her televised speech, two letters fell off the slogan on the wall behind her - \"Building a country that works for everyone.\" When she finished, May was embraced onstage by her husband Philip, as Lenny Kravitz's \"Are You Gonna Go My Way?\" rang out in the auditorium. The prime minister later tried to make light of her vocal difficulties, tweeting a picture of the speech surrounded by cough medicine and lozenges, with the word \"coughs.\" *coughs* pic.twitter.com/1b6CoW5Mrz But the speech did not resolve doubts about May's future. Her struggle to speak could be seen as a symbol of her vulnerability - or of her steely determination to carry on. Senior Tories rallied to support her. Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson tweeted that \"if ever the PM needed a metaphor for service and duty and resolution through adversity, that battling performance was it!\" If ever the PM needed a metaphor for service and duty and resolution through adversity, that battling performance was it! Huge respect. Others said the speech humanized a politician whose wooden campaigning style has seen her dubbed the \"Maybot.\" \"She completely turned around that tone of the general election,\" said Conservative lawmaker George Freeman. May fought back against \"Maybot\" claims in her speech, saying passion for social justice \"burns inside me\" and highlighting her work against racism, modern slavery and child sexual abuse. She even made a rare personal reference, saying \"it has always been a great sadness for me and Philip that we were not blessed with children.\" The unscripted mayhem overshadowed a substantial speech in which May appealed to middle- and lower-income voters. She promised to put a price cap on energy bills and get government back into the business of building public housing, a role it has largely abandoned since the 1980s, \"to help fix our broken housing market.\" Undersupply and rising prices have made home ownership an elusive goal for many Britons. May took responsibility for the Conservative election failure, saying \"I led the campaign, and I am sorry.\" Then she tried to move on, telling ministers to \"shape up\" and focus on \"the daily lives of ordinary working people.\" And she called for a more humane politics, saying \"people are fed up with the game-playing, the name-calling.\" She vowed to work for an inclusive, open Britain, seeking to allay fears that the country will become more insular after it leaves the European Union. She told EU citizens living in Britain \"we want you to stay,\" and said that after Brexit, the country would not be one retreating behind borders, but \"a global Britain that stands tall in the world.\" May said the government wants divorce talks with the bloc to end in a good deal, but is \"prepared in the event that they do not.\" May's speech was also overshadowed by furor over Johnson's comment during a meeting at the conference that the Libyan city of Sirte could become a tourism hub once they \"clear the dead bodies away.\" Conservative lawmakers condemned the remarks as crass and tasteless, and several called for Johnson to be fired.",

            "article_content": "John Kelly took the reins at the White House as chief of staff last week after a chaotic period marked by the departure of several top officials. Meanwhile, the impaneling of a grand jury suggested special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election is deepening. \"Face the Nation\" sat down on Sunday with Sen. Tom Cotton, a member of the Intelligence and Armed Services committees, to discuss some of the national security issues facing the country.\u00a0 What follows is a transcript of the interview with Cotton, which aired August 6, 2017, on \"Face the Nation.\" JOHN DICKERSON: Good morning, and welcome to \"Face the Nation.\" We begin this morning with Arkansas Republican senator, Tom Cotton. He joins us from Minneapolis. Senator, welcome. I want to start with something that people are watching now. It's what you, on the intelligence committee, have been investigating. And that is Russian- potential Russian efforts to influence American actions. So what's happened is the National Security Advisor, H.R. McMaster has been under a bit of an assault in the digital space. And The New York Times reports that on Friday on social media, 600 Twitter accounts linked to Russian influence operations at one point had the hashtag, \"FireMcMaster.\" It was so popular, it was the number one item on Friday. What do you make of all of that? And does it look like what you've been investigating during the election?\u00a0 SEN. TOM COTTON: Well, John, good morning. First off, I think H.R. McMaster's a great American. There aren't many generals out there who are highly decorated in two different wars, and also have best-selling Ph.D.'s about civil military relations. I was happy to bring him to the President's attention in February, pleased that the President chose him to be his national security advisor, glad to know that the President said on Friday that they're working very well together.  I don't want to comment on the specific report from The New York Times. But I will say that Russia has a long history of using disinformation, deception, subterfuge, and espionage to influence Western democracies. That happened in our election last year when Russian intelligence services hacked into those emails and released them.  It happened in 1983 when Russian intelligence services were behind much of the protest against the deployment of intermediate range nuclear forces to Western Europe. So it should come as no surprise that Russia continues its effort to manipulate Western democracies in a way to sow discord and disagreements between our countries in NATO and within the United States or any other Western European country. And it's something the United States obviously must be on guard against.  JOHN DICKERSON: Do you think the Russians are involved in what is obviously some kind of an operation to hurt H.R. McMaster as the national security advisor and perhaps push him out?  SEN. TOM COTTON: Again, John, I don't want to comment on that specific report. But it shouldn't surprise any American to know that Russia uses its money and its intelligence services to spread disinformation, use subterfuge and deception and manipulation, to try to divide political opinion within the United States, within any Western European country, or among NATO countries. That's one of the techniques that Russia has used for decades, during the Cold War and during the Putin era.  JOHN DICKERSON: So given that Russia is an ongoing threat, you signed onto legislation to sanction Russia. Is there more that the administration should do?  SEN. TOM COTTON: Well, Russia remains an adversary to the United States. We have some overlapping interests. It would be better if our relationship was better. But our relationship is not good right now because of Vladimir Putin. There are steps that I think that we should be taking that we should have taken under the Obama administration.  For instance, providing defensive weaponry to Ukraine. I encourage the President and the administration to take a look at those steps. I know they are doing so through deliberate, careful National Security Council meetings.  JOHN DICKERSON: And you- and you support- Do you think there'll be a decision on that with respect to arming the Ukrainians?  SEN. TOM COTTON: I hope so, John. And I hope there's other steps that we can take to try to strengthen NATO's defenses against Russia. For instance, Russia's conducting a major military exercise on their western border, on NATO's eastern border. I've long supported the efforts to send more of our troops to Eastern Europe to try to increase the permanent presence there, and to make it clear to Russia that we'll stand by all of our NATO allies, and they can't take steps that will intimidate or interfere with NATO's member countries.  JOHN DICKERSON: Another thing the administration, the President, the defense department are looking into is the situation in Afghanistan. I want to ask you a couple questions that the President appears to be asking, which is first of all, after 16 years, why is it still in the US national interest to be involved in Afghanistan, where you served and- and fought?  SEN. TOM COTTON: John, Afghanistan is the place from which we were attacked 16 years ago next month. It's the one place where we successfully ejected Al Qaeda from. Today, though, it's still-  you still see a resurgent threat from the Taliban and Al Qaeda. But also, the Islamic state, as well. And we don't want to see what happened in Mosul in 2014, when the Islamic State took over that city, happen in Kandahar, Kabul, or Jalalabad, and let that space become an area from which terrorist extremists can plot and launch attacks against the United States and our citizens again.  JOHN DICKERSON: Do you agree with the president, who reportedly has said he believes that the U.S. is losing in Afghanistan?  SEN. TOM COTTON: We aren't making enough progress. And in military terms, if you're not winning, sometimes you are losing. We've seen the Taliban and associated terrorist organizations make gains in recent years. It's time to stop those gains and roll them back. There's a lot of different techniques to do so, but we cannot allow Afghanistan to once again become an ungoverned country from which terrorist organizations can launch attacks against the United States and our citizens.  JOHN DICKERSON: You and I, during the campaign, talked about Congress' role in overseeing the President. I wanted to get your thoughts about three things that Congress did before everybody left town. First, there was the vote on sanctions, which the President did not like, with respect to Russia.  Also, in the Senate, you took measures to make sure there were no recess appointments. And finally, there are a couple bipartisan efforts to make sure that if- that the President can't fire the special counsel. What do you make of all of those actions with respect to- Seems to be Congress is trying to constrain the President.\u00a0 SEN. TOM COTTON: Well, those are all very different kinds of actions. On the sanctions legislation, I supported that legislation because Russia and China are adversaries, and North Korea is racing towards having a nuclear armed missile that can strike the United States. The recess appointment issue is something that goes back to the Obama administration.  I can tell you, as a junior senator, I signed a sign-up roster early this year that was choosing when I was going to be in Washington, D.C., during a recess, to preside over a short session of the Senate, to insure that there wasn't a recess appointment. That's simply Congress taking its responsibilities seriously, to provide advice and consent to all nominations.  We did it under the Obama administration. It's happening under the Trump administration, as well. Finally, on those two pieces of legislation, I don't see them going very far. The Independent Counsel Statute in the 1970s and '80s and '90s was a disaster. We have an executive branch in which the power of all the departments and all the agencies reports to the single elected member of the President.  So those are all very different kinds of actions. But Congress is a co-equal branch of government. And in my opinion, for decades, Congress has ceded too much authority to the executive branch. And we should exercise our constitutional responsibilities seriously and with vigor.  JOHN DICKERSON: All right, senator. We're going to have to leave it there. Thanks so much for being with us.\u00a0",

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., told a displeased voter in Mukwonago, Wisconsin, last week, \"We've got to get it done.\" September will give Republicans a chance to complete their responsibilities with minimal fuss. If they deliver a tax cut, GOP thinking goes, much will be forgiven. Two must-do items will dominate Congress' September agenda: increasing the government's debt limit to prevent a jarring federal default and passing a temporary spending bill to avert a government shutdown. Many Republicans can't bring themselves to back a debt limit boost. But they run the government, and it's their responsibility to deliver those votes. Democratic support will be required, and some hope they'll win concessions in exchange. A stopgap measure will be needed because the 12 annual spending bills are behind schedule. There's no agreement on their overall price tag, which will be in the $1 trillion-plus range. One wild card is whether Mr. Trump will press to fund the U.S.-Mexico border wall he's pledged. That could spark a nasty confrontation with Democrats. The White House and Republicans promise to revamp the loophole-choked tax code and lower rates for corporations and individuals. Along with repealing and replacing President Barack Obama's health care law, this is holy grail for the GOP. But core principles remain unresolved, including whether the effort would further bloat the budget deficit. Crucial details must be settled, among them how far to lower rates and which tax credits and deductions would be erased. The last time those problems were reconciled and the tax code broadly reshaped was 1986. The GOP's signature disaster so far this year was the Senate's July rejection of attempts by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to eradicate Obama's health care law. Republican divisions proved fatal, and they're split over what comes next. Mr. Trump has goaded McConnell to keep trying. Senate leaders have shown little enthusiasm for charging back up that hill without the votes to pass something. \"We've pivoted to tax reform and I think we've got to stay on that,\" Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said in a brief interview Friday. Health committee Chairman Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., says he'll work with the panel's top Democrat, Patty Murray of Washington state, to continue billions in payments to insurers for reducing out-of-pocket costs for low- and middle-income customers. In exchange, Alexander wants to relax coverage requirements that protect consumers under Obama's law. It's unclear the parties can reach compromise. The Senate aims to approve the annual defense policy bill in September. That's when Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., expects to return to Washington after starting brain cancer treatment. He and McConnell wanted to pass the bill last month, but Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., thwarted that plan. Paul wants votes on amendments on indefinite detention and war authorization. McCain has warned he'll use the bill to map a strategy for Afghanistan if Mr. Trump fails to develop a plan. The House and Senate intelligence committees are investigating whether Russia worked with Mr. Trump's presidential campaign to try helping him win the election. The FBI and Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller are also investigating. Mr. Trump has repeatedly denigrated the issue as \"fake news\" and a \"witch hunt.\" Lawmakers from both parties seem determined to press on. Senators introduced bipartisan bills last week creating judicial review procedures that could shield Mueller from firing by Mr. Trump. Lawmakers hope to approve a bipartisan bill speeding federal approval of projects to export liquefied natural gas and boosting energy sources and efficiency. Republicans also want to roll back the Endangered Species Act, saying it hinders drilling and logging. Several programs expire Sept. 30, including the Children's Health Insurance Program, a Democratic favorite. Also facing expiration are federal flood insurance and programs run by the Federal Aviation Administration. Conservatives chaff at renewing flood insurance, which is $25 billion in debt. FAA renewal is stuck over a plan to transfer the agency's air traffic control system to a private nonprofit organization.",

            "article_content": "Weary Republicans in Washington may be ready to move on from health care, but conservatives across the United States are warning the GOP-led Congress not to abandon its pledge to repeal the Obama-era health law - or risk a political nightmare in next year's elections. The Senate's failure this past week to pass repeal legislation has outraged the Republican base and triggered a new wave of fear. The stunning collapse has exposed a party so paralyzed by ideological division that it could not deliver on its top campaign pledge. After devoting months to the debate and seven years to promising to kill the Affordable Care Act, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky., simply said: \"It's time to move on.\" But that's simply not an option for a conservative base energized by its opposition to the health law. Local party leaders, activists and political operatives are predicting payback for Republicans lawmakers if they don't revive the fight. \"This is an epic fail for Republicans,\" said Tim Phillips, president of Americans For Prosperity, the political arm of the conservative Koch Brothers' network. \"Their failure to keep their promise will hurt them. It will.\" To the American Conservative Union, the three Republican senators who blocked the stripped-down repeal bill that failed in the wee hours Friday are \"sellouts.\" A Trump-sanctioned super political action committee did not rule out running ads against uncooperative Republicans, which it did recently against Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nevada. There are limited options for directly punishing the renegade senators \u2014 John McCain of Arizona, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. None of the three is up for re-election next fall. McCain, whose dramatic \"no\" vote killed the bill, is serving his last term in office, has brain cancer and is hardly moved by electoral threats. Still, broad disillusionment among conservative voters could have an impact beyond just a few senators. Primary election challenges or a low turnout could mean trouble for all Republicans. Democrats need to flip 24 seats to take control of the House of Representatives, a shift that would dramatically re-shape the last two years of President Trump's first term. \"If you look at competitive districts, swing districts, or districts where Republicans could face primary challenges, this is something that will be a potent electoral issue,\" Republican pollster Chris Wilson said of his party's health care failure. \"I don't think this is something voters are going to forget.\" One such challenger has emerged. Conservative activist Shak Hill, a former Air Force pilot, plans to run against second-term GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock in a competitive northern Virginia district. Hill told The Associated Press that Comstock, who voted against a GOP House health care repeal bill in May, \"has failed the moral test of her time in Congress.\" The leaders of other groups, such as Women Vote Trump, have begun to court primary challengers to punish those members of Congress deemed insufficiently committed to President Donald Trump's agenda. \"I expect that we will get involved in primaries,\" said the group's co-founder, Amy Kremer. \"You cannot continue to elect the same people over and over again and expect different results.\" On Capitol Hill, some Republicans insist their health care overhaul could be saved in the short term. Yet party leaders - backed by outside groups - are signaling that they would probably move on to taxes. Republicans hoped the issue would bring some party unity, even as realists in Washington view the a tax overhaul - something that hasn't happened in more than 30 years - as one of the most complex legislative projects possible. The Trump administration has become engulfed in internal drama over personnel and personalities. Mr. Trump on Friday ousted his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and replacing him with Home Security Secretary John Kelly. The president did not appear to share conservatives' outrage about the Senate's vote, but repeated his promises to remake the health system. \"You can't have everything,\" Mr. Trump said, adding: \"We'll get it done. We're going to get it.\" Around the country, Republican voters continue to support efforts to repeal former President Barack Obama's health law, even if there is little agreement on an alternative. A CNN poll released last week found that 83 percent of Republicans favor some form of repeal, while only 11 percent of Republicans want the party to abandon the repeal effort. Among all adults, 52 percent of voters favor some sort of repeal, with 34 percent favored repeal only if replacement could be enacted at the same time. \"The political pressure on something like this is real,\" said GOP strategist Mike Shields. \"I don't think this is over.\" Like others Republican operatives, Shields said the party's ability to enact the rest of Mr. Trump's agenda - taxes, infrastructure and the border wall - could help \"mitigate how upset people will be\" about health care. \"If this is part of a general trend,\" he said of the GOP's governing struggles, \"I think that can be pretty disastrous for 2018.\" Republicans will be held responsible for any negative economic fallout from the current health system's failure, said Paul Shumaker, a North Carolina Republican pollster and senior adviser to Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C. As early as October, voters are likely to see increased costs as insurance companies notify people about their new rates. By next October, it will be too late to unlink Republicans from the problem, Shumaker said. For now at least, many Trump supporters blame the Republican Party's problems on its leaders in Congress. \"They certainly didn't have their house in order,\" said Larry Wood of Waynesboro, Virginia, who voted for Trump only after supporting Ohio Gov. John Kasich in the 2016 GOP primary. The 69-year-old retired homebuilder says the failure falls at the feet of Congress. Mr. Trump seems content to let the current system collapse. \"As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!\" he said in a tweet. --- Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

            "article_content": "Facing intense controversy in Washington, D.C., President Trump spent his Tuesday night on a stage that has always treated him well -- the rally platform. \"It is much easier to act presidential than what we are doing here tonight, believe me,\" Mr. Trump told his audience in Youngstown, Ohio, tackling the criticism that sometimes he doesn't appear presidential and saying he \"can be more presidential than any president\" except maybe Abraham Lincoln. But being presidential isn't how to get things done, Mr. Trump said. Moments later, he mused about being asked whether he should be on Mount Rushmore, but said that if he even joked about it, the \"fake news\" media would take him seriously and report it. Mr. Trump lashed out against the media as he faces increasing criticism -- even from members of his own party -- for calling the Russia investigation a \"witch hunt\" and for blasting his own Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Mr. Trump spent much of his speech touting what he considers the successes of his administration so far, saying the White House is finally draining the swamp and fighting for the American people in areas like defending\u00a0America's borders. \"I watch the media as they say 'well, he just had some fun during the campaign on the wall.' That wasn't fun folks,\" the president said, assuring the crowd he will build the wall. Mr. Trump's family, including his wife, Melania Trump, son, Eric Trump, and daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, appeared on stage before Mr. Trump spoke to hype up the crowd. \"God was in this election, ladies and gentlemen,\" said Lara Trump, who is already at work on the president's reelection campaign in 2020. \"I knew we would win.\" Will be traveling to the Great State of Ohio tonight. Big crowd expected. See you there! Before the rally, Mr. Trump appeared before veterans at AMVETS Post 44, a local branch of the veterans service organization. \"Look at all those cameras back there, isn't that nice,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We love Ohio!\" This isn't the first campaign-style rally Mr. Trump has held since taking office. He's also held rallies in Iowa, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Tennessee. On Monday, Mr. Trump addressed the Boy Scouts of America in West Virginia, saying, \"Who the hell wants to talk about politics when I'm in front of the Boy Scouts?\" He still talked about politics, dishing the \"fake news\" media and describing the \"cesspool\" of Washington. Mr. Trump's Twitter feed -- even for Mr. Trump -- has been particularly contentious in recent days. On Tuesday morning, the president continued his Twitter attacks on Sessions, saying his AG had been \"very weak\" on prosecuting former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over the use of her private email server while at the State Department. That's after Mr. Trump in November 2016, shortly after he was elected, told the New York Times he didn't want to pursue charges against Clinton. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers! So far, Sessions has indicated he will stay on the job, but it's unclear how the president's dissatisfaction with the nation's top law enforcement officer will end. Sessions was among the first people to endorse Mr. Trump, and has remained loyal to his agenda. Earlier this week he also called Rep. Adam Schiff (D-California), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee investigating Russian election meddling and any ties between Russia and the Trump campaign, \"sleazy.\" Sleazy Adam Schiff, the totally biased Congressman looking into \"Russia,\" spends all of his time on television pushing the Dem loss excuse! The White House staff is also in the middle of a major shakeup. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer announced his resignation Friday, and Michael Short, senior assistant White House press secretary, resigned on Tuesday. Mr. Trump brought on Anthony Scaramucci to be his new communications director, and Scaramucci is threatening to fire anyone who leaks information.

            "article_content": "NAIROBI, Kenya -- Al-Shabab extremists from neighboring Somalia beheaded nine civilians in an attack on a village in Kenya's southeast early Saturday, officials said, adding to growing concerns the Islamic militant group has taken up a bloody new strategy.\u00a0 The attack occurred in Jima village in Lamu County, said James Ole Serian, who leads a task force of security agencies combating the al Qaeda-linked al-Shabab.  Beheadings by al-Shabab have been rare in Kenya even as the group has carried out dozens of deadly attacks over the years. Beheadings are not uncommon in Somalia, where the extremists carry them out on people who are believed to be enemies and to terrorize local populations.  This East Africa country has seen an increase in attacks claimed by al-Shabab in recent weeks, posing a security threat ahead of next month's presidential election.  Al-Shabab has vowed retribution on Kenya for sending troops in 2011 to Somalia to fight the group, which last year became the deadliest Islamic extremist group in Africa.  Saturday's attack occurred in the Pandaguo area, where al-Shabab fighters engaged security agencies in a daylong battle three days ago. A police report said about 15 al-Shabab fighters attacked Jima village and seized men, killing them with knives.  Al-Shabab in recent months has increased attacks in Kenya with homemade bombs, killing at least 46 people in Lamu and Mandera counties.  The increase in attacks presents a huge problem for Kenya's security agencies ahead of the Aug. 8 presidential election, said Andrew Franklin, a former U.S. Marine who is a security analyst. On election day security agencies will be strained while attempting to stop any possible violence and al-Shabab could take advantage, he said.  There was no immediate government comment on the latest attack.  Acting Interior Minister Fred Matiangi issued a dusk-to-dawn curfew for parts of Garissa, Tana River and Lamu counties. Mandera County already was under a curfew following earlier al-Shabab attacks. All are close to the Somali border.  President Uhuru Kenyatta has not issued any statement on the recent surge in al-Shabab attacks.  Kenya is among five countries contributing troops to an African Union force that is bolstering Somalia's fragile central government against al-Shabab's insurgency. Of the troop-contributing countries, Kenya has borne the brunt of retaliatory attacks from al-Shabab.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "LONDON -- British Prime Minister Theresa May is looking to Northern Ireland for support in forming a new government after losing her gamble in calling a snap election.  With official results in Friday morning for all but one of the 650 Parliamentary seats in play, it was clear that May's Conservative Party had lost its majority, leaving her unable to form a new government without building a coalition.  The Democratic Unionist Party, which won 10 seats in Thursday's voting, quickly emerged as the most likely partner to form that coalition government, and May confirmed in brief remarks outside 10 Downing Street that it was her intention to \"work with\" the DUP. DUP leader Arlene Foster may seek concessions from May in exchange for providing the needed seats to reach a 326-vote majority, however. Foster said Friday that it would be \"difficult\" for May to continue in her role. \"I certainly think that there will be contact made over the weekend but I think it is too soon to talk about what we're going to do,\" she said. The Conservative Party has depended on Irish politicians before: Prime Minister John Major relied on support from the Ulster Unionist Party to shore up his tiny majority in 1992-1997. Northern Ireland's people voted in favor of remaining inside the European Union in the June 23 referendum last year, going against the national trend in favor of Brexit. The DUP in general favors a \"soft Brexit\" rather than the \"hard Brexit\" sought by May, and it wants to preserve its open border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member. The Telegraph newspaper, seen as leaning toward Britain's Conservative Party, reported Friday -- citing anonymous party sources -- that May had been put \"on notice\" by her Conservative colleagues not to bend to the wishes of opposition parties and soften her stance on Brexit negotiations. According to the article, May could face a challenge for her leadership of the party, and thus the premiership, if she does abandon her push for a \"hard brexit.\"  The DUP's other key policy positions -- and the prospect of them being foisted upon the Conservatives as a trade-off to secure their votes in Parliament -- led to new fears Friday in left-leaning British political circles. The DUP has come out against same-sex marriage, denied human-caused climate change, and favors a repeal of abortion rights.",

Petulance. Politics as usual.\u00a0 In the proverbial words of my beloved Beatles: \"You say yes, I say no.\u00a0 You say stop, and I say go.\" \u00a0 Americans are furious \u2013 even more so than on Election Day.\u00a0 And it's hard to blame them.\u00a0 Everything is promised.\u00a0 Nothing is delivered. Yet, for all their contempt for the broken city on a hill, they refuse to take away the keys to the kingdom.\u00a0 They bemoan the leaders in Washington who create the problems, yet consistently re-elect them, perpetuating the status quo without hope of a viable solution. It's a cyclical political paralysis that deepens with every election.\u00a0 The new president is learning what took the old president years to figure out: the art of winning and the art of governing are inherently at odds.\u00a0 Americans really do want change they can believe in. And they really want to make America great again. But it is not enough to change the president.\u00a0 They have to change the system. \u00a0 Maybe that's why Americans are demanding a new relationship with their government: one that prioritizes local leadership and targeted solutions, instead of trying to force a one-size-fits-all national approach.\u00a0 The numbers \u2013 rooted in a poll my firm conducted on behalf of the National Governors Association \u2013 are as clear as they are compelling. A full 71 percent of voters say that state government is doing a \"better job of serving its citizens and delivering results\" than the federal government (29 percent).\u00a0 America's governors and state governments received a relatively high 45 percent favorability rating, compared to just 27 percent for the federal government as a whole.\u00a0 And state government enjoys higher trust on many \u2013 though not all \u2013 issues related to social and economic leadership, from budgeting to education to infrastructure.\u00a0 Even in the era of Trump \u2013 who coasted into the White House on the wings of an angry electorate that feels forever ignored and left behind \u2013 Washington is still doing what Washington does best: gridlock.\u00a0 Congress has proven incapable of working with itself \u2013 let alone the White House.\u00a0 Indeed, leaders of both parties remain hopelessly deadlocked. \u00a0 They prioritize loyalty to obstinate caucuses over common-sense solutions that deliver real and measurable results for the American people.\u00a0 Think that first health care debacle was embarrassing?\u00a0 Saddle up.\u00a0 With tax reform, it's about to get even worse. Meanwhile, our infrastructure is crumbling.\u00a0 Our schools are failing.\u00a0 Our borders are broken.\u00a0 Hardworking taxpayers are living paycheck-to-paycheck, desperate for relief.\u00a0 America has given up on Washington.\u00a0 They want the states to stand up, speak out, and take responsibility.\u00a0 Governors get it.\u00a0 Democrats like New York's Andrew Cuomo and Colorado's John Hickenlooper and Republicans like Tennessee's Bill Haslam, Ohio's John Kasich and Wisconsin's Scott Walker have proven track records because they have broken the cycle of petty partisanship and have fashioned compromises across the aisle.\u00a0 They don't do band-aids; they do results.\u00a0 They offer solutions, not stale rhetoric.\u00a0 They look forward, not backward.\u00a0 And as a result, their schools have improved, their healthcare is better, and they are addressing quality of life issues with ideas, plans, and actions.\u00a0 \u00a0 This is a unique opportunity for a unique time.\u00a0 Think about it -- Republicans have long led the choir in singing the praises of local leadership.\u00a0 Now they're not alone: because Democrats detest Trump, they, too, are looking local.\u00a0 \u00a0 And, from coast to coast, the gubernatorial bench is exceptionally strong.\u00a0 They are passionate.\u00a0 They are prepared.\u00a0 They are taking on tough challenges that Washington is either unwilling or unable to undertake itself. I'm not na\u00efve.\u00a0 Every 20 or so years, fury with Washington refocuses the eye of the electorate on the states.\u00a0 But like clockwork, we revert to our old ways.\u00a0 Consequently, the collective efficiency and effectiveness of Washington deteriorates further. \u00a0 \u00a0 We're a diverse population of 320 million people.\u00a0 The challenges of Massachusetts are not the same challenges of Mississippi.\u00a0 That runs straight into conflict with Washington's penchant for top-down, sweeping remedies, with which we are already underwhelmed and over budget.\u00a0 In short, our political leaders' entire approach needs to change \u2013\u00a0now. \u00a0 So I ask Speaker Ryan, someone I have respected and supported for over two decades: how much more proof do you need before you seek a fundamental change in governing that restores teeth to the 10th Amendment, the New Relationship America is begging for? These are times of great consequence.\u00a0 How many kids must languish in failing schools before Congress steps up to the plate?\u00a0 How many bridges must collapse?\u00a0 How many people must lie awake at night wondering whether they will have the skills and training for the job they're going to need tomorrow? \u00a0 Mr. Speaker, amidst this cycle of broken promises and enduring disappointment, I'll take governors \u2013 who have something to prove they're for \u2013 over your D.C. politicians who are perpetually flaunting what they're against. \u00a0 Pick any issue.\u00a0 Pick any member of Congress.\u00a0 If they can't find the decency and determination to \"get to yes\" on matters significant to the greater good, maybe it's time to say no.\u00a0 No more.\u00a0 Stop looking to Washington.\u00a0 Start looking to the states. \u00a0 All politics is local.\u00a0 These days, so is all progress.

Tillerson signaled what he plans to do initially as secretary of state on issues that involve ExxonMobil, where he was the CEO from 2006 to 2016 and where he worked for the last four decades.  \u201cIf confirmed as secretary of state, I would recuse myself from those issues,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cI\u2019ve made clear in my disclosures, and I think in answers to questions that have been posed, that obviously there\u2019s a statutory recusal period, which I will adhere to, on any matters that might come before the State Department that deal directly and specifically with ExxonMobil.\u201d The recusal period, however, only applies for one year, and was therefore asked if he would recuse himself for the remainder of his tenure as secretary of state. Tillerson said that for any matter after the first year that involves Exxon, he would \u201cseek the guidance of the ethics counsel\u201d and honor their advice. Both Democrats and Republicans on the panel grilled Tillerson about his position on U.S. sanctions that the Obama administration has imposed against Russia in response to its 2014 annexation of Crimea and its recent cyberattacks in an attempt to influence the election.  He didn\u2019t directly answer questions about whether he would advise President-elect Donald Trump to reverse those sanctions imposed in retaliation for hacking. \u201cIf confirmed, senator, I would want to examine it and all aspects of it.\u201d He also said he would want to maintain \u201cthe status quo until we are able to develop what our approach is going to be.\u201d Lawmakers questioned what appeared to be contradictory statements Tillerson has made about the effectiveness of sanctions. Asked if he has changed his view on sanctions, Tillerson said, \u201cWhen sanctions are imposed, they are, by design, going to harm American business.\u201d He then said that sanctions are \u201ca powerful tool\u201d and that the U.S. must design them, target and enforce them well. The most prevalent question from members focused on whether Tillerson and Exxon, under his leadership, lobbied the government against the implementation of sanctions.  \u201cI never lobbied against the sanctions,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cThe characterization that ExxonMobil lobbied against the sanctions is just not accurate.\u201d  He stated that Russia has no legal claims to Crimea, but he criticized the Obama administration for not executing a strong enough strategy in response to Russia\u2019s annexation of that territory. Tillerson said that Russian leadership would have understood a \u201cpowerful response\u201d such as a more robust supply of U.S. military assets. \u201cI would have recommended that the Ukraine take all of its military assets it had available, put them on that eastern border, provide those assets with defensive weapons that are necessary just to defend themselves, announce that the U.S. is going to provide them intelligence and that either NATO or U.S. will provide air surveillance over the border to monitor any movements,\u201d Tillerson said. In a tough line of questioning, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, a 2016 GOP presidential candidate, asked Tillerson if he believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin worked to influence the 2016 election, spread fake news, denigrate Hillary Clinton as the Democratic presidential nominee and worked to help Mr. Trump\u2019s chances.  Tillerson said he has not received any classified briefings yet because he has not received his clearance yet, but that he did read the unclassified report that the intelligence community released last week on Russia\u2019s interference in the election. \u201cThat report, clearly, is troubling and indicates that all of the actions you just described were undertaken,\u201d Tillerson said. Tillerson was also asked about the two-page addendum to the intelligence community\u2019s Russian hacking report that said Russia had tried to compromise the president-elect. Tillerson said he had not been briefed on the allegations and was not sure if Mr. Trump had been either. Asked if the FBI should be allowed to investigate those allegations for accuracy, Tillerson said, \u201cI think I would leave that to those agencies to determine.\u201d Tillerson said that the \u201cgreat and most complex threat\u201d that the U.S. is facing today is in the cybersecurity realm. He said that the U.S. is \u201cextraordinarily vulnerable\u201d and has not built sufficient defensive infrastructure.  He said that the Trump administration should \u201cput in place a comprehensive strategy for dealing with cybersecurity and cyber threats.\u201d That policy should encompass, he said, appropriate norms for cyber behavior, appropriate use for cyber information and an acceptable response when those norms are violated.  During the hearing, Rubio asked Tillerson if he believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin is a war criminal.  \u201cI would not use that term,\u201d Tillerson said.  Rubio told Tillerson that \u00a0Putin has ordered the murder of dissidents, political opponents and journalists and asked Tillerson if he agrees with that assessment.  \u201cI do not have sufficient information to make that claim,\u201d Tillerson said, adding that sometimes such incidents occur when people speak up for freedom in oppressive regimes. \u201cIn terms of assigning specific responsibilities, I would have to have more information.\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, Hillary Clinton\u2019s vice presidential running mate, asked Tillerson if he is aware of any financial connections between Mr. Trump or his associates with Russian individuals or organizations. \u201cI have no knowledge,\u201d Tillerson said.  Tillerson was asked to share his view on Mr. Trump\u2019s original proposal to ban Muslims from entering the U.S.  \u201cNo, I do not support a blanket-type rejection of any particular group of people,\u201d he said.  Asked if he would support a U.S. registry for Muslims, Tillerson said, \u201cI would need to have a lot more information over how such an approach would even be constructed.\u201d He added that if such a registry were used as a tool for vetting, he said it would probably extend to other groups. Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, later pressed Tillerson on the registry again and Tillerson said, \u201cI do not support targeting any particular group,\u201d but he still seemed to leave the door open to some sort of database used for vetting people. Tillerson said that the U.S. must be \u201chonest\u201d about \u201cradical Islam\u201d and emphasized that one of the top priorities for the Trump administration is to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). If confirmed as secretary of state, he also said he would ensure that the State Department does its part to support Muslims around the world \u201cwho reject radical Islam in all its forms.\u201d  Tillerson said defeating ISIS requires advanced capabilities with U.S. communication tools to disrupt the group\u2019s communication tools like the Internet. Tillerson also made the point that defeating ISIS in Iraq and Syria won\u2019t get rid of the group once and for all: \u201cIt will simply morph to its next version.\u201d Tillerson was pressed to clarify his views about climate change -- an issue which he said he came to a conclusion on a few years ago. He said that the risk of climate change does exist and it\u2019s significant enough to merit action. Asked if he believes human activity has led to climate change, Tillerson said that the increase in greenhouse gas emissions \u201care having an effect.\u201d  \u201cOur ability to predict that effect is very limited,\u201d he said. Tillerson was also asked about his stance on the Paris climate agreement that was negotiated under the Obama administration. \u201cWe\u2019re better served by being at that table than leaving that table,\u201d Tillerson said, which stands in direct contrast to Mr. Trump\u2019s previous remarks in which he said he\u2019d want to \u201ccancel\u201d the deal. Tillerson said that he would maintain U.S. sanctions against North Korea and criticized the Obama administration for what he described as a failure \u201cto enforce existing sanctions regimes\u201d including those overseen by the United Nations. Tillerson blasted the Obama administration\u2019s decision last month to abstain during the vote on the U.N. Security Council resolution regarding Israeli settlements in the West Bank. \u201cIsrael is, has always been, and remains our most important ally in the region,\u201d Tillerson said.  The resolution, he said, was \u201cnot helpful\u201d and undermines the prospects for direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Tillerson said that Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s subsequent speech about the importance of still pursuing the two-state solution was \u201cquite troubling because of the attacks on Israel.\u201d  On the Iran nuclear deal, Tillerson said if he\u2019s confirmed, he would do a \u201cfull review of that agreement as well as any number of side agreements that, as I understand, are part of that agreement.\u201d Tillerson said that he\u2019d like to know whether Iran is complying with the agreement and would like to review the verifiability that Iran is complying. He said that the current deal freezes Iran\u2019s ability to develop a nuclear weapon, but he said it doesn\u2019t deny Iran the ability to buy one.  \u201cWhat comes at the end of the agreement,\u201d Tillerson said, is what he\u2019d like to evaluate. He was also asked about a report from USA Today this week that said a subsidiary of Exxon did business with Iran, bypassing U.S. sanctions against Iran, under Tillerson\u2019s leadership. Asked if he had any memory of this situation, Tillerson said, \u201cI do not.\u201d Tillerson was asked about whether he agrees with Mr. Trump that NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) were big mistakes. Tillerson said Mr. Trump\u2019s issue that he has with NAFTA is that it\u2019s been in place for a few decades now and should be reviewed. \u201cI do not oppose TPP,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cI share some of [Mr. Trump\u2019s] views...whether the agreement that was negotiated serves all of American interests at best.\u201d On the Obama administration\u2019s new policies regarding travel to and business with Cuba, \u00a0Tillerson said he would do a complete review of recent executive orders from President Obama.  Asked if he would advise Mr. Trump to veto a bill seeking to lift the U.S. embargo on Cuba, Tillerson said, \u201cIf confirmed, yes, I would.\u201d  Tillerson, however, did not give Rubio an answer regarding whether Cuba belongs on the U.S. state sponsors of terrorism list.

            "article_content": "MOSCOW -- When Russia launched a military campaign in Syria two years ago, President Vladimir Putin sought to save his ally from imminent collapse and break Russia's international isolation over a crisis in Ukraine. He achieved that and more, emerging as a key stakeholder in the Middle East who has brokered deals with many of its key players - from Iran to Saudi Arabia to Turkey and Israel. It's a regional footprint that comes with a degree of clout that even the Soviet Union, which depended on a handful of Arab allies, couldn't dream of during the Cold War era. And it was accomplished with limited resources and a lot of audacity. \"Vladimir Putin is determined to restore a greater role for Russia as a global power ... and the Middle East is really the main area where Russia has that potential, in part because the Soviet Union played that role in the Soviet period,\" said William Courtney, an adjunct senior fellow at RAND Corporation. With just a few dozen jets and several thousand troops, Russia waded into Syria's war and stubbornly pressed its campaign despite international scorn and an outcry over resulting civilian casualties. Russia's bold intervention in Syria came as the United States under President Barack Obama steered clear of military engagement and found itself in a series of acrimonious disputes with key allies, including Israel and Saudi Arabia. Under the vastly inconsistent policies of Donald Trump, and in an era of an inward looking, America-first U.S. policy, Russia's maneuvers became all the more poignant on the global stage. Putin's success in the region was on full display Monday, with the confident and upbeat leader moving between Syria, Egypt and Turkey in a whirlwind tour a week after announcing he will seek re-election for another six-year term in March. Speaking to Russian troops on the tarmac at Hemeimeem air base in Syria, Putin declared victory over the Islamic State group and Syrian rebels and announced he had ordered a scaling down of the Russian contingent in Syria. In Egypt, he signed a deal for the construction of a nuclear reactor on the country's Mediterranean coast and sought to strengthen his relationship with a key regional power that has in the past three years bought billions of dollars in Russian weapons. And in Turkey, a NATO member, the Russian leader appeared to be on the same page with strongman Recep Tayyip Erdogan on key issues. The Russian president was frequently derided for his penchant for a 19th century-style Realpolitik characterized by cynical political calculus. But Putin's approach paid off in Syria, where he managed to play on the conflicting interests of regional powers and strike deals with various players. When Putin decided to intervene in Syria, President Bashar Assad was on the verge of collapse, his forces losing on all fronts. Within weeks, the Russian military had airlifted supplies needed to set up a base in Assad's heartland and launched an air campaign at the end of September 2015. At first, observers were skeptical about Putin's Syria adventure given Russia's economic troubles and the overwhelming negative odds on the chaotic Syrian battlefield, where the Islamic State group, al-Qaida militants and a motley collection of rebels backed by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey and others were routing Assad's shrinking military. Many in the West and in Russia predicted Syria would turn into another Afghanistan - a botched Soviet intervention that led to massive losses and ended in a humiliating 1989 withdrawal after nearly a decade of fighting. Putin argued that Russia needed to intervene in Syria to fight a terror threat, but made it clear that he wasn't going to walk into a trap like the Soviet war in Afghanistan. Another reason for skepticism was the Russian military meltdown that followed the Soviet collapse. The army's vulnerabilities were highlighted by separatist wars in Chechnya and a brief 2008 war with Georgia, where the lack of modern communications and weapons, lack of coordination between various military branches and poor discipline were woefully apparent. But the Syrian campaign suddenly saw a different Russian military - one armed with sophisticated precision weapons, well-trained, neatly-dressed and proud of its mission. \"Putin managed to explain to the Russian people why Syria was important and not only did he explain it, he also showed them Syria wasn't going to be Afghanistan,\" Dmitry Trenin, director of the Moscow Carnegie Center, told The Associated Press. The war saw the combat debut of an array of Russian weapons, including long-range cruise missiles that were fired from surface navy ships, submarines and bombers. The display of Moscow's revamped arsenals also served another key goal - to show the U.S. and its NATO allies that Russia no longer exclusively relies on nuclear weapons. The new cruise missiles gave Putin a long-sought long-range precision cruise capability that only the U.S. had before. Early in the campaign, Moscow found itself on the verge of a military conflict with Ankara after a Turkish fighter jet downed a Russian warplane on the Syrian border in November 2015.\u00a0 But just a few months later, Putin mended ties with Turkey, offering President Recep Tayyip Erdogan strong support after a failed coup attempt. They struck a deal on Syria, setting up de-escalation zones that helped reduce fighting. Russia also reached out to other key players - from Iran, which staunchly backed Assad, to the Saudis, the Qataris and others who supported the opposition. It also communicated with Israel to make sure the conflict didn't hurt their friendly relationship. Russian military successes in Syria and its rapprochement with Turkey paved the way for another Putin diplomatic coup - a warming of ties with Saudi Arabia, Moscow's opponent since Cold War times when it armed Afghan fighters battling the Soviet invasion. In a first-ever visit by a Saudi monarch, King Salman visited Russia in October. While declaring victory in Syria, Putin made it clear Russia is there to stay. He plans to expand the air base and turn a crumbling Soviet-era naval supply facility in Syria's port of Tartus into a full-fledged navy base capable of hosting big ships. Russia has also drafted a deal with Egypt to allow its warplanes to use bases there - a deployment unseen since the times when Egypt was a key Soviet ally in the Mideast before going to the U.S. side in the mid-1970s. Courtney, the RAND analyst, said despite Putin's successes in the region, Russia will remain a limited great power that serves mainly as a military supplier because it lacks the resources and capability that the West has for nation building or reconstruction. \"The challenge for Putin is to turn the use of his military force and military weapons supplies in the Middle East to something that is a lasting success, and we don't yet see how Russia is going to get there,\" he said.",

It is also the first Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing on DOJ since Sessions took office.

            "article_content": "President Trump and Polish President Andrzej Duda held a joint news conference ahead of Mr. Trump's speech to the Polish people later Thursday morning. Mr. Trump arrived in Warsaw on Wednesday for a brief visit -- his return to Europe after a shaky first trip to the continent in May, when he sought to reassure NATO allies that he supports Article 5, the principle of collective defense of the alliance. The joint appearance with Duda was President Trump's first overseas news conference, and he was quickly asked about the\u00a0successful intercontinental ballistic missile test\u00a0carried out by North Korea on July 4.\u00a0 4:33 a.m. ET: President Duda began the news conference by welcoming President Trump. He stressed the partnership between the two nations, and in particular the shared role as members of the NATO alliance. He said he and Mr. Trump had discussed, among many other security issues, the looming \"Zapad 17\" military exercises to be carried out by Russia in the autumn in neighboring Belarus. Many expect Russian leader Vladimir Putin to increase the scale of the semi-regular exercise in a show of force with tensions still high in the region following Russia's annexation of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine. He said he was assured that the United States and President Trump took Poland's security seriously as a member of NATO. 4:39 a.m. ET: President Trump noted that his visit was \"quick, but the people have been wonderful.\" He said he and Duda had reassured the \"enduring bonds of friendship\" between the two nations, going on to say Poland had been \"right their with us\" in the fight against Islamic extremist groups in Iraq and Afghanistan. Mr. Trump said that the U.S. and Polish \"commitment to NATO\" was \"critical,\" before mentioning the challenges posed by Russia. 4:43 a.m. ET: He said Poland had joined the U.N. Security Council at a \"critical time,\" citing the \"threat from North Korea -- and that's what it is, it's a threat,\" which he vowed the U.S. would confront with it's allies to \"very strongly demonstrate to North Korea that there are consequences for their very bad behavior.\" 4:51 a.m. ET: The first question was on North Korea's ICBM test, with a second part asking for Mr. Trump's reaction to his viral video battle with CNN. Mr. Trump responded to the second question first, saying the network, \"has some problems\" and describing it again as \"fake news.\" He said CNN had \"really taken it too seriously, and I think they've really hurt themselves really badly... we want to see fair press. I think it's a very important thing. We don't want fake news.\" The president then turned to North Korea's ICBM test, saying there were \"pretty severe things that we're thinking about\" in response, but adding that he does not \"draw red lines,\" and \"we'll have to see\" how the Kim Jong Un regime behaves in the coming weeks and months.\u00a0 \"It's a shame that they're behaving this way... in a very, very dangerous manner,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that \"something will have to be done about it. 4:57 a.m. ET: President Trump was asked to say definitively whether he believed Russia had hacked the U.S. election that won him the presidency.\u00a0 He said, \"I think it was Russia, and it could well have been other countries, and I won't be specific.\"\u00a0 Mr. Trump then sought to stress that, \"when President Obama found out about this (Russian hacking) in August, and the election was in November, that's a long time, and he did nothing about it.\" \u00a0 He said he believed that Mr. Obama neglected to do anything about the hacking because, \"he thought Hillary Clinton was going to win the election.\"\u00a0 He summed up his stance by saying, \"nobody really knows\" who hacked the 2016 U.S. election. After the news conference, Mr. Trump attended a summit of the Three Seas Initiative, which aims to improve trade between countries around the Baltic, Black and Adriatic Seas. \u00a0\u00a0 Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump gave a speech in Warsaw in which he lauded the Polish people, \"who have never forgotten who they are,\" according to excerpts released by the White House. In the speech, President Trump renewed his call for nations to unite in the fight against terrorism, \"to strip them of their territory, their funding, their networks, and any form of ideological support. While we will always welcome new citizens who share our values and love our people, our borders will always be closed to terrorism and extremism.\" \u00a0 Following his stop in Poland, Mr. Trump travels to Hamburg, Germany for the G-20 Summit which kicks off Friday. There, he'll have his first face-to-face\u00a0meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and he'll also meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping. \u00a0 Tucker Reals is the CBSNews.com foreign editor, based at the CBS News London bureau.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court struck down two congressional districts in North Carolina Monday because race played too large a role in their creation, a decision voting rights advocates said would boost challenges in other states.\u00a0 The justices ruled that Republicans who controlled the state legislature and governor's office in 2011 placed too many African-Americans in the two districts. The result was to weaken African-American voting strength elsewhere in North Carolina.  In recent years, the Supreme Court has ruled for civil rights groups and black voters in challenges to political districts in Alabama, North Carolina and Virginia.  A Democratic group led by former Attorney General Eric Holder is focusing on redistricting challenges to counter political gains Republicans have made since the 2010 census and the redrawing of electoral districts that followed.  In North Carolina, both districts have since been redrawn and the state conducted elections under the new congressional map in 2016. Even with the new districts, Republicans maintained their 10-3 edge in congressional seats.\u00a0 A separate challenge has been filed to the redrawn districts, this time claiming that politics played too much of a role in their creation. The Supreme Court has never ruled that a partisan gerrymander violates the Constitution.  Justice Elena Kagan, writing for the court, said the state did not offer compelling justifications to justify its reliance on race in either district.  The issue of race and redistricting one is a familiar one at the Supreme Court and Kagan noted that one of the districts was \"making its fifth(!) appearance before this court.\"  States have to take race into account when drawing maps for legislative, congressional and a host of municipal political districts. At the same time, race can't be the predominant factor without very strong reasons, under a line of high court cases stretching back 20 years.  A three-judge federal court had previously struck down the two districts. The justices upheld the lower court ruling on both counts.  The court unanimously affirmed the lower court ruling on District 1 in northeastern North Carolina. Kagan wrote that the court will not \"approve a racial gerrymander whose necessity is supported by no evidence.\"  The justices split 5-3 on the other district, District 12 in the southwestern part of the state. Justice Clarence Thomas joined the four liberal justices to form a majority. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito and Anthony Kennedy dissented. Justice Neil Gorsuch did not take part in the case.\u00a0 The state insisted that race played no role at all in the creation of one district. Instead, the state argued that Republicans who controlled the redistricting process wanted to leave the district in Democratic hands, so that the surrounding districts would be safer for Republicans.  \"The evidence offered at trial...adequately supports the conclusion that race, not politics, accounted for the district's reconfiguration,\" Kagan wrote.  Alito said in dissent that the evidence instead shows that the district's borders \"are readily explained by political considerations.\"  Voting rights advocates said the ruling supports their arguments in yet another case pending before the Supreme Court that challenges North Carolina's state legislative districts. A federal court had previously thrown out 28 state House and Senate districts as illegal racial gerrymanders.  But earlier this year the Supreme Court temporarily halted an order to redraw those legislative districts. The justices could act on the challenge to the state districts as early as next week.  The lawyer leading the challenge to the state districts, Anita Earls of the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, said Monday's ruling has clear implications for that case.  \"It's abundantly clear that what the state of North Carolina did in drawing its legislative districts cannot withstand constitutional muster,\" she said in a phone interview.  The court action comes at a time of intense political division in the state, highlighted by legal battles over moves by the GOP-controlled legislature to pass laws limiting some of the powers of North Carolina's new Democratic governor, Roy Cooper. Democrats have hoped that a redrawing of state districts could help them erode veto-proof majorities in both chambers of the General Assembly.  Cooper issued a statement applauding Supreme Court for supporting \"a level playing field and fair elections\" for voters.  \"The North Carolina Republican legislature tried to rig Congressional elections by drawing unconstitutional districts that discriminated against African Americans and that's wrong,\" Cooper said.  The Rev. William Barber, the president of the North Carolina NAACP who has sued separately over voting rights, said the high court's ruling shows that the General Assembly \"engaged in systemic racism and cheated to win elections.\"  Holder said the National Democratic Redistricting Committee that he leads \"will aggressively pursue new cases to end similar illegal racial gerrymandering in other states.\" ",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump's election campaign was notable for many reasons, but one that sits awkwardly with the first country he has chosen to visit as president was his tone toward Islam. Favoring fiery language and vowing to put \"America first,\" Mr. Trump would regularly criticize his political opponents for appearing soft on terror \u2014 but moreover, his vow to ban Muslims from entering the United States both invigorated many among his base, while inflaming his critics.\u00a0 His inflammatory rhetoric on Islam was backed up by two subsequent attempts to implement a travel ban affecting a small number of Muslim-majority countries, both of which were held up by legal challenges. \u00a0His language, on the trail and thereafter, has been described by those affected as deeply alienating, as many American Muslims often felt \"otherized,\" and fissures within the American public widened.\u00a0 \u00a0 Mr. Trump arrived in Saudi Arabia \u2014 Islam's home \u2014 \u00a0this weekend, on the first international trip of the presidency. On Sunday, he's scheduled to deliver a highly anticipated speech about radicalism to Arab leaders. And perhaps notably, the Associated Press reports that Mr. Trump's remarks \u2014 scripted by Stephen Miller who authored the travel ban \u2014 will feature a softening of his rhetoric about Islam. Yet ahead of the speech, many of the president's past statements \u2014 made in tweets, interviews and off-the-cuff comments at campaign rallies \u2014 are being revisited. September 2013: Before the extent of his political ambitions were fully known, Mr. Trump was accused on Twitter of \"hating\" Muslims. He shared a one-word retort.\u00a0 \"@mandem3: @realDonaldTrump you hate muslims.\"  Wrong March 2015: Prior to launching his presidential bid, Mr. Trump tweeted about a 2015 Texas shooting outside a contest for Prophet Mohammed cartoons in a Dallas suburb.\u00a0 What would you do if a large group of Muslims had a very public meeting drawing horrible and mocking cartoons of Jesus? Oh really, be cool! November 2015: At a campaign rally in Birmingham, Ala., Mr. Trump made the assertion, without evidence, that thousands of people celebrated in Jersey City, N.J. on Sept. 11, 2001. He doubled down on the claim in a subsequent interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos: \"There were people over in New Jersey that were watching it, a heavy Arab population, that were cheering as the buildings came down. Not good.\" Mr. Trump proceeded to share tweets in an attempt to bolster his argument, citing articles from Infowars -- the site run by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. I LIVE IN NEW JERSEY & @realDonaldTrump IS RIGHT: MUSLIMS DID CELEBRATE ON 9/11 HERE! WE SAW IT! https://t.co/1SksZU9qlj December 2015: In what became one of the defining moments of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump called for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,\" a proposal that many began colloquially referring to as the \"Muslim ban.\" The statement can no longer be found on Mr. Trump's campaign website. In it, however, he said: \"there is great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population.\" The complete text is below: Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on. According to Pew Research, among others, there is great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population. Most recently, a poll from the Center for Security Policy released data showing \"25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad\" and 51% of those polled, \"agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to Shariah.\" Shariah authorizes such atrocities as murder against non-believers who won't convert, beheadings and more unthinkable acts that pose great harm to Americans, especially women. Mr. Trump stated, \"Without looking at the various polling data, it is obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension. Where this hatred comes from and why we will have to determine. Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life. If I win the election for President, we are going to Make America Great Again.\" - Donald J. Trump On the same day his proposed \"Muslim ban\" was unveiled, Mr. Trump publishes a tweet suggesting that there are no Muslim American sports heroes. Obama said in his speech that Muslims are our sports heroes. What sport is he talking about, and who? Is Obama profiling? January 2016: Mr. Trump continues to defend his stance on Twitter, in which he criticizes former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's opposition to both his Muslim ban and his proposed border wall. \u00a0 Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL, but not O.K. to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant! March 2016: In an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Mr. Trump says: \"I think Islam hates us. There's something there. There's a tremendous hatred there.\" Later in the month, in wake of the deadly terror attack in Brussels, Belgium, he once again argues that Muslims should not be permitted to \"flow in\" to the United States. Incompetent Hillary, despite the horrible attack in Brussels today, wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in.  No way!",

            "article_content": "The Koch Brothers' political network is preparing to spend millions of dollars to ensure their vision for tax reform isn't lost in the increasing chaos consuming President Donald Trump's administration. The network's leading organizations, Americans for Prosperity and Freedom Partners, on Thursday released a set of general preferences for major changes to the tax code. While explicitly stating their opposition to new border-adjustment or value-added taxes, there were few specifics in a document that was designed to inject a new sense of urgency into the stalled tax debate. \"Now is the time. We've got to unite around these principles,\" network spokesman James Davis said. \"The White House hopefully will see this as a jolt to support them in driving this forward.\" Beyond Thursday's release, Davis said the network backed by billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch is launching a multimillion-dollar campaign through the summer to ensure their conservative tax plan is not forgotten. The campaign will include digital ads and town hall meetings across the country, along with phone banks and direct mail. The Koch push reflects broader concerns from the nation's business community that Trump's promise to overhaul the tax code may fall victim to his mounting political challenges. The stock market on Wednesday suffered its largest single-day loss of the Trump presidency. That was before the Justice Department appointed a special counsel to investigate allegations that Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia to sway the 2016 election. Late last month, Trump released a one-page proposal that included massive tax cuts for businesses and a bigger standard tax deduction for middle-income families, lower investment taxes for the wealthy and an end to the federal estate tax for the superrich. It's largely in line with the Koch network's preference, which calls for lower rates, fewer brackets and the elimination of \"special loopholes\" and deductions. There were modest signs Wednesday that the Trump administration was trying to spark new momentum for its tax plan. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other administration officials met with Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Finance Committee in what Democrats described afterward as an opening conversation in the tax debate. Even under the best of political circumstances, tax reform is difficult. Congress hasn't overhauled the tax code in more than three decades. \"If we don't start making the case to the American people and showing them how this improves their lives now, it becomes increasingly more and more difficult, particularly as we move closer to the election,\" Davis said.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump touted his progress on gun rights at an National Rifle Association conference in Atlanta Friday, but not before reliving his Election Night victory and warning the crowd that \"Pocahontas\" \u2014 referring to Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2014 may threaten gun rights in 2020.  Mr. Trump spent several minutes recounting Election Night results, state by state, then intimated the crowd already has a pro-gun candidate in 2020 \u2014 him. But he also took the opportunity to warn attendees that \"Pocahontas\" might run, adding that she isn't pro-gun. Mr. Trump referred to Warren as \"Pocahontas\" multiple times during his campaign.  \"It may be Pocahontas,\" Mr. Trump said of his potential 2020 challenger.  Mr. Trump eventually launched into his record of protecting gun access so far in his presidency, including successfully landing the \"very special\" and pro-Second Amendment Neil Gorsuch on the U.S. Supreme Court. Mr. Trump emphasized his support of \"responsible\" gun ownership.\u00a0 \"You have a true friend and champion in the White House,\" said Mr. Trump. \"No longer will federal agencies be coming after law-abiding gun owners. No longer will the government be trying to undermine your rights and your freedoms as Americans.\" White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in a press gaggle Friday afternoon that the NRA speech is a \"good way to end an incredible week,\" according to a White House pool report. Saturday marks Mr. Trump's 100th day in office.  During his campaign, Mr. Trump promised to protect gun rights as president.  \"The Second Amendment is on the ballot in November,\" Mr. Trump said shortly after the NRA gave its backing to the GOP nominee. \"The only way to save our Second Amendment is to vote for a person that you all know named Donald Trump. Okay? I will tell you. I will never let you down.\" He did sign a bill one month into office revoking an Obama-era regulation that made it tougher for people with mental illnesses to purchase firearms.  Mr. Trump also reiterated his promise to build a wall along the U.S. Mexico border, saying it would help keep out criminals. He especially singled out the MS-13 gang.  \"Get 'em the hell out of here, right?\" Mr. Trump said of MS-13. \"Get 'em out.\" Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump thinks China has repeatedly sucker-punched the U.S. economy with unfair trade policies. And he plans to air his grievances with the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, at their two-day summit starting Thursday in Florida. The meeting will be \u201cvery difficult,\u201d said Mr. Trump, whose criticism of Beijing resonates with his voter base. Is China\u2019s trade behavior as wicked as President Trump says? Not quite. In short, it\u2019s not as bad as it used to be and in some regards has improved. But its bias remains pretty blatant, with plenty of one-sided policies and high tariffs.\u00a0 Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric about Chinese trade actions isn\u2019t always accurate or up-to-date, yet China\u2019s leadership does continue to tilt the game board in its direction. So the president has talked about protectionist steps like imposing steep tariffs on Chinese imports to the U.S. as high as 45 percent.\u00a0 \u201cProtection will lead to great prosperity and strength\u201d for America, he said in his inauguration speech in January, although he and the administration have somewhat softened their tone lately as the Xi summit approached. China became the world\u2019s second-largest economy ($11.4 trillion), behind the U.S. ($18.5 trillion), mostly by doing its utmost to promote exports -- and to block trading partners, particularly major industrial powers like the U.S., from getting much of a foothold in its fast-growing domestic markets.\u00a0 Since Mr. Trump\u2019s election, with his calls for crackdowns on China and Mexico, the Chinese regime has sounded conciliatory. At the Davos World Economic Forum, President Xi sang the praises of global free trade and criticized protectionism, which he likened to \u201clocking oneself in a closed room.\u201d \u00a0 To China\u2019s critics, that\u2019s rich. Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a Washington think tank, said China believes in free trade rules for the rest of the world -- but mercantilism for itself. Under mercantilism, a nation fosters its economy with subsidies, tariffs and other trade barriers to get a leg up on the competition. \u201cChina\u2019s systematic mercantilism represents a threat\u201d to the U.S. and the the world at large, Atkinson said. Still, there\u2019s a lot of fear that Mr. Trump will get too tough on China and a trade war will erupt that would rattle global prosperity. Imports like consumer electronics would suddenly become ruinously expensive. As Hoyt Bleakley, a University of Michigan professor, put it: \u201cA sudden increase in trade costs is a recipe for a slowdown, maybe a recession, as the higher costs disrupt the supply chain.\u201d\u00a0 China still sees itself as an emerging nation, even though its economic heft is unequaled by any other country except the U.S., which it hopes to supplant at the No. 1 spot in 2030, if current growth trends continue. Indeed, much of China\u2019s population is poor, and its GDP is spread over four times as many people as the U.S. has. While China isn\u2019t booming at a double-digit pace anymore, it is expanding at an enviable rate: 6.7 percent in 2016, compared to 1.9 percent for the U.S.\u00a0 In Mr. Trump\u2019s view, the outsourcing of American jobs to China -- or Mexico, India and other places with lower-paid labor forces -- is a tragedy that must be redressed. He has acknowledged this one issue was the key to his election victory. U.S. manufacturing jobs declined 34 percent from 1998 to 2010, during the era of China\u2019s most rapid ascent.\u00a0 Another sign of an ongoing problem: The U.S. runs a wide trade deficit with China, to the tune of $347 billion last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. It\u2019s now half the overall trade gap, an increase from 30 percent a decade before.\u00a0 Here are the battlegrounds of Sino-American trade relations, which show how China has changed its mercantilistic approach to a degree, but far from what its detractors see as just: Currency manipulation.\u00a0This isn\u2019t the problem it used to be, but to President Trump, it\u2019s still an ongoing outrage. Running for office, he pledged he would declare China a money manipulator on \u201cDay One\u201d of his administration. That hasn\u2019t happened.\u00a0 But he hasn\u2019t backed off his criticism of China for what he sees as deliberately holding down the price of its currency, the yuan. An artificially low yuan makes Chinese wares cheaper in America and American goods costlier there, harming U.S competitiveness. As recently as February, the president said in an interview with Reuters that China was \u201cthe grand champion\u201d of currency manipulation.\u00a0 Short of tariff punishment, Mr. Trump\u2019s tools to fight back are rather limited. Declaring China a manipulator would, under U.S. law, require Washington to negotiate with Beijing for a year. The goal: Get China to sell dollars and other foreign denominations to drive them down and the yuan up.\u00a0 If that didn\u2019t work, U.S. alternatives are confined to slapping on a tariff, which Congress has given presidents the power to do unilaterally. China, however, has a history of lashing back at trade sanctions. When the Obama administration imposed tariffs on Chinese tire imports in 2009, China retaliated by taxing U.S. chicken parts.\u00a0 To be sure, China used to audaciously maneuver to give the yuan an advantage over global competitors. It purchased foreign currencies, especially the U.S. dollar, to shove them higher against the yuan. In the process, it stockpiled enormous foreign currency reserves, reaching almost $4 trillion worth by 2014.\u00a0 These days, though, any Chinese manipulation is to bolster, not weaken the yuan. Seeking to smooth frictions with the U.S., Beijing has depleted its vast reserves of dollars: The enormous increase in the global supply of greenbacks has pushed down its value, and elevated the yuan by 1 percent this year.\u00a0 At the same time, the Chinese government has clamped down on its citizens using the yuan to buy assets elsewhere, such as high-end real estate and foreign stocks. That also has acted to keep less of the currency in circulation abroad, and thus scarcer, further adding to its worth.\u00a0 Will China keep promoting a stronger yuan in the future, or is this just a blip? Maybe it\u2019s for keeps. As a rising international force with investments around the globe, China wants to play nice with others on the currency front. Nevertheless, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s eager to give ground elsewhere.\u00a0 Tariffs and taxes. Just about all nations impose some kind of tariffs on imports and ladle sales taxes atop them. But the U.S. does this the least, a legacy of helping rebuild countries damaged in World War II and later its mission to bring up emerging ones, such as China. The Chinese Communist-run government had mandated a shift to a semi-capitalist economy in a bid to enhance its people\u2019s living standards. \u00a0 The combined tariff and tax rate for exports to the U.S. is 9 percent, on average. The tariff rate is around a third of the total, roughly 3 percent. In China, the tax-tariff total is 27 percent (tariff: 7 percent).\u00a0 In fairness, many other nations charge even higher levels than does China -- such as Germany\u2019s 24 percent, Brazil\u2019s 31 percent and Mexico\u2019s 23 percent. The actual tariffs vary, depending on the type of merchandise. China charges a 25 percent tariff on imported cars; the U.S., 2 percent. A lot of nations don\u2019t tax exports, and that\u2019s largely true of China. Congressional Republicans are weighing imposing such a system in the U.S, which they call a border adjustment tax. But this proposal has met with fierce opposition from American importers, like the retail industry.\u00a0 None of the high-tariff nations has anywhere near the size of China\u2019s economy or its potential to become a geopolitical rival of the U.S. For what it\u2019s worth, China used to have much higher tariffs, as much as 40 percent in 1992, but these came tumbling down after it entered the World Trade Organization, research firm Capital Economics\u00a0noted.\u00a0 Mr. Trump hasn\u2019t said much about the tariff-tax question. Still, it may come up as the administration pushes to sell more stuff in the often-restricted Chinese consumer marketplace. Nonmonetary barriers. An even knottier issue is the brace of protections that China has erected to hold down an influx of foreign goods and influence. Cracking this Chinese wall will surely be on the agenda at some point in the Trump administration\u2019s negotiations with the Xi government. For instance, Beijing restricts Americans and other outsiders from investing in state-owned businesses. And when foreign companies seek to link up with Chinese partners, the government often requires them to hand over intellectual property.\u00a0 During the Trump-Xi summit, few expect a harsh blowup. Just the same, given Mr. Trump\u2019s irascible nature, that\u2019s always possible. In March, China\u2019s second-highest official, Premier Li Keqiang, told reporters that China doesn\u2019t want a trade war, in which nations ratchet up tariffs and other barricades, which risks freezing up the global economy as in the 1930s. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin responded the next day that certain trade relationships must be reexamined to render them fairer for U.S. workers. \u00a0 A trade war would likely mean much higher prices for American consumers on all manner of goods that are imported. Certainly, China could always take steps to retaliate against the U.S. beyond restoring high tariffs. Beijing is the second-largest holder of U.S. Treasury bonds after Japan. China could dump its $1 trillion in U.S. paper, which would send Treasury prices crashing and U.S. interest rates skyrocketing, slamming everyday Americans. \u201cThe best strategy for the U.S. is to prompt China to open up,\u201d said Saruhan Hatipoglu, head of research firm BERI, a geopolitical research firm. \u201cNot increase restrictions for Chinese goods and investment into the U.S.\u201d\u00a0 Larry Light is a veteran financial editor and reporter who has worked for the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Business Week, Money, AdviceIQ and Newsday.",

            "article_content": "The stock market\u2019s epic post-election uptrend has given way to the most persistent sell-off since 2011. U.S. large caps stocks have fallen in 10 of the last 11 sessions. Bank stocks are leading the way down, off nearly 11 percent from their March 2 intraday high.  The turnabout has been fueled by last week\u2019s failure by President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress to advance legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare after resistance by both conservative and moderate GOP members in the House of Representatives, along with all of the Democrats. As a result, the \u201cTrumpflation\u201d trade -- driven by hopes of aggressive pro-growth policies by President Trump, including deregulation, tax cuts and infrastructure -- spending is being unwound.\u00a0 As Mr. Trump shifts his focus from health insurance to tax reform, the dream of quick action is giving way to the dark realities of political gridlock, even with single-party control of both the White House and Congress. As both GDP and corporate earnings grow tepidly, investors had pushed stock prices higher via stretched valuations justified by a rosy political outlook that no longer appears accurate.  A re-rating is underway suggesting stock prices could accelerate to the downside in the weeks to come.  Tax reform is set to be equally if not even more contentious than health care because of biting issues surrounding the need for spending cuts to offset the cost of proposed tax cuts. It\u2019s important to remember a big reason the Trump-Ryan health insurance effort failed was very the negative analysis of its budget and coverage implications by the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office. Once the CBO showed the dramatic drop in coverage levels, all the political momentum was lost. Similarly, Trump\u2019s current tax cut plans -- even with a generous \u201cdynamic scoring\u201d boost to future GDP growth -- are expected to result in a major increase in the national debt. The hard-right Freedom Caucus in the House that torpedoed the health insurance bill is very likely to resist such a fiscally irresponsible move without offsetting spending cuts and revenue hikes. This, in turn, will unleash more cans of political worms. Democrats will attack spending cuts -- already proposed in areas such as housing support. And revenue hikes have focused on a possible \u201cborder adjustment tax\u201d on imports that retailers are rallying against. Add it all up, and it\u2019s very likely that these big issues won\u2019t be resolved until the very end of the year or into 2018, if at all. And let\u2019s not forget that the national debt limit will become an issue in the fall, heightening the stakes. Trump campaigned on a pledge to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington and reform areas that, admittedly, need reform while taking on the special interests. Instead, at least for now, it looks like the swamp is draining him. For Wall Street, as well as the millions of Americans who supported Trump\u2019s campaign, this is a major disappointment.  Keep an eye on the U.S. dollar, which has already largely reversed its post-election rally (chart above). The dollar\u2019s strength is a proxy for how aggressively foreign investors are pouring money into U.S. shares and other assets. A break of the 200-day moving average (red line), which hasn\u2019t happened since last July, would quicken the losses in U.S. equities. It\u2019s no coincidence that as American stock prices have weakened in recent weeks, global investors have jumped into emerging market shares, which are outperforming U.S. large-caps with a strength not seen since last summer.\u00a0 Anthony Mirhaydari is founder of the Edge\r\n, an investment advisory newsletter, and Edge Pro, options newsletter.

            "article_content": "FRANKFURT, Germany - U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to get tough on trade partners like China, Mexico and Germany. Now his Treasury chief, Steven Mnuchin, will get his first opportunity to confront them all in one room. The meeting of the 20 most powerful economies\u2019 finance ministers in Germany this week is likely to be dominated by talk about whether to commit to free trade, as previous meetings have -- or implicitly accept that some countries may put up barriers, like tariffs, as Mr. Trump has promised. The officials are also due to discuss their longstanding ban on manipulating currencies to gain economic advantage. Weakening a currency can help a country\u2019s exporters, but it can also end up dumping its troubles with business costs and competitiveness on its trade partners. The gathering Friday and Saturday in the southern German resort town of Baden-Baden will help set the tone for international commerce and finance and will give Mnuchin a chance to clarify what the U.S. position is. The focus will be on the final statement issued jointly by the finance ministers on Saturday. Last year\u2019s gathering of the Group of 20 finance ministers in Chengdu, China, issued a statement opposing \u201call forms of protectionism.\u201d This time, such unequivocal language could be softened to refer to trade that is \u201copen\u201d and \u201cfair,\u201d without the absolute opposition to import restrictions to benefit domestic workers. President Trump has repeatedly emphasized that the U.S. needs a tougher approach to trade that would put American workers and companies first. He has already pulled the U.S. out of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement with Japan and other Pacific Rim countries, and he has started the process to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada, both of which are G-20 members. Additionally, Britain is preparing to pull out of the European Union and its free-trade zone that permits cross border business without import and export taxes, or tariffs, after voters chose to leave in a referendum last year. \u201cWe are committed to open and fair trade,\u201d said a senior U.S. Treasury official this week, who briefed reporters only on condition of anonymity to discuss the U.S. position ahead of the talks. \u201cThat means a trading system that has a level playing field for our firms and our workers globally. We will be encouraging policies that lead to that level playing field.\u201d The official wouldn\u2019t comment on what language might be in the finance ministers\u2019 final statement this week. He also didn\u2019t want to discuss what changes if any the U.S. might be seeking to the G-20\u2019s statement on currency policy but said Mnuchin would press counterparts to live up to their commitments to refrain from manipulation. During the election campaign, Mr. Trump said he planned to name China a currency manipulator right after he took office. But he hasn\u2019t discussed the topic. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will join Mnuchin in representing the U.S. Other prominent participants will be European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, China\u2019s finance minister, Xiao Jie, and the host finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble of Germany. The G-20 is also due to discuss ways to strengthen the global economy and create more jobs. Other issues include international financial regulation and efforts to crack down on tax avoidance and evasion. The summit is taking place with the global economy in relatively good shape: the International Monetary Fund predicts worldwide growth of 3.4 percent this year and 3.6 percent next year, compared with 3.1 percent last year. Yet the election results in Britain and the U.S. have underlined discontent with trade and globalization and a sense among many that the benefits of a globalized economy \u2014 that is, fewer barriers to trade and business \u2014 do not reach enough people. Ahead of the summit, IMF head Christine Lagarde said that it was clear that highly educated workers benefit more from globalization and called for the G-20 to focus on \u201cgreater efforts to equip lower-skilled workers with the tools they need to seek and find better-paying jobs.\u201d Those could include targeted job training and education. The G-20 calls itself the premier forum for cooperation on international economic issues.\u00a0Its members\u00a0make up more than 80 percent of the world economy. The finance ministers\u2019 meeting will pave the way for a summit of national leaders in Hamburg, Germany, on July 7-8. The G-20\u2019s decisions and statements are not legally binding on member countries. The group depends on the individual leaders\u2019 commitments to follow through back home, and the degrees and speed of compliance can vary.",

            "article_content": "U.S. equities churned near the unchanged line on Thursday, with the Dow Jones industrials index recovering from early session weakness to notch another new record high. No major catalysts were in play as investors continue to monitor the situation in Washington for clues on the path of tax, regulatory and health care policy. The last 1 percent decline was way back on Oct. 11. For those keeping track at home, the result marked the Dow\u2019s 10th consecutive record close, something that has happened just one other time in the 100-plus year history of the index: January 1987. But that\u2019s not exactly an example we want to mimic: Just 10 months later, the Dow suffered a 30 percent crash.  Then, like now, Wall Street was breathlessly pricing in the prospect of deregulation and tax reform from a Republican President, Ronald Reagan. And then, like now, the Federal Reserve was tightening policy in response to a rebound in oil prices. \u00a0 The current post-election market \u201cmeltup\u201d has been driven purely by excitement over plans out of the Trump White House, as earnings expectations have actually been sliding, which is pushing valuations metrics higher (chart above), something even the Federal Reserve mentioned in its latest meeting minutes.  This was bolstered recently when President Trump said his tax plans would be unveiled within a \u201ccouple\u201d weeks -- igniting the month-long push in equities. But now, realization is growing that any tax cut efforts are likely to be a 2018 story, as highlighted by Goldman Sachs analysts led by David Kostin in a recent note to clients. \u00a0 Comments from Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin over the last few days suggest the timing of tax reform legislation could be later in 2017 than many had expected. In an interview with Reuters, President Trump said he supported \u201csome form\u201d of a border tax and that both tax reform and health care would be tackled together -- no doubt due to rules in the Senate related to avoiding a filibuster -- which will make the legislation more complex and unwieldy.  Supporting this takeaway was an article in Axios suggesting the GOP may delay a push on infrastructure spending until closer to the 2018 midterm elections to increase the pressure on Congressional Democrats to support their efforts to provide jobs and projects for their home districts. The report pressured stocks in the machinery, engineering/construction and steel industries.  Translation: This is going to take time. Thus, markets may have gotten ahead of themselves in pricing in the positives of Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda.  Looking back at the 1987 parallel, President Reagan\u2019s tax plan was passed in October 1986 and implemented in July 1987. Stocks collapsed in a \u201csell the news\u201d dynamic, according to research from Barclays Capital, because all the positive factors had already been priced into stretching valuations (chart above).\u00a0 The Federal Reserve responded to a rebound in energy-driven inflation over that period by raising interest rates from 5.9 percent to 7.2 percent between October 1986 and September 1987.  Are we headed for a similar outcome as the Fed mulls a rate hike in March? No one can say for sure. But one factor makes 2017 look worse than what happened in 1987: The national debt is much greater now -- and it will surely rise, at least over the short term, as a result of what we can assume about President Trump\u2019s tax cut plans so far. That raises the specter that the market, at some point, starts worrying about the downsides of lower taxes: Higher inflation, further policy tightening from the Fed and the risk of financial instability of the kind seen in 2011 when Standard & Poor\u2019s downgraded the U.S. Treasury\u2019s credit rating. \u00a0 Anthony Mirhaydari is founder of the Edge\r\n, an investment advisory newsletter, and Edge Pro, options newsletter.

            "article_content": "SEOUL, South Korea -- Hyundai Motor Group said Tuesday it will significantly increase its investment in the U.S. while Donald Trump is president and is considering building a new U.S. factory. Chung Jin Haeng, a president of the world\u2019s fifth-largest automotive group, said Hyundai Motor, Kia Motors and their affiliated companies will spend $3.1 billion by 2021 on research and development and maintaining their factories in Alabama and Georgia. That represents a 50 percent increase from the $2.1 billion the companies invested in the U.S. in 2012-2016. The increased spending comes mostly from research and development, as the South Korean maker of the Genesis and Tucson invests in artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, environmentally friendly cars and other future technologies. Chung said Hyundai will study building a new U.S. factory if demand for cars rises during Mr. Trump\u2019s administration. The new administration\u2019s promise to create 1 million jobs and attract new companies could stimulate demand for cars and other products, he said. \u201cIf there is such a sign, we will immediately review (the new plant),\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe won\u2019t miss when the time is right.\u201d Hyundai did not provide any further details about a possible new plant. The South Korean group does not usually disclose its five-year investment plan for specific countries, and the announcement of the U.S.-specific investment plans comes just a few days before the president-elect takes office Friday. Since Mr. Trump won the election, he has badgered auto companies about building their cars in the United States rather than Mexico. The South Korean automotive conglomerate has not yet drawn public attention from the president-elect, who threatened to impose a border tax on vehicles made in Mexico by Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co. and Toyota. Automakers have responded to Mr. Trump\u2019s threat by affirming their commitment to the U.S. market.  General Motors was announcing on Monday a $1 billion investment in its factories that will create or keep around 1,000 jobs, a GM official with knowledge of the announcement confirmed to CBS News. But another sources told The Associated Press the GM outlays won\u2019t be the result of any pressure from Mr. Trump. Earlier this month, Ford announced it had scrapped plans to build a new $1.6 billion small-car factory in Mexico while Fiat Chrysler announced a $1 billion investment plan in its two U.S. factories. Nearly all automakers build small cars in Mexico to take advantage of its lower wages. Hyundai is no exception. When Kia\u2019s first Mexico plant launched operations just two months before the Nov. 8 election, the group said about 80 percent of the vehicles assembled there will be exported mainly to the United States and other countries. The plant has a capacity to turn out 400,000 cars per year. That Mexico plant is now \u201ca source of worry\u201d for the carmaker, Chung said, without elaborating. He said Hyundai does not plan additional investments in Mexico. He denied that political pressure was behind the company\u2019s announcement of its U.S. investment plan. \u201cThe U.S. market is strategically important for us,\u201d he said. \u201cSuccess or the failure in the U.S. market is a measure of global success.\u201d",

            "article_content": "DAKAR, Senegal -- Gambia\u2019s president-elect said Thursday he will be sworn into office at the Gambian embassy in neighboring Senegal, while there was no word from longtime leader Yahya Jammeh on the day that his mandate expired. The Facebook and Twitter accounts for Adama Barrow, run by his staff, said his inauguration would take place Thursday at 4 p.m. in Gambia\u2019s embassy in Senegal\u2019s capital, Dakar. Senior members of Barrow\u2019s political coalition could not be immediately reached to provide details of the ceremony. Jammeh was at his official residence in Banjul, State House, and intended to stay there, said an official close to the administration who was not authorized to speak to reporters. If the West African regional force is going to arrest Jammeh, it will have to be at State House, he said. Many of Jammeh\u2019s loyalists at State House will resist, the official added. But Gambia\u2019s army of an estimated 900 soldiers is divided over its loyalties to Jammeh, and those not sympathetic to him will not leave until they are invited by the new government, the official said. The U.N. Security Council was expected to vote Thursday on a draft resolution endorsing the West African regional force\u2019s \u201call necessary measures\u201d to remove Jammeh. Barrow won the December election, defeating Jammeh, who came to power in a coup in 1994. Jammeh initially conceded defeat but then changed his mind and said he would not accept the results, saying the election was marred by irregularities. Jammeh has resisted strong international pressure for him to step down and allow Barrow to take office and allow a peaceful resolution to Gambia\u2019s crisis. His mandate expired at midnight, and troops from Senegal and other countries in West Africa\u2019s regional bloc, ECOWAS, have positioned themselves on Gambia\u2019s border with the intention of forcing Jammeh out if he doesn\u2019t agree to leave. African nations began stepping away from Jammeh, with Botswana announcing it no longer recognized him as Gambia\u2019s president. His refusal to hand over power \u201cundermines the ongoing efforts to consolidate democracy and good governance\u201d in Gambia and Africa in general, it said. The African Union earlier announced that the continental body would no longer recognize Jammeh once his mandate expired. The streets of Banjul were quiet Thursday, with few cars and scattered groups of men gathered on roadsides chatting under trees. Shops were closed and gasoline petrol was in short supply. Very few tourists remained in the resorts. Jammeh declared a state of emergency this week, but there were no signs of military activity and fewer checkpoints than in previous days. Thousands of Gambians have fled the country, including some former cabinet members who resigned in recent days. Hundreds of foreign tourists, including many from Britain and the Netherlands, were evacuated on special charter flights. In Banjul, many residents said they are waiting for news of Barrow\u2019s inauguration in neighboring Senegal. \u201cWe are behind Barrow. We are not scared,\u201d said taxi driver Boto Sane. \u201cWhen we hear that everyone can go out (to celebrate safely), that he has returned, we will. For now we are calm.\u201d Another resident said the regional forces would be welcomed if it leads to peace. \u201cWe welcome ECOWAS. We like that they are coming,\u201d said taxi driver Tata Saidy. \u201cWe are waiting to hear that now, at this moment, the president is Barrow.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump held a free-wheeling, hour-long press conference at Trump Tower Wednesday morning -- the first formal press conference he\u2019s held since winning the presidency in November. In a tweet hours later, Mr. Trump described the press conference as \u201cgreat,\u201d but also slammed \u201cfake news\u201d outlets.\u00a0 We had a great News Conference at Trump Tower today. A couple of FAKE NEWS organizations were there but the people truly get what's going on Though the motivation for the news conference was to outline how he will deal with his complex web of business interests once he\u2019s in the White House, much of the press conference ended up focusing on Russian election interference and on reports Tuesday that the intelligence community\u2019s classified report on Russian hacking had an addendum with unverified details of potentially compromising information that Russia has gathered on the president-elect, and that Mr. Trump was briefed on last week. Here are some of the highlights:  Mr. Trump said he\u2019s not allowed to discuss information that was presented during his intelligence briefing -- but confirmed that outside the briefing, he did in fact see the memo in question on compromising information, calling it a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d \u201cI saw the information, I read the information outside of that meeting. It\u2019s all fake news -- it\u2019s phony stuff, it didn\u2019t happen and it was gotten by opponents of ours,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a group of opponents who got together -- sick people -- and they put that crap together.\u201d Asked whether he accepts the intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusion that Russia actively worked to influence the 2016 election, Mr. Trump said he believes Russia was responsible for the hacking -- but stopped short of saying he believed they had an influence on the campaign. \u201cAs far as hacking, I think it was Russian,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people and I can say that when we lost 22 million names and everything else that was hacked recently, they didn\u2019t make a big deal out of that, that was something that was extraordinary.\u201d Asked if he had a message for Putin about future hacking activities, Mr. Trump replied: \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be doing it, he won\u2019t be doing it.\u201d \u201cRussia will have much greater respect for our country when I\u2019m leading it than when other people have led it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will see that.\u201d He said he considers Putin\u2019s praise of him to be \u201can asset, not a liability,\u201d though he doesn\u2019t yet know whether he and Putin will \u201cget along.\u201d \u201cNow I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m going to get along with Vladimir Putin,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope I do, but \u2026 do you honestly believe that Hillary [Clinton] will be tougher on Putin than me?\u201d Though Mr. Trump asserted that he would have been able to continue running his business from the White House if he wanted to, he said his two sons, Eric and Donald Jr., along with Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg, would take over his businesses while he\u2019s president.\u00a0 \u201cI could actually run my business ... and run government at the same time,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like the way that looks but I\u2019d be able to if I wanted to.\u201d The stacks of manila folders on the table next to Mr. Trump at the podium were, he said, \u201csome of the many documents I\u2019ve signed turning over complete and total control.\u201d \u00a0 Mr. Trump introduced Sherri Dillon of Morgan Lewis, a lawyer who has been working on the plan for the Trump business empire. Dillon said Mr. Trump\u2019s business holdings and investments will be put in a trust before Inauguration Day to be overseen by sons Donald Jr. and Eric, and Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg. Mr. Trump also said that his two adult sons will run the company. Ivanka Trump, whose husband Jared Kushner is set to become a senior adviser to the Trump White House, will have \u201cno further management\u201d role in the company. There will be \u201cno new foreign deals\u201d made during the duration of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, Dillon added, and domestic deals will be subject to \u201csevere restrictions.\u201d To people who suggest Mr. Trump should sell his business, Dillon said that would only \u201cexacerbate\u201d the possibility for conflicts. Additionally, in order to ensure that \u201cit is the American people who will profit\u201d going forward, Mr. Trump has directed that all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotels will be donated to the U.S. Treasury.\u201d At the start of the press conference, Mr. Trump thanked news organizations that did not run stories on Russia\u2019s alleged compromising information about him. \u201cI want to thank a lot of the news organizations, some of whom have not treated me well over the years, a couple in particular, and they came out so strongly against that fake news,\u201d he said. \u201cI have great respect for the news, I have great respect for freedom of the press and all of that, but I will tell you there were some news organizations \u2026 that were so professional, so incredibly professional.\u201d Later on, he called BuzzFeed, which posted a document which it says is the dossier about the Russian information, \u201ca failing pile of garbage,\u201d and also criticized CNN for publicizing the reports on Tuesday. CNN reporter Jim Acosta attempted to ask a follow-up question, but Mr. Trump repeatedly shut him down.  \u201cNo, not you, your organization is terrible. Quiet. Quiet,\u201d he said. As Acosta continued trying to ask a question, talking over another reporter, Mr. Trump continued: \u201cDon\u2019t be rude. Don\u2019t be rude. Don\u2019t. Be. Rude. I\u2019m not going to give you a question. You are fake news.\u201d After the exchange, he called on CNN digital reporter Jeremy Diamond, CBS News\u2019 Arden Farhi noted. On a question about his proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, Mr. Trump said Mexico will \u201creimburse\u201d the U.S. for the wall because he doesn\u2019t want to wait to build it until a deal can be made with Mexico. \u201cI want to get the wall started,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wait a year and a half until I make my deal with Mexico.\u201d As for the form that reimbursement will take, Mr. Trump said it\u2019s more likely it will be through a \u201ctax\u201d than a \u201cpayment.\u201d \u201cThey will reimburse us for the cost of the wall, whether it\u2019s a tax or whether it\u2019s a payment,\u201d he said. \u201cProbably less likely that it\u2019s a payment.\u201d In response to a question from CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett, Mr. Trump said he plans to announce his pick to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia \u201cwithin two weeks\u201d of taking office. \u201cThat will be probably within two weeks of the 20th,\u201d he said. \u201cSo within about two weeks, probably the second week.\u201d Asked to discuss his administration\u2019s plan for dealing with the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Trump declined to give any specifics but said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to get health care taken care of in this country.\u201d He did say, however, that the ACA would be replaced \u201cessentially simultaneously\u201d with something \u201cfar less expensive and far better.\u201d As soon as his health and human services secretary nominee, Rep. Tom Price, is confirmed, Mr. Trump told reporters \u201cwe\u2019ll be submitting a plan\u201d to repeal and replace Obamacare.\u00a0 \u201cObamacare is a complete and total disaster,\u201d he said, citing increased premiums and high deductibles. \u201c...Frankly, we could sit back -- and it was a thought from a political standpoint -- but it wouldn\u2019t be fair to the people.\u201d Emily Schultheis is a reporter/editor for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "Roy Moore on Wednesday night released a nearly 5 minute video refusing to concede the Alabama Senate race. Moore also highlighted his extremely conservative beliefs and read a Bible verse.\u00a0 \"We are indeed in a struggle to preserve our republic, our civilization, and our religion and to set free a suffering humanity.  And the battle rages on,\" Moore said. Moore insisted not all the military and provisional ballots have been counted, and he said \"we are awaiting certification by the Secretary of State.\" Alabama Secretary of State Nick Merrill told CNN on Tuesday night that it's \"highly unlikely\" the race will end with anything other than a Jones victory. According to an unofficial tally posted on the Secretary of State's website, Doug Jones won 671,151 votes to Moore's 650,436.\u00a0 More than 22,000 people wrote in a third candidate. Merrill told CBS affiliate WHNT that this election had \"one of the largest write-in campaigns that's ever happened in the state in a competitive election.\"\u00a0 \"We don't have anything to compare it to because this is unprecedented in the history of the state,\"\u00a0 Merrill said. In the video, Moore said the race was \"tainted by over $50 million dollars from outside groups who want to retain power and their corrupt ideology.\" He insisted the race is not about being a Republican or Democrat, but the \"Washington establishment which will not listen to the cries of its citizenry - and the battle rages on.\" Moore also gave a rundown of some of the things he believes are wrong with society, including abortion, gay marriage, the national debt, the drug crisis, border security, and that society has \"even begun to recognize the right of a man to claim to be a woman, and vice versa.\" \"Today, we no longer recognize the universal truth that God is the author of our life and liberty,\" Moore said. \"Abortion, sodomy, and materialism have taken the place of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\" According to WHNT, if the race is not close enough to warrant a recount -- meaning within one-half of one percent of all votes counted -- then Moore can request a recount and pay for it himself.\u00a0 \"The last time that it happened that anyone is aware of was when Governor Bentley edged out Tim James in June of 2010 for the July 2010 runoff,\" Merrill told WHNT.\u00a0 In that race, Tim James requested and paid for the runoff, WHNT reports. Merrill told WHNT that he doesn't predict any recount would change the results, but the Moore campaign is \"probably not interested in knowing my opinion about that.\"\u00a0",

            "article_content": "MOSCOW -- Declaring a victory in Syria, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday visited a Russian military air base in the country and announced a partial pullout of Russian forces from the Mideast nation. Putin's visit marks his first trip to Syria, drawing a symbolic line under the campaign that has shored up President Bashar Assad's government. It is also the first visit by a foreign head of state to war-ravaged Syria since its bloodletting started nearly seven years ago. Putin's brief stop at the Hemeimeem air base in Syria's coastal province of Latakia while on route to Egypt comes days after the Russian president declared his bid to run for re-election in the March 18 vote, helping encourage the feelings of pride about Russia's revived global clout and prestige. It also follows the Russian announcement last week that the Syrian army under the Russian air cover routed the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in eastern Syria and fully restored control over the border with Iraq. In a televised speech to the Russian troops at the base, the Russian leader hailed their valor. \"You have shown the best qualities of a Russian soldier,\" Putin said. The Hemeimeem base, in the heartland of Assad's Alawite minority, has served as the main foothold for the Russian military campaign in Syria. In a speech to the troops, Putin said that he had ordered the military to withdraw a \"significant part\" of the Russian contingent in Syria. \"Friends, the Motherland is waiting for you,\" Putin said. He added that \"if the terrorists again raise their heads, we will deal such blows to them they have never seen.\" Russian television stations showed Putin walking off the plane, embracing and shaking hands with Assad at the air base. Putin said that the Russian military will maintain their presence at the Hemeimeem air base and the naval facility in Tartus. Syrian TV said Assad thanked Putin for his troops' effective contribution to the fight against terrorism in Syria. Russia launched its air campaign in Syria at the end of September 2015 when Assad's government was teetering on the brink of collapse and quickly changed the course of the conflict in its favor.",

Jones would be a disaster!\" he tweeted. He also reminded America that he did not support Moore during the primary: \"I endorsed Luther Strange in the Alabama Primary. He shot way up in the polls but it wasn't enough. Can't let Schumer/Pelosi win this race. Liberal Jones would be BAD!\" Arriving back at the White House Sunday evening, Mr. Trump ignored shouted questions about whether he'd campaign for Moore. Jones spokesman Sebastian Kitchen responded in a statement to CBS News: \"Doug Jones is continuing to focus on finding common ground and getting things done for real Alabamians.

Sanders confirmed the president has not spoken to Moore since the Washington Post published the sexual misconduct allegations. President Trump was also asked during a Cabinet meeting Monday whether he believed Roy Moore's accusers, but he ignored the question. He has not yet spoken about the accusations against Moore. After his chosen candidate, incumbent Sen. Luther Strange lost to Moore, Mr. Trump said he would support Moore's candidacy in the December special election. Last week, soon after allegations that Roy Moore had pursued teen girls when he was in his 30s and had reportedly had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl when he was 32 years of age, Conway had told \"Fox & Friends\" that \"the incontrovertible principle is that no Senate seat is worth more than a child, and we all want to put that forward.

            "article_content": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- The CIA's release of documents seized during the 2011 raid that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden has again raised questions about Iran's support of the extremist network leading up to the Sept. 11 terror attacks. U.S. intelligence officials and prosecutors have long said Iran formed loose ties to the terror organization from 1991 on, something noted in a 19-page report in Arabic that was included in the release of some 47,000 other documents by the CIA. For its part, Iran has long denied any involvement with al Qaeda. However, the report included in the CIA document dump shows how bin Laden, a Sunni extremist from Iran's archrival Saudi Arabia, could look across the Muslim world's religious divide to partner with the Mideast's Shiite power to target his ultimate enemy, the United States. \"Anyone who wants to strike America, Iran is ready to support him and help him with their frank and clear rhetoric,\" the report reads. The Associated Press examined a copy of the report released by the Long War Journal, a publication backed by the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a think tank fiercely critical of Iran and skeptical of its nuclear deal with world powers. The CIA gave the Long War Journal early access to the material. The material also included never-before-seen video of bin Laden's son Hamza, who may be groomed to take over al Qaeda, getting married. It offers the first public look at Hamza bin Laden as an adult. Until now, the public has only seen childhood pictures of him. The release comes as President Donald Trump has refused to recertify Iran's nuclear deal with world powers and faces domestic pressure at home over investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The 19-page report included in the CIA release was available online Wednesday. The CIA later issued a warning about the files on its website, saying that since the material \"was seized from a terrorist organization ... there is no absolute guarantee that all malware has been removed.\" The CIA then took down the files entirely early Thursday, saying they were \"temporarily unavailable pending resolution of a technical issue.\" \"We are working to make the material available again as soon as possible,\" the CIA said. The unsigned 19-page report is dated in the Islamic calendar year 1428 - 2007 - and offers what appears to be a history of al Qaeda's relationship with Iran. It says Iran offered al Qaeda fighters \"money and arms and everything they need, and offered them training in Hezbollah camps in Lebanon, in return for striking American interests in Saudi Arabia.\" This coincides with an account offered by the U.S. government's 9/11 Commission, which said Iranian officials met with al Qaeda leaders in Sudan in either 1991 or early 1992. The commission said al Qaeda militants later received training in Lebanon from the Shiite militant group Hezbollah, which Iran backs to this day. U.S. prosecutors also said al Qaeda had the backing of Iran and Hezbollah in their 1998 indictment of bin Laden following the al Qaeda truck bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people, including 12 Americans. Al Qaeda's apparent siding with Iran may seem surprising today, given the enmity Sunni extremists like those of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) have for Shiites. But bin Laden had run out of options by 1991 -- the one-time fighter against the Soviets in Afghanistan had fallen out with Saudi Arabia over his opposition to the ultraconservative kingdom hosting U.S. troops during the Gulf War. Meanwhile, Iran had become increasingly nervous about America's growing military expansion in the Mideast. \"The relationship between al Qaeda and Iran demonstrated that the Sunni-Shiite divisions did not necessarily pose an insurmountable barrier to cooperation in terrorist operations,\" the 9/11 Commission report would later say. Before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York's World Trade Center and the Pentagon in Washington, Iran would allow al Qaeda militants to pass through its borders without receiving stamps in their passports or with visas gotten ahead of time at its consulate in Karachi, Pakistan, according to the 19-page report. That helped the organization's Saudi members avoid suspicion. They also had contact with Iranian intelligence agents, according to the report. This also matches with U.S. knowledge. Eight of the 10 so-called \"muscle\" hijackers on Sept. 11 -- those who kept passengers under control on the hijacked flights -- passed through Iran before arriving in the United States, according to the 9/11 Commission. However, the commission \"found no evidence that Iran or Hezbollah was aware of the planning for what later became the 9/11 attack.\" For its part, Iran has denied having any relationship with al Qaeda since the 1998 attacks on the embassies. Iran quietly offered the U.S. assistance after the Sept. 11 attacks, though relations would sour following President George W. Bush naming it to his \"axis of evil\" in 2002. On Thursday, Iran's semi-official Fars news agency, which is close to the hard-line paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, dismissed the CIA documents as \"a project against Tehran.\" The 19-page report describes Iranians later putting al Qaeda leaders and members under house arrest sometime after the Sept. 11 attacks. It mentions the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, saying it put increasing pressure on Iran, especially with the rise of al Qaeda in Iraq. \"They decided to keep our brothers as a card,\" the report said. That would come true in in 2015 as Iran reportedly exchanged some al Qaeda leaders for one of its diplomats held in Yemen by the terror group's local branch. While Yemen described it as a captive exchange, Tehran instead called it a \"difficult and complicated\" special operation to secure the Iranian diplomat's freedom from the \"hands of terrorists.\" \"The repercussions ... of the Sept. 11 attacks were undoubtedly very large and perhaps above (our) imagination,\" the al Qaeda report said.",

            "article_content": "Special counsel prosecutor Andrew Weissmann argued that former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates are prone to deceiving people and pose a significant flight risk in court documents unsealed Tuesday, CBS News' Paula Reid reports.\u00a0 In the newly unsealed court memo, Weissmann argues for why the court should take the somewhat-unusual step of confining Manafort and Gates to house arrest and electronic monitoring during the case. The prosecutor pointed to the substantial assets the two hold, along with their foreign networks, that would enable them to \"live comfortably\" overseas. Weissmann also says they have a history of misleading people, and possess \"sophistication in moving money across borders.\"\u00a0 In a footnote, the prosecutor notes Manafort registered a phone and an email account under an alias, traveled abroad with that phone, and had three different passports with three different numbers.\u00a0 The memo also cites \"strong evidence of their guilt\" as a reason to flee. Manafort and Gates pleaded not guilty Monday to 12 counts, including conspiracy against the United States and conspiracy to launder money. The charges were a result of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election meddling and any ties to the Trump campaign, and the grand jury that stemmed from that investigation. \"As explained below and at the initial appearance in this matter on October 30. 2017, the defendants pose a risk of flight based on the serious nature of the charges, their history of deceptive and misleading conduct, the potentially significant sentences the defendants face, the strong evidence of guilt, their significant financial resources, and their foreign connections,\" the memo reads.\u00a0 In the court filing, Weissmann said it's \"difficult to quantify precisely\" how much the former campaign manager is worth, with the court records containing specific details about how Manafort has offered very different estimates of his own net worth on various loan statements. In 2016, Manafort listed his own net worth as ranging from $25 million to $136 million on different forms. In 2016, Gates listed his net worth at $30 million, and his liquid net worth at $25 million, the filing says. The memo says the two also have connections to Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs, who have provided them millions of dollars. The two will remain on home confinement until Thursday, their next court appearance. The government is not opposed to releasing them on bonds of $10 million for Manafort and $5 million for Gates, subject to house arrest and electric monitoring. Neither defendant has a criminal history, the court filing notes. Manafort faces a sentencing range of 12.5 to 15.5 years. Gates faces a sentencing range of 10 to 12.5 years.\u00a0 On the same day as their indictment, former Trump campaign aide George Papadopolous pleaded guilty in Mueller's probe to lying to the FBI.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "The reporting of this story was made possible by a fellowship from the International Women's Media Foundation Great Lakes Fellowship (IWMF). Nine thousand miles away from Trump Tower and Hillary Clinton's email server, Aboud Jumbe watched the 2016 presidential election closely. As policy director for Zanzibar's Ministry of Lands, Water, Energy and Environment, Jumbe's day-to-day concerns include rising and warming waters, an existential threat to this island nation, given its precarious geographic location and below sea-level terrain.  Jumbe had breathed easy under President Barack Obama. The United States had finally established itself as a leader in the fight against climate change. But as he watched Donald Trump's rise with a sense of dread, glued to the television set much like the rest of the world, that relief was quickly upended. Once becoming president, Mr. Trump staffed his administration with climate change skeptics and quickly pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement. \"For the first time, I could see the U.S. railing against the world and to me, it was a really sad, sad affair,\" Jumbe recalled last month, sitting in his dimly lit wood-paneled office on the outskirts of Stone Town, the main port city of Zanzibar, a semi-autonomous series of islands off the coast of Tanzania in east Africa. Frustrations on the island run deeper than with Mr. Trump's sudden repudiation of the Paris accord. Government officials and residents alike bristle at the fact the developed world is responsible for climate change, while developing nations bear the brunt of the effects. The threat of climate change and rising sea levels are very real to small, developing islands, which often lack the resources and capacity to adapt.  Small governments that rely on international financing to climate-proof their countries are turning to more creative solutions. In Zanzibar, they're turning to drones. The Zanzibar Mapping Initiative is the world's most ambitious mapping project deploying small-scale drones. The project was born out of a partnership with the World Bank and the Zanzibar Commission for Lands and the State University of Zanzibar, modeled after a drone mapping and digitization project called Dar Ramani Huria, a Swahili phrase that translates to \"The Open Map of Dar es Salaam.\"  In August 2016, armed with $20,000-lightweight yellow and black senseFly eBee drones, a team of 17 geospatial technology students from the State University set out to fly drones over every single village on Unguja, Zanzibar's larger island.  The group of millennials spent nearly a year scattered across the 53-mile long stretch of soil and sand, programming drone flights to capture aerial images and topography of every square inch of land. Hundreds of these images are now being pieced together to create a high-resolution base map of Zanzibar. And the geospatial data collected by the drone during flight will be published online and available to the public by November, with the hope of revolutionizing the policy-making capabilities of the Zanzibari government.  Mapping and land management remains a frustrating and expensive problem across the African continent. A mere 2.9 percent of Africa is mapped at a local scale, compared to 87 percent of Europe, according to a 2007 report from the United Nations. As the population swells -- Tanzania's national average population growth rate is one of the fastest in the world -- a lack of up-to-date maps makes for messy land disputes and hamfisted attempts at urban planning.  After the Zanzibar Revolution in 1964, \u00a0a new semi-autonomous democratic government nationalized the economy and redistributed land to the landless for free. The government handed out leases lasting up to 99 years, sometimes with a verbal agreement and often without proper planning. Houses started popping up in the middle of roadways, and entire villages materialized in flood zones. As the lush urban-island of 1.3 million people confronts the creeping threat of climate change and an uptick in natural disasters, high resolution aerial photography and a modern spatial data infrastructure can not only facilitate urban planning but assist government officials in climate-proofing the island. Consumer-facing maps like those developed by Google and Apple lack the kind of granular resolution and detailed data that local officials need. Small-budget governments like Zanzibar have for years reverted to old-school mapping techniques, surveying land by hand with a measuring tape.  Disaster risk management is an urgent task in Zanzibar, where much of the economy depends on the tropical climate and marine and terrestrial ecosystems. \u00a0Fisheries, seaweed farming and tourism make up at least 30 percent of Zanzibar's GDP, and agriculture contributes to about a quarter of the economy.  \"If you look at the tourism sector, if you look at the rain farm system and if you look at the fisheries, it is all a climate-dependent system,\" Jumbe, the policy director, said. \"So if you alter that \u2013 either naturally or unnaturally -- the people's systems collapse. And so for us, we have to monitor.\" This means the government has a vital interest in monitoring changes in coastlines, vegetation growth, saltwater intrusion, coral bleaching and sea levels.  \"It would be wonderful if the drone images could show us the extent of the degradation of seagrass or coral reef patches,\" Narriman Jiddawi, a senior lecturer at the Institute of Marine Sciences in Stone Town, said of her plans to utilize the drone maps. Seagrass, dense underwater meadows crucial to surrounding habitations in shallow ocean water, is one of many plant species on the decline around the Zanzibar coast due to \"changes in salinity and temperature, ocean acidification, storm activity and ultraviolet irradiance,\" according to 2012 report.  Sea surface temperatures over the past 20 years have trended upward on Unguja island, the largest island in the Zanzibar archipelago. Predictions from Climate Systems Analysis Group, a climate research group at the University of Cape Town, project a 2 degree celsius increase in temperature by 2050. Even modest changes to the temperatures of Zanzibar's shallow water could wreak havoc on the seaweed farming industry. Data show increases in wind speeds, wave heights and high ocean levels, all of which contribute to erosion of coastlines.  \"When I see our mangroves suffocating under the rising sea level, when I see our reef habitats disappear, when I look around at my favorite beach spots in Zanzibar, that I used to remember with serenity, I look at them now and feel a desperate sense of despair,\" Jumbe said.  Fishermen who have seen their livelihoods swallowed up over the course of their lifetimes know firsthand the dangers of rising sea levels and warming ocean temperatures on Kilimani Bay, a barren stretch of white sand and calm ocean where the land has been seemingly carved out of the southwestern peninsula of the island with an ice cream scooper. \u00a0 Juma Khamisi, a weathered kofia cap-wearing fisherman who has worked from the same spot for decades, has been forced to venture further and further from shore, in deeper and colder waters, in search of his haul. The 53-year-old says that a dyke once protected a shallow freshwater swamp right off the shore, allowing his fellow fishermen to grow rice and vegetables. The dyke has been compromised in recent years by the encroaching sea. Crops grow no more. \u00a0 \"You can see that there has been a lot of soil erosion,\" Khamisi said through a translator, standing barefoot in the sinking sand, his handcarved wooden boat parked a few feet away. \"Not sure why there is water encroaching the land but what I know is that water levels are increasing.\"  Half of Zanzibar lives below the poverty line, making the crop-killing effects of climate change that much more devastating. For fishermen like Khamisi, who farm in their backyards and live on roughly $1 dollar a day, it's the difference between feeding a family or going hungry.  Traveling around the island, nearly everyone had at least a tangential connection to the Zanzibar Mapping Initiative. But Mohammed Juma, the director of urban and rural planning, takes credit for spearheading the project.  His office in Stone Town is littered with vintage maps and coffee-table art books. Wearing tight-fitting maroon pants and a houndstooth jacket, Juma does not look the part of a typical Zanzibari government official.Juma said he began to pay attention to drone work three years ago, when he attended a workshop in Dar es Salaam about an open data initiative in Tanzania funded by the World Bank.  \"I was fascinated, because one of the issues we are suffering from here is lack of information \u2014 especially for me,\" he said. \"I plan. So if I want to go and plan somewhere, I don't have the information.\" The map of the archipelago used by the government of Zanzibar has not been updated since 2004. That map wasn't digitized for five years, meaning it was already out of date by the time it was finally released in 2009.  \"It was near impossible,\" Juma said of his predecessors' ability to do their jobs.  After the workshop in Dar es Salaam, Juma pulled aside Edward Anderson, a senior disaster risk management specialist for the World Bank based out of Tanzania, who coordinated a previous mapping project. Anderson had been pestering the World Bank to start utilizing drones for various purposes for years.  \"Until now, if the government really wanted help to update it's base map, you'd need aero-imagery, you'd hire a company,\" Anderson told me(check). \"It would cost $200,000 just to move the plane from Kenya to Zanzibar.\"  \"What the drones do is significantly reduce of cost and complexity,\" Anderson added.  Word of the drones spread quickly as they quietly soared over Zanzibar's settlements. In the village of Sebleni, a family said a torrential flood forced them to evacuate their home at 3 a.m. last spring, displacing them until the water finally evaporated in June. They hoped the data collected by the drones would help the government mitigate the devastation of natural disasters.  Zanzibar's unofficial landfill is an old quarry pit that's now a hazardous crude dump site surrounded by homes. Hamadi Juma, the head of Zanzibar's Urban Services Project, planned to use the drone imagery to establish the borders of the dump site, resettle the families living around the pit and transition it into Zanzibar's first and only official landfill.  \"It is in an unsustainable position of being a world class tourist destination without having a sanitary landfill or sludge treatment facility,\" read a financing proposal Juma shared.  All over Zanzibar, high-resolution maps are expected to help planners accomplish tasks that come easy to city planners in the West. The images will allow planners to plot street lamps along village roads or initiate the collection of property taxes, which have not been collected on the island since 1964. They can help adjudicate land conflicts, and implement more sophisticated urban development for an island with a booming population.  Two members of the Zanzibar Mapping Initiative, Khadija Abdulla Ali and Mohammed Seif Kassim, her former classmate at the State University of Zanzibar, have mapped the school's campus several times over the past year. The imagery showed that informal housing surrounding the university in Tunguu, right outside of Stone Town, had nearly tripled in the previous 12 months. \"We are 1.3 million on this tiny island, what if all of us have houses \u2013 what is the future of this island?\" Abdallah Hama Bakar, a disaster risk management specialist working on the project at the State University, told me. \"Our city will grow horizontally \u2013 so we have to do this planning. Otherwise after 20 years, our island will be little more than a settlement.\" \"In Zanzibar, the drone become famous,\" Kassim said in imperfect English as he waited for Ali to identify the best position to launch the drone. We had traveled to a fenced-off clearing of land in the middle of the village of Nungwi one afternoon in early August to take the winged robot for a test drive. Kassim pulled out a laptop computer, placed it on the hood of our SUV and began to program the flight path of the drone. With the tiny aircraft in hand, Ali stood still in the center of the pitch, and cocked her head to the sky to test the wind against her face. Soon prepared for launch, she broke into a quick sprint, her orange-bedazzled hijab billowing behind her. She released the drone into flight, cutting the figure of a modern Zanzibari superwoman \u2013 cape and all, flapping against the overcast horizon. The drone, buzzing overhead at an altitude of around 600 feet, would be able to capture aerial photos with such precision that you'd be able to witness the near-naked kite surfers gleefully skimming past the hijab-wearing seaweed farmers who labor on Nungwi's shallow crystalline shore.  Nungwi is a pricey tourist destination on the northernmost tip of the island, where rooms at hotels go for $400 a night and tourists can enjoy beachside couples massages.  But the lavish accommodations here are surrounded on all sides by impoverished villages that share a single spout of fresh water. At the turn onto a rutted dirt road into Nungwi, a large sign displays hand-drawn renderings of a man and a woman in skimpy swimsuits, with two big red crosses etched over their bodies. \"Please respect local & traditional culture,\" the sign reads, a timeworn request that is often ignored by vacationers.  Much like the lucrative tourism business in Nungwi, the drones buzzing overhead have also become a source of suspicion among locals. As two of the island's drone evangelists working to demystify the flying object and their mission, Kassim and Ali had collected a trove of war stories. \"In some areas, they fear the drone,\" Ali said. \"They think it's a bomb when it crashes. Or they say, we don't want you to fly drone because you will know our secrets. So you can't.\"  She recalled a particularly frightening day in the field when her drone crashed, and confused villagers rushed to collect the scattered pieces. They refused to hand over the machine over unless paid the money they demanded. Ali went back to the area the next day with government security guards to finish mapping the area.  But she treasured most of her experiences explaining the power and purpose of the drone to fellow Zanzibaris. It reinforced the new kind of professional autonomy the program and drone certification had granted her, freeing her from the seaweed farms.  \"Most of the men feel like I'm a man, because I'm strong and smart and in our culture, most women are not,\" Ali said, fidgeting with her hands, still covered in henna from her wedding. She married at the end of July in a traditional Islamic wedding. \"In our culture, men have to give you permission to do things. But I choose someone who gives me permission to do everything. Someone who listens and makes you proud of what you do. Women automatically think we can't. But for me, everything is a possibility.\"  The marginalization of women on Zanzibar -- which is culturally conservative but also embraces Western modernity -- is subtle at first glance. But Ali's gentle fearlessness and prominence around the island is a paradox in a place where a women's rights activist was quietly murdered with a machete.  \"Khadija is one of those very few women in Zanzibar who are really up for a change \u2013 for an evolution, of the way people perceive things and I think we need to help her, support her,\" said Aboud Jumbe.  The drone project has enabled women like Ali and her female counterparts to challenge prevailing stereotypes of the role of women on the majority Muslim island, a small stride towards closing a gender gap in economic opportunity. Women account for almost three quarters of the agricultural workforce. \u00a0 \"There are so many factors, including low level of education compared with men, and it is embedded with early marriage, school drop out, the mismatch of education they have with labor market needs -- those are the challenges that make the disparities,\"said Mwanaidi M. Ali, the female director of the Zanzibar's Youth Development Department of high female unemployment numbers.  \"Cultural barriers? No. I am here and I'm the director,\" she added.  The numbers tell a slightly different story: Women account for over half of the labor force in Tanzania but compared to men, women only constitute as 32 percent of the paid workforce in industries outside of agriculture, according to a study conducted by Tanzania's Commission for Science and Technology. In urban areas, female unemployment stands at 22.9 percent, compared to their male counterparts at 6 percent. And for young women specifically, the unemployment rate stands at 13.2 percent, according to the Zanzibar Employment Service.\u00a0 The elevation of female drone pilots, who complained of the Mapping Initiative's spotty and third-rate payroll, hasn't necessarily translated to sustainable careers.  When Ali, Khairaat Ali Khamis and Asha Khamis Mussa joined the team, their participation was a part of their geo-spatial studies, coupled with a $4 stipend, barely enough money to cover travel allowances and buy bottled water to keep hydrated while working long hours under the blistering island sun. Eventually, after what the World Bank called an internship period, some participants were hired for higher wages. Ali, Khamis and Mussa all say that they were not paid consistently for their work. The three women say that Yves Barthelemy, a contractor for the World Bank who managed the team, oftentimes failed to pay them altogether.  \"I don't know what the exact word but it was like \u2013 he wasn't doing what he was supposed to do sometimes. Because people work and you have to pay them \u2013 on time,\" Khamis said.  Mussa alleged that Yves Barthelemy, a contractor for the World Bank who managed the team, failed to pay her altogether.  Sitting in her older brother's government office at the Fisheries Department on a Saturday morning in August where she was programming his computer, Mussa spoke pridefully of her role as drone pilot, but was mindful of the disapproval from men in her community -- \"they give me different kind of name because of what I'm doing and because of how busy I am.\" Wounded not by their comments, but by the missing compensation and too uncomfortable to speak up for herself -- \"you would not feel comfortable either,\" she told me -- Mussa eventually quit.  \"It hurts me to remember that I was the only one who did not get paid for the last mission,\" she said. She could no longer spend her time doing a job for which she was not being paid. Barthelemy disputes Mussa's account and says that she was paid a total of 450 Tanzanian Shilling for a total of 45 days of work. If there was an error, it could be remediated, Barthelemy wrote in an email, but conceded that delays in paying the students were common.  \"There were delays in paying Yves who was coordinating this and hence delays in paying the students such that indeed, there was a period when they were mapping unpaid, but this should have been reimbursed retroactively,\" Anderson wrote in an email. Shortly after being made aware of the payment issue with Mussa, the World Bank said it had been resolved.\u00a0 \"No doubt that the days were long, tiring and sometimes frustrating when drones crashed or did not work, then charging batteries at home, then starting early in the morning ... and that as a consequence some of the students thought 10.000 [Tanzanian Shilling] was not worth it,\" Barthelemy added in an email. \"A lot of this was part of their classwork so the payment wasn't a commercial rate which is why we were able to get the costs down but a number of them were able to get commercial jobs,\" explained Frederick Mbuya, a consultant for the World Bank working with Tanzania's Commission for Science and Technology. \u00a0 \"They are now operating jobs commercially and being paid commercial rates,\" he added.  While this was true for Ali, who completed a paid assignment to map a gold mine in Mwanza at the end of the summer, Khamis left the team to become a teacher and Mussa quit.\u00a0 Many people on the island are concerned that the data from the mapping initiative won't be as widely accessible as the World Bank has promised, due to a mix of government incompetence and bureaucratic paralysis. \"This government has a strongly Soviet bureaucracy -- a very Soviet past -- and is set up with a central command control structure,\" Anderson, the World Bank official, said in his office in Dar es Salaam. A 2015 law made it illegal for any publication or organization to call data \"official\" unless it has been approved by Tanzania's National Bureau of Statistics. \"When we talk about drone mapping, it's being done by surveyors of the government, so it's a mandate -- we're not worried about the drone data being somehow illegal,\" Anderson said.  Anderson says that Zanzibar's agreement with the World Bank stipulates that 7 centimeter-per-pixel resolution of the national map will be made public, but that the Bank hasn't yet sold the notion that data is a public good to be repurposed by the entire government. \u00a0 \"If we remove that platform and go back to working in silos, then we risk ending up in disappointment,\" Jumbe says of the open source push.  That's why people like Lorna Slade, the Executive Director of Mwambao Coastal Community Network, are hiring drone experts of their own. Slade, who works with local communities around Unguja to manage their fisheries and local natural resources, hired Yussuf Said Yussuf to map her non-profit's octopus recovery program. Yussuf managed the Zanzibar Mapping Initiative and now serves as Tanzania Flying Labs coordinator for We Robotics, a business incubator for drone services.  Octopus hunting is a booming market for Zanzibari fishermen,especially around the holiday of Ramadan. But a mature female octopus needs 30 days undisturbed in a coral reef to breed and hatch their eggs. So Slade's team identifies areas to close off from the fishing community for two to three months to facilitate breeding, a task completed more intelligently and efficiently with aerial imagery, as opposed to village opinion or diving expeditions. Slade hopes to eventually utilize underwater drones to monitor octopus nesting and aquaculture.  Unlike in the United States, where the drone market has been somewhat stymied by restrictive and onerous regulations, the creative use of drones to solve basic problems in developing countries like Tanzania, Rwanda, Malawi, and Uganda has flourished.  Frederick Mbuya is a World Bank consultant and a drone visionary who founded the \"drone as a service\" company Uhurulabs. He's one of the most prominent proponents of the drone revolution in Africa and has his hands in some of Tanzania's most transformative projects.  Nestled in his oasis of his home office in Dar es Salaam, surrounded by drone parts, computers, and vintage mini planes, the gesticular Mbuya rattles off the many ways he's using drones: aerial surveys for land mapping, analysis of agricultural data to improve farm management, oil and gas pipeline inspections, and medical supply delivery.  In 2018, the only drone delivery service in the world called Zipline, a California company which is already up and flying in Rwanda, Zipline, will be expanding into Tanzania. Distribution centers throughout the country will charter fleets of drones to deliver vital medical supplies to difficult to access areas to make up for the Tanzanian government's shortcomings.  Mbuya is currently working on literature to help other commercial drone companies navigate the process of registering and licensing drones for commercial work in Tanzania -- what he hopes to be an example for the rest of the region wrestling with regulating technology developing at a faster pace than the government can legislate.  \"There is nothing more powerful than a young innovator in Africa building something themselves and it flying,\" Mbuya said.  \"I think the Zanzibar project is a bold statement to the rest of the world and to the rest of Africa: look, we have the largest ever mapping project using small scale drones,\" Mbuya says. \"That is something that Zanzibaris should be extremely proud of and African countries should be inspired by. They don't have to lean on foreigners coming in to do the high tech work.\"\u00a0",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- The North American Free Trade Agreement is in its 23rd year. But doubts are rising that it will survive through its 24th.  President Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw from the agreement if he can't get what he wants in a renegotiation. But what he wants -- from requiring that more auto production be made-in-America to shifting more government contracts to U.S. companies -- will likely be unacceptable to America's two Nafta partners, Mexico and Canada.  Round 4 of Nafta talks began Wednesday in Arlington, Virginia. In a sign of how contentious things could get, the countries extended the negotiations for two extra days, through Tuesday.  \"What is the administration going to do? Are they going to be patient and work through these things?\" asked Phil Levy, senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. \"Or are they going to take this as a pretext and say, 'We tried negotiations. They failed. Now we need to blow this up?'\"  Blowing up the deal appears to be Mr. Trump's favored choice. On the campaign trail, he called Nafta a job-killing disaster. And in an interview with Forbes magazine published Tuesday, he said: \"I happen to think that Nafta will have to be terminated if we're going to make it good. Otherwise, I believe you can't negotiate a good deal.\"  Levy pegs the chance of Nafta's survival at less than 50 percent.  The end of Nafta would send economic tremors across the continent. American farmers depend on Mexico's market. Manufacturers have built complicated supply chains that cross Nafta borders. Consumers have benefited from lower costs.  Nafta erased most trade barriers among the US, Canada and Mexico and led to an explosion in trade among the three countries. But critics say the pact sent hundreds of thousands of U.S. manufacturing jobs to Mexico, where corporations took advantage of low-wage labor.  Before the renegotiation began in August, many business and farm groups hoped the Trump administration would settle for tweaking rather than abandoning the trade deal -- updating it, for example, to reflect the rise of e-commerce. But US Trade Rep. Robert Lighthizer declared at the outset that the U.S. wouldn't be satisfied with anything but a major overhaul.  So the administration has been seeking to ensure that more auto production be made in America to receive Nafta benefits, that more government contracts in the Nafta bloc go to U.S. companies and that Nafta expires unless the countries agreed every few years to extend it. The administration also wants to scrap a dispute-resolution process favored by Canada.  Those proposals are considered poison pills by Canada and Mexico.  The negotiators are under pressure to reach a deal this year -- before presidential elections in Mexico and midterm elections in the US raise the political temperature in 2018.  \"The administration set itself the task of doing a really radical overhaul and having it done by Christmas,\" said Levy, a former trade adviser to President George W. Bush. \"I'm not surprised that Ambassador Lighthizer hasn't been able to square that circle.\"  Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Trade, said Mr. Trump \"very likely\" has the legal authority to withdraw from Nafta on his own if talks collapse. But Congress can fight back. Lawmakers could pass a resolution calling on the president to obtain congressional authority before invoking the Nafta clause that lets countries pull out. They could also threaten to block the president's agenda unless he secures congressional approval to withdraw.  If the US left Nafta, trade barriers to Canada and Mexico would pop back up. Some of the tariffs wouldn't be especially high. But Mexican tariffs on many American farm products could soar -- to as high as 37 percent on corn, for example, noted Caroline Freund, a senior fellow at Peterson.  For that reason, many agricultural lobbies and lawmakers from farm states have urged the administration to \"do no harm\" in the Nafta talks.  Daniel Ujczo, a trade lawyer with Dickinson Wright, predicted that Canada and Mexico would likely call a timeout if the US insists on pushing contentious proposals.  \"The Canadian and Mexican strategy will be to take a pause,\" he said, and \"allow the US domestic process to play itself out\" with business and farm groups and many lawmakers rising to defend Nafta.  Nafta supporters are already rallying. In a speech Tuesday in Mexico City, Thomas Donohue, president of the US Chamber of Commerce, vowed: \"We're going to fight like hell to protect the agreement.\" ",

            "article_content": "ERBIL, Iraq -- There's election fallout in Iraq after Kurds voted overwhelming this week for independence. Iraqi Kurds have been a crucial partner of the U.S. in the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. They say the Iraqi government is now taking steps against them that could hinder their efforts. Turkish and Iraqi troops held military drills along Iraqi Kurdistan's northern border this week and in its main airport on Friday, people took the last planes out after Iraq's national government canceled international flights. \u00a0 Federal Iraqi authorities are ratcheting up the tension, pressuring the leaders of this region to cancel the results of Monday's referendum, in which over 90 percent of voters chose full independence.\u00a0 Most are members of the Kurdish ethnic minority and they already rule over their own autonomous region. Iraq's national government says the referendum was illegal.\u00a0 Turkey, which has a restive Kurdish population of its own, condemned the vote and the U.S. also opposed it, worried it could disrupt the fragile cooperation between the Kurds and the Iraqi government in the fight against ISIS. The Kurds of Iraq have battled bravely against ISIS as close American allies who have laid down their lives to defeat the extremists.\u00a0 Capt. Hazar Nadar Hassan lost both his legs to an ISIS bomb in 2014 and said\u00a0doctors only gave him a 2 percent chance of survival. \u00a0 When you realized that he had lost both your legs, he said he was \"thinking about my kids -- and whether I'd ever seem them again.\"\u00a0 Sgt.

He was in a coma for 18 days and has neurological damage. \u00a0 But he said still wants to go back to being a soldier. \u00a0 Many people here believe that sacrifice makes Iraqi Kurdistan more deserving of independence, but not even its friends seem to agree. \u00a0 The Kurdish regional government seems to have miscalculated the anger this referendum would generate and the retaliation it would provoke. Turkey has threatened to cut off oil exports from the region, which would be economically crippling. \u00a0",

            "article_content": "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- Women will be allowed to drive for the first time next summer in Saudi Arabia, the ultra-conservative kingdom announced Tuesday, marking a significant expansion of women's rights in the only the country that barred them from getting behind the wheel. The country's Shura council was considering the issue, but King Salman made the final call, CBS News White House and senior foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan reports. While women in other Muslim countries drove freely, the kingdom's blanket ban attracted negative publicity for years. Neither Islamic law nor Saudi traffic law explicitly prohibited women from driving, but they were not issued licenses and were detained if they attempted to drive. \"Women are half our population. They are a capable half of our population. Without them we cannot move forward,\" Prince Khaled bin Salman, the new Saudi ambassador to the U.S., told reporters Tuesday. He declared there is \"no wrong time to do the right thing.\" \"Women are allowed to drive however they decide to,\" Khalid said, explaining that women do not need to get permission from males to drive and they do not need guardianship with them to drive.  \"The pace of change has changed,\" Khalid said of his country, noting its youth and vibrancy. \"I think our leadership understands our society is ready.\" The decree indicated that women will not be allowed to drive immediately. A committee will be formed to look into how to implement the new order, which is slated to take effect in June 2018. For years, the kingdom has incrementally granted women more rights and visibility, including participation in the Olympic Games in London and Rio, positions on the country's top consultative council and the right to run and vote in local elections in 2015. Despite these openings, Saudi women remain largely subject to the whims of men due to guardianship laws, which bar them from obtaining a passport, traveling abroad or marrying without the consent of a male relative. Women who attempt to flee abusive families have also faced imprisonment or been forced into shelters. King Salman and his young son and heir, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, tested the waters over the weekend by allowing women into the country's main stadium in Riyadh for annual celebrations of the nation's founding. The stadium had previously been reserved for all-male crowds to watch sporting events. Women and men also flooded a main street in the capital, bopping their heads to pop music as green lights flickered overhead in the color of the flag. The scene was shocking for a city in which gender segregation is strictly enforced and where women are seldom seen walking the streets, much less mixing in close quarters with males. The official announcement came in the form of a royal decree that was reported late Tuesday by the state-run Saudi Press Agency and state TV. \"I am really excited. This is a good step forward for women's rights,\" said Aziza Youssef, a professor at King Saud University and one of Saudi Arabia's most vocal women's rights activists. Speaking to The Associated Press from Riyadh, she said women were \"happy\" but also that the change was \"the first step in a lot of rights we are waiting for.\" Saudi history offers many examples of women being punished simply for operating a vehicle. In 1990, 50 women were arrested for driving and lost their passports and their jobs. More than 20 years later, a woman was sentenced in 2011 to 10 lashes for driving, though the late King Abdullah overturned the sentence. As recently as late 2014, two Saudi women were detained for more than two months for defying the ban on driving when one of them attempted to cross the Saudi border with a license from neighboring United Arab Emirates in an act of defiance. Youssef took part in numerous driving campaigns, including a widely publicized effort in 2013 when dozens of women across the kingdom uploaded videos to YouTube of themselves driving in Saudi Arabia. Some videos showed families and male drivers giving women a \"thumbs-ups,\" suggesting many were ready for the change. Activist Manal al-Sharif was arrested by Saudi Arabia's religious police for driving in 2011. She lost her job and received abuse and threats. \"You always have to be prepared when you speak up against the odds or the status quo to pay a price,\" she told CBS News' Holly Williams in 2013. \"Profanity, lies, rumors. You could lose your job. You could lose everything.\" On Tuesday, al-Sharif celebrated King Salman's decision on Twitter: \"Saudi Arabia will never be the same again. The rain begins with a single drop.\"\u00a0 You want a statement here is one: \"Saudi Arabia will never be the same again. The rain begins with a single drop\" #Women2Drive \u2764\ufe0f However, many of those same ultraconservative clerics, who wield power and influence in the judiciary and education sectors, have also spoken out in the past against women driving, playing sports or entering the workforce. They argue such acts corrupt society and lead to sin. One Saudi cleric even stated in 2013 that driving could affect a woman's ovaries and hurt her fertility. That same year, around 150 clerics and religious scholars held a rare protest outside the Saudi king's palace against efforts by women seeking the right to drive. Women in Saudi Arabia have long had to rely on male relatives to get to work or run errands, complicating government efforts to boost household incomes as lower oil prices force austerity measures. The more affluent have male drivers. In major cities, women can access ride-hailing apps such as Uber and Careem. To celebrate Tuesday's decree, several Saudi women posted images on social media deleting their ride sharing apps. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert called the move \"a great step in the right direction.\" She did not comment on whether Saudi Arabia still needs to do more to ensure full rights for its female citizens. Lori Boghardt, a Gulf specialist at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said the change is yet another sign that the crown prince is intent on adopting social reforms that will transform the kingdom. \"Today it's especially clear that this includes moves that've long been thought of by Saudis as politically risky,\" she said.",

            "article_content": "CBS News has confirmed special counsel Robert Mueller has asked the White House for documents relating to President Trump's actions since taking office. Sources with direct knowledge of the Mueller inquiry and its current request for documents confirm the documents are tied to former national security adviser Michael Flynn's firing, CBS News' Major Garrett reports. The documents are also tied to the firing of FBI Director James Comey, an Oval Office meeting between a Mr. Trump with Russian officials and any White House involvement in Mr. Trump's son Donald Trump Jr.'s campaign meeting with various Russians in 2016. The sources said the requests were in the hands of the White House for several weeks and there has been a energetic effort bordering on frantic to comply with the investigators' request for relevant documents. The pursuit of responsive documents has strained relations among some White House attorneys with some lawyers -- chief among them Ty Cobb -- pushing for full disclosure in hopes of expediting the end of the probe and others, led by White House Counsel Don McGahn, seeking to evaluate each document release through the institutional lens of protecting presidential prerogatives now and in the future. The disclosure of Mueller's specific requests has rattled the White House legal team. But these two camps are in agreement in what they perceive will be the likely outcome of Mueller's probe -- that it will not yield any charges against the president or top officials. \"There have been leaks in this story,\" said one source close to the White House process. \"It is fair to say this one did not come from Mueller's side. And this is not helpful to the White House. It rattles people.\" Extracting positive implications of the Mueller probe has been a challenge for those sympathetic to the White House. The interpretation after this disclosure is that Mueller's team is, in terms of its White House engagement, staying within the scope of the Russia election probe and not seeking documents about past financial transactions, documents or business relationships. The White House and Cobb declined to comment on any specifics of the Mueller investigation. Cobb merely repeated his long-standing pledge that the White House will \"respect the integrity\" Mueller's investigation and \"cooperate fully.\" Mueller's request was first reported by The New York Times. The request for documents from Mr. Trump's time as president represents a shift in the inquiry's focus to Mr. Trump's behavior since starting his term in the White House. The Times reported that in recent weeks, the special counsel has requested information on 13 different areas Mueller's team hopes to investigate. In response, Trump administration lawyers have begun searching through emails and seeking other documents relating to Mueller's request.  Cobb, Mr. Trump's lawyer responsible for managing the multiple Russia investigations led by congressional committees, intelligence agencies and the special counsel, told Mueller's office that he will turn over several documents this week, according to the Times.  \"We can't comment on any specific requests being made or our conversations with the special counsel,'' Cobb told the Times. Blair Guild is a politics reporter and video producer for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "In his first major address to the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, President Trump delivered his harshest warning yet to the North Korean regime, saying it risked \"total destruction\" if it continues its pursuit of nuclear weapons.\u00a0 \"The U.S. has great strength and patience but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea,\" said Mr. Trump to the UNGA. The president also said of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, \"Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and his regime.\" It's a\u00a0nickname he has recently started using in tweets.\u00a0 Mr. Trump said the regime's \"reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles\" threatens the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life.\u00a0 \"It is an outrage that some nations would not only trade with such a regime -- but arm, supply and financially support a regime that imperils the world with nuclear conflict.\" \u00a0 Describing the North as a \"depraved regime,\" Mr. Trump blamed it for \"the starvation deaths of millions, and for imprisonment torture and oppression of countless more,\" and he cited the case of American student Otto Warmbier, who died after being held in North Korean captivity.\u00a0 NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told CBS that Mr. Trump's comments toward North Korea was yet another example of his \"strong rhetoric and strong language.\"\u00a0 \"We've seen the international community condemning North Korea of the developing of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles, the importance of working together to make sure that North Korea bounds it missile program and refrains from more testing, it is a threat toward all of us and it requires a global response,\" said Stoltenberg.\u00a0 He added, \"there's no easy way out, no easy answer\" but that the international community needs to \"find something in between doing nothing\" and using military force. \u00a0 As anticipated, Mr. Trump also spoke in harsh terms about Iran and the nuclear deal signed by his predecessor. He called it \"one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the U.S. has ever entered\" and deemed it an \"embarrassment to the U.S.\" In an indictment of the international body, Mr. Trump said the Iran nuclear deal provides a \"cover for the potential construction of a nuclear program\" in the region, an outcome that the U.S. would not tolerate. \"We cannot let a murderer's regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles, and we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program.\" It was a signal from the president that he is seriously considering either pulling out of or renegotiating the Iran nuclear deal, CBS News' Margaret Brennan observed.\u00a0 The Iran deal is agreement some of America's strongest allies have signed, and they have said that it cannot be renegotiated. Mr. Trump also framed his campaign's \"America First\" ideology as American sovereignty in this speech. He told world leaders that the U.S. \"can no longer be taken advantage of\" in deals where the U.S. \"gets nothing in return.\" \u00a0 \"In America, the people govern the people rule and the people are sovereign,\" said Mr. Trump, adding that he was elected to serve the people of his country.\u00a0 \"As long as I hold this office I will defend America's interests above all else but in fulfilling our obligations to our own nations we also realize its in everyone's interest to seek a \u00a0future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous and secure,\" he added. On Monday, the president kicked off his week of diplomacy with a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, where he promised the leader that there was a \"good chance\" for peace in the Middle East. He also sat with French President Emmanuel Macron and lauded the president for his impressive military parade on Bastille Day.\u00a0 In his final words to the body, Mr. Trump said, \"Our hope is a world of proud independent nations that embrace their duties, seek friendship, respect others and make common cause int he greatest shared interest of all, a future of peace for the people of this wonderful earth.\" He says that the true vision and mission of the UN and the message to the world will be that we will \"fight together, sacrifice together and stand together\" for peace, freedom, justice, family for humanity. \"Maduro has inflicted terrible pain and suffering on good people of his country,\" said Mr. Trump of the dictator. Mr. Trump calls the unfair election in the region and the starvation of freedom of its people \"completely unacceptable and we cannot stand by and watch. We and all other share a goal that goal is to help them regain their freedom recover their country and restore their democracy.\" His remark that \"the problem is that socialism has been faithfully implemented in Venezuela\" receives very little applause or positive reaction from the body. \u00a0 Powerful people in this room under the guidance of the UN can solve many of these vicious and complex problems,\" said Mr. Trump, but he noted that the UN \"can be a much more accountable and effective advocate for human dignity and freedom around the world.\" In harsh tones to the international body, Mr. Trump says the Iran nuclear deal provides a \"cover for the potential construction of a nuclear program\" in the region.\u00a0 The president says the U.S. can't abide by an agreement if Iran continues destabilizing activities.\u00a0 Calling it \"one of the worst and one-sided transactions the U.S. has ever entered into\", Mr. Trump warns the assembly that \"you haven't heard the last on it, believe me.\" The president calls the North Koreans a \"depraved regime\" and says they are responsible for the starvation deaths of millions, and for imprisonment torture and oppression of countless more\" citing the death of American student Otto Warmbier.\u00a0 Mr. Trump says their \"reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles\" threatens the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life. He chastised nations would trade or financially support \"a country that imperils the world with nuclear conflict.\"\u00a0 In a warning to North Korean leaders, whom Mr. Trump called a \"band of criminals,\" he said the U.S. has\"great patience\" but that America will have no choice but to \"totally destroy\" North Korea if the regime continues its provocations.\u00a0 The president referred to dictator Kim Jong Un by a new nickname -- \"Rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.\"\u00a0 \"We must protect our nations their interests and their futures. We must reject threats to sovereignty from the Ukraine to the south China Sea,\" says Mr. Trump, publicly recognizing \u00a0the global threats posed to the U.S. and abroad.\u00a0 He adds, \"We must uphold respect for law, borders and culture and the peaceful engagement these allow and just as founders of this body intended we must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil and terror.\" \"As long as I hold this office, I will defend America's interest above all else but in fulfilling our obligations to our own nations we also realize its in everyone's interest to seek a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous and secure,\" Mr. Trump says.\u00a0 He says that \"America does more than speak for the values expressed in the UN charter\", adding that Americans have paid the \"ultimate price to defend our freedom and the freedom of many nations.\" \"In America, the people govern the people rule and the people are sovereign,\" says Mr. Trump, saying he was elected to serve the people of his country.\u00a0 Mr. Trump delivers an \"America First\" message to the international body, saying, \"I will always put America first -- just like you -- as the leaders of your countries will always -- and should -- always put your countries first.\" \"We do not expect diverse counties to share the same cultures or system of government but we expect all nations to uphold these sovereign duties, to respect the interests of its own people and rights of every other sovereign nation.\" Mr. Trump embraces the idea of \"mutual respect\" between nations to allow \"individuals to flourish in the fullness of the life intended by God.\" \"Authoritarian powers seek to collapse the values, the system, and alliance that prevented conflicted and tilted the world toward freedom since WWII,\" says Mr. Trump of the threats to the international body. Mr. Trump shifts to addressing poverty and providing a world \"free from violence, hated and fear\" for children the world over.\u00a0 President Trump tweets about his \"big day\" at the United Nations, mentioning \"many good things, and some tricky ones, happening.\"\u00a0 Big day at the United Nations - many good things, and some tricky ones, happening. We have a great team. Big speech at 10:00 A.M. While the president writes that his speech will take place at 10:00 AM, Mr. Trump is slated to speak 4th in line in this morning's plenary sessions. Exact timing will depend on how long the leaders before him speak, but he is anticipated to being his address at 10:30 AM ET.\u00a0 Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

Mr. Trump has been attacking another GOP senator up for reelection in 2018, Sen. Jeff Flake, of Arizona, calling him \"weak on borders, weak on crimes.\" The president praised Kelli Ward for entering the GOP primary against Flake, saying it was \"Great to see\" that she was running against him, and he also reportedly met with other potential challengers earlier this week in Phoenix.\u00a0 CBS News' Katiana Krawchenko contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "President Trump taunted the news media at his rally in Phoenix\u00a0Tuesday night\u00a0with accusations of divisiveness that, since Charlottesville, Republicans, Democrats and business leaders have laid at his feet. \"They are trying to take away our history and our heritage, you see that,\" Mr. Trump said of the media. Mr. Trump's deflection and grievance are aimed at keeping the third of the country still on his side energized and angry, reports CBS News chief White House correspondent Major Garrett. The \"us\" against \"them\" strategy targets Senate Republicans like Jeff Flake and John McCain. Both of them endured indirect fire from the bully pulpit in Phoenix. Mr. Trump spoke about Flake first.\u00a0 \"Nobody wants me to talk about him, nobody knows who the hell he is,\" the president said of Flake. He then indirectly fired at McCain. \"We are going to get rid of Obamacare. I will never stop -- one vote,\" Mr Trump said. The president even rattled GOP congressional leadership by threatening to shut down the government next month if he doesn't get funding for the border wall. \"If we have to close down our government we are building that wall,\" Mr. Trump said. That threat sounded all the more bizarre considering the long history of campaign promises that Mexico would pay for the wall. When asked about a potential shutdown on Wednesday, Speaker Paul Ryan said, \"I don't think a government shutdown is necessary and I don't think most people want to see a government shutdown.\" Attacking some Republicans, including a supposed ally like , is also strategic. The president needs to show his base that he's still committed to populism, despite the firing of chief strategist Steve Bannon. McConnell and the president haven't spoken in two weeks, and the senator's aides allow Mr. Trump's erratic rhetoric and GOP-bashing threaten the party's entire agenda. None of this has much effect on the president's historically low approval ratings, which remain stuck in the mid-30s -- down from the low 40s four months ago. Those who approve of Mr. Trump's performance, however, cannot be painted with the same brush, says Anthony Salvanto, CBS News' elections and surveys director. He has a core base of supporters -- accounting for about half of his total supporters -- who feel more attached to him than they do to the Republican Party, Salvanto said on \"CBS Evening News\" Wednesday. \"They vote Republican but consider themselves as Trump supporters first and foremost,\" Salvanto said. Salvanto said they are motivated because \"they believe he's fighting for their culture and way of life.\"  \"They take criticism of him personally themselves, they say, and it's only made their support firmer,\" he said. The other half of Mr. Trump's backers are what Salvanto calls \"conditional supporters.\"  \"They want policy outcomes from this president,\" he said. \"Now, they still back him, but they feel like he has to deliver in Congress with legislation. They want the tax cut, for example.\" \"These folks are much more transnational, so the question will be: at what point might they run out of patience if he can't deliver on that policy agenda?\" Salvanto said.",

            "article_content": "PHOENIX\u00a0-- Sen. John McCain's packed agenda while on break from Congress in his home state of Arizona has hardly been the schedule of a typical brain cancer patient - or even someone about to turn 81. McCain has been undergoing targeted radiation and chemotherapy treatments at the local Mayo Clinic on weekday mornings before going about his day with vigor. In the past two weeks, the Republican has discussed a development project with local mayors, given a radio interview and held a Facebook town hall. The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee outlined a military strategy for Afghanistan, attended an Arizona Diamondbacks baseball game and went hiking several times with his family. He has been active on Twitter, including condemning the white nationalist attack in Virginia while criticizing President Donald Trump's response to the violence. McCain's spokeswoman in Washington, Julie Tarallo, said the senator was not available for an interview with The Associated Press. His daughter, Meghan McCain, tweeted Friday that he had just finished his first round of chemotherapy. \"His resilience & strength is incredible,\" she wrote. \"Fight goes on, here's to small wins.\" Those who know the former POW well say they aren't surprised by McCain's upbeat and feisty approach to his latest challenge. \"This is all so characteristic of him, going back to his early days in Arizona politics,\" said Grant Woods, the state's former attorney general who served as McCain's administrative assistant while he campaigned in 1982 for a seat in Congress' lower house. \"He outworked everyone, went door-to-door all summer in 110 temperatures.\" McCain's trip home during the August congressional recess comes as other lawmakers have returned to hostile constituents amid debates in Washington over health care and other elements of the president's agenda. Despite his busy schedule, McCain has avoided town hall meetings. He has no upcoming election to worry about, having won a sixth term in November. Still, during McCain's time in Arizona, tensions have increased with Trump, who recently criticized the senator again for voting against the GOP health-care bill he backed. \"You mean Senator McCain, who voted against us getting good health care?\" Trump asked when his name came up during a news conference. Trump's remark came a day after McCain criticized him for saying both the white nationalists and counterprotesters bear responsibility for the violence last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia. The senator insisted in a tweet that \"there's no moral equivalency between racists & Americans standing up to defy hate and bigotry\" and the president should say so. Trump also has sharpened his criticism of McCain's fellow Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake in the lead-up to a Tuesday night rally Trump has planned in Phoenix, calling the senator \"WEAK\" on the border and crime. McCain's friend Woods said McCain hasn't slowed down since undergoing surgery in mid-July to remove a 2-inch (51-millimeter) blood clot in his brain and being diagnosed with an aggressive tumor called a glioblastoma. It's the same type of tumor that killed Sen. Edward M. Kennedy at age 77 in 2009 and Beau Biden, son of then-Vice President Joe Biden, at 46 in 2015. Glioblastoma is a somewhat unusual cancer, with the American Brain Tumor Association estimating only about 12,400 new cases will be diagnosed this year. McCain's natural energy aside, his upbeat attitude is typical of people who've recently had a brain tumor removed, said Dr. Michael Lawton, chairman of neurosurgery and CEO and president at Phoenix's Barrow Neurological Institute. \"They experience a lot of relief from the problems the tumor caused,\" such as headaches or seizures from pressure on the brain. Patients usually do well in the early post-operative stage, Lawton said. \"But there could be some tough things down the road,\" he added, speaking generally about typical experiences with glioblastoma because Barrow is not involved in McCain's treatment. Typical treatment of a glioblastoma involves chemotherapy and radiation to halt division of any possible remaining cancer cells and shrink any existing mass, followed by an MRI every two months to monitor for a recurrence, he said. McCain's three-week round of treatments that ended Friday forced the globe-trotter to stay near home rather than travel to meet with troops or international leaders as he normally does each August. The senator said during his Facebook appearance that after this round, doctors will \"see if there is anything additional that needs to be done.\" In the meantime, \"I feel good. I have plenty of energy.\" McCain warned friends and foes with a laugh: \"I'm coming back!\" Survival amid seemingly unsurmountable odds has been a constant in the life of this son and grandson of four-star admirals. As a Navy pilot, McCain lived through a July 1967 fire that killed 134 sailors aboard the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal in the Gulf of Tonkin during the Vietnam War. The following October, his plane was shot down during a bombing mission over Hanoi. He endured more than five years as a prisoner of war. McCain also has survived several bouts with melanoma, a dangerous skin cancer. He was first elected to the Senate in 1986. Over his six terms, McCain carved out a reputation as a maverick and became one of the best-known figures in American politics. He ran unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000 and won it in 2008, but then lost to Barack Obama. McCain returned to Washington after his operation, entering the Senate on July 25 to a standing ovation from his colleagues. He sported a wound from the surgery above his left brow and bruising under his eye. In a widely praised speech, McCain complained to his fellow senators they had been \"getting nothing done\" because of partisanship and called the U.S. health care system a \"mess.\" He then cast a thumbs-down vote against the latest attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare, winning praise from Democrats and scorn from the right. Michael O'Neil, an Arizona pollster who writes a political column and has a local radio show, said facing such a serious illness will likely bring McCain even greater freedom to act on his beliefs. \"All the political constraints are now gone,\" he said. The American Cancer Society says the odds of surviving for five years or more are only 4 percent for people over 55. Despite the diagnosis, the senator seems to be a man filled with gratitude as he approaches his 81st birthday on Aug. 29. \"Even those that want me to die don't want me to die right away,\" he said during his Facebook appearance. \"Thank you for everything you've done for literally the luckiest guy on Earth.\"",

            "article_content": " \r\n\tThe statue of Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville, Virginia, was the focus of an emotional debate in the state's Republican primary election weeks before it became a flashpoint in the nation's struggle over race.\r\n \r\n\tCorey Stewart, an outsider candidate for governor sometimes compared to President Donald Trump, seized on possible removal of the Confederate general's memorial as an \"attempt to destroy traditional America.\" Stewart, who said in an interview Tuesday that such an action \"hits people in the gut,\" found unexpectedly strong support, forced his main opponent to defend the statue and almost won.\r\n \r\n\tNow the fight over \"traditional America\" is throwing a spotlight on the Republican Party's struggle with race in the age of Trump. The deadly white supremacist rally against removal of the Lee statue served as a painful example of the uncomfortable alignment between some in the party's base and the far-right fringe. But despite the party's talk of inclusiveness and minority outreach, it's clear white fears continue to resonate with many in the GOP base. Politicians willing to exploit those issues are often rewarded with support. One big beneficiary, critics say, has been the president himself.\r\n \r\n\tA crowd of protesters in Charlottesville confronted a man holding a confederate flag on Tuesday at the site of the Robert E. Lee statue where white supremacists rallied last weekend.\r\n \r\n\tFor those critics, on both the left and right, Mr.\u00a0Trump's response to Charlottesville was a glaring example. On Saturday, he denounced hatred and violence on \"many sides,\" seeming to assign blame equally to counter-demonstrators as well as hate groups protesting the proposed removal of the statue. He waited until Monday to specifically name the groups he was condemning -- the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists.\r\n \r\n\tOn Tuesday, he was back to assigning partial blame to those protesting the white supremacists.\r\n \r\n\t\"I think there's blame on both sides,\" Mr. Trump charged in a fiery Trump Tower press conference. He added, \"There are two sides to a story.\"\r\n \r\n\t\"Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch,\" Mr. Trump continued. \"Those people were also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee.\"\r\n \r\n\tFor Republicans who hoped the president might use the moment to send a new message about racism and their party, Mr. Trump failed the test.\r\n \r\n\t\"We have reached a defining moment,\" New Hampshire GOP chair Jennifer Horn said. \"We, as Republicans, every single one of us, needs to speak up and make it very clear that this is not our party, these are not our values.\"\r\n \r\n\tSuch moments have the potential to undermine years of attempts to portray the party as more welcoming to minority voters.\r\n \nThe Republican National Committee, led by Mr. Trump's former chief of staff Reince Priebus, released an exhaustive report in 2013 noting that the GOP's traditional base of older, white voters was becoming a smaller and smaller portion of the electorate in America. \"If we want ethnic minority voters to support Republicans, we have to engage them and show our sincerity,\" the RNC wrote.\r\n \r\n\tYet Republican officeholders, including the president, have found success by seizing on semi-hidden \"dog whistle\" rhetoric and policies largely designed to appeal to whites.\r\n \r\n\t-- Across the Midwest, Mr. Trump and others have appealed to suburban white voters by decrying a rise in urban violence, even as statistics show violent crime is down in many cities.\r\n \r\n\t-- With no evidence of widespread voter fraud, Republicans nationwide have promoted voter ID laws that several courts determined discriminate against minority voters.\r\n \r\n\t-- Mr. Trump's promise to build a massive wall along the southern border resonates with conservatives across the West and even in overwhelmingly white Northeastern states where Republicans fear the influx of illegal Hispanic immigrants.\r\n \r\n\t-- And, particularly in the South, some conservatives continue fight to preserve symbols of a Confederate Army that fought for Southern states' rights to continue slavery. The relics are simultaneously denounced as symbols of oppression by most blacks and celebrated as marks of Southern pride by many whites.\r\n \nThis week in Alabama, three Republicans running in Tuesday's special U.S. Senate primary demonstrated the careful tiptoeing politicians do around the subject.\r\n \r\n\tRep. Mo Brooks generally bemoaned \"bigotry.\" Former Alabama Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore rejected \"violence and hatred.\" Sen. Luther Strange, appointed to the seat when Mr. Trump tapped Jeff Sessions as attorney general, made no reference to racial motivations at all.\r\n \r\n\tBrooks and Strange also expressed support for Mr. Trump's remarks, and Strange seemed to echo the president's assertion that \"many sides\" were at fault, as he encouraged \"Americans to stand together in opposition to those who encourage hate or promote violence.\" Mr. Trump recently endorsed Strange.\r\n \r\n\tThe careful language reflects a political reality in a state where nearly all Republican votes come from white voters, says David Mowery, an Alabama-based political consultant who has worked for Republicans and Democrats. That doesn't mean Republicans actively pursue racist votes, he said, but sometimes it means they take the most cautious path to avoid controversy.\r\n \r\n\t\"I don't think here that any Republican benefits by talking about it or is necessarily hurt by not talking about it,\" he said.\r\n \r\n\tFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, now Mr. Trump's representative to the United Nations, said as recently as 2014 that the Confederate battle flag should fly at the state Capitol. She changed course two summers ago only after a white supremacist who was photographed holding a Confederate flag murdered nine black people inside a South Carolina church. About the same time, then-Gov. Robert Bentley of Alabama removed Confederate banners from a Confederate monument outside his office, though the monument remains.\r\n \r\n\tIn this year's Virginia primary for the Republicans' candidate for governor, outsider Stewart lost to establishment favorite Ed Gillespie, but by less than 2 percentage points. On Sunday, Gillespie attended church in Charlottesville and minced no words in naming names and urging those responsible for the violence to take their \"vile hatred\" out of the state.\r\n \r\n\t\"We have stared down racism and Nazism and white supremacy before, and we will stare it down again,\" the Republican candidate for governor told a local TV station.\r\n \r\n\tHis campaign later added that Gillespie continues to oppose removal of confederate statues, but \"believes it is an issue best resolved at the local level.\"\r\n \r\n\tStewart is now running for the Senate in 2018.\r\n",

Hard to believe that with 24/7 #Fake News on CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, NYTIMES & WAPO, the Trump base is getting stronger! He first tweeted about \"the failing @nytimes,\" which he said \"made every wrong prediction about me including my big election win.\" He claimed the Times \"apologized,\" though there's no evidence that that happened. Mr. Trump then tweeted about how \"the Fake News Russian collusion story, record Stock Market, border security, military strength, jobs...Supreme Court pick, economic enthusiasm, deregulation & so much more have driven the Trump base even closer together. \" The president said he is \"working hard\" from New Jersey and will head to New York next week \"for more meetings.\" He was seen\u00a0 over the weekend on the golf course.  Mr. Trump continued to tweet by slamming Sen.

            "article_content": "Hours after it was revealed that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is using a grand jury in the Russia investigation, President Trump stood before thousands of his strongest supporters nearly 300 miles away in Huntington, West Virginia.  In the state Mr. Trump won handily in November, Democratic Gov. Jim Justice announced he is switching to the Republican party\u00a0on Thursday night at the rally. Justice said the Democratic Party \"walked away\" from him, before defending the president on the Russia controversy. \"Today I will tell you with lots of prayers and with lots of thinking,\" Justice told the crowd. \"Today I tell you as West Virginians, I can't help you anymore being a Democrat governor. So tomorrow, I will be changing my registration to Republican.\"  The West Virginia governor -- who seemingly took a shot at former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus by saying the country had a new chief of staff whose name people can pronounce in John Kelly -- sidelined the Russia story.  \"Have we not heard enough about the Russians?\" Justice said. \"I mean, to our God in heaven above, think about it! The stock market's at 22,000. And this country has hope, and we're on our way.\"  Mr. Trump said the only reason Russia is a focus is because Democrats cannot accept his win.  \"We didn't win because of Russia. We won because of you,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Have you seen any Russians in West Virginia or Ohio or Pennsylvania? Are there any Russians here tonight?\" the president said.  Instead, Mr. Trump said prosecutors should be focused on finding Hillary Clinton's 33,000 missing emails. The president has sternly and publicly criticized his own Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, for not going after the former secretary of state, even though Mr. Trump after the election told the New York Times he didn't feel strongly about the issue and didn't want to pursue charges against his former competitor. The president also touted his administration's desire to invest an additional $1 trillion in the nation's infrastructure, and curb the number of legal immigrants allowed in the country. Mr. Trump said he wants to prohibit immigrants from going on welfare for five years, a line he gave at a previous rally in Iowa last month. But that's already a provision in current law, something the White House said the president knew after that rally. It's unclear why the president repeated the line. As trouble swirls at home, Mr. Trump has taken to the skies and to the stage to speak to his supporters, blasting the \"fake news\" media, disparaging the \"witch hunt\" Russia investigation and touting his purported successes so far. Thursday's rally marked his seventh since taking office in January. As the president faces blowback on Russia, the GOP's failure to pass health care legislation before the August recess, and even leaked calls in which Mr. Trump admitted to Mexico's president\u00a0that building a border wall was of secondary importance, he may need that support more than ever.  At the rally, the president's daughter-in-law Lara Trump decired the \"crazy story about Russia.\"  \"It's so crazy, you have no idea,\" she said. Mr. Trump visited West Virginia last week as well, when he touted his electoral college win and criticized his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, before the Boy Scouts of America at a national jamboree. The head of the Boy Scouts, Mike Surbaugh, issued a statement apologizing for the speech.\u00a0  Mr. Trump fueled even more controversy by claiming the head of the Boy Scouts called him to say the speech was the greatest his organization had ever heard. Later, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders conceded Mr. Trump\u00a0only spoke to members of Boy Scout leadership in person after the speech.\u00a0  Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "By Anthony Salvanto, Kabir Khanna, Jen De Pinto, Fred Backus Six months in, President Donald Trump's strongest backers like seeing him fight his chosen opponents: they want the president to call out those he believes disloyal, do even more to make Democrats mad, fight with the mainstream media, and feel he's taking on \"people who deserve it.\" But the combativeness they applaud seems precisely what most others dislike. And that -- along with declining personal evaluations -- is costing the president potential support, even as many give him credit for an improving economy, according to a new Nation Tracker poll released Sunday. The president's overall ratings on the metrics of being \"presidential\" and \"effective\" remain down, and today many of his softer and would-be supporters feel he creates unnecessary \"conflict and drama,\" and most of his detractors -- and most Americans overall -- describe what they see from the White House as \"chaos.\" The nationwide trend in support, comparing today to the initial Nation Tracker study at the beginning of the president's term, is a slow drift in the direction of opposition. Resister ranks have increased over time (six points from the start of the administration) and the strongest supporter ranks have thinned slightly (down four points from the start.) The big gaps between the groups are defined by very different personal ratings of the president and how he's handling himself in office. And things could become even more intractable: those on the furthest ends -- the strongest backers and strongest opponents \u2013 are more likely to strongly believe their way of life is at stake. President Trump's most ardent backers -- who call themselves supporters, period, and whom we've labeled Believers since the start of this ongoing panel study -- remain connected and loyal to the president by what seems a deep cultural and personal link, feeling he \"fights for people\" like them and speaks in a way they can relate to. They're the only group, among the segments in this study, where a majority wants the president to do\u00a0more\u00a0tweeting. A majority of these Americans describe what they're seeing from the White House as \"great\" and overwhelmingly feel the country, and their culture, are safer now. Their loyalty -- which they say the president deserves -- is to Donald Trump over other political parties and labels like conservative or Republican. But this core base has shrunk a bit as it intensifies -- down now to 18 percent from the 22 percent where it started in February. They like him both personally and politically, but softer supporters do not. In a signal of how much culture and national issues may matter to the Believers even over their own finances, they are more likely to say the nation is safer and the borders are more secure than to say their own economic situation has improved under this president. Demographically, they are also much older than other support groups. Conditional supporters -- who back him but say he must deliver what they want -- are still with the president, but increasingly call him distracted, and much less likely to call him effective than they were this spring, and less likely than believers to think he's gotten things done so far, though most do. They're more apt than believers to say Mr. Trump is starting unnecessary conflict and drama. They want to see less fighting and \"taking on\" other groups, and more of Mr. Trump working across the aisle; more focus on policy items like infrastructure. Most of them do not think the \"swamp\" is being drained. What keeps them attached? They're attached to his policies -- which they like -- more so than to the president, personally. But despite the critiques they also say they remain\u00a0patient\u00a0-- in fact, patience is one thing that distinguishes \"conditionals\" from other people who don't want the fighting but who've now become curious opponents. And most are rooting for him to succeed. They give the president credit for the economy. The question for them, it seems, is whether they'll ultimately get all they want. The people who started in February as supporters, but have drifted away to become curious opponents today, say things have gone worse than expected so far. Opponents who are potential supporters -- we've labeled them curious because they say they still might consider the president, but are not with him now -- say they are neither rooting for nor against him at this point. They disapprove of him personally, because they feel he isn't making their own prospects any better. They're more likely to describe themselves as growing impatient than being out of patience yet. Personal views of the president take a big downward turn as people go from Conditional supports to curious opponents. The curious cite Mr. Trump's own personal behavior and comments as the main reason they are against him, far ahead of not keeping his promises. For them his rating on being \"presidential\" has declined five points from May. Most don't think he's gotten any meaningful policy things done, and this dovetails with their description of him as distracted. Like both supporters and opponents of the president, they want to see him negotiate with Democrats more. The curious are more likely to call themselves independent than to align with either of the two major parties. Importantly, most also did not vote in the 2016 presidential election. As the ranks of the curious have declined during the course of the administration (one might now even label them skeptical) those who have left have become resisters, not supporters. Those who moved into the resister ranks since February describe what they see as \"frightening\" and \"chaos.\" Back in February, they said they would decide whether or not to support the president in part by how he handled himself in office. Today, they voice a strong dislike of President Trump personally. Health care may have had some impact on all this. Those who disapproved of the president's handling of health care overwhelmingly felt he was not fighting for their economic interests, more generally. Finally, the ranks of his staunchest opponents -- who we call resisters in this study -- have grown, due in part to former supporters who describe themselves as out of patience, and those in this group overwhelmingly (three in four) call what they're seeing \"frightening\" -- a sentiment that may, in turn, be exactly what the core supporters want them to feel.\u00a0 Most resisters \u2013 eight in ten - at least somewhat believe the fundamental matter of how the country's democracy works is at stake today, the highest of any group. They are also distinguished from curious by their desire for what will happen. Believing so much is at stake, nine in 10 resisters are hoping President Trump does\u00a0not\u00a0succeed, because they think the country will be better off if he didn't accomplish what he wants to. The main reason resisters say they are against Mr. Trump is that they feel he's harming the country and its democracy \u2013 more than two-thirds do - which is different from the curious, who point to Trump's personal behavior as the reason they oppose him. They don't see much outreach from the president. Nearly all of the resisters don't think the president speaks for them. And they don't see him as fighting for people like them. Two-thirds of them say the first six months of the Trump presidency is worse than they expected -- far higher than the less than half of the curious who say that. They see Mr. Trump as temperamental and even dangerous. Anthony Salvanto, Ph.D., is CBS News' director of elections and surveys.

            "article_content": "Montana Governor Steve Bullock is making moves that signal a possible testing of the waters for a 2020 presidential run.  According to a New York Times report, the Democrat, who joined the nation's governors for a weekend in Rhode Island for the National Governors Association's (NGA) annual summer gathering, made remarks showing his first steps toward seeking the presidency.  \"I believe the time is right to lend my voice, the voice of someone that after getting elected has been able to govern in what's viewed as a red state,\" Bullock said. \"Some of the things that I've been able to do in Montana can also translate beyond just the state's border.\" The Times also reports that Bullock is creating a political action committee -- Big Sky Values PAC, to provide funds to allow him to meet Democratic donors, help the party's candidates and fund out-of-state electoral travels, another clear sign of Bullock's intentions to move beyond state politics.  Bullock, a lifelong Montanan who was once the state's attorney general, was elected governor in 2012.\u00a0 Bullock previously fed rumors of a run when he attended the Center for American Progress' Ideas Conference in Washington with other potential Democratic hopefuls back in May -- including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York and Virginia Governor Terry MacAuliffe.\u00a0 \"Democrats need to do a better job of showing up and making arguments even in places where people are likely to disagree,\" he said in remarks. \"It's good for democracy and it's good for our Democratic Party.\" During the summer meeting, governors participated in talks on trade, the opioid crisis, apprenticeship and work-based learning as well as cybersecurity.\u00a0 While Bullock told the Times that it was premature to talk White House goals, the governor was elected to serve as the vice chairman of the NGA while attending the Rhode Island gathering, and will be seated as the bipartisan group's chairman next summer.\u00a0 \"It's our job as governors to deliver for the people of our states. We deal with real-life, on-the-ground impacts and together, our focus remains on fighting for hard-working families in each of our states,\" Bullock said.\u00a0 Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

            "article_content": "Republican Karen Handel shattered Democrats' hopes Tuesday night to take Georgia's 6th Congressional District seat away from the GOP and turn the election into a referendum on the policies and the person of President Trump.\u00a0 So, who is she? Handel, 55, is the first woman Georgia Republicans have ever sent to Congress, an overlooked fact in the midst of Tuesday night's events. The former Georgia secretary of state lost multiple bids for higher office before winning her seat in Congress in the most expensive House race in history. In 2014, she lost a GOP primary for U.S. Senate to David Perdue, and in 2010, she narrowly lost her bid for the GOP nomination for governor.\u00a0 Handel is no stranger to Washington, D.C. It's where she was born. She grew up in nearby Upper Marlboro, Maryland, where she went to high school. According to her Premiere Speakers Bureau bio, Handel left an \"abusive home\" at 17, finishing high school and entering the workforce on her own.\u00a0 \"I've had to be tough my whole life. I moved out when I was 17 to get away from a pretty tough and difficult family environment,\" Handel said in a digital ad that ran this year.\u00a0 Handel spent some time at Prince George's Community College in Maryland and at the University of Maryland, but never graduated from college, placing her in the roughly 5 percent of members of Congress without a bachelor's degree.\u00a0 After her time at college, she worked at a Hallmark Cards store before working for Vice President Dan Quayle's wife, Marilyn Quayle.\u00a0 She and her husband, Steve Handel, who have no children, moved to the Atlanta area in the 1990s.\u00a0 In the private sector, Handel held executive management positions with CIBA Vision and the accounting firm KPMG. She also served as president and CEO of the North Fulton Chamber of Commerce.\u00a0 It was in Atlanta that Handel's career in politics really began, working as an aide in the office of then-Gov. Sonny Perdue in the early 2000s. Handel served as the chairwoman of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners from 2003 to 2006, before she was elected Georgia's first Republican secretary of state in 2006. As secretary of state, Handel implemented a controversial voter ID law, legislation other states soon copied. Handel served in that role until 2010.\u00a0 In 2012, she gained national attention when she resigned from her role as a vice president at the Susan G. Komen for the Cure, after the board decided to restore funding to Planned Parenthood. Handel wrote a book in the wake of her departure -- \"Planned Bullyhood: The Truth Behind the Headlines about the Planned Parenthood Funding Battle with Susan G. Komen for the Cure.\" On the issues, Handel is a standard conservative Republican -- she is pro-life, wants a simpler tax code, pro-border wall and supports a strong national defense, according to her website. During her 2014 Senate bid, Handel said she would be more like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) than Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky). Handel is a fan of the Indianapolis Colts, an NFL team that left Baltimore, Maryland, in the 1980s. Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, issued a stern warning to President Donald Trump in the wake of a turbulent few weeks for the White House.  \"Stop tweeting, think about what you say because you're reflecting in a big pool,\" Feinstein said Sunday on \"Face the Nation.\" \"The Senate and the House have to feel a sense of stability from day to day. We can't feel the anxiety that goes with not knowing what may happen next, what may be said next. And we need to depend on our president for truth. That is really important,\" Feinstein added.\u00a0 It's also important for the American people to know what could be behind \"some of the actions that have recently been taken,\" Feinstein said. And she has questions for former FBI Director James Comey, who was recently fired.\u00a0 \"What I want to know from him is how many times did he meet with the president. Or talk with the president on the phone. What was he asked by the president? Was he asked to in any way alter the investigation? What was he asked about General Flynn? Questions like that,\" said Feinstein. Feinstein's comments come after a series of dramatic events, including the appointment of former FBI Director Robert Mueller to oversee the Trump-Russia probe, and revelations of a Comey memo that said Mr. Trump pressed him to drop the investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.  When asked if the investigation now goes beyond the question of Russia and the Trump campaign and includes a question of a cover-up, Feinstein said, \"Well, I think that's right. It does. I know what the president told me when he called to say that he was firing him. And that turned out not to be the reason.\" Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, had repeatedly called for public hearings to find out the details surrounding Mr. Trump's reported request to end the Flynn investigation.  Following the appointment of Mueller as a special counsel in charge of the Russia investigation, Feinstein applauded Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's pick, calling the former FBI director \"respected\" and \"talented.\" \"The appointment of Bob Mueller as special counsel for the Russian investigation is a good first step to get to the bottom of the many questions we have about Russian interference in our election and possible ties to the president,\" Feinstein said in a previous statement. \"Bob was a fine U.S. attorney, a great FBI director and there's no better person who could be asked to perform this function.  Comey has recently agreed to testify in public before Senate Intelligence Committee members to discuss the events surrounding his firing, a move Feinstein says is important in order to \"put the facts before the American people.\" \"The big fact is: Did the president fire Comey because of his investigation and he was worried about what the investigation might conclude? If so, that borders on a very serious charge. So we need to flesh that out. We need to see what the response is. And it's got to come from Director Comey himself,\" said Feinstein.\u00a0 Feinstein was asked about comments that -- according to\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0-- Mr. Trump made in a meeting with Russians. Mr. Trump reportedly called Comey a \"nut job\" and said his firing relieved \"great pressure\" on him -- comments that Feinstein called a \"horrible thing for a president to say.\" \"Former Director Comey is no way, shape, or form a nut job,\" she said. \"He's a very strong man. He's very principled man. I happen to believe he made a couple of mistakes. I suspect he thinks he's made a couple of mistakes. Whether that deserved his termination or not is not up to me. The fact is he has been terminated. But the reason for the termination has really not been ferreted out. And that's what has to be before the American people clear and distinct.\" Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON - Some of the staunchest resistance to President Donald Trump's threats to abandon the North American Free Trade Agreement could come from some of his staunchest supporters: farmers. Farm Country is on red alert over the Trump regime's position on the pact, which the president has characterized as a job-killing disaster. NAFTA has widened access to Mexican and Canadian markets, boosting U.S. farm exports and benefiting many farmers. U.S. Trade Rep. Robert Lighthizer on Thursday formally notified Congress of the administration's plan to renegotiate NAFTA. That could put Mr. Trump, who has sent mixed signals on his plans for NAFTA, at odds with many farmers. A large majority of rural Americans backed his presidential bid, drawn to his calls to slash environmental rules, strengthen law enforcement and replace Obamacare. \"Mr. President, America's corn farmers helped elect you,\" Wesley Spurlock of the National Corn Growers Association warned in a statement last month after White House aides signaled that Mr. Trump would deliver on his vow to abandon the treaty. \"Withdrawing from NAFTA would be disastrous for American agriculture.\" Within hours, Trump softened his stance. He wouldn't actually dump NAFTA, he said. He'd first try to forge a more advantageous deal with Mexico and Canada. Farmers have been relieved that NAFTA has survived so far. Yet many remain nervous about where Trump's trade policy will lead. As a candidate, Trump defined his \"America First\" stance as a means to fight unfair foreign competition. He blamed unjust deals for swelling U.S. trade gaps and stealing factory jobs. But NAFTA and other deals have been good for American farmers, who stand to lose if Trump ditches the pact or ignites a trade war. The United States has enjoyed a trade surplus in farm products since at least 1967, government data show. Last year, farm exports exceeded imports by $20.5 billion. \"You don't start off trade negotiations ... by picking fights with your trade partners that are completely unnecessary,\" says Aaron Lehman, a fifth-generation Iowa farmer who produces corn, soybeans, oats and hay. I will renegotiate NAFTA. If I can\u2019t make a great deal, we\u2019re going to tear it up. We\u2019re going to get this economy running again. #Debate Many farmers worry that Trump's policies will jeopardize their exports just as they face weaker crop and livestock prices. \"It comes up pretty quickly in conversation,\" says Blake Hurst, a corn and soybean farmer in northwestern Missouri's Atchison County. That county's voters backed Trump more than 3-to-1 in the election but now feel \"it would be better if the rhetoric (on trade) was a little less strident,\" says Hurst, president of the Missouri Farm Bureau. Trump's main argument against NAFTA and other pacts was that they exposed American workers to unequal competition with low-wage workers in countries like Mexico and China. NAFTA did lead some American manufacturers to move factories and jobs to Mexico. But since it took effect in 1994 and eased tariffs, annual farm exports to Mexico have jumped nearly five-fold to about $18 billion. Mexico is the No. 3 market for U.S. agriculture, notably corn, soybeans and pork. \"The trade agreements that we've had have been very beneficial,\" says Stephen Censky, CEO of the American Soybean Association. \"We need to take care not to blow the significant gains that agriculture has won.\" The U.S. has run a surplus in farm trade with Mexico for 20 of the 23 years since NAFTA took effect. Still, the surpluses with Mexico became deficits in 2015 and 2016 as global livestock and grain prices plummeted and shrank the value of American exports, notes Joseph Glauber of the International Food Policy Research Institute. Mexico has begun to seek alternatives to U.S. food because, as its agriculture secretary, Jose Calzada Rovirosa, said in March, Trump's remarks on trade \"have injected uncertainty\" into the agriculture business. Once word had surfaced that Trump was considering pulling out of NAFTA, Sonny Perdue, two days into his job as the president's agriculture secretary, hastened to the White House with a map showing areas that would be hurt most by a pullout, overlapped with many that voted for Trump. \"I tried to demonstrate to him that in the agricultural market, sometimes words like 'withdraw' or 'terminate' can have a major impact on markets,\" Perdue said in an interview with The Associated Press. \"I think the president made a very wise decision for the benefit of many agricultural producers across the country\" by choosing to remain in NAFTA. Farmers know they're frequently the first casualties of trade wars. Many recall a 2009 trade rift in which China responded to U.S. tire tariffs by imposing tariffs on U.S. chicken parts. And Mexico slapped tariffs on U.S. goods ranging from ham to onions to Christmas trees in 2009 to protest a ban on Mexican trucks crossing the border. The White House declined to comment on farmers' fears that Trump's trade policy stands to hurt them. But officials say they've sought to ease concerns, by, for example, having Agriculture Secretary Perdue announce a new undersecretary to oversee trade and foreign agricultural affairs. Lighthizer's two-page letter offered few details about what changes the administration would seek in the 23-year-old pact. He told reporters on Thursday that any new deal should do a better job of protecting U.S. factory workers and should be updated to reflect new technologies. Many farmers are still hopeful about the Trump administration. Some, for example, applaud his plans to slash environmental rules that they say inflate the cost of running a farm. Some also hold out hope that the author of \"The Art of the Deal\" will negotiate ways to improve NAFTA. One such way might involve Canada. NAFTA let Canada shield its dairy farmers from foreign competition behind tariffs and regulations but left at least one exception - an American ultra-filtered milk used in cheese. When Canadian farmers complained about the cheaper imports, Canada changed its policy and effectively priced ultra-filtered American milk out of the market. \"Canada has made business for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin and other border states very difficult,\" Trump tweeted last month. \"We will not stand for this. Watch!\" Canada has made business for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin and other border states very difficult. We will not stand for this. Watch! Some U.S. cattle producers would also like a renegotiated NAFTA to give them something the current version doesn't: The right to label their product \"Made in America.\" In 2015, the World Trade Organization struck down the United States' country-of-origin labeling rules as unfair to Mexico and Canada. Many still worry that Trump's planned overhaul of American trade policy is built to revive manufacturing and that farming remains an afterthought. \"So much of the conversation in the campaign had been in Detroit or in Indiana\" and focused on manufacturing jobs,\" said Kathy Baylis, an economist at the University of Illinois. The importance of American farm exports \"never made it into the rhetoric.\"",

            "article_content": "President Trump flatly denied Thursday during a joint press conference with Colombian President Juan Manual Santos that he told now-fired FBI Director James Comey to end an investigation into embattled national security adviser Michael Flynn. \"No, no. Next question,\" said Mr. Trump, asked if he ever told Comey to drop the FBI probe.  The press conference marked Mr. Trump's first news conference in a week of rapid developments for the White House, including reports that the White House was aware Flynn was under investigation before the president's inauguration, that Mr. Trump possibly revealed classified information to Russian diplomats, and that fired FBI Director James Comey said in a memo that Mr. Trump asked him to drop the FBI investigation into Flynn. The press conference was also the president's first public appearance after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced the appointment of former FBI Director Robert Mueller to be special counsel to investigate any ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.  Mr. Trump said he could \"respect\" Mueller's appointment, but described the ongoing Russia saga as a \"witch hunt.\" \"Well I respect the move, but the entire thing has been a witch hunt...\" Mr. Trump said, adding that a special counsel appointment \"divides the country.\" The president also dismissed claims that he has done anything deserving criminal prosecution or impeachment over the last six months.  \"I think it's totally ridiculous,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Everybody thinks so. And again we have to get back to working our country properly so that we can take care of the problems that we have. We have plenty of problems. We've done a fantastic job.\" Mr. Trump, still under intense scrutiny over his firing Comey, piled on criticism of the former FBI director during the press conference.  The president derided Comey's \"poor, poor performance\" when he testified before Congress two weeks ago. Comey misspoke in describing the number of emails Clinton aide Huma Abedin forwarded to the laptop of her husband, former congressman Anthony Weiner.  \"That was a poor, poor performance - so poor in fact \u00a0that I believe and you'd have to ask him because I don't like to speak for other people - but I believe that's why the Deputy Attorney General went out and wrote his very, very strong letter,\" the president said. \"And then on top of that, after the Wednesday performance by Director Comey, you had a person come and have to adjust the record which many people have never seen before because there were misstatements made.\" Originally, the White House said Mr. Trump fired Comey only after receiving a recommendation to do so last week from Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, but Mr. Trump himself later said he was going to fire Comey \"regardless\" of the DOJ's recommendation. A number of senators told reporters on Thursday, after a meeting with Rosenstein, that Rosenstein was aware Comey was going to be fired before he completed a memo outlining the justification for firing Comey. Rosenstein's memo criticized Comey's handling of the investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of state. Mr. Trump tried to focus on international issues in the press conference, as he prepares to depart for his first foreign trip as president Friday. He praised America's relationship with Colombia, and said he and Santos will work together to end the drug epidemic in the U.S. and respond to the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela. Santos said that, after meeting with Mr. Trump, he had \"no doubt\" the two countries would continue to support each other. Santos was expected to ask Mr. Trump, who is making cuts to foreign aid, to renew funding to support a peace agreement between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces.\u00a0 Follow below for updates of the press conference from earlier.\u00a0 President Trump had a very short, decisive answer when asked if he ever asked fired FBI Director James Comey to end the FBI's investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. \"No, no. Next question,\" the president said.\u00a0 The president also dubbed the question of impeachment \"totally ridiculous.\" \"I think it's totally ridiculous, everybody thinks so,\" the president said.\u00a0 He also again mentioned Rosenstein's memo, suggesting that the deputy attorney general wrote his memo in response to Comey's testimony two weeks ago about Russian interference and the presidential election.\u00a0 Comey, Mr. Trump said, \"had the very poor performance on Wednesday. That was a poor, poor performance - so poor in fact\u00a0 that I believe and you'd have to ask him because I don't like to speak for other people - but I believe that's why the Deputy Attorney General went out and wrote his very, very strong letter.\" \u00a0 Mr. Trump, asked if the appointment of former FBI director Robert Mueller to be special counsel on the FBI's Russia investigation, said the entire Russia probe has been a \"witch hunt.\"\u00a0 \"Well I respect the move, but the entire thing has been a witch hunt,\" Mr. Trump said.\u00a0 The president reiterated a comment he made earlier afternoon, saying the appointment \"divides the country.\"\u00a0 \"There is no collusion between certainly myself and my campaign, but I can always speak for myself and the Russians - zero. I think it divides the country,\" the president said. \"I think we have a very divided country because of that and many other things. So I can tell you that we want to\u00a0 bring this great country of ours together.\"\u00a0 The president added that he wants to get back to focusing on issues relevant to the country, like defeating ISIS and creating jobs.\u00a0 President Trump in the joint press conference emphasized that Colombia is a key partner in the war against drugs. Part of that fight includes building a border wall, he said.\u00a0 \"The drug epidemic is poisoning too many American lives, and we're going to stop it,\" Mr. Trump said.\u00a0 Mr. Trump called his meeting with Santos \"productive,\" as he said future meetings will be.\u00a0 Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "SAN CRISTOBAL, Venezuela -- Legions of national guardsmen and military helicopters began descending on a western Venezuela state Wednesday where an outbreak of looting and political violence left at least three people dead in as many days, raising the nationwide death toll in a wave of unrest to at least 43. Fifteen-year-old Jose Guerrero died in San Cristobal on Wednesday after going out the previous afternoon to purchase flour and being shot near a protest, authorities said. His death means the number killed in nearly two months of protests and street clashes is likely to surpass that seen in the country's last political upheaval in 2014, when 43 people died during three months of demonstrations against the socialist government. Top military commanders announced they were sending 2,000 national guardsmen and 600 troopers from special operation forces to Tachira, a mountainous state along Venezuela's border with Colombia where Guerrero and two others have been killed during protests since Monday. A rash of violence across Tachira this week has left dozens of businesses looted, 11 police stations set aflame and nervous residents scrambling to buy what food they can find. Public transportation was shut down Wednesday, many businesses closed and long lines snaked to the few operating ATMs. \"From this moment we are not going to permit any more violent or terroristic acts,\" said Jose Morantes Torres, commander of a regional defense force overseeing operations. By late Wednesday afternoon, helicopters could be seen arriving at Tachira's military airport. Hundreds of national guardsmen in green uniforms were patrolling areas where protests have taken place, while others stood in front of grocery stores and other shops and some kept watch from armored trucks. The military operation comes as President Nicolas Maduro faces mounting international pressure to hold elections and refrain from using tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters. Anti-government street mobilizations that began after the nation's Supreme Court issued a ruling stripping congress of its last powers in late March are continuing on a near-daily basis. Meanwhile, the death toll is rising at a steady clip and is likely to surpass the 2014 protest fatalities in about half the time. The growing list of casualties puts both the government and the opposition in increasingly strained positions, analysts said. Deaths, which are often captured on cellphone cameras and shared widely online, will probably further isolate Venezuela's government from international public opinion. But the bloodshed also raises the question of how much longer the opposition can call on its supporters to take the risk of going into the streets, said Christopher Sabatini, a professor at Columbia University. \"The opposition has the moral upper hand, but as long as the government refuses to yield and kill its own citizens, how much longer can this go on?\" Sabatini said. Arrests have been made in just eight of the deaths, five of which involved police officers, according to the chief prosecutor's office. Maduro's government blames the opposition for the violence, saying they are purposely fomenting unrest in order to remove him from power. Opposition leaders deny that and say heavy-handed officers and armed, pro-government militias known as \"colectivos\" are responsible. The violence in Tachira began Monday after several weeks of largely peaceful protests. That day, the minister of the nation's prison system was in San Cristobal to promote Maduro's push to resolve the crisis by convening a special assembly to rewrite Venezuela's constitution, a proposal the opposition rejects. With her arrival, residents say, also came bands of \"colectivos\" who threatened protesters. Videos shared on social media by Tachira residents show armed men in masks roaming the streets on foot and motorcycles and in some cases appearing to open fire. On Monday afternoon, Luis Alviarez, 18, and Diego Hernandez, 33, were fatally shot during separate demonstrations. Videos of both incidents were distributed online, showing the two men lying lifeless on the pavement. By Wednesday, residents in San Cristobal woke up to discover dozens of businesses had been looted. Public transportation was shut down, the state's agricultural industry - a critical provider of Venezuela's fruits and vegetables - paralyzed and people worriedly lined up at ATMs to withdraw cash. Guerrero, the latest casualty, was taken to a hospital Tuesday after being shot and died Wednesday morning after undergoing surgery, authorities said. Speaking outside a hospital, his sister lashed out at Maduro and blamed national guard officers for her brother's death. \"I hate you with all my heart,\" she said, crying. \"He was a boy of 15.\"",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0-- Some lawmakers are accusing President Donald Trump of obstruction of justice after revelations that FBI Director James Comey wrote a private account of the president asking him to shut down an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Congressional Democrats were already concerned that Trump was trying to stifle a probe into possible coordination between his campaign and Russia's election meddling by firing Comey last week. The latest development only heightened their outrage, renewing calls for a special prosecutor. And Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal said in a statement that \"we are witnessing an obstruction of justice case unfolding in real time.\" But obstruction of justice is a tricky issue both criminally and politically. And legal experts say it could be difficult to prove the president crossed a line. Some questions and answers about obstruction of justice: WHAT IS OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE? Simply put, it's preventing authorities - such as police or prosecutors - from doing the work of investigating and applying the law. WHAT IS TRUMP ACCUSED OF DOING? Comey wrote that Trump asked him to end an investigation into Flynn during a February meeting in the Oval Office. Comey, who was known to keep a paper trail of sensitive meetings, chronicled the president's request in a memo he produced soon after the conversation, according to a Comey associate who reviewed the document and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. Flynn had just been forced to resign after lying about the nature of his contacts with the Russian ambassador. The White House disputed the account of the Comey memo. IS SUCH A REQUEST OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE? Criminally speaking, obstructing justice applies to a variety of scenarios - like threatening a juror, retaliating against a witness, or impeding a grand jury proceeding - and Trump's alleged request would not fit neatly into any of them, legal experts said. \"No one would write a federal statute with this situation in mind because it's such an extraordinary situation,\" said Jens David Ohlin, a dean at Cornell University Law School. Meddling in a federal investigation could qualify as impeding a judicial proceeding under the obstruction statute. But to bring an obstruction charge, a prosecutor would have to show the president was trying to \"corruptly\" influence the investigation, and proving an improper intent can be hard. Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, said Trump would have some lines of defense. \"The president can claim he was raising an issue of concern for a longtime associate,\" Turley said. \"That doesn't mean that the question was not wildly improper, and frankly, would border on the moronic.\" BUT ISN'T THERE EVIDENCE? Comey's memos could be valuable in any obstruction investigation. \"What you have is contemporaneous documentation of Comey's recollection of what the president said,\" said Bob Bauer, who served as White House counsel under President Barack Obama. \"That's obviously a very powerful piece of evidence.\" But barring recordings, a memo still becomes a case of \"he said, she said,\" said former prosecutor Jonathan Lopez. Still, there's also a witness: Comey. \"He's around and the best evidence of what happened in that meeting would be to call him as a witness,\" said Barbara McQuade, former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan. ARE THERE OTHER POSSIBLE ACTIONS? Even if this didn't lead to a criminal conviction, such a request could add to the basis for impeachment for obstruction of justice. \"It's the whole pattern here, it's firing Comey and also directing him to end the investigation against Flynn, all of these things are done because he wants to stop an investigation from reaching the highest echelons of the administration and possibly him personally,\" Ohlin said. \"It's the type of political self-dealing that is intolerable.\" But Turley said that may not be enough. \"What we have is a memo of a president asking highly inappropriate questions of an FBI director,\" he said. \"This would be pretty thin soup for even an impeachment proceeding.\"",

            "article_content": "Tuesday's Republican runoff for the House seat Rep. Mick Mulvaney vacated to join the Trump administration has exposed a breach in the party that's so wide, some GOP voters are threatening to stay home. The two candidates are alike in many ways, but one is backed by business groups with mainstream appeal, while the other gets support from hard-right groups that reject compromise. Despite the similarities between Tommy Pope \u2014 the top vote-getter on May 2 \u2014 and Ralph Norman, who trailed him by less than 1 percent in the first round, some GOP voters say they can't fathom backing the other Republican, even against a Democrat, in the general election on June 20. South Carolina's 5th Congressional District spans 11 mostly rural counties where Republicans dominate after state GOP leaders changed the boundaries to draw it more safely under their party's control. It's the same district held by the fictional Democratic politician Frank Underwood in the first season of \"House of Cards\" on Netflix, and had been in Democratic hands for more than 100 years until Mulvaney's victory in 2010. Similar boundary shifts in many states have effectively shrunk the middle ground and made it harder for politicians to reach across party lines. It's the same in the 5th, where Norman has tried to stay on Pope's right flank through the Republican primary. Both voice support for some of President Donald Trump's policies in TV ads and campaign planks, including a border wall with Mexico and efforts to loosen regulations on businesses. Both pledged to get rid of President Obama's health care law. The main difference is who backs them: Pope, an attorney from York and the No. 2 in South Carolina's House, has the support of several high-profile state Republicans, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and dozens of law enforcement leaders, including fellow former prosecutor U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy. Norman, a real estate developer, former state House member and major backer of Nikki Haley, counts on support from the party's right flank, including the Club For Growth's political arm, Jim DeMint, and Sen. Ted Cruz, who campaigned with him Monday. Any hint of working with centrists is precisely what one Norman supporter doesn't want in Congress. \"You can work with the far left, you can work with the far right, but you can't work with the middle because you don't know how they are going to vote,\" voter Margarett Blackwell told The Associated Press, quoting advice she said she got from Mulvaney himself. Blackwell, 76, supported Pope's 2010 state House campaign, helping flip the district from Democrat to Republican. But she's so disillusioned with Pope's willingness to compromise with moderates to raise the state's gas tax for the first time in 30 years that she says stay home in June if Pope is the GOP nominee. Mike Barrow, a 71-year-old Army veteran, has the same bad feeling about Norman. \"I've got four or five friends with the same problem,\" said Barrow, saying Norman's endorsements from Washington personalities like Cruz and DeMint go against their desire to be represented by outsiders. The winner faces Democrat Archie Parnell, a former tax adviser with Goldman Sachs and staff attorney for the House Ways & Means Committee and the Department of Justice, whose top priorities are tax reform and job creation. Democratic Party Chairman Trav Robertson said he anticipates the Republican who emerges will make a sharp turn toward the middle. \"At 7:05 tomorrow night, you're going to see just how quickly either Tommy Pope or Ralph Norman become a hypocrite,\" Robertson said. \"They're going to shift all of their policies and beliefs to the center, because the 5th District is a center on the political spectrum.\"",

            "article_content": "For months, stocks rose on any hint, rumor or tweet from President Trump about his plan for tax reform. Then they got a look at it. Investors have reacted with disappointment at what they've seen of the proposal. which has drawn criticism for being short on detail. Stocks slid into the red after the plan was introduced on Wednesday and continued to trade heavily today, a far cry from the rip-roaring rally to new highs on Tuesday.\u00a0 Gluskin Sheff economist David Rosenberg said the reaction was a classic case of the \"emperor showing up without any clothes,\" referring to the one-page summary of the plan whose broad outlines were already known. \"Nearly six months after the election, the administration's tax proposals amount to less than a single side of paper,\" sniffed Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist with Capital Economics, in a client note. Another reason investors seem underwhelmed: The math doesn't work, at least not without saddling the U.S. with politically unpalatable debt. Slashing the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent will cost $2.4 trillion over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Oxford Economics estimates the plan would boost the deficit from roughly 3 percent of GDP to more than 7 percent in the first 18 months after it is implemented. Not only would this severely worsen the country's long-term budget situation, but it would also foreclose using a filibuster-proof \"reconciliation\" process in Congress to pass a tax bill. Why? Because it's poised to add trillions to the national debt, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.  Goldman Sachs chief Washington analyst Alec Philips said the plan faces \"a long road ahead\" despite being lighter in detail and less ambitious than Trump's campaign proposals. Moreover, given a lack of revenue-enhancing offsets -- such as a \"border adjustment tax\" that was previously floated -- the package is expected to add $5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years.  How the White House expects to deal with this, if it intends to deal with it at all, will be revealed when it submits a formal budget in May.\u00a0 Philips expects a big increase to estimated economic growth: By assuming GDP grows 3 percent per year on average, versus the 1.8 percent average the Congressional Budget Office assumes, the cost of the tax package would decline by roughly $3.7 trillion over the ten-year budget period.  The bigger issue, and why Wall Street seems so gutted: The complexities involved, and the charged political climate, means a tax reform package is unlikely to become law until the beginning of 2018 at the earliest.

            "article_content": "Who would come out ahead and who would be left behind if President Donald Trump's tax plan were enacted as is? The outline the Trump administration unveiled Wednesday would tilt the tax code toward investors and businesses. The impact on individual taxpayers is also positive, although wealthier ones likely would make out far better. But the effect on future taxpayers from a possibly higher federal deficit isn't encouraging, to say the least.\u00a0 The tax plan that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn rolled out Wednesday would lower the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent. The current rate is the highest in the industrialized world and has led to an exodus of U.S. companies to lower-tax nations.\u00a0 In addition, the plan would also apply a 15 percent rate to \"pass-through\" businesses, whose owners now pay individual income tax rates that range as high as 39.6 percent yearly. These entities include everything from barber shops to hedge funds -- and also real estate firms like the Trump Organization, which is Mr. Trump's property vehicle.\u00a0 The Trump tax plan is very similar to his proposal during the 2016 election campaign. But what was floated on Wednesday is light on the details and didn't include much on individual tax provisions or how to pay for the cuts.\u00a0 The president doesn't look kindly on the big revenue-raiser proposed by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R.-Wisconsin), called a border adjustment tax, which would tax imports and not exports. This would raise $1.1 trillion over 10 years, the Tax Foundation estimates, and would go far toward bridging the budgetary gap that the tax reductions would open. \u00a0 Whatever happens to the president's tax plan will depend on whether he can keep intact GOP majorities in the House and Senate. Some GOP deficit hawks are leery that the Trump approach may expand the already-swollen national debt even more. At this stage, it looks as if few Democratic lawmakers will back the Trump plan.\u00a0 The difficulty of passing tax legislation was highlighted by the failure to overhaul Obamacare. As\u00a0Mark Hamrick, Bankrate.com senior economic analyst, put it: \"When discussing health care, we're talking about a segment of the U.S. economy. When discussing individual and corporate tax reform, we're basically talking about the entire economy. The split within the GOP over taxes might well be just as difficult to overcome.\"\u00a0 While Mr. Trump's plan is sure to look different after going through the legislative grinder, with more details yet to come, the one presented Wednesday has winners and losers: Big winners: corporations. While the statutory rate on large businesses may be 35 percent, a\u00a0Government Accountability Office study\u00a0found last year that large U.S. corporations paid an average 14 percent on their income from 2008 to 2012. What's more, 42 percent of them paid no taxes.\u00a0 Trouble is, these companies had to pay a boatload to tax attorneys and accountants to secure these better rates. As the argument goes, wouldn't it be better to let them pay less in taxes without all the bother, and thus be able to hire more workers and spend more on plants and equipment, juicing economic growth?\u00a0 Another pro-business feature of the Trump plan is its bid to entice U.S. corporations to return much of the estimated $2 trillion in cash housed overseas, where corporate tax rates are lower. If the U.S. corporate rate were 15 percent, which would make it one of the world's lowest, that would be a big incentive to bring the cash home, thus yielding more tax revenue. The administration is mulling a one-time repatriation levy of 10 percent to sweeten the pot.\u00a0 Perhaps that would translate into a bigger tax haul from big business. Corporations contributed just 9 percent of total federal revenue in 2016. In times past, they gave a lot more: In the mid-1960s, it was\u00a0over 20 percent. With the Trump plan, \"this would be the first time business income was taxed at a lower rate than personal income,\" said Don Susswein, a principal at the RSM U.S. tax consulting firm.\u00a0 Or it could just be a giveaway that benefits no one other than investors and well-paid corporate chieftains? Some critics contend that depending on trickle-down economics, where the benefits given to businesses and the rich also stimulate economic manna for the masses, is folly.\u00a0 \"Corporations are already dodging their fair share of taxes at a time of record profits, yet he is trying to give them a massive tax cut,\" said Frank Clemente, executive director of the liberal Americans for Tax Fairness. \u00a0\u00a0 Big winners: pass-through businesses. The point here is to allow small businesses, as well as professional organizations like medical practices, to get the same treatment as corporations -- with the result being more consumer spending and more jobs. After all, small businesses account for the bulk of job creation.\u00a0 To the president's critics, his plan is a large conflict of interest. \"Trump is seeking to dramatically reduce his own tax bill, while at the same time refusing to show the American people what he already pays in taxes,\" Americans for Tax Fairness' Clemente said.\u00a0 Although Mr. Trump has refused to release his tax returns, claiming he can't while they're under federal audit (a contention many dispute), it's clear he would face a lighter tax load under his plan. The president has more than 500 pass-through entities that contain his real estate holdings.\u00a0 Big winners: wealthy individual taxpayers, less so for others.\u00a0While details are thus far sparse, most Americans would benefit \u00a0from the Trump plan, with some doing better than others. Namely, the rich. The administration aims to make taxes less onerous on citizens, both in terms of how much they pay and the difficulty of figuring out tax returns. Tax brackets would shrink to three from seven. Rates, which now range from 10 percent to 39.6 percent, would be a less-burdensome 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. A big help to lower-income taxpayers would be the doubling of the standard deduction -- what people take who don't itemize -- to $24,000.\u00a0 However, what the administration's tax plan would actually do for individuals is unclear without more specifics. An analysis of Mr. Trump's campaign tax plan last year by the Tax Foundation found that the top 1 percent of the population (earning $469,550 and up) would gain $135,460 on average, while a middle-income earner ($48,652 to $88,147) would garner $1,174. The removal of the 3.8 percent tax on investment income, enacted to help pay for Obamacare, is a boon to wealthier investors. Other than that surcharge, capital gains and dividends are taxed at a 20 percent rate. The administration also wants to cancel the estate tax, which affects the amount over $5.49 million that an individual passes along to heirs. Now, every dollar below that is tax-free. Mr. Trump would make all of it exempt from taxation. Also helping the better-off is Mr. Trump's call for axing the alternative minimum tax, launched in the 1960s to ensure that loophole-using rich people paid something. It does this by severely limiting deductions. Because the AMT wasn't indexed to inflation, it now affects households making as little as $200,000, meaning the upper middle-class and no longer just the mega-wealthy.\u00a0 But big-money folks like the president would benefit the most if the AMT goes away. That's judging by Mr. Trump's 2005 tax return, a portion of which came to light recently from an unknown source. Because he had huge losses from real estate investments, which he deducted, Mr. Trump would have paid next to nothing ordinarily. But due to the AMT, because it ignores most deductions, he ended up paying at the 24 percent rate, which is still far below the top rate. Take away the AMT, and he needn't worry about that. \u00a0 Possible losers: future taxpayers. Treasury Secretary\u00a0Mnuchin contended that the plan \"will pay for itself with growth.\" In other words, the tax cuts would stimulate economic activity that would generate extra tax income and make up for the shortfalls from lower rates. There's a longstanding debate over whether that is true, which goes all the way back to Ronald Reagan's 1981 cut. The deficit ballooned under Reagan, but the economy also expanded -- and other influences were at work, such as the squelching of double-digit inflation by the Federal Reserve, which makes clean cause-and-effect analyses difficult. Would better growth help out at all? Most likely, but not to the extent Mnuchin envisions. Just a third of the cost of tax cuts is recouped because of more rapid economic growth, by the reckoning of Gregory Mankiw, who headed the President's Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush. If so, that means an even larger federal debt because Washington would have to sell more bonds to make up for the diminished revenue. \"Unfortunately, it seems the administration is using economic growth like magic beans -- the cheap solution to all our problems,\" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan watchdog group. \"But there is no golden goose at the top of the tax cut beanstalk, just mountains of debt.\" Right now, the debt held by the public is 77 percent of GDP. MacGuineas' organization projects that will reach 150 percent by 2050 under current law. And the Trump plan would make it far worse, she said, adding trillions to the $13.6 trillion in debt already on the books.\u00a0 That conceivably could thwart needed federal spending to fight recessions or wars, and it could crowd out investments in job-creating private enterprise, as everyone would be buying presumably safer Treasury bonds. And to be sure, the government under this scenario would have to hike taxes radically to pay for everything. Of course, whether anything close to this plan can or will be passed is problematical, in light of the dynamics of Congress and the ferocity of special-interest lobbyists to protect or even improve their clients' special tax breaks. Cohn and Mnuchin said many of the details had to be hashed out with lawmakers, and what they presented was more of a framework. \"This was not based on a lot of study, but on what could be passed,\" said Michael Greenwald, a partner at the Friedman LLP tax consulting firm.\u00a0 And how long it will take is yet another question. Mnuchin indicated that the tax package would become law this year. It took Reagan five years to pass a major tax reform.

            "article_content": "Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin confirmed that the tax plan set to be unveiled later this afternoon will include a proposal to drive down the corporate tax rate from 35 percent down to 15 percent.  Mnuchin confirmed the rate decrease at a discussion at the Newseum on Wednesday, calling it the \u201cbiggest tax cut and largest tax reform in the history of our country.\u201d \u201cWhat we think is important is small business, and we are committed that small business owner operators will have the benefit of the business rate,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cWhat this is not going to be is a loophole to let rich people, who should be paying higher rates, pay 15 percent. This is going to be for small businesses that drive the economy and they will have benefit of this.\u201d\u00a0 Mncuchin would not go into detail about the plan but emphasized that the goal is to work together with the House and Senate to get the plan passed and to make it permanent.  \u201cThe average American should have simple taxes, and for a large part of people, they won\u2019t be paying taxes,\u201d Mnuchin continued. \u201cThere will be personal exemptions, and people who can\u2019t afford it won\u2019t be paying taxes.\u201d\u00a0 The plan comes as a result of what Mnuchin described as \u201cproductive\u201d weekly meetings with the lawmaker in charge of tax writing in the House, Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, as well as with members of the Senate on tax reform. Mnuchin said that the House, Senate and the Trump administration are \u201call on the same page in making tax reform a major priority to boost the economy.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that Democrats will work with us on this. This is about tax cuts that are good for the American people, and I hope they won\u2019t stand in the way of creating tax cuts for small business, for making business competitive, for simplifying personal taxes. So, we\u2019re hopeful that it\u2019s bipartisan,\u201d said Mnuchin. Mnuchin also confirmed that the border adjustment tax favored by Brady and House Speaker Paul Ryan is not included in the White House plan. He said there were things in the tax \u201cwe\u2019re concerned about,\u201d and \u201cwhat we\u2019ve discussed with them is we don\u2019t think it works in its current form.\u201d He said that they\u2019d continue to have discussions with them about possible revisions.\u00a0 When asked how closely Mr. Trump worked with Treasury in crafting a blueprint for the plan, Mnuchin said that the president is \u201cdetermined we will have tax reform. As a matter of fact, he called me at 7:30 this morning, and we went over plans for the day.\u201d Implementing sweeping tax reforms was high on the list of Mr. Trump\u2019s major campaign promises to voters during the election. But there is no indication yet of exactly how the administration plans to reform the tax code, only the mention of tax cuts. This week, in an interview with the AP, Mr. Trump promised a \u201cmassive tax cut,\u201d maybe even the\u00a0\u201cbiggest tax cut we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\u00a0 According to White House legislative liaison Marc Short, the plan will be broad in principles. It\u2019s goal will be to make it revenue neutral, and in a bipartisan manner, engaging \u201cexternal audiences\u201d for a period for 4-6 weeks, with language to be completed by summer.\u00a0 Mnuchin and National Economic Director Gary Cohn are scheduled to appear at the White House press briefing to unveil the plan.\u00a0 Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump took a step Friday to unwind, or at least soften, Obama administration rules that thwarted U.S corporations from moving their headquarters overseas to reduce tax bills. \u00a0 Since the Great Recession, more than 50 American companies transferred their legal domiciles to nations that charge lower corporate tax rates. The statutory rate in the U.S. is 35 percent, but in Ireland, a popular destination for such shifts, it\u2019s 12.5 percent. Such exoduses, known as tax inversions, were mostly shut down by a series of regulatory actions from 2014 to 2016, under Barack Obama.\u00a0 But Mr. Trump, who has championed a lighter tax burden on Corporate America in a bid to boost jobs, signed an executive order that could potentially lead to deep-sixing the Obama barriers to corporate departures. \u201cWe\u2019re going to lower our business tax, which is the highest in the world,\u201d the president said in a Friday afternoon ceremony in Washington, where he signed the order.\u00a0 He also vowed to unveil his latest tax reform proposal this coming week, which would contain a \u201cmassive tax cut.\u201d\u00a0 The order instructs the U.S. Treasury Department to study tax rules to see if any were enacted that exceed executive branch authority, which Republicans generally claim is the case for the Obama inversion measures. The implication is that Mr. Obama\u2019s anti-inversion action will be scrapped or weakened. While Mr. Trump\u2019s order is aimed at the full span of taxation, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin earlier confirmed to reporters that the Obama inversion rules were a big target. On Friday, the president also issued an order for Treasury to review rules on what financial institutions are designated\u00a0 important enough to warrant special government oversight. This would affect insurance companies, like American International Group (AIG), which say that they, unlike banks, are not central enough to the nation\u2019s financial system to merit such scrutiny. A third order compels Treasury to examine plans to dismantle failing financial firms, which some say form a safety net for banks that allows them to take undue risks. \u00a0 While Mr. Trump\u2019s tax-oriented order has no immediate impact, it serves as a statement of the White House\u2019s intent. The administration\u2019s broader goal is to lower U.S. corporate rates. During the\u00a02016 election campaign, Mr. Trump expressed dismay that companies have fled the U.S., but he blamed it on high taxes.\u00a0 Although corporations generate only 11 percent, or around $350 billion, of the $3.25 trillion in overall federal tax revenues, the administration believes a lower tax burden will lead to more jobs for Americans. Its critics say the only result would be bigger payouts for stockholders. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Under Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plan and that of House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin), the corporate tax rate would be lowered to 15 percent or 20 percent, although some think it will end up no lower than 28 percent to avoid a tax revenue shortfall. Just when the wholesale overhaul of the tax code will occur is anyone\u2019s guess because other priorities, like revamping the health insurance law, appear to be crowding it out. Also, Democrats on Capitol Hill have threatened to stall any tax overhaul unless Mr. Trump releases his tax returns.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re up in the air on tax reform, so it\u2019s a good idea to repeal\u201d the tax inversion ban in the interim, said Diana Furchgott-Roth, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute. She argued that even if a U.S. company moved abroad, its lower tax tab would permit it to book higher overall earnings. This, she contended, could translate into more money available to expand U.S. capacity and thus yield more jobs. But to Frank Clemente, executive director of the liberal Americans for Tax Fairness, permitting tax inversions again will bring Americans very few boons. He termed it \u201cironic\u201d that Mr. Trump campaigned for keeping jobs on American soil, \u201cbut he also wants to let companies ship them overseas\u201d to get a tax break. Over the past three years before Mr. Trump took office, the Obama administration imposed new rules\u00a0making such corporate flights offshore harder. The typical inversion model was for a larger U.S. company to merge with a smaller one in a lower-tax country.\u00a0 But the Obama rules altered the math to disallow unions where the American acquisition partner was lopsidedly larger, which was often the case. They also outlawed a post-merger maneuver where the remaining\u00a0 U.S.-based subsidiaries borrowed money from the offshore parent company and paid tax-deductible interest under U.S. law, reducing its taxes. \u00a0 The Obama rules scotched several planned cross-border combinations, including stopping North Chicago-based AbbVie (ABBV) from merging with Ireland\u2019s Shire (SHPG), and New York-headquartered Pfizer (PFE) with Allergan (AGN), which is also incorporated in Ireland.\u00a0 Most inversions were in the pharmaceutical industry because they lack the big domestic infrastructure common among sectors like manufacturing. This made the drug companies more portable. Leaving behind an enormous inventory of company factories would open the departed corporation to political pressure from Washington and other critics. But a few inversions didn\u2019t involve pharma. For instance, 2014\u2019s $12.6 billion merger of Canada\u2019s coffee chain Tim Hortons and America\u2019s Burger King, which is far larger. The joint company, called Restaurant Brands International (QSR), now is located in suburban Toronto.\u00a0Canada\u2019s corporate federal tax rate is 26.5 percent. To be sure, the U.S. tax code is riddled with loopholes, which allow domestic companies to lower their tax rates considerably. Nearly a fifth of profitable U.S. corporations pay no federal income taxes, according to an\u00a0analysis\u00a0by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, which also found the average corporate tax payout was around 14 percent, far less than the statutory 35 percent.\u00a0 Once the Washington jockeying over the tax code overhaul begins, platoons of high-powered lobbyists will fight to keep tax breaks for their clients. So where this all will end up remains very murky.\u00a0 Larry Light is a veteran financial editor and reporter who has worked for the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Business Week, Money, AdviceIQ and Newsday.",

            "article_content": "PESHAWAR, Pakistan -- When Durdana married for a second time and to a man of her own choosing, her parents threatened to kill her if she tried to see her new husband. They imprisoned her in their home, but she still had her mobile phone and had learned that a helpline for women had been set up. She noted the number and then one day when she was alone in the house, she called.  Nayab Hassan was on the other end. She had been trained how to answer the call. \u201cBe gentle. Listen. Let them speak. Let them tell you what they want. Sometimes they are very emotional,\u201d she said at the helpline center -- located in the sprawling provincial parliament buildings in Pakistan\u2019s deeply conservative Khyber Pukhtunkhwa province, where tribal councils still hand over young girls to settle disputes.\u00a0 Not far from the border with neighboring Afghanistan, Khyber Pukhtunkhwa became the first province in Pakistan to set up a hotline for women that feeds directly into the provincial legislature.  It\u2019s still a small operation. It began March 1 and so far there are only two operators, Hassan and Mehran Akbar. They take the information from the women and Shandana Naeem, a lawyer, follows up with advice and a network of free legal services.  They keep a careful log of all their calls, which average one a day so far, and while most have emanated from the provincial capital of Peshawar, several have come from more remote regions.  Durdana\u2019s call was from Swat, a picturesque mountain region of clear blue lakes that ramble through valleys surrounded by imposing peaks. The area\u2019s beauty is a stark contrast to its dark and violent history. It was in Swat where Pakistan\u2019s Taliban briefly ruled, beheading police in the town square and where Malala Yousafzai was shot in the head for advocating girls\u2019 education and criticizing the violent religious radicals as being frightened of female education.  The log book is carefully kept. It records names, dates, phone numbers and then their stories. Some are horrifying.  One woman, Aneesa, called to say that two years earlier her husband had thrown acid at her, stole her money and jewelry and fled to Saudi Arabia. She had moved in with her parents and now her eyesight was deteriorating from the acid attack; she needed medical assistance but had no money to pay for it.  Naeem said they helped her work through the red tape of getting a health card --\u00a0the first step to health care. But Aneesa\u2019s call also made them realize the need to engage local health clinics and develop a network that would be willing to offer free health care, similar to their legal service network.  Naeem said most of the calls have been over property disputes, where women were being denied their inheritance.  The helpline was developed by Meraj Humayun Khan, a 70-year-old parliamentarian who has taken on her male colleagues to organize a women\u2019s caucus in the provincial parliament. With the weight of the 22-member caucus behind her, Khan lobbied for the direct helpline to the legislature.\u00a0 \u201cWe need to be in touch with their issues,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI can have a lot of ideas but it should come from them.\u201d  The original call that prompted the helpline was a property dispute, said Khan, explaining that Pakistan\u2019s inheritance laws -- based on Islamic injunctions -- allow male relatives priority and give a lesser share to women. And those women are often denied or intimidated by male relatives to forfeit even that lesser share.\u00a0 The reason for locating the helpline in the provincial parliament was to collect data from women that would in turn bolster arguments for legislative changes. Khyber Pukhtunkhwa province is already behind on women\u2019s right issues; lawmakers there have so far refused to pass an anti-domestic violence law that other provinces have approved.  Hard-line religious parties hold significant sway in Khyber Pukhtunkhwa. Jamaat-e-Islami and the Jamiat-e-Ulema Pakistan (whose madrassas or religious schools were favored by Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban) are partners in the provincial coalition government.  The 22 women in the provincial parliament are there on quota seats reserved for women. No female candidate has been able to win a general election seat in the deeply conservative and tribal-dominated province.  Khan says she plans to run on a general seat in the 2018 elections, but she admits even those men who have championed and endorsed her candidacy have been met with skepticism and resistance.  \u201cEveryone they talk to asks \u2018That\u2019s all well and good, but don\u2019t you have any men who can run?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a humiliation for them to be represented by a woman. They think women don\u2019t know anything about politics, about economics.\u201d  The chairperson of Pakistan\u2019s Human Rights Commission, Zohra Yusuf, says different provinces are making progress on women\u2019s issues at different paces. Southern Sindh is Pakistan\u2019s most progressive province in terms of laws to safeguard women, she said. Earlier this month the most populous province, Punjab, opened state-of-the-art shelters for women facing abuse at home.\u00a0 Last year Pakistan passed a bill that essentially closed a loophole which used to allow so-called honor killers to escape punishment.  Yusuf said that despite the legislative progress, on-the-ground enforcement of these new laws still remains a significant hurdle.  \u201cI think the governments are realizing it\u2019s about time something needs to be done,\u201d she said in a telephone interview.  \u201cLaws were passed last year, the honor killing bill, rape, violence against women, but still it is about enforcement.\u201d  In Pakistan it is difficult to even get the police to register a case of domestic violence, said Khan, who explained they often see it as a private family issue.  Durdana in Swat, whose family threatened to kill her if she met her husband of choice, was told to go to the police station and charge her parents with unlawful confinement or tell her husband to go to police to demand he be allowed  to see her, said Naeem, the helpline lawyer.  That was March 6. Naeem has tried repeatedly to telephone Durdana on the number she gave but it is either turned off or rings unanswered. The dilemma, she says, when giving advice is that there is no way to know whether the police, for example, will help the women or hand them back to the family they are fleeing.  \u201cWe have to get the police, the justice system, the many government departments, on our side, working with us,\u201d said Khan the founder of the helpline. \u201cWhile all government departments agreed . . . we now need them to make good on their promises.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Democrat gunning to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz in Texas is ripping a page straight out of the playbook of Sen. Bernie Sanders, framing himself as an outsider who wants to harness the grassroots and eradicate the corrupting scourge of money in politics. Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, a mop-haired 44-year-old El Paso native first elected to the House in 2012, embarked on a four-city tour of Texas on Friday to launch his underdog campaign against Cruz, who is up for re-election next year. Throughout the day, O\u2019Rourke talked up his \u201cpeople driven\u201d campaign for Senate, eschewed big money and party labels and emphasized job creation. He even dropped a few f-bombs in front of a crowd of beer-drinkers at a bar in Dallas. As Democrats continue soul-searching over the future of a fractured party lacking a coherent message, O\u2019Rourke is trying to present the image of a candidate who ignores the rules of conventional politics. The particulars of his Senate bid -- the site of his campaign headquarters, for example -- remain up in the air. But what is clear is that the Spanish-speaking Democrat is working hard to show voters he won\u2019t take marching orders from the D.C. establishment. \u201cI don\u2019t know about the Democratic Party right now, but anytime we are waiting for someone out of central headquarters, waiting to figure something out, we might as well give up,\u201d O\u2019Rourke told CBS News. \u201cI just know what I\u2019m hearing in Texas, and what I feel as a Texan. There are too many people who want to work and who are skilled and can\u2019t find that work.\u201d O\u2019Rourke chatted by phone Friday as he boarded a commercial flight to Dallas, where he would meet supporters in the crowded backyard of a local brew house. No Democrat has won a statewide race in Texas in since 1994, but O\u2019Rourke sounded bullish on his ability to connect with voters in a highly partisan environment. \u201cPeople want a full-time senator. Someone focused on this state -- not on running for President,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone who puts country before party and isn\u2019t chasing big money, and believes public service is a calling and not a career.\u201d\u00a0 O\u2019Rourke pledged to serve a maximum of two terms in the Senate, echoing the vow he made to serve no more than four terms in the House. He didn\u2019t hesitate when asked to say something nice about Cruz, a conservative provocateur who revels in eliciting scorn from both sides of the aisle. (Cruz\u2019s chilly reputation among his Senate colleagues fueled joking accusations throughout the 2016 presidential campaign that he was in fact the Zodiac Killer.) \u201cI\u2019ve met [Cruz] and I think he is a nice guy,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cI think he did a terrific job running for president and almost won the nomination, but did it at the expense of Texas and a Senate seat that should have been focused on the people of this state.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a phenomenal campaigner and a smart guy,\u201d he added. Jeff Roe, Cruz\u2019s 2016 campaign manager, wasted no time in attacking O\u2019Rourke on Twitter after he announced his candidacy, calling him \u201cmore liberal than [Wendy Davis].\u201d Finally nat libs found a candidate more liberal than @wendydavis ! meet @RepBetoORourke will they sacrifice electability for liberalism? Davis, a former Texas state senator who gained national attention for filibustering an anti-abortion bill, ran for governor in 2014 with the backing of many national Democrats. She was crushed when voters went to the polls, losing to now-Gov. Greg Abbott by more than 20 points. O\u2019Rourke does have one thing in common with Cruz: He\u2019s a social media obsessive who believes in the power of the internet to connect directly with voters. His social media persona is part of his strategy. O\u2019Rourke made headlines last month when he embarked on an impromptu 1,600-mile, 36-hour road trip from Texas to Washington with Republican Rep. Will Hurd after snow grounded their flights. The duo broadcast the bipartisan marathon on Facebook Live. To follow him on social media is to become familiar with even the most mundane details of the congressman\u2019s life. He\u2019s an avid user of Instagram and Snapchat. On Friday, he snapped his morning run with his dog along the U.S.-Mexico border. Later, he boarded his flight and tweeted a grinning selfie from his middle seat in coach. Hola from seat 27B! Headed to Dallas and will see you tonight at Eight Bells Alehouse at 6:30! pic.twitter.com/cfL1CLR6XA O\u2019Rourke boasted that he has more Snapchat followers than any other member of Congress and says he\u2019ll continue to be \u201cthe most accountable and transparent person in Congress,\u201d using social media to connect with constituents and voters he would otherwise never get the chance to meet. But O\u2019Rourke, who once played in a rock band and lived in Brooklyn, plans to take on Cruz directly on the issue of money in politics. Cruz raised nearly $90 million from super PACs during his 2016 presidential campaign, with $6 million going to a single analytics firm. O\u2019Rourke has pledged not to take PAC money from wealthy donors, instead focusing on grassroots small-dollar fundraising. To win a statewide race in Texas, O\u2019Rourke will have to walk a tricky line. The Lonestar State still skews Republican despite perennial Democratic dreams of a growing Hispanic population turning the state blue. O\u2019Rourke said he\u2019s confident he can appeal to Trump supporters as well as Democrats. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many Trump voters have approached me in Texas,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of buyer\u2019s remorse. They are happy with their decision, would vote for Trump again. But they\u2019re disappointed at how ineffective government is.\u201d \u201cThe road to effective government runs through Texas,\u201d he added. This is not to downplay O\u2019Rourke\u2019s national progressive appeal. Shortly after O\u2019Rourke formally entered the race, Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard academic who has carved out a side career fighting corporate money in politics, endorsed O\u2019Rourke in a post on\u00a0Medium. \u201cBeto O\u2019Rourke wants to challenge one of the very few politicians in America today who actually openly and firmly defends this corrupt system\u200a -- Ted Cruz,\u201d Lessig wrote. \u201cIf a crazy man could be elected because he promised America he would \u2018drain the swamp,\u2019 I\u2019m quite sure this incredibly-decent,-former-punk-rocker,-40-something,-takes-no-PAC$,-Congressman-willing-to-drive-1600-miles-in-a-car-with-a-Republican can be Texas\u2019 next Senator,\u201d he concluded. O\u2019Rourke isn\u2019t the only Democrat with an eye on Cruz\u2019s Senate seat. Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Democrat whose district includes San Antonio, may also throw his hat in the ring. If he does, he\u2019ll benefit from deep connections with national Democrats who could provide key support in the primary. Castro has been busy with the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the U.S. presidential campaign, and has said he will decide by the end of April whether to jump into the race. \u201cHe\u2019s a friend and I think he\u2019d be a great candidate,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said of the prospect of a matchup against Castro, which would immediately become one of the most watched primaries in the country. \u201cI told him if he runs and joins me, I want to do this in a way we make Texas proud, and I\u2019m confident we can do that.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Early Thursday morning the president released his 2018 budget blueprint, which immediately drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans because of its drastic reduction in funding for several government agencies. Among the hardest hit were the EPA and the State Department -- which would each see budgets slashed by almost thirty percent. The plan also included an extra $54 billion dollars in defense spending, an allotment for the wall on the U.S./Mexican border and other increases for national defense. In addition to Congressional fury over the budget blueprint, the White House is \u00a0facing an uphill battle on healthcare. The American Healthcare Act has faced fierce opposition from House and Senate Republicans and the President spent most of the week making his case for his version of reform.\u00a0 Sunday on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d we\u2019ll talk to Senator Ted Cruz, one of the Republicans who has been critical of the AHCA and is working with House colleagues to adapt their bill into a vehicle that can pass in the Senate. Also on the agenda: the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch. We\u2019ll ask Senator Cruz how much resistance he predicts from Democrats and what to expect from those hearings next week.\u00a0 Then we\u2019ll turn to White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney to take us through Mr. Trump\u2019s budget proposal and why he thinks such extreme reductions in the federal government are necessary. \u00a0 With FBI Director James Comey scheduled to testify on the Hill next Monday, we\u2019ll sit down with the top Democrat in the House Rep. Nancy Pelosi, R- California, to discuss the ongoing investigation into potential Russian ties with the Trump presidential campaign. Does Pelosi have faith in Comey\u2019s investigation? \u00a0Democrats oppose the American Health Care Act, but will they work with Republicans in finding a solution to healthcare suitable to both sides? And we\u2019ll check in with CBS News Elections Director Anthony Salvanto who will discuss the new findings from the CBS News Nation Tracker, our ongoing attempt to keep tabs on what real Americans think about healthcare, the administration, congress and the country? He\u2019ll have the latest findings from our collaboration with Yougov.\u00a0 As always, our political panel will break down all the news from the week and look ahead to what\u2019s coming up.

            "article_content": "Investors were gifted another new record high for the Dow Jones industrials index on Friday. It marked the 11th record in a row, a run matching January 1987 for the best-ever streak in the index\u2019s more than 100-year history.\u00a0 Yet for most of the day, keeping the streak alive looked like a long shot as stocks traded heavily, with a loss of around 60 points. But then, as if powered by divine providence, a \u201cmeltup\u201d in the last hour of trading pushed the average into the green and up to another new all-time high. In fact, the Dow turned positive only in the final minute of trading (chart below). In the end, the Dow gained just a fraction of a percent, up 11 points, thanks in large part to gains by \u201cdefensive\u201d issues like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Verizon (VZ), while cyclical names like Caterpillar (CAT) lagged. Small-cap stocks in the Russell 2000 declined slightly. Treasury bonds were stronger across the curve -- a safe haven bid that bests characterizes the tone of the day\u2019s trade. That pushed the 30-year Treasury yield below 3 percent.  Wall Street continues to focus on the growing realization that President Trump\u2019s desire for tax reform, infrastructure spending and Obamacare replacement will likely be longer in coming than originally envisioned. Issues like a border tax remain in flux.\u00a0 And with the debt ceiling approaching fast, fresh attention is being paid to the fiscal implications of these policies at a time when the budget deficit -- given a national debt swelling toward $20 trillion -- will increasingly have to bear rising interest service costs.  And this is all happening within the context of analysts marking down 2017 S&P 500 earnings growth expectations, rising inflation pressure and an increasingly hawkish Federal Reserve that could well raise interest rates again next month. The \u201chard\u201d economic data remains weak as well, from gasoline demand to housing activity (chart above).  While the Dow overall looked like it shrugged off these concerns on Friday, under the surface rising stress is clearly evident.  After 15 straight days higher, technology stocks suffered their worst day of the year. Financials suffered their worst session in five weeks. Gold rose above the $1,250 level for the first time since the election and is up eight of the last nine weeks. Silver is up nine weeks in a row for its best run since May 2006. And bitcoin just hit a new record high.  Breadth remains moribund as well, with buyers focusing on a very narrow group of momentum-driven stocks. On Friday, more than 60 percent of total volume on the New York Stock Exchange went into declining issues.  To be clear, none of this precludes stocks from persisting in their historic uptrend. But the risks of a sudden reversal are clearly rising in unison.\u00a0 Anthony Mirhaydari is founder of the Edge\r\n, an investment advisory newsletter, and Edge Pro, options newsletter.

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- The closure of a regional airport could force residents of a small town in upper Michigan to drive eight hours to catch a flight. The elimination of funding to keep the Great Lakes clean could hurt business at a waterside Ohio boating club. Cuts to the nation\u2019s flood insurance program could mean greater losses after a storm for homeowners on Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast. In his first budget blueprint since taking office, President Donald Trump held to his promise to build up the U.S. military while slashing domestic spending - even for programs that benefit the rural and lower-income Americans who voted for him last November. \u201cSome people might think it\u2019s a betrayal,\u201d said Eric Waara, the Republican city manager of the 7,000-person town of Houghton on Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula, who said he hoped the proposal was just a negotiating tactic. \u201cI think that we all hope it\u2019s the first small step until something better.\u201d Houghton sits more than 200 miles from a major highway and for many residents the Houghton County Memorial Airport is their connection to the outside world. Trump\u2019s proposed elimination of the Transportation Department\u2019s Essential Air Service program, or EAS, could force the airport to close or dramatically curtail service, leaving residents with a four-hour drive to Green Bay, Wisconsin, or eight hours to Chicago to catch a flight, Waara said. The administration said it would save $175 million a year. Trump carried Houghton County with more than 54 percent of the vote as he became the first Republican to win Michigan since 1988. He got more than 50 percent of the vote in 86 of the 111 communities served by EAS, according to an Associated Press analysis of voting data. The proposed $1.15 trillion budget distills much of Trump\u2019s sweeping campaign rhetoric into a set of hard choices and cold priorities. Trump is calling on Congress to boost defense spending by $54 billion, a move popular with many Republicans. A wall along the border with Mexico, a core campaign promise, would receive $4 billion to start construction. Trump\u2019s campaign promises to gut ineffective programs and shrink a bloated bureaucracy translated into a plan that cuts environmental protections programs, community development funding, housing vouchers, scientific research, a commission to create economic opportunities in Appalachia and other programs. Funding for popular social services like Meals on Wheels, which provides food to the elderly, and after-school programs for children, also are on the chopping block. The outline - the start of negotiations with Congress - leaves untouched Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid spending. \u201cRural America stepped up to the plate behind the president in his last election, and we\u2019re wholeheartedly behind him. We need to make sure that rural America at least gets its fair share,\u201d said Alabama Rep. Robert Aderholt, the Republican chairman of the House agriculture appropriations subcommittee. Aderholt, who represents one of the highest Trump voting congressional districts in the country, said he\u2019s generally supportive of less federal spending but has concerns about cuts that would hurt several rural development programs. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really reflect President Trump\u2019s support for rural communities,\u201d he said. Trump administration officials said the proposal supports a desire to give states more flexibility and to protect taxpayers from seeing their dollars wasted. \u201cYou\u2019re only focusing on half of the equation, right?\u201d Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said when asked about the cuts. \u201cYou\u2019re focusing on recipients of the money. We\u2019re trying to focus on both the recipients of the money and the folks who give us the money in the first place.\u201d The budget proposal offered the promise of increased spending and services in some parts of Trump Country. The plan calls for a $500 million increase in spending to counter opioid epidemic, an acute problem in many rural communities. It proposes an additional $4.4 billion for veterans health care, including money to extend a program that allows eligible veterans to seek care from a private doctor outside the VA network. Trump\u2019s proposed military buildup could be an economic boon to military contractors and military communities. In the areas surrounding Fayetteville, North Carolina, what\u2019s good for Fort Bragg is good for the community. \u201cWe can\u2019t help but look upon the budget favorably,\u201d said Robert Van Geons, head of Fayetteville-Cumberland County Economic Development Corp. Two of the counties that make up the sprawling Fort Bragg delivered more than 60 percent of its votes for Trump. Others saw economic worries in the proposal. The blueprint would cut almost all the $300 million in funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, raising concern among some in the Ohio counties along Lake Erie. The initiative was started to help limit invasive species such as the Asian carp, among other threats. It was meant to reduce dangers such as the outbreak of bacteria in 2014 that contaminated drinking water for nearly 500,000 people living around Toledo. Trump\u2019s budget plan says that these programs should be the responsibility of state and local governments. At Catawba Island Club, a lakeside club with hundreds of boat slips, a golf course and 100 year-round employees in Ohio\u2019s Ottawa County, President Jim Stouffer said a rise in pollution could hurt his business. \u201cOur reason for being is our members being able to get out on the water,\u201d Stouffer said. Trump won the county by 57 percent of the vote on his way to carrying Ohio. The budget plan would also cut $190 million for mapping flood hazards for the National Flood Insurance Program, as well as grants to fund projects that would reduce damage from natural disasters. Without accurate maps of floodplains and the engineering projects funded by these grants, the costs from flood losses and natural disasters could be even higher for homeowners, businesses and taxpayers, said Don Griffin, a vice president at the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America. The three states with the most flood insurance policies, according to the government, are Florida, Texas and Louisiana, all of which supported Trump.",

That\u2019s gone, thanks to him.\u201d Keeping on the race theme, Kimmel pointed out, \u201cBlack people saved NASA and white people saved jazz,\u201d he joked. \u201cThat\u2019s what you call progress.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t discriminate based on where people are from in Hollywood,\u201d Kimmel continued. \u201cWe discriminate based on age and weight.\u201d After toasting \u201coverrated\u201d Meryl Streep for her 20th nomination, Kimmel introduced a montage of past best supporting actor winners before Alicia Vikander took the stage to present the award to this year\u2019s winner, Mahershala Ali. The \u201cMoonlight\u201d star thanked his teachers and professors. \u201cIt\u2019s not about you,\u201d he said they told him. \u201cYou\u2019re in service to these stories and these characters.\u201d He also pointed out that his wife gave birth to their daughter four days ago. Kimmel got in one more political dig, asking anyone from CNN, the New York Times and the L.A. Times to leave the room. \u201cWe have no tolerance for fake news. Fake tans, we love,\u201d he explained.\u00a0 Kate McKinnon and Jason Bateman then took the stage to present the Oscar for best makeup and hairstyling, which went to \u201cSuicide Squad.\u201d\u00a0 McKinnon and Bateman stuck around to present best costume design to \u201cFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cSting told me I was going to win tonight, and I didn\u2019t believe him at all,\u201d Colleen Atwood said while accepting her fourth Oscar. \u201cHidden Figures\u201d stars Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae, who in turn welcomed the film\u2019s subject, 98-year-old Katherine Johnson, who received a standing ovation.\u00a0 The actresses then presented the Oscar for best documentary feature, which went to \u201cO.J.: Made in a America,\u201d the nearly eight-hour ESPN miniseries.\u00a0 Kimmel then tried an O.J. Simpson joke that drew groans from the celebrity audience. Luckily, he was able to then introduce consummate crowd-pleaser Dwayne Johnson, who sang a bit before bringing Lin-Manuel Miranda and \u201cMoana\u201d star Auli\u2019i Cravalho to the stage to perform -- with Miranda offering up a new prologue rap for their nominated song, \u201cHow Far I\u2019ll Go.\u201d\u00a0 Looking to one-up his peanut butter and jelly sandwich gag at last year\u2019s Emmy, Jimmy Kimmel treated the crowd to candy dropped into the auditorium via small packages on parachutes. The next awards, presented by Sofia Boutella and Chris Evans, went for sound editing and sound mixing. \u201cArrival\u201d took home sound editing, while \u201cHacksaw Ridge\u201d took sound mixing.\u00a0 Vince Vaughn acknowledged the latest recipients of the Governor\u2019s Awards -- including Jackie Chan -- before a highlight reel of best supporting actress acceptance speeches ushered in this year\u2019s award, presented by Mark Rylance. This year, best supporting actress went to Viola Davis for \u201cFences,\u201d her first Oscar and third nomination.\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s one place that all the people with the greatest potential are gathered, and that\u2019s the graveyard,\u201d she said from the stage, saying she wanted to exhume the stories of the people who never saw their dreams come true. \u201cWe are the only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life. So here\u2019s to August Wilson, who exhumed and exalted the ordinary people.\u201d Davis tearfully paid tribute to her fellow cast members, co-star and director Denzel Washington, her parents, her sister and her husband and daughter.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t know if anybody\u2019s going to be able to give a speech after that,\u201d Kimmel joked after Davis\u2019 moment. \u201cShe was just nominated for an Emmy for that acceptance speech.\u201d Charlize Theron and her personal inspiration, Shirley MacLaine, then took the stage to present the best foreign language film Oscar to \u201cThe Salesman,\u201d directed by Asghar Farhadi, who notably was not present to accept the award. A statement from Farhadi was read instead.\u00a0 \u201cMy absence is out of respect to the people of my country and those of the other six nations\u201d barred entry into the U.S. \u201cDividing the world into the us and our enemies categories creates fear.\u201d His statement then called on filmmakers to continue creating empathy through their work.\u00a0 Dev Patel then introduced Sting\u2019s performance of his Oscar-nominated song, \u201cThe Empty Chair.\u201d The former Police frontman sang and played guitar on a stark, darkened stage.\u00a0 Before bringing in his next stunt -- a bus full of tourists who think they\u2019re on their way to an exhibit on Oscar gowns -- Hailee Seinfeld and Gael Garcia Bernal took the stage to present the animated film awards, starting with best animated short film, which went to Pixar\u2019s \u201cPiper.\u201d\u00a0 Before announcing animated feature, Bernal made an impassioned plea against President Trump\u2019s planned wall along the Mexican border, referring to actors as \u201cmigrant workers.\u201d Best animated feature went to Disney\u2019s \u201cZootopia,\u201d with its filmmakers thanking audiences for celebrating a film that embraces tolerance.\u00a0 \u201cFifty Shades Darker\u201d stars Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan then took the stage to present the Oscar for production design, which went to the married team behind \u201cLa La Land.\u201d\u00a0 Then it was time for Kimmel\u2019s stunt with the tour bus riders to come to fruition. The stunned tourists couldn\u2019t stop taking pictures with their phones. Ryan Gosling even gave one of the tourists his leftover candy, while Denzel Washington performed an impromptu wedding. Jennifer Aniston provided her sunglasses as a wedding present.\u00a0 Kimmel then invited the tourists to all touch Mahershala Ali\u2019s brand-new Oscar.\u00a0 \u201cRogue One\u201d stars Felicity Jones and Riz Ahmed took the stage to present the Oscar for best visual effects, which went to the team behind \u201cThe Jungle Book.\u201d  Seth Rogen and his inspiration, Michael J. Fox, came together on stage, even stepping out of a DeLoreon. \u201cI am at the Oscars with Michael J. Fox and a DeLoreon wearing future shoes,\u201d Rogen said. \u201cAll I have to do now is sing the Schuyler sisters\u2019 song from \u2018Hamilton\u2019 and my bucket list will be complete.\u201d  Much to the delight of Lin-Manuel Miranda, he began to do just that, cajoling Fox into joining him.  They then presented the award for best editing, which went to \u201cHacksaw Ridge.\u201d\u00a0 Kimmel then reenacted a scene from \u201cThe Lion King\u201d with \u201cLion\u201d star Sunny Pawar before dropping another batch of candy on the audience.\u00a0 Salma Hayek and David Oyelowo presented the Oscars for both documentary short subject and live action short film. In the documentary category, \u201cThe White Helmets,\u201d about imperiled rescue workers in Syria. The live-action short film award went to \u201cSing.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re more than two hours into the show and Donald Trump hasn\u2019t tweet about us once, and I\u2019m starting to get worried about him,\u201d Kimmel said. He then tweeted at the president, \u201cU up?\u201d John Cho and Leslie Mann then took the stage to clumsily explain the Oscars\u2019 sci-tech awards ceremony, an event \u201cso prestigious, none of you were invited,\u201d Mann said.\u00a0 Javier Bardem and Meryl Streep then took the stage to present the award for best cinematography, which went to Linus Sandgren for \u201cLa La Land,\u201d the musical\u2019s second award of the night.\u00a0 Kimmel then unveiled a special Oscars edition of his hit segment, Mean Tweets, featuring Natalie Portman, Ryan Gosling, Samuel L. Jackson and more. A few stars had NSFW comebacks for their critics, including Robert De Niro.\u00a0 Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone then took the stage to introduce the best song nominees from their film, \u201cLa La Land,\u201d welcoming their co-star John Legend to the stage. Legend sang \u201cCity of Stars\u201d from a grand piano, with dancers moving around him. As he transitioned into \u201cAudition (the Fools Who Dream),\u201d the dancers took the air, reliving one of the film\u2019s more iconic moments.\u00a0 After making Lin-Manuel Miranda blush and being tripped by Matt Damon, Kimmel introduced presenter Samuel L. Jackson, in attendance to announce the winner the best original score, which went to \u201cLa La Land\u201d composer Justin Hurwitz.\u00a0 Jackson\u2019s \u201cAvengers\u201d co-star Scarlett Johansson then took the stage to present best original song, which brought Hurwitz back to the stage to accept the Oscar for the \u201cLa La Land\u201d track \u201cCity of Stars.\u201d\u00a0 Jennifer Aniston then took the stage to present a longer-than-usual In Memoriam segment, with tributes to Carrie Fisher, Prince, Gene Wilder and more. She made a special mention for Bill Paxton, who\u2019d passed away Saturday. Sarah Bareilles performed Joni Mitchell\u2019s \u201cBoth Sides Now\u201d as images of those the Academy lost in the last year played on screen.\u00a0 Changing tone, Kimmel then presented a clip about how he\u2019s inspired by Matt Damon\u2019s performance in \u201cWe Bought a Zoo.\u201d Damon and his \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d co-writer, Ben Affleck, then took the stage to present the Oscar they won nearly 20 years ago, best original screenplay -- only Damon was only introduced as \u201cand guest.\u201d Then, whenever Damon spoke, the orchestra would attempt to play him off, with Kimmel conducting.\u00a0 Once things settled down, the Oscar went to Kenneth Lonergan for \u201cManchester by the Sea.\u201d\u00a0 Amy Adams then took the stage in a shimmering silver gown to present best adapted screenplay to Barry Jenkins and Tarell Alvin McCraney for \u201cMoonlight.\u201d\u00a0 Worried that the candy wasn\u2019t doing enough to tide the crowd over, Kimmel then unleashed parachutes filled with cookies and doughnuts. \u201cIt\u2019s like a horror movie,\u201d he said. \u201cGluten is literally falling from the sky.\u201d\u00a0 Halle Berry took the stage to present the award for best director, which went to Damien Chazelle for \u201cLa La Land,\u201d making him the youngest winner in the category in Oscar history.\u00a0 Then, with another highlight reel of past speeches, it was time for the Oscar for best actor, with Brie Larson presenting the award to \u201cManchester by the Sea\u201d star Casey Affleck, who gave a humbled and shy acceptance speech, thanking fellow nominee Denzel Washington for teaching him to act -- despite the fact that they met for the first time that night.\u00a0 Leonardo DiCaprio then took the stage to present best actress to \u201cLa La Land\u201d star Emma Stone. \u201cI realize that a moment like this is a huge confluence of luck and opportunity,\u201d she said. \u201cI still have a lot of growing and learning to work to do, and this guy is a really beautiful symbol to continue on that journey.\u201d Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway -- celebrating the 50th anniversary of \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d -- took the stage to present best picture -- or, as Kimmel described it, \u201ca chance to see Matt Damon lose an Academy Award.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cOur goal in our politics is the same as our goal in art: to get to the truth,\u201d Beatty said, adding that the nominated films \u201cshow us the growing diversity in our community and a respect for diversity all over the world.\u201d That final honor of the night appeared to go to the most nominated film of the night, \u201cLa La Land,\u201d with the producers going through their acceptance speeches before it became clear that Beatty and Dunaway had actually made a mistake and \u201cMoonlight\u201d was the best picture winner.\u00a0 \u201cI opened the envelope and it said Emma Stone for \u2018La La Land,\u2019\u201d Beatty explained. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to be funny.\u201d\u00a0 The team for \u201cMoonlight\u201d then took the stage in bewilderment. Barry Jenkins and producer Adele Romanski accepted the award while trying to make sense of what was happening to them.\u00a0 \u201cI knew I would screw this show up,\u201d Kimmel said as he closed the show. \u201cAt least we got to see some extra speeches.\u201d\u00a0 Later, Price Waterhouse Coopers issued this statement: \u201cWe sincerely apologize to \u201cMoonlight,\u201d \u201cLa La Land,\u201d Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, and Oscar viewers for the error that was made during the award announcement for Best Picture. The presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected. We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred. \u201cWe appreciate the grace with which the nominees, the Academy, ABC, and Jimmy Kimmel handled the situation.\u201d Ned Ehrbar is an entertainment producer for CBS News.",

            "article_content": "A poem recited by Alicia Keys, a simple request from Scarlett Johansson and a stage showered with shredded newspaper thanks to Michael Moore \u2014 these were all moments that caused Women\u2019s March on Washington attendees to explode with loud cheers. Hundreds of thousands of protesters watched speakers and performers\u2019 passionate pleas, speeches and song on Saturday\u2014 so many speakers, in fact, that the march was delayed by nearly two hours. But marchers didn\u2019t seem to mind. People surrounded the stage as celebrities, activists and politicians took their turns delivering their unique, inspirational messages.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a look at several moments from the speeches that went viral: America Ferrera, a vocal Hillary Clinton supporter in the 2016 election, led the charge early Saturday as she stepped on stage to express her hopes and fears, a day after President Donald Trump was sworn in. \u201cA platform of hate and division assumed power yesterday,\u201d Ferrera started. The actress then explained why she felt women should march in protest of President Trump. \u201cWe march today for the moral core of this nation, against which our new president is waging a war,\u201d Ferrera told the Washington crowd. \u201cOur dignity, our character, our rights have all been under attack and a platform of hate and division assumed power yesterday. But the president is not America. ... We are America and we are here to stay.\u201d\u00a0 Gloria Steinem pulled out a piece of paper as she stepped to the podium, kicking off her speech with sharp criticism of President Trump.\u00a0 \u201cTo paraphrase a famous quote, I just want to say, \u2018I have met the people and you are not them,\u2019\u201d said Steinem, directing her message to the president. \u201cWe are the people.\u201d\u00a0 The Women\u2019s March in Washington, D.C. alone required a thousand more busses than the entire inauguration, Steinem added. One line in the veteran activist\u2019s wide-ranging speech left people talking:\u00a0 \u201cI was just talking to people from our many sister marches, including the one in Berlin, and they asked me to send a special message: We in Berlin know that walls don\u2019t work,\u201d said Steinem, mocking Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to build a wall along the southern border with Mexico. \u201cWho wants to be in my next movie here?\u201d Michael Moore joked as he walked on stage to cheers. The filmmaker pulled out a copy of Saturday\u2019s Washington Post, pointing at a headline that read, \u201cTrump takes power.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Moore shouted. \u201cHere\u2019s the power! Here\u2019s the majority of America right here. We are the majority.\u201d Shortly after, Moore ripped a copy of the paper on stage, joking, \u201cI\u2019ll pick it up later.\u201d Admitting he couldn\u2019t follow Gloria Steinem, Moore said he didn\u2019t want to give the traditional speech and quickly got to the point. On Monday, Moore said,\u00a0call your senators and tell them, \u201cWe do not accept Betsy DeVos as our secretary of education.\u201d Betsy DeVos, President Trump\u2019s nominee for education secretary, faced the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee this week, fielding tough questions from Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Al Franken. The conversation got especially tense when Sen. Al Franken confronted her on the problem of student debt in America. \"Planned Parenthood is not the problem \u2014 we're the solution,\" says Cecile Richards at a Women's March rally: http://cbsn.ws/2kdJnDw Dressed in vibrant magenta, Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood, thanked everyone at the Women\u2019s March on Washington for continuing to \u201cfight.\u201d \u201cToday, we\u2019re here to deliver a message \u2014 we\u2019re not going to take this lying down,\u201d Richards exclaimed. \u201cFor the majority of people in this country, Planned Parenthood is not the problem \u2014 we\u2019re the solution.\u201d Richards then mirrored a message spread by Hillary Clinton, who she called her \u201cheroine\u201d: \u201cReproductive rights are human rights.\u201d A bundled-up Scarlett Johansson also read from a piece of paper as she delivered a speech to thousands of people at the nation\u2019s capital.\u00a0 Unlike those before her, Johansson had a simple plea for the new president: \u201cSupport me.\u201d \u201cI respect that you are our president-elect,\u201d Johansson began. \u201cAnd I want to be able to support you. But first, I ask, that you support me. Support my sister. Support my mother. Support my best friend and all of our girlfriends. Support the men and women here today that are anxiously awaiting to see how your next moves may drastically affect their lives.\u201d \"These girls are on fire,\" sings Alicia Keys while walking the stage at #WomensMarch rally https://t.co/TgJ6U199TR pic.twitter.com/6XBLRieX1E \u201cAre you ready to march?\u201d Alicia Keys asked an enthusiastic crowd as she strutted along the stage in Washington, D.C. on Saturday. The singer pulled out a scrunched up piece of paper and began to passionately read \u2014 with long pauses \u2014 Maya Angelou\u2019s famous poem, \u201cStill I Rise.\u201d \u201cI am the dream and the hope of the slave. I rise. I rise. I rise,\u201d Keys read. When finishing the poem, Keys addressed women in the crowd, \u201cWe will not allow our bodies to be owned and controlled by men in government or any men anywhere for that matter.\u201d The crowd cheered. Slowly, motioning the audience to sing along, Keys then sang her popular song, \u201cGirl on Fire\u201d \u2014 but this time, it wasn\u2019t just about one girl, but girls, plural. \u201cThese girls are on fire,\u201d Keys ad-libbed, as the crowd went wild. Madonna was one of the final artists to speak at the Women\u2019s March in Washington, D.C., and left after a quote that may yet land her in hot water. Wearing bright orange, baggy pants and a black hat with pointy ears, Madonna said: \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m angry,\u201d Madonna stated, pointing to her chest. \u201cYes, I am outraged. Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.\u201d The singer then cursed several times on stage. In fact, the phrase \u201cF-bombs\u201d soon began to trend on Twitter, as people counted hearing at least three throughout her speech. After closing her speech, the pop star performed two hit songs, \u201cExpress Yourself\u201d and \u201cHuman Nature.\u201d During breaks in the songs, the singer continued to use vulgar remarks about the president.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- President Trump is set to meet his first world leader since taking office -- British Prime Minister Theresa May, a friendly ally who hopes to nudge the populist president toward the political mainstream. The visit Friday comes a day after Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto called off his own trip to Washington, planned for next week, amid wrangling over who will pay for Mr. Trump\u2019s planned wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Mr. Trump\u2019s spokesman said the president would seek a 20 percent tax on Mexican imports to pay for the barrier, then later clarified that such a tax was just part of a \u201cbuffet of options\u201d to pay for the wall May\u2019s meeting with the president in the Oval Office is being hailed by the British government as a sign that the trans-Atlantic \u201cspecial relationship\u201d is valued by the new administration. The White House said late Thursday that May and Trump would hold talks, followed by a press conference and a working lunch -- in a statement that misspelled the prime minister\u2019s first name as Teresa. It was later corrected. May\u2019s visit, so soon after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, has been criticized by her political opponents, and risks being overshadowed by the flood of announcements, plans and proposals coming out of the White House.\u00a0 On Thursday May was repeatedly asked about Britain\u2019s stance on torture -- the U.K. condemns it -- after Mr. Trump said he thinks torturing terrorism suspects works. Mr. Trump is something of a mystery to world leaders, many of whom expected Democrat Hillary Clinton to win the election.\u00a0 His administration\u2019s main interlocutors with foreign governments so far -- including son-in-law Jared Kushner and senior adviser Steve Bannon, a conservative media executive -- are also unknown to many of their counterparts. So May is a bit of a scouting party -- or guinea pig -- among global politicians. She has strong reasons for wanting the relationship to work. Britain is set to leave the European Union, or \u201cBrexit,\u201d and its 500 million-person single market. A trade deal with the U.S., Britain\u2019s biggest export market, is a major prize. Mr. Trump has drawn parallels between Britain\u2019s choice to leave the EU and his own success, using the Brexit vote to bolster his derision of the 28-nation bloc and his preference for striking bilateral agreements. That puts May in an awkward spot. She wants a good relationship with Mr. Trump, but does not share his disdain for the EU, saying it\u2019s in Britain\u2019s interests that it succeed. Mr. Trump and May both addressed a Republican retreat Thursday in Philadelphia, though their visits did not overlap. During his remarks to lawmakers, Mr. Trump bemoaned the fact that Wilbur Ross, his nominee to be commerce secretary, would not be confirmed in time for a visit that was expected to focus heavily on trade. \u201cI don\u2019t have my commerce secretary. They want to talk trade,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding with a smile: \u201cSo I\u2019ll have to handle it myself.\u201d May\u2019s speech alternated between saluting Mr. Trump\u2019s vision for what she called American \u201crenewal\u201d and reminding him, and his Republican colleagues, of the United States\u2019 global responsibilities. May urged the U.S. to join Britain and embrace \u201cthe responsibility of leadership in the modern world.\u201d She mentioned the trans-Atlantic alliance during World War II and afterward, when the U.K. and the U.S. set up the United Nations and NATO - organizations that Mr. Trump has strongly criticized. She joined in Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism of previous U.S. governments\u2019 foreign policy, saying that \u201cthe days of Britain and America intervening in sovereign countries in an attempt to remake the world in our own image are over.\u201d But May also said Britain supported a strong European Union and considered NATO the bulwark of global security. May praised Mr. Trump\u2019s dedication to fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and Islamic extremism in general, but she stressed -- as President Trump\u2019s administration pushes for new U.S. entry restrictions on people from certain Muslim-majority nations -- the need not to tarnish \u201cthe peaceful religion of Islam and the hundreds of millions of its adherents.\u201d May acknowledged the need to engage with Russia to end the\u00a0war in Syria, yet cautioned that the West\u2019s approach to President Vladimir Putin should be \u201cengage but beware.\u201d There are few obvious similarities between the brash American businessman and the quiet, diligent May. In her speech, May referred several times to Republican President Ronald Reagan and Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher -- politicians from very different backgrounds who forged an alliance that helped transform their parties, and the world. And, she said aboard her plane, \u201csometimes opposites attract.\u201d",

            "article_content": "During his first week in office, President Donald Trump has been busy exercising his presidential pen. He has signed a series of executive actions ranging from slowing the implementation of Obamacare to fulfilling his campaign promise of building a wall along the southern border with Mexico. But what exactly are executive actions? And just how meaningful are these actions taken by President Trump?\u00a0 Executive actions get their power from Article II of the Constitution. There are a number of different edicts that fall under this category\u2014from presidential proclamations to presidential directives-- but the two most important are executive orders and presidential memoranda. Executive orders carry the greatest weight. \u201cIt\u2019s a document that orders the executive branch officials to do something,\u201d as Saikrishna Prakash, a law professor at the University of Virginia puts it. So far Trump has signed four executive orders (President Obama had signed 279 by the time he was done).\u00a0 These orders are required by law to be recorded in the Federal Register and archived which means there is always a binding document recording the action. The Constitution grants Congress the power to write legislation, executive orders are the president\u2019s tool to implement lasting and meaningful policy within the powers granted to a president in the Constitution. For instance, Harry Truman\u2019s Executive Order 9981 integrated the armed forces and John Kennedy\u2019s Executive Order 10925 created the requirement that government contractors had to implement affirmative action policies. If a president issues an executive orders telling federal agencies to act outside of the powers given to the executive branch in the Constitution it is meaningless. One of Obama\u2019s first acts as president was to sign an order closing the military prison Guantanamo Bay, something he campaigned heavily on in the 2008 election, but without congressional approval it was unenforceable.\u00a0 Congress refused to authorize the transfer of inmates to U.S. soil and the prison remains open today. Presidential memoranda\u00a0are next on the hierarchical ladder. Due to the blurred nature of their use and power they have been called \u201cexecutive orders by another name\u201d The president uses this tool to state the administration\u2019s position on a more general scope of policy. John Hudak of the Brookings Institute notes an advantage presidents have of using presidential memorandums over executive orders is, \u201cthey [executive orders] have taken on such a pejorative connotation.\u201d This \u201cpejorative connotation\u201d stems from the fear of presidents abusing their power by going around congress to implement their own laws.\u00a0 In the public eye and in an increasingly political atmosphere, presidential memoranda sound less harmful than executive orders. Memorandums act as proposals to persuade, rather than order bureaucracies to move in a certain direction. \u00a0So far President Trump has issued eight memorandums ranging from removing the U.S. from the Trans- Pacific Partnership (TPP) to instituting a hiring freeze within the federal government. The distinctions between these presidential edicts are blurry and the Constitution does not give them any formal definition. Although presidents have historically relied on executive orders, President Obama and (so far in his first week) President Trump have used presidential memoranda to cast their influence over specific policies.\u00a0 Both actions have a binding effect on the entire executive branch. Dr. Lara Brown Associate Professor and Interim Director of the George Washington University School of Political Management sees a political motive in the growth of all this presidential paper. \u201cPresidents have promised more and more,\u201d she says \u201cand have not been any more successful working with congress.\u201d Brown says because of this, presidents have sought to do more on their own. So what is the significance of Trump\u2019s executive actions so far? \u00a0Congress still has the \u201cpower of the purse\u201d and it would take their action to implement some of what Trump lays out in his orders and memoranda. For example, while President Trump can sign an executive order telling his agencies and departments to begin the construction of a wall, it is up to congress to appropriate the funds necessary for the wall to actually be built. Unlike Obama\u2019s failure to close Gitmo, Trump has a congress willing to work with him. Cristina Rodriguez a law professor at Yale, says it\u2019s important not to get too caught up on the particular edicts a president uses, but to focus on \u201cwhat actually gets done.\u201d This will be Mr. Trump\u2019s test as he continues to push his large political agenda and trying to rally members in congress to enact the proposals he has put forward.

            "article_content": "NEW YORK - Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s long-term vision for Facebook (FB), laid out in a sweeping manifesto, sometimes sounds more like a utopian social guide than a business plan. Are we, he asks, \u201cbuilding the world we all want?\u201d While most people now use Facebook to connect with friends and family, Zuckerberg hopes that the social network can encourage more civic engagement, an informed public and community support in the years to come. Facebook now has nearly 2 billion members, which makes it larger than any nation in the world. \u201cFacebook stands for bringing us closer together and building a global community.... Yet now, across the world there are people left behind by globalization, and movements for withdrawing from global connection,\u201d Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook in a Harvard dorm room in 2004, wrote in a post on his page on Thursday. \u201cIn times like these, the most important thing we at Facebook can do is develop the social infrastructure to give people the power to build a global community that works for all of us.\u201d In a phone interview with The Associated Press, Zuckerberg stressed that he wasn\u2019t motivated by any one particular event \u2014 not even the U.S. election \u2014 to write the 5,500-word missive, which he\u2019s been working on for the past month on nights and weekends. Rather, he said, it\u2019s the growing sentiment in many parts of the world that \u201cconnecting the world\u201d \u2014 the founding idea behind Facebook \u2014 is no longer a good thing. Zuckerberg, 32, said he still strongly believes that more connectedness is the right direction for the world. But, he adds, it\u2019s \u201cnot enough if it\u2019s good for some people but it\u2019s doesn\u2019t work for other people. We really have to bring everyone along.\u201d The letter is short on specific details and plans Facebook has in the works. And it does not mention anything about Facebook as a business, its billions in advertising revenue or the targeting it is often criticized for. Zuckerberg said Facebook provides regular updates on how its business is doing and product launches \u2014 and this is meant to be different. Facebook began as a way for Harvard students to connect with other Harvard students online. Over the years it expanded to include other college and university students, high schoolers, then people who were no longer in school ... and then everyone, really. At least those lucky enough to have an internet connection and a computer or smartphone. Or even an old, basic phone for a \u201clite\u201d version available in developing countries. Today, most of Facebook\u2019s 1.86 billion members \u2014 about 85 percent \u2014 live outside of the U.S. and Canada. The Menlo Park, California-based company has offices everywhere from Amsterdam to Jakarta to Tel Aviv. (It is banned in China, the world\u2019s most populous country, though some people get around it.) Naturally, Zuckerberg takes a global view of Facebook and sees potential that goes beyond borders, cities and nations. People use Facebook to share photos of babies and pets, to connect with strangers who have the same rare disease, to post political diatribes, to share news links (and sometimes fake news links ). Facebook has also pushed its users to register to vote, to donate to causes, to mark themselves safe after natural disasters, and to \u201cgo live.\u201d\u00a0 For many, it\u2019s become a utility. Some 1.23 billion people use it daily. How people use Facebook is evolving. Increasingly, people use it to connect with strangers based on shared interests. In groups, people talk about everything from knitting to parenting to political activism . More than 100 million people are in at least one Facebook group, though Zuckerberg wants way more. He laments the fading of traditional social communities such as churches, labor unions and local groups. \u201cA healthy society needs these communities to support our personal, emotional and spiritual needs,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote. \u201cIn a world where this physical social infrastructure has been declining, we have a real opportunity to help strengthen these communities and the social fabric of our society.\u201d Zuckerberg has gotten Facebook to this position of global dominance \u2014 one that Myspace and Twitter, for instance, never even approached \u2014 partly thanks to his audacious, long-term view of the company and its place in the world. Rather than getting fixated on the next quarter\u2019s profit or the next day\u2019s user uproar, he tends to consider Facebook 5, 10 or more years into the future. It\u2019s as grandiose as it\u2019s been successful, at least so far. \u201cFor the past decade, Facebook has focused on connecting friends and families. With that foundation, our next focus will be developing the social infrastructure for community \u2014 for supporting us, for keeping us safe, for informing us, for civic engagement, and for inclusion of all,\u201d he wrote. Last fall, Zuckerberg and his wife, the doctor Priscilla Chan, unveiled the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a long-term effort aimed at eradicating all disease by the end of this century. Then, as now, Zuckerberg preferred to look far down the road to the potential of scientific and technological innovations that have not been perfected, or even invented yet. This includes artificial intelligence. \u201cThe long term promise of AI is that in addition to identifying risks more quickly and accurately than would have already happened, it may also identify risks that nobody would have flagged at all \u2014 including terrorists planning attacks using private channels, people bullying someone too afraid to report it themselves, and other issues both local and global,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt will take many years to develop these systems.\u201d Speaking to the AP, \u00a0Zuckerberg said he understands that we might not \u201csolve all the issues that we want\u201d in the short term. \u201cOne of my favorite quotes is this Bill Gates quote, that \u2018people overestimate what they can get done in two years and underestimate what they can get done in 10 years.\u2019 And that\u2019s an important mindset that I hope more people take today,\u201d he said.",

The law is expected to be challenged in Israel\u2019s Supreme Court and is likely to face legal hurdles.\u00a0 The law retroactively legalizes several thousand homes built illegally on private Palestinian land. The original landowners would be compensated either with money or alternative land, even if they do not agree to give up their property.

Mr. Trump has been perceived as sympathetic to settlements, an issue at the heart of the Israel-Palestinian conflict that was a frequent source of friction between his predecessor, Barack Obama, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Israeli nationalists have believed they now have an ally in the White House. But last week, the White House said while the administration doesn\u2019t \u201cbelieve the existence of settlements is an impediment to peace, the construction of new settlements or the expansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders may not be helpful in achieving that goal.\u201d The international community overwhelmingly opposes settlements and sees them as an obstacle to peace. \u00a0",

            "article_content": "President Trump is still weighing moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, according to an interview he gave to an Israeli news outlet.  In the interview published Friday with Israel Hayom, the president was asked how soon he would make a decision on relocating the embassy to the holy city of Jerusalem from Tel Aviv -- a controversial shift that could inflame tensions across the Islamic world.  \u201cI am thinking about the embassy, I am studying the embassy [issue], and we will see what happens,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe embassy is not an easy decision. It has obviously been out there for many, many years, and nobody has wanted to make that decision. I\u2019m thinking about it very seriously, and we will see what happens.\u201d That\u2019s a slight softening from the president\u2019s original campaign promises about the embassy.  In the spring of last year, then-candidate Trump vowed in a speech to pro-Israel lobbying group the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) that he would make the move during his presidency.  \u201cWe will move the American Embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem -- and we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between America and our most reliable ally, the state of Israel,\u201d Mr. Trump said in March. And in December after his election win, he nominated bankruptcy lawyer David Friedman to serve as the U.S. ambassador to Israel, signaling his intention to follow through with this campaign promise. Friedman, who is an Orthodox Jew, said after his nomination in a statement that he looks forward to having \u201cthe U.S. embassy in Israel\u2019s eternal capital, Jerusalem.\u201d That month, top aide to the president Kellyanne Conway also called the promised relocation a \u201cvery big priority\u201d for the next administration.  The interview with Israel Hayom -- a paper owned by casino magnate and Republican mega-donor Sheldon Adelson -- also touched on the issue of Israeli settlements and their effect on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.  The president seemed to strike a harder line on the construction of more settlements. \u201cThey [settlements] don\u2019t help the process, I can say that,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThere is so much land left. And every time you take land for settlements, there is less land left. But we are looking at that, and we are looking at some other options we\u2019ll see. But no, I am not somebody that believes that going forward with these settlements is a good thing for peace.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s comments come just days before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to visit the White House.  In the weeks since Mr. Trump officially took office, the Israeli government announced the building of more than 5,000 new houses in the occupied West Bank and retroactively legalized thousands of settlement homes on Palestinian land. Netanyahu has also floated the idea of constructing completely new settlements -- the first in years.  Last week, however, the White House issued a statement warning against the continued construction of new settlements. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that the existence of current settlements is an impediment to peace, but I think the construction or expansion of existing settlements beyond the current borders is not going to be helpful moving forward,\u201d White House spokesperson Sean Spicer said in a statement.  In the interview with Israel Hayom, however, the president stated he did not want to \u201ccondemn\u201d Israel.  \u201cIsrael has had a long history of condemnation and difficulty. And I don\u2019t want to be condemning Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand Israel very well, and I respect Israel a lot, and they have been through a lot. I would like to see peace and beyond that. And I think that peace for Israel would be a good thing for the Israeli people, not just a good thing, a great thing.\u201d Mr. Trump is expected to meet with Netanyahu in Washington Wednesday. ",

Michael Flynn, spoke to the Russian ambassador about four issues including a Dec. 25 plane crash, Syria and ISIS and setting up a phone call between Mr. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\u00a0 2:55 p.m. After Spicer slammed the press for its coverage of Mr. Trump throughout the campaign and doubting his potential, Spicer claimed that the first few rows during Mr. Trump\u2019s CIA visit Saturday were \u201call CIA.\u201d\u00a0 2:45 p.m. CBS Radio\u2019s Steven Portnoy asked Spicer about a CBS News report from Jeff Pegues that the first few rows of people at CIA headquarters Saturday during Mr. Trump\u2019s visit were his own people cheering him on.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s accurate at all,\u201d Spicer said, adding that he doesn\u2019t have a seat chart and that only about 10 people from the White House attended the event.\u00a0 2:42 p.m. Spicer is asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s intentions on Social Security and whether infrastructure reform is still a priority. The president, he said, \u201chas been very clear about preserving and protecting this very important benefit to our seniors.\u201d He added that Mr. Trump is still focused on making infrastructure a \u201chuge priority.\u201d\u00a0 2:37 p.m. Spicer is asked whether Mr. Trump plans to repeal or maintain an Obama administration policy to bar LGBT worker\u2019s discrimination.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Spicer said.\u00a0 2:35 p.m. Spicer said he doesn\u2019t expect Mr. Trump to issue any additional executive orders today, but expects more throughout the week, especially on trade. 2:32 p.m. Spicer is asked if Mr. Trump has spoken with anyone on the investigation into Russian interference in the election and if he would stop the probe. Spicer said he doesn\u2019t believe he\u2019s spoken with anyone on that and hasn\u2019t indicated that he would stop any such investigation.\u00a0 2:27 p.m. Spicer was asked what the Trump administration is going to do to address climate change.\u00a0 \u201cI think he\u2019s going to meet with his team and figure out what policies are going to be best,\u201d Spicer said, adding that there should be a \u201cbalance\u201d so that the U.S. uses its resources well, that are smart for the environment and also ensures job creation.\u00a0 2:25 p.m. Spicer refused to say what the national unemployment rate is and said that too often, government officials gets their heads wrapped around a number or statistic. 2:19 p.m. CBS\u2019s Margaret Brennan asked Spicer if the memorandum he issued to withdraw from TPP is any more than symbolic.\u00a0 Spicer said that pulling out of the agreement is symbolic because it represents a \u201cnew era of trade policy\u201d that puts American workers first. Spicer added that the U.S. already has existing trade agreements with nations that negotiated TPP and that the deal was an expansion of the status quo.\u00a0 \u201cThis is not a deal that was in our country\u2019s best interest,\u201d Spicer said.\u00a0 2:16 p.m. Spicer is asked what the U.S. interest would be in moving its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, breaking longstanding U.S. policy. Spicer said that no decisions have been made yet, and added, \u201cWe\u2019re at the very early stages of that decision-making process.\u201d 2:10 p.m. ABC\u2019s Jonathan Karl asked Spicer if he intends to tell the truth and pledge to now knowingly provide falsehoods to the press.\u00a0 \u201cIt is. It\u2019s an honor to do this,\u201d Spicer said, adding, \u201cI believe we have to be honest...I think sometimes we can disagree with the facts. Our intention is never to lie to you, Jonathan.\u201d\u00a0 Asked if he wants to make any corrections to the statement he made on Saturday, Spicer dodged the question and said that the numbers for metro ridership he relied on came from an outside group and not the agency that runs the D.C. metro system. He said he didn\u2019t make the numbers up out of thin air.\u00a0 Spicer acknowledged the importance of having a healthy relationship with the press, but then slammed a journalist (who apologized) for inaccurately reporting that the bust of Martin Luther King, Jr., had been removed from the Oval Office. Spicer said that there seems to be an \u201cattempt\u201d by the press to go after Mr. Trump and there\u2019s a \u201crush to judgment every time.\u201d\u00a0 2:06 p.m. The AP\u2019s Julie Pace asked Spicer about reports that Russia coordinated with the U.S. on airstrikes in Syria. Spicer said the situation is \u201cstill developing\u201d and referred reporters to the Department of Defense. Spicer added that Mr. Trump has made clear that the administration would like to work with any country interested in defeating the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).\u00a0 2:04 p.m. April Ryan of American Urban Radio Networks asked Spicer if the Trump administration has a mandate to dismantle Obamacare given the differences in crowd size at his inauguration last Friday and the women\u2019s march on Saturday.\u00a0 \u201cWe have a mandate to make healthcare more accessible and lower cost,\u201d Spicer said. 1:59 p.m. Spicer is asked about reports that the Trump administration plans to work with Congress to pass major cuts to discretionary spending. Spicer said that there\u2019s been \u201ca lack of respect for taxpayer dollars in this town\u201d and that Mr. Trump will work with Congress to save money.\u00a0 1:56 p.m. The series of questions began with one on how soon Mr. Trump will build a border wall. Spicer didn\u2019t give a specific answer and only said that the president is already starting to work with Congress on appropriations for the border wall (even though Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed that Mexico would finance the wall).\u00a0 1:54 p.m. Spicer said that the White House is creating \u201cSkype seats\u201d in the briefing room to journalists who live beyond 50 miles from Washington, D.C., that would open up briefings to a \u201cdiverse group\u201d of journalists to can\u2019t afford traveling to D.C.\u00a0 Mr. Trump will have breakfast with heads of the auto industry on Tuesday, Spicer said, including General Motors, Chrysler and Ford. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump will have a swearing-in ceremony for Homeland Security Secretary Gen. John Kelly. 1:51 p.m. Spicer is still going through a pretty lengthy statement before moving to questions. He detailed the meeting Mr. Trump plans to have later in the day with congressional leaders. He slammed Senate Democrats for not confirming Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kansas, as CIA director on Friday, but the vote is expected to happen on Monday evening. 1:45 p.m. Spicer has begun the press briefing by detailing Mr. Trump\u2019s activities today, including a meeting between the new president and business leaders at the White House. Spicer said he will reconvene the group in a month, and have quarterly meetings after that. He announced that Trump issued a presidential memorandum, withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\u00a0 Spicer said Mr. Trump also signed executive orders, including one that bans U.S. funding to go toward organizations that provide abortions abroad. 1:30 p.m. The new White House press secretary Sean Spicer is about to face the press, two days after he delivered a false statement about the crowd size at Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration on Friday to the White House press corps. The briefing comes after Mr. Trump signed several executive orders on Monday morning.\u00a0 Rebecca Shabad is a video reporter for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, a vocal critic of Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, weighed in on his support of what he said were the president\u2019s \u201cstellar\u201d Cabinet nominees Friday night.  Asked about Rex Tillerson, Mr. Trump\u2019s pick to lead the State Department, Flake pledged a vote to confirm the oil executive.  \u201cI think he\u2019s great,\u201d Flake said in an interview with CBSN.  He went on to praise the rest of Mr. Trump\u2019s Cabinet choices, just as the Senate readies to hold more confirmation votes in the upcoming week.  \u201cBoy, if the president governs like he has picked his Cabinet, then we\u2019re in for a good four years,\u201d Flake told CBSN. \u201cI think they\u2019ll all get through. I look forward to supporting them.\u201d  On Friday, just hours after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration ceremony, the Senate voted on two of the president\u2019s Cabinet nominees. The Senate confirmed Gen. John Kelly with an 88-11 vote to be the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.  Kelly, who succeeds Secretary Jeh Johnson, testified before the Senate Homeland Security Committee at his confirmation hearing last week. Senators also confirmed retired Gen. James Mattis in an overwhelming 98-1 vote to lead the Defense Department. Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump signed a waiver approved by Congress that allows Mattis to serve as the defense secretary, overriding a current law that doesn\u2019t allow the confirmation of a Pentagon chief who has been within seven years of relief from duty. Flake also discussed his support for Steven Mnuchin, the former Goldman Sachs executive who Mr. Trump has chosen to lead the Treasury Department. When asked whether he was \u201cfine\u201d with Mnuchin, Flake, who is already facing critical ads in Arizona over his backing of a Wall Street financier deeply involved in the nation\u2019s housing foreclosure crisis in 2008, responded in the affirmative.  \u201cI give the president -- whether it\u2019s Democrat or Republican -- wide latitude in their Cabinet picks,\u201d said the Arizona Republican. \u201cElections have consequences and we ought to give -- unless there\u2019s some disqualifying aspect -- we ought to give the president who he wants to run the administration.\u201d  In his CBSN interview, Flake also gave his reactions to Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural speech at the U.S. Capitol Friday.  \u201cHe sounded the same themes that he did during the campaign,\u201d Flake said, noting Mr. Trump\u2019s mentions of trade, protecting the border and economic growth. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have expected anything else.\u201d Flake voiced some concerns on the president\u2019s professed views on international trade deals, which Mr. Trump repeatedly vowed to roll back during his 2016 campaign.  Defending trade with Mexico as a benefit to his home state of Arizona, Flake said, \u201cObviously I want to see economic growth first and foremost. I think that comes more with trade.\u201d  \u201cWe\u2019ll see where we go,\u201d he added.",

            "article_content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon says he\u2019s optimistic about the Trump presidency. \u201cHe\u2019s putting professionals in the field -- if you want to win the game, put Tom Brady in the field,\u201d Dimon said Thursday on \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d \u00a0 Dimon, who was at one point considered for the treasury secretary position and serves on President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s strategic and policy forum, said Mr. Trump was selecting \u201cexperienced, successful, smart, patriotic\u201d people for his administration. One of those \u201cprofessionals\u201d among Mr. Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks is Steve Mnuchin, the treasury secretary nominee and a former Goldman Sachs partner, who Dimon said will make a \u201cformidable\u201d team with Mr. Trump.  \u201cI think he\u2019s quite qualified, he\u2019s very smart, he wants to do the right thing,\u201d Dimon said, after revealing that he himself had never been offered the job.  As for Rex Tillerson, who was grilled Wednesday in a confirmation hearing for secretary of state, Dimon also voiced his support, calling the former ExxonMobil CEO a \u201cclass act.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s smart and he\u2019s patriotic. I listen to the press about -- that he had dealings in Russia -- well, almost every big company is dealing with Russia. That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not a patriot. I wouldn\u2019t question his patriotism. The other thing people talk about, that they\u2019re successful. Think of the counterfactual. Do you want to have unsuccessful people in these jobs? \u2026 Successful, experienced, respected by everybody in deals around the world. I think that\u2019s a pretty good trait.\u201d In his first press conference since winning the race, Mr. Trump reminded people about a promise he had made. \u201cI said that I will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created. And I mean that,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Dimon said he hopes Mr. Trump is right. \u00a0 \u201cFor any president, it is important that we have a healthy, vibrant economy,\u201d Dimon said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for jobs, it\u2019s important for businesses, important for middle-class wages, important for low-scale wages, and I\u2019m hoping a lot of the policies they\u2019re talking about \u2013 because they\u2019re talking about trade tax reforms, we desperately need. And that\u2019s probably the most important thing.\u201d\u00a0 The president-elect also said there would be a \u201cvery large border tax\u201d for companies that choose to take U.S. jobs abroad. But Dimon wasn\u2019t worried.  \u201cI\u2019m looking past the one-liners and thinking about what\u2019s important for America. So a lot of us do business all around the world. Part of America\u2019s competitiveness is because we have Microsoft, because we have Boeing, because we have JPMorgan Chase, and we have to educate the world on the importance of that,\u201d Dimon said. \u201cBut there are downsides. So in this election, I guess around the world, you\u2019ve seen people recognizing there are downsides to trade. There are people who have been hurt.\u201d To address that, Dimon said the country needs to do a better job with trade adjustment assistance, where the government helps workers who lost their jobs due to foreign trade. \u201cI think we have to do all of these various things to make sure it works for everybody in America,\u201d Dimon said.  Dimon is heading to Davos, Switzerland, for the next week\u2019s World Economic Forum, where Chinese President Xi Jinping will be in attendance for the first time to promote globalization. With Donald Trump emphasizing an \u201cAmerica First\u201d trade stance and the European Union grappling with a looming Brexi, some have suggested China is now the leader of economic globalization. But Dimon begged to differ.  \u201c[China] is so far behind the United States, it\u2019s not even funny. I say that respectfully,\u201d Dimon said. \u201cThey have 500 million people living in poverty. Not enough food, water, energy. They don\u2019t have our wide, deep capital markets, they don\u2019t have our education system, they don\u2019t have our rule of law, they don\u2019t have most of what we have, our innovation capabilities.\u201d However, he said he understands that \u201cChina wants to rise up among the world and take its rightful place.\u201d  \u201cBut my personal opinion, it\u2019s very important that America maintain its superior economic position which, by the way, is the root, the foundation of a superior military position. They go hand in hand,\u201d Dimon said. \u201cAmerica has been so important for the growth of the world, the consistency of the world, the economic freedom of the world, the spray of democracy that we shouldn\u2019t lose that.\u201d\u00a0 JPMorgan Chase is also awarding 10 states a total of $20 million in grants to provide students who graduate from high school with \u201cthe skills they need to compete for high-skill, well-paying jobs.\u201d  \u201cThere is economic and moral imperative in this country that we get jobs for kids. And we have too many kids, particularly in inner city schools who don\u2019t graduate or if they do graduate, they\u2019re not qualified for a job. So this is all the things they need, from social skills to specific skills to get kids jobs,\u201d Dimon said.\u00a0 They would be preparing for \u201cmiddle class jobs,\u201d Dimon added, which will pay between $40,000 to $60,000 a year.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Outgoing CIA Director John Brennan warned President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday, saying he doesn\u2019t fully understand the threat of Russia -- and that his open criticism of the intelligence community could have effects far outside the United States\u2019 borders.  \u201cI think he has to be mindful that he does not have a full appreciation and understanding of what the implications are of going down that road,\u201d Brennan told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d He also said that once Mr. Trump is inaugurated things will be different for him -- and that he\u2019ll have responsibilities beyond just \u201ctalking and tweeting.\u201d \u201cNow that he\u2019s going to have an opportunity to do something for our national security as opposed to talking and tweeting, he\u2019s going to have tremendous responsibility to make sure that U.S. and national security interests are protected,\u201d Brennan said. Brennan\u2019s comments are indicative of just how much the relationship between Mr. Trump and the intelligence community has soured. Since the U.S. intelligence agencies announced in December that they had \u201chigh confidence\u201d that Russia was working to influence the 2016 presidential election in his favor, Mr. Trump has expressed skepticism in their findings and publicly denounced the leaks from intelligence sources.  The president-elect took to Twitter Sunday evening to respond to Brennan, saying over two tweets, \u201cOh really, couldn\u2019t do much worse - just look at Syria (red line), Crimea, Ukraine and the build-up of Russian nukes. Not good! Was this the leaker of Fake News?\u201d That sustained criticism of the intelligence community is dangerous for more than just morale at the CIA or the FBI, Brennan said: it sends a message to other countries. \u201cThe world is watching now what Trump says and listening very carefully,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t have confidence in the intelligence community, what signal does that send to our partners and allies as well as our adversaries?\u201d As for Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion that intelligence leaks are reminiscent of Nazi Germany, Brennan said the comparison is \u201coutrageous.\u201d He said Mr. Trump needs to think and learn about an issue before he boldly professes his opinion on it: \u201cSpontaneity is not something that protects national security interests,\u201d he said. And when it comes to Russia, Brennan said, any attempts to start over with Russia need to be handled very carefully.  \u201cI think Mr. Trump has to understand that absolving Russia of various actions it has taken in the past number of years is a road that he needs to be very, very careful about moving down.\u201d Brennan\u2019s comments echo those of other top intelligence officials, who say it\u2019s no small thing to challenge the integrity of the country\u2019s intelligence community. Michael Morell, a former acting CIA director under President Obama, told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d last week there would be \u201csignificant effects if the disparagement continues.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism is a \u201cgut punch to people who go to work every day, nonpartisan, apolitical, trying to call it like they see it,\u201d Morell said. \u201c...It has undermined morale in the intelligence community and at CIA and that\u2019s a big issue.\u201d Emily Schultheis is a reporter/editor for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "James Mattis is testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee at his confirmation hearing to become defense secretary under President-elect Donald Trump. After the hearing, the committee is expected to vote to give an exception to a limitation against an appointment for defense secretary within seven years of relief from active duty. Mattis served as commander of U.S. Central Command from 2010 to 2013, commander of the U.S. Joint Forces Command from 2007 to 2010 and NATO\u2019s Supreme Allied Commander of Transformation from 2007 to 2009. 12:50 p.m.\u00a0All Republicans and most Democrats voted in favor of the waiver except Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut and Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts. Gillibrand and Warren could be possible 2020 presidential contenders. 12:34 p.m. The hearing has adjourned and now the committee is about to vote on the waiver for Mattis. 12:31 p.m. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, asked Mattis about whether he agrees with Mr. Trump about his statements on Putin. Mattis said he agrees with the president-elect\u2019s desire \u201cto have an engagement there,\u201d which he said even happened in the midst of the Cold War between the U.S. and the former Soviet Union. \u201cI have very modest expectations about areas of cooperation with Mr. Putin,\u201d Mattis said. 12:15 p.m. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, asked Mattis what he believes the capital of Israel is.\u00a0 \u201cThe capital of Israel, sir, is Tel Aviv because that\u2019s where all of the government people are,\u201d Mattis said. Asked if Jerusalem is Israel\u2019s capital, Mattis deflected and said he is sticking with longstanding, current U.S. policy which is that the U.S. does not recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital.\u00a0 Graham asked Mattis if he would support increasing sanctions against Russia and Mattis said he\u2019d like to meet with the new national security team and \u201ccraft a strategy to confront Russia.\u201d 12:01 p.m. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, a 2016 GOP presidential candidate, said that Mattis will be an \u201cextraordinary defense secretary\u201d and that he\u2019s proud to support him. Cruz predicted that he would be confirmed in a \u201cstrong, bipartisan vote.\u201d 11:58 a.m. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, Hillary Clinton\u2019s vice presidential running mate, asked Mattis if the U.S. military should offer to provide security assistance as part of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019d have to look at the specific commitment,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a going-in prohibition to engaging along those lines.\u201d\u00a0 Asked if it would be an appropriate use of the U.S. military, which would be similar to the assistance provided on the Israel-Egypt border, Mattis said, \u201cIf we can contribute, certainly, it\u2019s something we should look at.\u201d 11:54 a.m. Mattis agreed that the greatest threat to national security is the government\u2019s growing national debt and he said he will \u201csupport strongly\u201d senators who are trying to repeal sequestration. 11:40 a.m. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, brings up Russia\u2019s efforts to build up their military in the Arctic and said that Putin has filled a vacuum left by the U.S. Mattis is asked what the effect is of the U.S. not being actively engaged in that region. Mattis said that it\u2019s \u201cnot to our advantage\u201d to leave any of those areas of the world where U.S. efforts are absent. Asked what Russia is trying to achieve in the Arctic, Mattis said, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d and he added that the U.S. must ensure that Russia doesn\u2019t expand those efforts to dominate the region. Mattis is also asked if he agrees with Chinese officials saying that they\u2019re not militarizing the South China Sea. \u201cNo, I do not,\u201d he said. 11:30 a.m. Mattis said that the \u201cprincipal threat\u201d facing the U.S. is Russia. 11:24 a.m. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, asked Mattis about the plan to defeat ISIS. He said that the U.S. must \u201cdeliver a very hard blow against ISIS in the Middle East.\u201d Mattis said it must be an \u201cintegrated strategy\u201d so that \u201cyou don\u2019t squeeze them in one place and they develop in another.\u201d The strategy, he said, should focus on their recruiting, fundraising and it must deliver a military blow in the Middle East. 11:22 a.m. Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, asked Mattis if there\u2019s something innate in being a woman or being LGBT that would cause him to believe they shouldn\u2019t be part of a lethal force. \u201cNo,\u201d Mattis replied. Hirono asked how he plans to deal with Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets and she alluded to previous tweets he has posted on defense contracts. \u201cIt\u2019s not my role to comment on the president-elect\u2019s statements other than to say it shows he\u2019s serious about getting the best bang for the dollar,\u201d Mattis said. 11:06 a.m. In an exchange with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, Mattis said he plans to address the issues of \u201cpost-traumatic stress\u201d that servicemembers and veterans can experience.\u00a0 \u201cThis cuts to the very heart of any of us who have ordered troops into harm\u2019s way,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cYou have my full commitment on this.\u201d Blumenthal expressed concern about giving Mattis a waiver to serve because the Democratic senator said that civilian control of the military has gone back to the founding of the republic.\u00a0 \u201cIf there were ever a case for a waiver...it is you in this moment in our history,\u201d Blumenthal said. 10:57 a.m. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, asked Mattis about the Pentagon\u2019s decision to open up infantry positions to women and whether he plans to roll back that policy.\u00a0 \u201cSenator, I\u2019ve never come into any job with an agenda, a pre-formed agenda,\u201d Mattis said.\u00a0 Gillibrand said that Mattis had made previous statements opposing that decision, but Mattis said he made those remarks when he was not in a position to return to the government.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m not coming in looking for problems,\u201d Mattis said, adding that he\u2019s looking for ways to ensure the department is at its \u201cmost lethal stance.\u201d Pressed again on whether he plans to oppose women in combat positions, Mattis said, \u201cI have no plan to oppose women in any aspect of our military.\u201d Gillibrand asked Mattis if openly serving gay servicemembers are undermining U.S. forces. He said that he believes the U.S. must stay focused on a military that\u2019s so lethal that it would be the worst day for enemies on the battlefield.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve never cared much about two consenting adults and who they go to bed with,\u201d he added. 10:51 a.m. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Nebraska, asked Mattis about the lack of a cyber policy. He said that it\u2019s important to make clear what the U.S. stands for and what it won\u2019t tolerate in the cyber realm. He said putting together a cyber policy is not something the Pentagon can do alone and that it must work together with the Treasury Department, Commerce Department and Homeland Security Department.\u00a0 Mattis said that the nation\u2019s cyber policy must be addressed on \u201can urgent basis.\u201d 10:44 a.m. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-New Hampshire, asked Mattis about the importance of maintaining NATO and if he\u2019s concerned with Mr. Trump\u2019s previous comments on the alliance.\u00a0 Mattis called NATO \u201cthe most successful military alliance, probably in modern history, maybe ever.\u201d He stressed it\u2019s important to \u201cmaintain the strong possible relationship with NATO.\u201d Mattis dodged questions about whether he\u2019s concerned with the president-elect\u2019s remarks, except he said Mr. Trump has \u201cshown himself to be open.\u201d 10:37 a.m. Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi, asked Mattis about the Obama administration\u2019s decision to abstain on the vote on the United Nations Security Council resolution on Israeli settlements in the West Bank.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019d have to get back and look at that,\u201d said Mattis, who said that he only has read about it in the newspaper. \u201cI don\u2019t have an authoritative view of that right now.\u201d Mattis emphasized that the U.S. must promote peace between Israel and the Palestinians.\u00a0 \u201cI think we\u2019ve got to restore a better relationship with Israel and with our Arab allies,\u201d he said.\u00a0 10:32 a.m. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, asked Mattis about the overseas contingency operations (OCO) fund that the Pentagon has relied on to fund overseas military operations like fighting ISIS, which falls outside budget caps.\u00a0 Mattis said that the Defense Department, under his leadership, would propose what is needed for OCO and the base budget at the department. He said his desire is for \u201ceverything to be in the base budget\u201d and then to come to Congress when there are emergencies, but admitted, \u201cWe are not in a position to dictate that.\u201d 10:26 a.m. Reed has begun questioning Mattis, who said he has \u201cvery, very high degree of confidence in our intelligence community.\u201d\u00a0 This comes after President-elect Donald Trump had repeatedly questioned the intelligence community\u2019s findings on Russian interference in the election. 10:17 a.m. McCain has begun questioning Mattis and asked if he believes the Pentagon has a plan to regain control of Raqqa. \u201cI believe we do, sir,\u201d Mattis said, but added that he believes that strategy needs to be reviewed and possibly \u201cenergized on a more aggressive timeline.\u201d McCain asked what the U.S. should do to combat Russian aggression in the Baltics and in eastern Ukraine. Mattis said that the U.S. has tried to engage positively with Russia in the past, but it\u2019s a short list of successes. He said that Putin is trying to dismantle NATO and that the U.S. should take diplomatic, military and joint action with alliances to \u201cdefend ourselves.\u201d Mattis said that deterrence is necessary to fight Russia. Asked if the U.S. military is strong enough to defend against the many threats in the world, Mattis said, \u201cNo.\u201d 10:10 a.m. Mattis is delivering his opening statement, naming Russia among some of the major threats facing the U.S. He said his nomination was a surprise as he was enjoying life west of the Rockies.\u00a0 \u201cIf the Senate consents and if the full Congress passes an exception to the seven-year requirement, I will provide strong civilian leadership of military plans and decisions. I recognize under the Constitution it is the Congress that raises, sustains, and supports our Armed Forces through annual authorizations and appropriations,\u201d Mattis said.\u00a0 \u201cI am mindful of the extraordinary privilege it is to be nominated for this position. I will hold service members, civilians, and their families foremost in my thoughts and work to give them the best chance for victory if you confirm me.\u201d Mattis said his top priorities would be military readiness, reforming the Defense Department and strengthening international alliances.\u00a0 10:00 a.m. Reed has begun his opening statement and said that Mattis, if confirmed, would lead the department when the U.S. faces many complex and multifaceted challenges.\u00a0 Reed named Iran, North Korea and Russia as threats and strategic challenges. He said he\u2019s interested in hearing from Mattis what his vision is to improve U.S. cyber defenses.\u00a0 He said he supports the move by Defense Secretary Ash Carter to open up combat positions and other positions in the military to women. 9:49 a.m. McCain said that members of the panel will consider legislation after the hearing to pass a statutory waiver to allow Mattis to serve as defense secretary. He has now begun his opening statement. McCain slammed the Obama administration for creating a \u201cperception around the world that America is weak and distracted,\u201d which he said has only emboldened America\u2019s enemies. He talked about the threat of radical Islamic terrorism and said that the U.S. will be \u201cengaged in a global conflict of varying scope and intensity for the foreseeable future.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cYou would lead a military at war,\u201d McCain said to Mattis.\u00a0 McCain added that the central challenge in the Middle East is not the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), but a breakdown in regional order and the terror group, he said, is a symptom of that.\u00a0 McCain also emphasized that Russia poses a threat to the U.S. and that it never wants to be America\u2019s friend. He said the U.S. must \u201cbuild a position of national strength against Russia\u201d and must \u201cre-establish deterrence.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cEach of our last three presidents has had great expectations of building a partnership with the Russian government. Each attempt has failed, not for lack of good faith and effort on the U.S. side, but because of a stubborn fact that we must finally recognize: Putin wants to be our enemy. He needs us as his enemy. He will never be our partner, including in fighting ISIL. He believes that strengthening Russia means weakening America. We must proceed realistically on this basis,\u201d McCain said. He also said that sequestration has caused, over the last five years, for national defense spending to be \u201carbitrarily capped,\u201d which he said has damaged military readiness. \u201cThe Budget Control Act is harming us in ways that our enemies can only dream,\u201d said McCain, who said it must be repealed.\u00a0 McCain said that the U.S. needs Mattis to lead the Pentagon and that over the last several years, he\u2019s witnessed a \u201csteady loss of trust\u201d and deteriorating relations between the department and members of Congress. 9:33 a.m.\u00a0Former Sen. Sam Nunn, R-Georgia, who introduced Rex Tillerson at this confirmation hearing for secretary of state yesterday, is among those introducing Mattis today. Nunn said Mattis is \u201cexceptionally well-qualified to lead the department of defense\u201d and he urged the panel to pass a statutory waiver to allow Mattis to lead the Pentagon.\u00a0 Former Secretary of Defense William Cohen, a former Republican senator who led the Pentagon under President Bill Clinton, is also introducing Mattis. He called Mattis a \u201cwarrior by nature\u201d and said \u201cwhat characterizes James Mattis is his courage.\u201d 9:30 a.m. James Mattis\u2019 confirmation hearing to become defense secretary is about to begin before the Senate Armed Services Committee. The panel is chaired by Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, and the top Democrat is Sen. Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island.\u00a0 The New York Times reported Thursday morning that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, will oppose Mattis\u2019 nomination.\u00a0 Rebecca Shabad is a video reporter for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton on Friday encouraged 2017 college graduates to stand up for \"truth and reason\" as she suggested President Trump has launched a \"full-fledged\" assault on those ideals.  \"When people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society,\" the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee warned in a commencement address at her alma mater, Wellesley College, in Wellesley, Massachusetts.  That's not hyperbole -- \"It is what authoritarian regimes throughout history have done,\" she said. \"You are graduating at a time when there is a full-fledged assault on truth and reason,\" Clinton told the class of 2017.  Clinton spoke about people who deny science and of those who concocted a conspiracy theory about her operating a child abuse ring out of a Washington, D.C.-based pizza parlor last year. \"Some are even denying things we see with our own eyes -- like the size of crowds,\" she said, referencing Mr. Trump's false characterization of the crowd size at his inauguration in January.  Clinton called Mr. Trump's 2018 budget proposal \"a con,\" which she said would underfund public education, mental health, efforts to combat the opioid epidemic and fight climate change. She spoke about Americans who have lost faith in the political, cultural, economic and societal conditions in the U.S., acknowledging that \"many feel left behind, left out, looked down on.\" She said these same people don't want \"DREAMERs deported or health care taken away\" and \"many don't want to retreat on civil rights, women's rights and LGBT rights.\"  She spoke about her graduation from Wellesley in 1969, and recalled the election of President Nixon a year earlier. \"We were furious about the past presidential election -- of a man whose presidency would eventually end in disgrace for his impeachment for obstruction of justice,\" she said, drawing applause from the crowd, at a time when some Democrats have said Mr. Trump committed obstruction of justice and should be impeached. \"We got through that tumultuous time.\"  Clinton said that the future of the nation depends on young people who \"insist on truth and integrity.\"  \"You didn't create these circumstances but you have the power to change them,\" said Clinton,\" who said the students might face \"trolls galore\" who \"may even call you 'a nasty woman,'\" referencing a phrase she embraced on the 2016 campaign trail, after Mr. Trump used the phrase about her during their third presidential debate.\u00a0 She said she's been \"doing okay\" since her election upset last November, which she joked has involved long walks in the woods, \"organizing my closets\" and she said \"chardonnay helped a little, too.\"  Clinton urged the students to make \"defending truth and a free society a core value\" of their life every day after their graduation.  \"Wherever you wind up next, the minute you get there, register to vote,\" she said. \"While you're at it, encourage others to do so...and vote in every election.\"\u00a0 Rebecca Shabad is a video reporter for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "JOHN DICKERSON, HOST: Today on FACE THE NATION: It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas here in Washington, as Republicans appear to have the votes to pass a mammoth tax bill this week, giving President Trump President Trump his Christmas wish.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have a tremendous spirit for the tax reform. This is going to be one of the great Christmas gifts to middle-income people.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: We will take look at winners and losers in the tax bill and talk to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  Vermont independent Senator Bernie Sanders says the bill will help the rich and hurt the middle class.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT: The very wealthy are becoming much more wealthy, while the middle class continues to shrink. And your solution is to give 62 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: We will ask him abut and what the next step is for Democrats after Doug Jones' stunning upset over Roy Moore in Alabama.  We will also talk to Oklahoma Republican Senator James Lankford, a member of the Intelligence Committee, which is conducting one of the investigation into possible Trump campaign collusion with the Russians.  We will also have plenty of analysis on all the news of the week and a look ahead to next, plus tell you how the tax bill might impact you.  It's all ahead on FACE THE NATION.  Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I'm John Dickerson.  The Republican tax plan is in the home stretch. The final package will be voted on Tuesday in the House then moves to the Senate. At this point, it looks like Republicans have enough votes to pass it. The $1.5 trillion tax cut plan roughly doubles the standard deduction for both individuals and married couples. It cuts individual tax rates. The top income bracket drops from 39.6 to 37 percent. The corporate tax rate decreases, too. It goes from 35 to 21 percent.  The bill eliminates the Obamacare ban mate, with individuals no longer required to purchase health care. It could result in 13 million more people becoming uninsured. The Child tax credit is doubled to $2,000. The income level for those qualifying goes up to $500,000, and $1,400 of the credit will be refundable for those whose income is so low that they don't pay income tax.  The mortgage interest deduction is capped at $750,000, and the deduction for state and local taxes is shrunk to $10,000. According to the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation, it will add $1.6 trillion to the debt.  And we begin today with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  Welcome, Mr. Secretary.  Let me ask you a question about priorities in this. Throughout the discussion about this tax bill, it's been clear the corporate rate is going to drop significantly, all the way to 20. It fixed on 21 percent at the end.  In the end here for the middle class, they do get a tax cut. But for a president who dedicated his presidency to the forgotten man and who ran as populist, are the -- is the weighting here correct?  STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: Absolutely.  And, first of all, let me just say, this is a historic event. People said we wouldn't get this done. We're on the verge of getting this done, the single biggest change to the tax system ever that President Trump is going to sign this week. And his priority all along has been fix a broken system.  Over 90 percent of people will be able to fill out their taxes on a postcard. The corporate tax rate going from the highest in the world at 35 percent to 21 percent makes us competitive. And more important, we fix a system where we now tax on U.S. income, which is all about creating U.S. jobs. We are going to bring trillions of dollars back onshore.  DICKERSON: Let me ask you, though, about on the -- the top rate is going down. The president at one point said the wealthy won't be getting a tax cut. Now they will, as it drops from 39.6 to 37.  Now, that balances out the deduction in state and local, but only for those people who live in high-state and local-tax states. So, again to this question of priorities.  Mark Sanford, Republican from South Carolina, said: \"From a truth-in-advertising standpoint, it would have been a lot simpler if we just acknowledged the reality on this bill, which is, it's fundamentally a corporate tax reduction and restructuring bill, period.\"  What's your response to that?  MNUCHIN: Not the case at all. Pass-throughs have the lowest rates that they ever had since the 1930s. That's a huge part of engine of growth of small- and medium-sized businesses that are going to create lots of jobs.  And this is about hardworking families that are going to see starting in February tax cuts. We're already working at the IRS to update the tax forms and update the tax charts. And they're going to see this in their paychecks in February.  DICKERSON: I guess the question is, it's not that the middle class will get no tax cuts. They will. They will get a tax cut.  But it's the size of the tax cut relative to the emphasis and size of what corporations will get through. Not every middle-class family has a pass-through, obviously.  Tom Cole, Republican from Oklahoma, told John Harwood of CNBC this: \"It just seems wrong\" when -- he was talking about the lack of tax cuts, say, help with payroll taxes, or the fact that the carried interest loophole remains.  He said: \"It just seems wrong. We'd be better off if there were more populist victories in there.\"  The president ran as populist. The argument is, there's just not as much as there could be for the middle class in this, not that they get nothing, but that the emphasis is skewed.  MNUCHIN: I think that is just not correct.  And people are going to see this in their paychecks. This is about the middle class. This is about working families. This is about child tax credits that are going up significantly, as you mentioned, refundable parts of the tax credits going up significantly.  People are going to see their paychecks go up. People are going to see their wages go up. That's what this is all about.  DICKERSON: On the wages question, how soon do you think -- the argument you make is that, with corporations, the tax is lower, they will pass it on to workers in their wages, and then also they will spend money on plants and equipment. How soon do you think that will...  MNUCHIN: I think we will see that this year.  You already see the stock market at record highs. You see people's 401(k)s up substantially.  DICKERSON: But that's not wages. That's...  MNUCHIN: No, no, I'm just saying you already see companies in anticipation in the market. So you're going to see trillions of dollars come back, and I think you're going to see this year wages going up.  DICKERSON: Because Kevin Hassett, who is the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said on this question of when businesses are going to pass this on to the middle class, he said: \"If you go to the optimistic vied of the literature, it could take three to five years. If you go to the pessimistic side, it would about double that.\"  So that's optimistic three to five. So, this is being sold as a big Christmas present everybody is going to get, but really this benefit that will pass on in wages and plants and equipment, Kevin Hassett, the president's -- chairman of his economic advisers says three to five years in the best case.  MNUCHIN: Well, that's three to five years on this $4,500.  But you're going to begin to see it right away. So, you won't see it all come in. It will go in over three years, as Kevin anticipates.  DICKERSON: But for something that is being sold to people as wages are going to go up, happy days are here again, happy days, even in the best-case scenario -- and, obviously, there's lot of debate about whether this will even turn out the way you have argued -- even in a best-case, we're talking three to five years for broad shared middle-class prosperity as result of the theory this is based on.  MNUCHIN: Not the case at all.  You're going to see happy days starting in February, where hardworking families sees that they have more money. That's something that's absolutely critical. You're going to see cuts anywhere from $2,000 to $4,000 for medium families with two kids.  This is going to have a huge impact in the economy, and it's going to have a huge impact on American jobs. You're going to see that right away.  DICKERSON: OK, difference between what people see in their taxes going down vs. the paychecks.  MNUCHIN: That's correct.  DICKERSON: But let me ask you this question.  The president, another thing he campaigned on central to his campaign was that he was going to drain the swamp, get rid of special interests.  Public Citizen reports that -- lobbyists have to disclose things they're working on -- 6,243 lobbyists have worked on tax-related issues. That's more than half the lobbyists in Washington worked on this.  For a president who promised to drain the swamp, that seems like a lot of people working on taxes.  MNUCHIN: Well, I think if it was up to the president, there would be a lot fewer of them.  I mean, the reason why there's so many people working on it is, we have touched almost every single part of the tax code. So...  DICKERSON: Have the lobbyists been defeated in this case?  MNUCHIN: Absolutely.  And if you look at the massive changes to this, we fixed a broken tax system. That's what this is all about.  DICKERSON: One -- Tom Cole talks about the carried interest loophole. That was something the president said that loophole let hedge fund managers get away with murder.  It's been tweaked a little, but it's still in there. Why was that worth keeping?  MNUCHIN: Again, that was up to the House and the Senate.  The president likes the overall bill. There's obviously little parts of this bill that he would have tweaked differently himself. The fact that it's moved from one year to three years is definitely a step in the right direction, and the fact that it impacts a lot of small real estate developers.  But, as you said, the president couldn't get every single little detail he wanted. That was one of them that got left out.  DICKERSON: OK. That's it. We're out of time. I really appreciate it, Mr. Secretary.  MNUCHIN: Great to see you. Thank you.  DICKERSON: Thanks for being with us.  And we're joined now by Vermont independent Senator Bernie Sanders. He's in Burlington.  Welcome, Senator.  This looks like it's going to get passed through the Senate and the House and signed by the president, this tax cut bill. Is there anything more that opponents like you could have done to stop this?  SANDERS: Well, I think we did everything that we could.  But at the end of the day, what you had is people like Mr. Mnuchin, who himself is worth $300 million or $400 million, the president of the United States, who is worth several billion dollars, as you mentioned, some 4,000 or 5,000 lobbyists doing everything that they could to write a bill which significantly benefits the wealthiest people in this country and the largest corporations.  The latest analysis that we have seen suggests that 72 percent of the benefits go to the top 5 percent. My guess is that 60 percent of the benefits will go to the top 1 percent  And at the end of the decade, because the benefits for the middle class are temporary, while the corporate benefits are permanent, at the end of the decade, over half of the middle class will be paying more in taxes.  What we are seeing here is a real massive attack on the middle class. And what I worry very much, John, is that if you listen to what the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, is talking about, what he is saying is that, as a result of this bill, the deficit will go up by $1.4 trillion.  And what Ryan, in my view, will come back with are massive cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid in order to offset that deficit.  DICKERSON: Let me ask...  SANDERS: So, massive tax breaks for the rich, cuts to Social Security, this is a grossly unfair tax bill.  DICKERSON: I want to get to the entitlements in just a moment, but on that question of the middle class, what the administration says and Republicans say is that, yes, those tax cuts expire for middle class, but knowing politics as they do, that nobody is going to vote to have let them expire, that those will essentially be capped.  That seems pretty reasonable in the way Washington works. So, is it really fair to say they're going to expire?  SANDERS: Well...  DICKERSON: Go ahead.  SANDERS: Well, they are. I mean, the way this bill is written is the tax breaks for corporations are now permanent.  Why weren't the tax breaks for the middle class made permanent? Because it has to do with the priorities of the folks who wrote that legislation. And their job is to represent multinational corporations, and not working families. That's where we are today.  DICKERSON: And let me ask you. There's lot of talk about politics here.  If the Democrats take control of the Senate -- and you caucus with the Democrats -- what is the promise to America about what will be done to reverse the state of affairs that you're so unhappy with?  SANDERS: Look, at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, where the people on top and large corporations are doing phenomenally well, our job is to pay attention to the needs of working families.  We talk about a child care tax credit in this bill. Truth is that, depending on where you live in America, good, quality child care can cost $12,000, $15,000, $20,000 a year.  Our job is to move to universal child care, so that every working family in this country knows that their kids have good, quality care. Right now, John, this is really quite unbelievable. While the Republicans are spending all of their time providing massive tax breaks to the rich, there has been no discussion, public discussion, about the dreamers, the needs of the dreamers, 800,000 young people born and raised in America, who are going to lose their legal status very shortly.  And what about the CHIP program?  DICKERSON: And let me get...  SANDERS: Nine million kids Gates lose their health insurance.  DICKERSON: Let me get to that in a second.  If you, Democrats take control, are corporate taxes going up?  SANDERS: I think we're going to take a very hard look at this entire tax bill and make it a tax bill that works for the middle class and working families, not for the top 1 percent and large multinational corporations.  DICKERSON: But there's no question that in order to achieve all of the things you want, taxes are going to have to go up on corporations? If they're down to 21 a result of this legislation, you can't find the money anywhere else?  SANDERS: Absolutely, yes, in my view, absolutely.  DICKERSON: So, OK.  All right, let's go on to now the budget and spending question. The Republicans, when Democrats have said Medicare is going to have to be cut because of the so-called pay-go rules, what Republicans say is, Democrats are going to waive those rules next year, that those pay-go rules are always waived, and so it's kind of a false attack to say that there are going to be automatic cuts for Medicare.  Your response?  SANDERS: No, what is not a false attack, John, is simply listening to what the speaker of the House has said.  And what he has said is, after they do this tax bill, the next order of business is so-called entitlement reform. And please understand that, when Republicans talk about entitlement reform, what they are talking about are massive cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.  In the budget that they already passed, they propose a trillion- dollar cut to Medicaid, which would be disastrous for people who have loved ones in nursing homes, for children and for working families who are on Medicaid.  This is what they have already proposed. So they are going to come back, in my view, in order to offset this deficit with terrible cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.  DICKERSON: So, that's slightly different, though, than following through on restrictions created by pay-go, which they say you will waive.  But let me ask you this question about the spending bill, keep the government open. What is your message to Democratic leaders about how tough -- how and what they should fight for in terms of keeping -- funding the government?  SANDERS: Look, right now, it is no secret that the middle class is hurting.  The Republicans have been unable to reauthorize, for example, the Community Health Center Program providing health care to 27 million Americans.  The CHIP programs, the Children's Health Insurance Program, they have ignored that, for three months, the CHIP program for nine million children in this country has not been funded. We have a crisis in pensions in this country. A million-and-a-half hardworking people who are promised their pensions are going to see their pensions reduced by 50 or 60 percent.  We have a rural infrastructure crisis, where people can't get even get broadband. We have 30,000 vacancies in the Veterans Administration that have not been filled.  Our job is to take care of the needs of working families and the middle class, not just worry about the 1 percent. So, I believe that, as we talk about the new spending bill, those are the issues we must demand that Republicans address.  DICKERSON: All right, we're out of time.  Senator, thanks so much for being with us.  And we will be back in one minute.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: We turn now to Oklahoma Republican Senator James Lankford. He joins us from Oklahoma City.  Welcome, Senator.  I want to talk with this tax cut bill. You have talked about the debt and the deficit throughout your career. All of the independent analysis says that this tax cut bill will add a trillion or more to the debt. Why then is this a bill you can support?  SEN. JAMES LANKFORD (R), OKLAHOMA: Actually, all the independent analysis doesn't note that. The Joint Committee on Tax does note that, but the Tax Foundation doesn't. There's a lot of others.  We have 130 different sets of economists that are out there, and part of the challenge is always looking at which one is right. All of them are putting a forecast out there. All of them have different numbers. We have some as high as a 5 percent growth. We have some as low as 0.8 percent growth. All of them show economic growth.  The guess is, how much economic growth is in the bill itself? The target of any time you do tax reform is to try reduce taxes on individuals and on businesses, so they have more money to spend, they can spend that money. That encourages the economy to grow. We know it will grow. Now the guess is how much.  DICKERSON: That's right. And the Tax Foundation is still around $500 billion to the debt, and there are -- the majority of independent analysis shows even larger.  And that bet you're making, isn't there a big downside risk that you have talked about throughout your career, which is that the negative effects of increased debt kill the growth that you're trying to create?  LANKFORD: Absolutely.  The biggest issue that would have if we have accelerating debt is to have the issue of continued investment from the federal government into more and more interest payments. We have to get the economy growing, though, to actually get on top of this.  We have said for years the debt has become so large, the only way to be able to get on top of this debt and deficit is a growing economy and limiting your spending.  We have limited spending over the last several years. It's been very small in its growth for spending, but the economy has also been flat in the last decade. We have not had a decade like the last decade since the 1940s.  So, we have got to get the economy growing again. We're not growing again. We never do get on top of the debt and deficit without that. So you're right. This is something that's designed to be able to energize the economy. It should work. A lot of people that we looked at and examined independently say it will work. And so the focus for us is, let's get this economy growing.  DICKERSON: Well, if that doesn't work, then you will have compounded problems.  And when you talk about spending, based on what you have seen from the way this tax bill put together, the intellectual rigor, the timing and pacing, do you have confidence that spending reductions can be done in a methodical and sensible way that will actually create good policy, or that will create a rush that might create more problems?  LANKFORD: No, I don't think it's going to create more problems. This tax bill itself has been over a year in the works.  In fact, if you go back to the original draft of it, it was about three years ago, coming from the camp plan. The House released out their proposal on tax reform in January of this year, the White House early in the summer.  This has not been a rushed process. This has literally been 12 months in the making and multiple hearings over the past year, and then leading back to earlier work even that was done several Congresses ago.  So, I know that the theme of this has been it's been rushed. And I think it's because lot of people haven't started paying attention until the very end. But the process has been long and methodical.  Now, the flip side of that is the spending side, because we have got a budget bill to take care of this week as well. I have had great frustration with budget process. The budget process was designed in 1974. It's only worked four times. I have been one of several to be able to say over and over again we have got to fix the way we do budget process. We will never get ahold of our spending until we do.  DICKERSON: Well, and that's the big question that remains from a process.  Let me, though -- we have got to switch to talk about the Intelligence Committee and the work you're doing. You have looked at this question of Russian interference in the election. Are the Russians still interfering and how are we going to protect the next election?  LANKFORD: Yes, there's no doubt the Russians not only engaged in our past election, but they're still trying to find ways to be able to do that.  We have noted several ways publicly in the last couple of months that they're still engaging in social media, trying to stir up the United States' controversies.  I compare it to, if you have got two kids in playground that are in a fight there's always somebody on the edge screaming fight, fight, fight, trying to bring a bigger crowd to it. That's what the Russians are really trying to do. They're not starting it. They're just trying to add fuel to the flame any time.  The key thing that I think needs to be done right now is a bill that is actually a bipartisan bill I'm working on to be able to finalize hopefully this week to be able to drop dealing with election security helping states protect their own election security. The FBI was much too slow and Homeland Security were much too slow in notifying our states the last time that the Russians were trying to probe election systems. We have got to be able to do that faster. We've got to help states have a good, reliable, auditable election system that they can actually do themselves, and that the federal government and that all entities from those states can trust those election results.  DICKERSON: Let me ask you about the texts that were released this week from investigator -- an investigator on the Mueller team.  What is your opinion about those texts, one of which referred to an insurance policy? There's a lot of debate about that text and what exactly was meant by it. But how serious do you think this is in the context of the larger investigation that you know something about?  LANKFORD: I think it's serious any time you have an investigator within an investigation has an obvious political bias, whichever direction that goes.  It's clear this individual within the Mueller team that was also on the Clinton e-mail investigation team on the FBI, in their leadership, had a strong bias against now President Trump when he was candidate Trump and was very clear about that.  When that was discovered by the Mueller team, they fired him, appropriately so, and took him off of that team. But that is a big consideration. We expect the Justice Department to be blind and be fair to all sides, not have a clear political bias and express it so strongly.  DICKERSON: But given that Mueller took him off the investigation, do you think this taints the larger project he's doing, since you know the scope of that larger project?  LANKFORD: Yes, it's very serious to be able to have someone inside.  What they have got to determine is, was he directing the investigation one way or the other while he was on the investigation? Is that something they can go back and repair and look and see if there's any kind of bias that is in it.  Obviously, I don't think it taints the entire process, but it certainly taints that season of it, and it's something you should look at with any political investigation that he was on at the time.  Again, we want our FBI agents to be neutral and to be nonpolitical, not very actively engaged politically.  DICKERSON: All right, Senator Lankford, thanks so much for being with us.  LANKFORD: Thank you.  DICKERSON: And we will be back in a moment.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: You can keep up with the news of the week by subscribing to the FACE THE NATION Diary podcast.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: We will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION and take a look at the record that is about to be broken with tax cuts in the Senate.  Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.  For a closer look at the Republican tax bill and what it will mean for you, we turn to Richard Rubin. He covers U.S. tax policy for \"The Wall Street Journal.\"  Welcome, Richard.  I've been reading everything that you've been writing.  So let's start just with the winners and losers at the end of the day here. Who are they?  RICHARD RUBIN, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": So, in the big picture, the winners are corporations. Like you talked about before, the corporate rate is going to go from 35 percent to 21 percent. That's a real big win for kind of the companies that have been paying close to that level. Think domestic retailers.  Pass-through businesses also really win under this. Those are partnerships, sole proprietorships, s corporations. For a lot of them, they're going to get basically a 20 percent discount on their tax rate. If they pay individual rates now, they still will, but they'll have a big, new deduction.  And then as Secretary Mnuchin talked about, and Senator Lankford talked about, middle class households, especially households with children, will have tax cuts. They'll see those in paychecks in February. They'll see those on the tax return they file in April of 2019. Those tax cuts are temporary. They expire at the end of 2025. And so that's something that I'm sure Congress will fight over for the next eight years or so.  DICKERSON: The secretary also mentioned that 90 percent or -- would be able to fill their taxes out on a card. This is one of the big goals, simplification. What do you make of that claim?  RUBIN: So what he's talking about is the number of people who would be able to move from itemizing to the standard deduction. Right now about 70 percent of people take the standard deduction. This will push that up closer to 90 percent, because the standard deduction will be larger and there will be fewer itemized deductions that cap on state and local income taxes of $10,000 will limit that.  That doesn't necessarily mean everyone's filing on a postcard. So it's much -- it's simpler for those marginal itemizer you can think of, like people who itemize now and won't under the new system, it will be simpler, but some of those people in that group might actually be -- end up paying more. So that -- so it will be easier. If you want to keep track of your deductions, your ultimate tax bill might end up being higher. And so that's a trade-off -- I don't know, is that a trade-off you want to make? That's up to them.  DICKERSON: And there's also work that you have to do before you get it on the card.  RUBIN: Yes, look, I mean, when you talk about a simpler system, the simplicity is really about, what is a child that's eligible for the child tax credit? How do you calculate the earned income tax credit for low income families. That's still really complicated. And you can have a simple form but behind that is a whole bunch of definitions and worksheets.  DICKERSON: What about on the corporate side and the pass-through side? There were a lot of claims about things that were going to be removed from the code. Have -- is there simplicity on those two parts of this story?  RUBIN: Look, the business side of the tax code is complicated because the world is complicated. You have to figure out what -- you know, how you should treat capital expenses. So there is some simplicity there in the sense that we've got these long -- these complicated depreciation schedules. At least for the first five years, companies can write off investments right away, that is a big simplification. Getting rid of the corporate alternative minimum tax, that's a simplification.  But the international provisions are new and novel and will take a lot of time for companies to figure out. The same with the pass- through businesses, who's eligible for that break and who's not. There's going to be a lot of work for tax accountants and tax lawyers in the days ahead.  DICKERSON: What did you make of covering this process? What -- give us your narrative story of how this -- this went from the original promise that were made about it until the final stage we're in here now?  RUBIN: I think that we saw is a lot of those original promises, the ones we saw during the campaign in 2016 and the early part of 2017, a lot of them happened but a lot of them -- some of them get jettisoned as they got toward the reality of needing to pass something. The failure on health care earlier in the year, I just don't underestimate how much that changed the Republican mindset in Congress. It went from, we need to pass our ideal tax plan to, we need to pass something. And the desire to get to yes for lawmakers was high.  So you had things like repealing the estate tax, repealing the alternative minimum tax for individuals, putting it in three tax brackets instead of seven. None of those things happened. They were willing -- making it revenue neutral, not adding to the deficit, which they had talked about repeatedly earlier in the year. They just pushed those things aside and said, we've got to get something done and this really became the art of the possible, not the art of the ideal for them.  DICKERSON: At the end of the stage, Marco Rubio seemed to kind of grab his moment, asked for the child tax credit to be refundable for those people who don't pay income taxes. First of all, how much of a policy difference did his stance make? What's the difference between what it would have been and what it is now? And then just kind of, what did you make of that last little piece of drama?  RUBIN: So, what they did on policy is, the proposal in the Senate was to allow the child tax credit for 17-year-olds, right now it's capped for 16-year-old. And so they kept the current law version of that and then expanded how much would be refundable for not the very lowest income families, but lower, middle income families. So you can think of what Rubio did as taking billions of dollars from all 17- year-olds and directing them to a lot of lower, middle income households. You can judge the merits of that however you want.  And, look, he -- he and Mike Lee of Utah were struggling with how to do this. They didn't seem like they wanted to take down the entire bill. They had the leverage to do that when it was in the Senate. But at that last moment they were able to get more.  Republican leaders did not want this in the bill initially. They didn't put it in the House bill or the Senate bill. And so that was a change that they were able to get at the end as part of getting everybody on board.  DICKERSON: And another person who got on board was Senator Corker of Tennessee who voted against the Senate bill because of the effect on the deficit and debt. Why did he change at the end?  RUBIN: You know, he basically -- I mean his statement basically said, well, I've looked at it again and I talked to people and I heard from constituents and maybe it will add to the deficit, but it's worth the risk. And that's -- you know, it's -- which is in some ways sums up what we're just talking about, that Republicans really got to a point, even the Republican who said he was opposed to it now is voting for it because they are just really eager to have some sort of accomplishment, something they can point to going into the -- into 2018 and the midterm elections, even though this bill is unpopular with the public.  DICKERSON: Final question is on the -- on the lobbyist. The secretary of treasury said this was a defeat for the lobbyists. How did you see their role in this and then -- and what -- whether they're -- I mean obviously there are over 6,000 of them, so they've got varied interests. But since it was such a central and important part of the campaign getting special interests out of the process, how do you evaluate that here?  RUBIN: So there are some special interests who lost. Home builders and realtors really fought to -- against -- and charities fought against that bigger standard deduction because it will -- it makes the incentive to itemize, the incentive for mortgage interest and charitable contributions smaller. And so they're not happy with the end product. So those lobbyists aren't happy.  The lobby -- corporate lobbyists, who have been pushing for a much lower corporate tax rate for many years, for a territorial system on foreign income that, you know, lets it be easier for U.S. companies to earn profits aboard and bring them home, they're really happy. This is -- this is what they've been pushing for for a long time and they had this magic lineup of Republicans controlling Congress and the White House to get it done.  DICKERSON: All right, Richard Rubin, thanks so much for being with us.  And we'll be right back with our political panel.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: We turn now to our political panel to unpack the news of the week.  Amy Walter is the national editor at the \"Cook Political Report.\" Jeffrey Goldberg is the editor in chief of \"The Atlantic.\" We're also joined by \"Slate\" magazine's chief political correspondent and CBS News political analyst Jamelle Bouie. And Ben Domenech is the founder and editor of \"The Federalist.\"  Before we get to policy, Ben, I want to ask you a question about Senator McCain, who's your father-in-law. How's he doing?  BEN DOMENECH, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Well, John, I'm happy to say that he's doing well. The truth is that, as anyone knows whose family has battled cancer or any significant disease, that oftentimes there are side effects to treatment that you have. The senator's been through a round of chemo and he went -- and was hospitalized this week at Walter Reed.  Our thanks to the doctors at NIH and Walter Reed who have been treating him. He is doing well. He's in good spirits. And he's looking forward to heading back home to Arizona for the holidays. Our thanks to everyone who has been sending thoughts and prayers to the senator this week. We greatly appreciate it. And he remains one of the toughest men on the face of the earth, as you know.  DICKERSON: That we know.  So, we'll send them again, our prayers to him and to the whole family.  DOMENECH: Thank you.  DICKERSON: So -- thank you.  All right, so now to this week. Let's start with the tax bill.  Jeffrey, it's going to pass. It's going to get signed by the president unless something really crazy happens. So --  JEFFREY GOLDBERG, \"THE ATLANTIC\": Which is not impossible in this America.  DICKERSON: Right.  GOLDBERG: But, you're right, it's going to probably pass.  DICKERSON: That's right. And so give us your sense of that -- what that means?  GOLDBERG: Well, I mean, I think, in the broadest political sense, I think that this takes Donald Trump's pretty bad year and might move it into the not bad category in the following sense.  You know, he started the -- his term, his first year, with a Supreme Court victory. He might end it with a -- with a tax cut victory, a tax plan victory. It's a legislative victory. It might not be possible with a broad swath of Americans, but it counts as a victory.  ISIS, by the way, is on its back foot in Iraq and Syria. If we didn't have all of the noise and craziness, the Russia investigation, the early morning tweeting, all of the -- the race-baiting and everything else that's been going on, you would look at this year and say, you know what, not the worst year for a first-year president. It's very interesting to think about it in those terms.  AMY WALTER, \"COOK POLITICAL REPORT\": Yes, and especially on the economy, which is the economy is doing very well. People are feeling better about it. The secretary of the treasury came on and talked about people's 401(k) improving. All of that is true. And yet none of that is translating the way it normally translates to a president, which is if the economy's doing well, usually the party in power, their approval ratings, do well.  And so figuring out where that all stands, as Jeffrey pointed out, is really about the fact that, are voters right now going to focus on the economy that they feel is doing better, and they personally are doing better, or are they focusing on the things about the president, his temperament, his behavior that they don't like? Right now they're focusing, politically at least, much more on what they don't like about the president than what they do like about the economy.  DICKERSON: It is fascinating to watch the president, who ran against Wall Street in part talking about the health of the -- the stock market.  Jamelle, the polling for this tax bill is not good. So does -- McConnell's -- Senator McConnell's argument is, it's going to get better once people start feeling this tax cut. Do you buy that argument?  JAMELLE BOUIE, CBS NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: I -- I'm not sure that I do. That is -- reminds me quite a bit of the Democratic Party's argument in the run-up to the Affordable -- or passing the Affordable Care Act, that once voters understood the benefits they got, they would like the bill. And as it turned out it took a good three or four or five years before the public was ever positive about that law. And they largely became positive about that law because of the prospect of losing that law and losing specifically the Medicaid expansion.  And there's -- you know, for -- although the Republican tax bill does deliver some benefits, it doesn't deliver anything as concrete as something like the Medicaid expansion did that might create the same kind of bond with voters.  And if you look at polling so far, even, you know, suburban voters, the kinds of people who you think would support this kind of tax policy, are skeptical about it. So I'm not -- I'm not sure -- I appreciate Senator McConnell's optimism, but I'm not sure it's going to actually play out that way.  DICKERSON: Ben, get -- let me get your thoughts, more generally, but also kind of playing off of what Jamelle was saying. Senator Sanders just said that basically his message is, corporate taxes are going up if Democrats get in control. How do you think that plays in this context?  DOMENECH: I think Republicans are actually going to be very confident running on this measure as sort of their key signature legislative success in 2018. I think that you will see a tick up in terms of people's attitude towards it once they actually see their paychecks go up.  You know, one of the things about this in terms of how unpopular it is, is that when you simply get past the initial numbers, it's the people think that they're not going to benefit from it, that they're not going to see a benefit that their taxes are actually going to go up and not down. I think that when people see their paychecks actually have more money in them, they're going to have a more positive attitude towards it.  But the simple fact is that Republicans want to be talking about this. Democrats are going foe be talking about getting rid of this president and his unpopular policies. They're going to be -- so many different Democrats and frankly base forces who are pushing Democrats towards turning this into an impeachment election where they are going to be getting this president out of office. And I think it's actually going to be difficult because the Democratic leadership would much prefer to be talking about, well, look at what he just gave to corporations and things along those lines. Nancy Pelosi's lines about this being apocalyptic, you know, end of the world sort of tax scenario I think are something that would actually cater to what they would like to be talking about. Instead, the base of the Democratic Party is going to drive this into a much more, I think, significant and extreme direction.  GOLDBERG: It does -- it does just seem, though, that the Republicans have a hard lift here, which is, it is -- it is impossible not to say that the greatest beneficiary in this plan, the corporations --  DOMENECH: Yes.  GOLDBERG: If you believe that corporations are people, then people are benefitting. If you don't, the Democrats have a very potent weapon. And I don't know -- I mean it will take -- if it takes time -- it will take time to get people around to this, but I don't know if you can ever get around to this, because that's the -- that is the top line observation.  BOUIE: And --  DICKERSON: And to -- go ahead, Jamelle.  BOUIE: And just to Amy's point from earlier, all of this interacting in an environment where voters are quite angry at the president's behavior. So even if there are material benefits from the tax bill, there's no -- there's no guarantee that that will -- that will interact with voter attitudes in a way to produce a political benefit for the Republican Party.  DICKERSON: And, Amy, what about the Democrats seizing this moment? The ability, obviously, that they haven't been able to stop it through Congress. But as a political matter, to Ben's point, I mean this used to be the bread and butter of the Democratic Party, how to talk to working people.  WALTER: Right.  DICKERSON: They've got some ammunition they could use here. What's your assessment on their ability to actually use it to make a case to people who already -- they've talked to, you know, about income equality overall all these years.  WALTER: Right. The best thing that Democrats have going for them right now is that they're not in the White House. And they are the party of the opposition. It's so much easier to be the party of opposition than to be the party actually making policy.  And what we found, especially in these midterm or early midterm elections and special elections is that what the party has struggled with for the last eight years in the era of Obama was getting their base, that Obama electorate, excited and energized, voters of color and younger voters. They couldn't do it when Obama was in the White House. Hillary Clinton couldn't do it. You know who's turning out the Obama coalition? Donald Trump. Donald Trump personally is a great motivator.  And to the point about whether they can talk about these issues, I think they make a very -- I think we're going to see this over and over again, the point you made about, thousands of lobbyists worked on this bill, tax cuts for corporate America. Whether people are feeling it or not, I think becomes less important than the overall argument that this president and Republicans said they were going to help the working people. This is really the same old, same old, helping corporations.  And, again, if the issue was, do I feel it in my paycheck, the biggest group of people that are souring on the president live in suburban America. Their 401(k)s are doing great right now.  DICKERSON: Right.  WALTER: So if it were really just about the economy, they would be on board.  GOLDBERG: The biggest -- the biggest question heading into 2018, I think, is whether there is a learning curve in the White House.  WALTER: Yes.  GOLDBERG: If he comes out of this realizing, wait, I got an actual traditional political Republican victory and learns to get out of his own way in 2018, then he's doing pretty well heading into the midterms. But this is Donald Trump we're talking about, so there's no guarantee that there's a learning curve and that he'll return to form, even with proof that behaving in a traditional way actually has benefit.  DICKERSON: Although --  DOMENECH: And you saw that -- and you saw that in Alabama in the sense that you -- you have, to Amy's point, you know, a candidate in Doug Jones who is more than 90 percent of what Hillary Clinton achieved in Alabama and a candidate in Roy Moore who got less than 50 percent of what Donald Trump achieved.  The truth is that Trump, since he got into the White House, has effectively been offering his voters circuses without the bread. He's been giving them the same level of entertainment that they experienced during the 2016 election without actually delivering on a lot of his populous promises when it came to shifting the way that the Republican Party would prioritize things.  And I think you see that totally with this tax bill. That is a very traditional Republican approach. It's not a breakaway from the kind of approach that you might have seen under a President Jeb Bush. And that's something that satisfies Mitch McConnell, satisfies Republican donors, but is not necessarily going to satisfy the same voters who said that Donald Trump was the kind of shift they wanted to see in the GOP.  BOUIE: But what's interesting is that in Alabama the voters who turned out for Roy Moore are the voters who are this working class, populist base.  DOMENECH: Yes.  BOUIE: They turned out for Roy Moore. The ones who didn't are these suburban voters. They're the ones whose support completely collapsed. And so I think there is an interesting question here of the degree to which the material circumstances of these white suburban voters in places like Alabama and Virginia will see -- or else next year seems to not matter as much for their political choices. That they're angry at Donald Trump for reasons that don't have anything to do with how they're doing in the pocketbook.  WALTER: Yes.  DICKERSON: Right. And, so, Amy, could we have a -- basically a policy-free 2018 which would be disaster because for Democrats they want to drive down those suburban numbers, which means reminding everybody of the most outrageous thing the president did recently, and because the base of the Democratic Party gets energized, as you already argued. So why -- I mean don't they want to basically keep the focus entirely on Donald Trump and his --  WALTER: They can make it on Donald Trump, but really they don't have to talk to their base and remind them why they don't like Donald Trump. The base is already pretty clear about how they feel about him. But it's making the case that the policies that the administration, that Republicans in Congress have passed haven't -- have been out of step with you, main street, whatever they want -- however they want to address it, whether it's the focus on corporate tax cuts, whether it's on the administration and the changes that have been made on issues like the environment, labor standards, et cetera. You can kind of go down the list. It's been a pretty -- it's -- conservatives should be happy. They've gotten a great agenda through, conservative judges getting through, regulatory reform, rolling back a lot of Obama-era --  GOLDBERG: Regulatory reform is the revolution here nobody's talking about because of the circuses.  WALTER: Yes.  GOLDBERG: But they're moving their agenda in a big day.  WALTER: (INAUDIBLE).  The one thing I do also want to say is that the focus so much for the president -- we saw a story today that the president's going to go out and do more of these alleys in 2016 -- I'm sorry, in 2018. The challenge for him is not getting those people in the rallies to vote for him. The challenge is to get the people who never showed up to the rallies but ultimately voted for him to continue to vote for him. Those people who were reluctant Trump voters. They didn't necessarily like him in 2016, but they disliked Hillary Clinton more. They thought he was the change candidate, she was the status quo. Those are the folks that are sour and souring on the president.  So their -- the number of rallies he does and keeping that business energized isn't the challenge. The challenge to Jeffrey's point is, going back to those people who were reluctant Trump supporters, but who want to see progress made without all the other drama.  DICKERSON: The people Jamelle said were souring in Alabama.  Ben, a Republican I talked to this week in assessing Alabama said, we don't think we're going to have anybody who has been credibly accused of, you know, sexual assault on a child in any other republican race. So, in other words --  DOMENECH: An optimistic view, right.  DICKERSON: In other words, let's not over read Alabama.  WALTER: Yes.  DICKERSON: That makes sense to me.  DOMENECH: Well, it does -- it does make sense to me, too, John. But I think in -- I mean, honestly, Republicans in the Senate were breathing a sigh of relief after Alabama. They did not want to be dealing with Roy Moore, particularly the certain that lot of the different staffers share were --  GOLDBERG: They'd have to shake his hand.  DOMENECH: Who were expressing was, once he gets in here, will we ever be able to get rid of him. And they didn't feel like they could.  You know, but the situation I think here is one that deserves a little bit more attention than just, we're not going to nominate someone like that in another race, because there was a series of decisions that were made by a number of different Republican politicians along the way that led to Roy Moore. Mitch McConnell has been of the belief for a long time now that there are two kinds of politicians. There are politicians he likes and there are politicians who will lose.  This ignores the third kind, which is politicians he doesn't like who could win. The fact is that if McConnell had not parachuted in millions of dollars to nuke (ph) Mo Brooks, a conservative in the primary, that he very well could have been the nominee in this situation and might be a senator today. Now, he has his own health issues, of course, but I think this is one of those things where McConnell needs to look hard at sort of the challenges that are not -- that are going to going -- be at the fore in a lot of these different primaries where he may need to make a choice about, do I have kind of a winnable candidate who's a conservative, or do I have someone who can.  DICKERSON: OK, we're going to have to end it there. And we'll be right back in a moment.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: In all the swirl of news this week, it might have gone unnoticed that with the naming of Tina Smith as Al Franken's replacement, the number of women in the Senate will reach a record high. Twenty-two women will serve next year.  The culture of American life is changing at a rapid pace, from Hollywood to the restaurant kitchen, to the corporate board room. Politics takes a while to catch up, but change is taking place there too. Roy Moore lost in Alabama and there have been other ripples.  Change will continue. So far, there are 374 women potentially running for the House in next year's election, 305 are Democrats, 69 Republicans. And so far there are 42 women exploring a senate run, 28 Democrats and 14 Republicans, according to the Rutgers University Center for American Women and Politics. That's four times as many women challenging House incumbents this time compared to the same period in 2015, and ten times the number of women challenging incumbent senators compared to 2012 and 2014. And we're just under 11 months from Election Day.  The door is closing on the era that protected powerful men in Washington. And based on these numbers, it appears another door is opening.  We'll be right back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: That's it for this week. Join us again next week. For FACE THE NATION, I'm John Dickerson.",

            "article_content": "Republican leaders in Congress plan to bring their massive tax overhaul to a final vote in both chambers this week after negotiators reached an agreement addressing the concerns of several key Senate holdouts. The final version cuts tax rates for corporations and high-income households while eliminating some popular deductions and overhauling the tax code. Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, has been one of the most outspoken critics of the measure, blasting it as a giveaway to corporations and wealthy Americans. He joined \"Face the Nation\" to discuss his evaluation of the plan and react to the surprising victory of Democrat Doug Jones in this week's Alabama special election for the Senate. What follows is a transcript of the interview with Sanders that aired Sunday, Dec. 17, 2017, on \"Face the Nation.\" JOHN DICKERSON: And we're joined now by Vermont Independent  Senator Bernie Sanders. He's in Burlington, welcome Senator. This looks like it's going to get passed through the Senate and the House and signed by the president, this tax cut bill. Is there anything more that opponents like you could have done to stop this?  BERNIE SANDERS: Well I think we did everything that we could  -- but at the end of the day what you had is people like Mr. Mnuchin, who himself is worth three or four hundred million dollars, or the president of the United States who is worth several billion dollars, as you mentioned, some four or five thousand lobbyists  doing everything that they could to write a bill which significantly benefits the wealthiest people in this country and the largest corporations. The latest analysis that we have seen suggest that 72 percent of the benefits go to the top 5 percent. My guess is that 60 percent of the benefits will go to the top 1 percent and at the end of the decade because the benefits for the middle class are temporary while- while the corporate benefits are permanent, at the end of the decade over half of the middle class will be paying more in taxes.  What we are seeing here is a real massive attack on the middle class and what I worry very much, John, is that if you listen to what the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan is talking about, what he is saying is that as a result of this bill, the deficit will  go up by $1.4 trillion dollars. And what Ryan, in my view, will come back with are massive cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, in order to offset that deficit- JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask yo- BERNIE SANDERS: So massive tax breaks for the rich, cuts to  Social Security, this is a grossly unfair tax bill. \u00a0 \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: I want to get to the entitlements in- in just  a moment. But on that question of the middle class, what the administration says and what Republicans say is that yes, those tax cuts expire for the middle class, but knowing politics as they do that nobody's going to vote to have- let them expire, that those  will essentially be kept. That seems pretty reasonable in-in the way Washington works. So is it really fair to say they're-- BERNIE SANDERS: \u00a0Well-- JOHN DICKERSON: --going to-- go ahead. BERNIE SANDERS: Well, they are. I mean, the- the way this bill  is written is the tax breaks for corporations are now permanent. Why weren't the tax breaks for the middle class made permanent? Because it has to do with the priorities of the folks who wrote that legislation. And their job is to represent multinational corporations  and not working families. That's where we are today. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me- Let me ask you. There's a lot of talk  about politics here. If the Democrats take control of the Senate, and you caucus with the Democrats, what's the promise to America about what will be done to reverse the state of affairs that you're so unhappy with? BERNIE SANDERS: Look. At a time of massive income and wealth  inequality where the people on top and large corporations are doing phenomenally well our job is to pay attention to the needs of working families. We talk about a childcare tax credit in this bill. Truth is that depending on where you live in America good  quality child care can cost $12, $15, $20,000 a year. Our job is to move to universal childcare so that every working family in this country knows that their kids have good quality care. Right now, John, this is really quite unbelievable. While the  Republicans are spending all of their time providing massive tax breaks to the rich, there has been no public discussion about the DREAMers, the needs of the DREAMers. 800,000 young people born and raised in America, JOHN DICKERSON: Let- BERNIE SANDERS:-who are going to lose their legal status very  shortly. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me-- BERNIE SANDERS: What about the CHIP program? JOHN DICKERSON: Right. Let me get-- BERNIE SANDERS: 9 million kids are going to lose their health  insurance. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me get to that in a second. But if you-  Democrats take control, are corporate taxes going up? BERNIE SANDERS: I think we're going to take a very hard look  at this entire tax bill and make it a tax bill that works for the middle class and working families. Not for the top 1% and large multinational corporations. JOHN DICKERSON: But there's no question that in order to achieve  all of the things you want taxes are going to have to go up on corporations. If they're down to 21 as a result of this legislation, you can't find the money anywhere else. BERNIE SANDERS: Absolutely. Yes. In my view absolutely. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Let's go on to now the budget and  spending question. The Republicans, when Democrats have said, \"Medicare is going to have to be cut because of the so-called Pay-Go rules,\" what Republicans say is, \"Democrats are going to waive those rules next year, that those Pay-Go rules are always waived.  And so it's kind of a false attack to say that they are going to be automatic cuts for Medicare.\" Your response? BERNIE SANDERS: No. It is not a false attack, John. It's simply  listening to what the speaker of the House has said. And what he has said is after they do this tax bill the next order of business is so-called entitlement reform. And please understand that when Republicans talk about entitlement reform what they are talking  about are massive cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security in the budget that they already passed. They proposed a trillion-dollar cut to Medicaid, which would  be disastrous to people who have loved ones in nursing homes, for children, and for working families who are on Medicaid. This is what they have already proposed. So they are going to come back in my view in order to offset this deficit with terrible cuts  to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. JOHN DICKERSON: So that's slightly different though than following  through on the restrictions created by Pay-Go, which they say you'll waive. But let me ask you this question about the spending bill. Keep the government open. What's your message to Democratic leaders about how and what they should fight for in terms of funding  the government? BERNIE SANDERS: Look. Right now it is no secret that the middle  class is hurting. The Republicans have been unable to reauthorize, for example, the community health center program providing healthcare to 27 million Americans. The CHIP program. The Children's Health Insurance Program. They have ignored the fact that for  three months the CHIP program for 9 million children in this country has not been funded. We have a crisis in pensions in this country. A million and  a half hardworking people who were promised their pensions are going to see their pensions reduced by 50 or 60 percent. We have a rural infrastructure crisis where people can't even get broadband. We have 30,000 vacancies in the Veterans Administration that have  not been filled. Our job is to take care of the needs of working families and the middle class. Not just worry about the 1 percent. So I believe that as we talk about the new spending bill those are the issues we must demand that Republicans address. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. We're out of time, senator. Thanks  so much for being with us. And we'll be back in one minute.",

            "article_content": "In an interview with \"Face the Nation\" Sunday, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, discussed topics ranging from the upcoming Alabama Senate race and Roy Moore to special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. What follows is a transcript of the interview with Durbin that aired Sunday, Dec. 10, 2017, on \"Face the Nation.\" JOHN DICKERSON: Joining us now is Senate Democratic Whip Richard  Durbin. He is in Springfield, Illinois. Welcome, senator. I want to pick up on something that Senator Collins said about the choice that senators may face if Roy Moore is elected in Alabama. And the question is: What business does the Senate have in overturning  the will of the people of Alabama if he is elected? Senator Collins said that's a very tough decision. What's your sense of it? DICK DURBIN: Well, John, I can tell you this. First, the decision  is to be made by the voters in Alabama on Tuesday. And I hope that they will do the right thing in terms of defining their standards and values when it comes to people representing them in Washington. But we have heard from Republican senators first who have  suggested that if Roy Moore ends up being elected to the Senate, he would face close scrutiny, investigation, even removal from the Senate once he arrives. I agree with Senator Collins. It's a complicated issue. But  I will tell you this. We faced the reality this past week. I've known Al Franken for over 20 years. He is my friend. He was on the floor of the Senate announcing his resignation. I sat just a few feet away from him. He said it was the worst day in his political  life. It was a somber feeling. It was a reality. And I hope the voters of Alabama appreciate that reality when they make their decision on Tuesday. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about a political critique of  the Democratic Party's pressure on Al Franken that led to his resignation. Dahlia Lithwick writes in Slate a piece that says, \"Morality is no longer its own reward. What we get in exchange for being good and morally right is now nothing.\" The argument that  the Democrats have a standard that leads to Franken to go and the Republicans are going to- the Republican committee's supporting Moore, the president's supporting Moore, and that essentially Democrats are on the high road but it's a politically bad road to  be on. DICK DURBIN: \u00a0I can just tell you your interview with Susan  Collins demonstrates that's not true. There are Republicans who feel very strongly about this issue and have said so. And I think if more do, then we can establish a national standard, not a partisan standard, when it comes to the future of relationships with  women. This to me from Susan Collins's comments gives me hope that the Alabama voters will do the right thing and we'll also see both parties coming to the same conclusion on this issue. JOHN DICKERSON: Final question on this, senator. There is a  criticism that Al Franken was pressured not just because of the specific facts of the case but Democrats wanted to look good in comparison to Republicans. What's your response? DICK DURBIN: I can tell you it was a painful process because  of our personal friendships and relationships with Al and his family. There was no political calculation in here. It was just a painful moment when we made a decision, moved forward on the Democratic side. I hope the Republicans will face that reality as well. JOHN DICKERSON: On taxes, senator, what can Democrats do? This  is moving into the conference committee. And Republicans have the votes to pass it. What are Democrats going to do? DICK DURBIN: Well, it did pass the Senate. There was only one  Republican senator, Bob Corker, who voted no. Susan Collins made it clear she's still waiting before she makes her final decision. I think others are in the same position. Jeff Flake, for example, from Arizona made it clear that bringing up this issue about  DACA and the DREAMers is critical to his vote when it comes to tax. So I can't assume where the Republicans will end. But they have an awful lot to accomplish in a very short period of time. JOHN DICKERSON: You mentioned DACA. Let's just go off on a  side road there on that. A number of your Democratic supporters, colleagues would like you as a Democrat to basically make funding of the government to keep the government running- would like you to make it contingent on doing something about DACA. Will you? DICK DURBIN: Well, I can tell you this. We don't want to see  the government shut down. We want to move forward in a bipartisan fashion to solve our problems. We believe that DACA is central. The president is the one who made this the issue. September the 5th he eliminated the DACA program and put in doubt the future  of over 780,000 people in America. And we want to get this done and accomplished. 34 Republicans in the House came out last week and said, \"Do  it before the end of the year.\" The Senate Republicans have said the same thing. Lisa Murkowski yesterday tweeted that her Christmas wish- her greatest Christmas wish is to see this done, DACA and the DREAMer issue resolved, this calendar year. It is within  the power of the Republicans to get this done and to put together a package that we can pass. We want to stand by them, work with them, and get that done. JOHN DICKERSON: Nothing focuses the mind like a deadline though.  And using the deadline of the funding as leverage both for this and also the Children's Health Insurance -- 9 million children -- that still has yet to be dealt with. You at one point said, \"I'm not prepared to go home for the holidays until we get our work  done.\" That suggests a little bit of use of this funding as a deadline. But are you really going to go that far? DICK DURBIN: Well, I feel very strongly about it. There are  many important issues. DACA to me personally and the DREAM Act are very personal and mean an awful lot. But when we're talking about funding our government, providing the resources and programs that many middle income families use across America, dealing with  the opioid crisis, making certain that we take care of our veterans, making certain that we have the money for biomedical research, these are part of the conversation and part of the dialogue as we close down this budget. It is up to the Republicans to make  a decision about what we will do. I think we can get this done right. JOHN DICKERSON: Final question, senator. You're on the judiciary  committee. There have been some questions raised about inspectors, people working for the special counsel, one of whom sent disparaging texts about the president. And then another who went to Hillary Clinton's victory party and also praised blocking the president's  travel ban. What's your -- how big of a deal do you think this is, that these questions are being raised? DICK DURBIN: Let me say at the outset. I have the highest confidence  in Bob Mueller. I also have confidence that if he has any questions about the motives or conduct of his staff he will act on it decisively and professionally. He is moving forward on this investigation. I trust him. If there is something that went wrong in  terms of the staffing, I trust him to take care of it. JOHN DICKERSON: All right, senator. That's it. We're out of  time. Thanks so much for being with us. And we'll be right back in a moment. Stay with us.",

            "article_content": "Speaker Paul Ryan scoffed Wednesday at Democrats' demands to only raise the debt ceiling for a three-month period that would push the risk of a default into December.  \"I think that's a ridiculous idea,\" the Wisconsin Republican told reporters when asked to react to the proposal. \"I hope they don't mean that.\"  Ryan suggested that a short-term debt limit increase would not benefit people in Texas and Louisiana who have to deal with the devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey.  \"They want to play politics with the debt ceiling?\" Ryan said. \"That will strand the aid that we need to bring to the victims of these storms that have occurred or are about to occur.\"  Ryan went on to call the plan \"ridiculous and disgraceful\" as well as \"unworkable.\" While he didn't specify what Republican leaders prefer for a debt ceiling extension, Politico reports that they want a measure that would lift it through the 2018 midterm elections next November. Congress usually raises the debt ceiling for a much longer period of time than three months.  Senate Republicans are expected to attach a debt ceiling increase to legislation that would provide $7.85 billion in aid to the Harvey relief effort. The House is expected to vote just on the initial aid bill Wednesday and the Senate is expected to attach the debt limit and send it back to the House for a final vote. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, issued a joint statement Wednesday saying Democrats would offer votes for the plan as long as it includes only a three-month debt limit increase.  \"Democrats are prepared to offer our votes for the Harvey aid package, and a short term debt limit increase of three months,\" they said. \"Given Republican difficulty in finding the votes for their plan, we believe this proposal offers a bipartisan path forward to ensure prompt delivery of Harvey aid as well as avoiding a default, while both sides work together to address government funding, DREAMers, and health care.\" December is already expected to be a busy month for Congress because lawmakers will likely push the issue of 2018 government funding to that time.\u00a0 Rebecca Shabad is a video reporter for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders wants America's youth to get involved in politics \u2013 and he's written a guide for them. The Vermont senator's new book, \"Bernie Sanders Guide to Political Revolution,\" aims to provide tools to help young adults do just that.\u00a0 \"What this book is about is saying that we have a real crisis in American democracy,\" Sanders told \"CBS This Morning\" on Tuesday.  In the book's foreword, Sanders writes of his optimism and faith in the current generation of young people, calling them \"the smartest, most idealistic, and least prejudiced generation in the modern history of the United States.\"  \"We have the lowest voter turnout of any major country on earth. It means that we're seeing \u2013 as a result of this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision \u2013 billionaires able to buy elections, spend hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars supporting candidates who represent the wealthy and the powerful,\" Sanders said.  The antidote, Sanders says, is to not only get young people involved in politics but get them involved in the political process.  \"Run for school board, run for city council, run for state legislature,\" he said. \"This is a generation that is beyond \u2013 in many respects \u2013 racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia. I have seen these young people stand together, talk about climate change, the need to transform our energy system, to take on the oligarchy that controls our country.\"  Sanders also railed against President Trump for policies that the senator says run contrary to what the president ran his campaign on, including draining the swamp and working on behalf of working-class Americans.  \"He has brought more billionaires into his administration than any president in the history of this country,\" Sanders said. \"He supported legislation that would throw 32 million people off of health insurance.\" Sanders called for the nation to \"stand together\" despite the country's increasing political divide under Mr. Trump.  \"Bottom line is: As a nation we have got to stand together. We cannot allow the divisions that are taking place every single day led by the president. Whether you're black, or white, or Latino, we are one nation. Let's work together,\" Sanders said.  Asked whether he was planning to run in the next presidential election Sanders said, \"It's a little bit early to talk about that. Let's focus on the issues impacting the American people.\"",

            "article_content": "President Trump declined to answer a question Thursday about how his administration plans to combat a rise in anti-Semitism, and instead told the Jewish reporter asking it to sit down and called it \u201cnot a fair question.\u201d During a press conference at the White House that lasted for more than an hour, a Jewish reporter expressed concern about growing anti-Semitism and said, \u201cWhat we haven\u2019t really heard being addressed is an uptick in anti-Semitism and how the government is planning to take care of it.\u201d The reporter then referenced a spate of bomb threats against Jewish Community Centers across the U.S. over the last month or so, and then was interrupted by the president.  \u201cHe said he was going to ask a very simple, easy question. And it\u2019s not. It\u2019s not a simple question, not a fair question,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cOkay, sit down. I understand the rest of your question. So here\u2019s the story folks. Number one, I am the least anti-Semitic person that you\u2019ve ever seen in your entire life. Number two, racism. The least racist person.\u201d \u201cBut let me tell you something, that I hate the charge. I find it repulsive. I hate even the question because people that know me--and you heard the prime minister, you heard Netanyahu yesterday--did you hear him? Bibi, he said, \u2018I\u2019ve known Donald Trump for a long time,\u2019 and then he said, \u2018Forget it.\u2019 So you should take that, instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that. Just shows you about the press, but that\u2019s the way the press is,\u201d Mr. Trump said.  The reporter was not asking whether Mr. Trump was anti-Semitic, however, and he expressed frustration soon after that his question was misconstrued by the president. President Trump clearly misunderstood my question. This is highly regretful and I'm going to seek clarification. #TrumpNewsConference This exchange came a day after a reporter asked the president at a press conference with the Israeli prime minister who asked what he would say to those in the Jewish community who believe and feel that the administration is playing with \u201cxenophobia and racist tones\u201d amid rising anti-Semitic incidents. Instead of answering the question, Mr. Trump went on to talk about his Electoral College victory last November.  \u201cWell, I just want to say that we are, you know, very honored by the victory that we had 316 electoral college votes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were not supposed to crack 220. You know that, right? There was no way to 221, but then they said there\u2019s no way to 270. And there\u2019s tremendous enthusiasm out there. \u201cI will say that we are going to have peace in this country. We are going to stop crime in this country. We are going to do everything within our power to stop long simmering racism and every other thing that\u2019s going on. There\u2019s a lot of bad things that have been taking place over a long period of time.\u201d \u201cI think one of the reasons I won the election is we have a very, very divided nation, very divided. And hopefully, I\u2019ll be able to do something about that. And I, you know, it was something that was very important to me,\u201d he added. He went on to point out that his son-in-law Jared Kushner is Jewish and his daughter Ivanka, Jared\u2019s wife, converted to the religion. \u201cAs far as people, Jewish people, so many friends; a daughter who happens to be here right now; a son-in-law, and three beautiful grandchildren. I think that you\u2019re going to see a lot different United States of America over the next three, four or eight years. I think a lot of good things are happening. And you\u2019re going to see a lot of love. You\u2019re going to see a lot of love. OK? Thank you.\u201d Rebecca Shabad is a video reporter for CBS News Digital.",

Barbara Lee, D-California, explained why she will not attend the Jan. 20 presidential\u00a0inauguration of Donald Trump, calling inaugurations celebrations and saying \u201cfor many, many reasons, I cannot celebrate.\u201d In an interview on CBSN\u2019s new political show \u201cRed & Blue,\u201d Lee said she supports and respects a peaceful transfer of power and the office of the presidency. But said she is not celebrating Russian interference in the election and what she described an effort to take healthcare away from 20 million people, among other issues. \u00a0 \u201cI haven\u2019t seen or heard anything yet from the president-elect that he wants to unify the country and speak to the aspirations of each and every American,\u201d Lee said. Lee first announced that she would not be attending the inauguration on Thursday. In a statement, she said inaugurations are celebratory events and that she \u201cwill not be celebrating or honoring an incoming president who rode racism, sexism, xenophobia and bigotry to the White House.\u201d \u201cI will be organizing and preparing for resistance,\u201d she said. Lee is among a growing number of Democrats who have said they won\u2019t be attending. The growing list includes lawmakers from California as well as from New York, Georgia, Michigan, Arizona and other states. Over the weekend,\u00a0Mr. Trump tweeted an attack on Rep. John Lewis after Lewis said Mr. Trump is not a \u201clegitimate president\u201d and that he would not attend. Some legislators rushed to boycott the inauguration after the Twitter attack. As of Sunday afternoon, at least 24 Democratic congressman had announced plans to skip the inauguration in protest of Mr. Trump, according to a count by CBS News. Some, however, announced their plans to not attend before the Trump-Lewis feud.\u00a0 Others have said they will not attend but did not cite the president-elect as a reason.\u00a0",
