Many religious conservatives thought this might be the year of an evangelical comeback, when voters would throw President Obama out because of his support of same-sex marriage and abortion, and his health plan's birth control mandate. It didn't work out that way. \"I think this was an evangelical disaster,\" says Albert Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky. Mohler says white evangelicals moved in lockstep: Seventy-nine percent voted for Republican Mitt Romney, the same percentage as voted for President George W. Bush in 2004. He says they boldly telegraphed their concerns about Obama, and \"our message was rejected by millions of Americans who went to the polls and voted according to a contrary worldview.\" Mohler says there's a danger that evangelicals won't see this larger lesson \u2014 that they will say Obama won because of his unique story and personality. \"No, it was far more than that,\" he says. \"Four states dealt with the issue of same-sex marriage and after 31 to 33 straight victories, we've been handed a rather comprehensive set of defeats on the issue of the integrity of marriage.\" That, and the legalization of marijuana in some states, are examples of what Mohler calls \"a seismic moral shift in the culture.\" Others say 2012 revealed another shift. \"The understanding that the evangelical vote is a kingmaking vote, I think, is now dead,\" says Shaun Casey, a professor at Wesley Theological Seminary and a former Obama adviser. He says evangelicals pulled out all the stops to unseat the president. \"Billy Graham and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association bought full-page ads in newspapers; that made no difference,\" he says. \"Ralph Reed spent tens of millions of dollars getting out the vote in battleground states; that didn't make the difference. And you add all of that up, and it was not enough because of the changing demographics of our country.\" \"The power of this group to shape elections,\" says Greg Smith, a senior researcher at the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life, \"is limited by its size.\" \"They do turn out,\" he says. \"A quarter of the electorate described themselves as white evangelicals. It's just that that's not enough to overcome the strong Democratic support of other religious groups.\" Smith says Obama won 95 percent of black Protestants, three-quarters of Hispanic Catholics, 7 out of 10 Jewish voters and 70 percent of religiously unaffiliated voters, which is the fastest-growing segment of \"religion.\" Early on, there were signs that the power of religious conservatives might be waning, says political scientist Mark Rozell at George Mason University. In the primaries, conservative religious leaders kept trying to crown various candidates: Rick Perry, Michele Bachmann, Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum \u2014 just to avoid the Mormon, Romney, as the party nominee. \"But they ended up with Mitt Romney as the party nominee,\" he observes, \"showcasing that their power wasn't all that great \u2014 in part because they didn't have a unifying message nor a figure who could unite them.\" Rozell says in their political heyday \u2014 in the 1980s and '90s \u2014 evangelicals had the Moral Majority and the Christian Coalition to mobilize them. They had Pat Robertson and James Dobson to inform and inspire them. \"But today, there really is no single leader or group of leaders who are directing the religious conservative movement,\" he says. \"And so it seems to many to be splintered or directionless.\" Mohler at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary says evangelicals now need to approach politics in a fundamentally different way. They need to bend a little on issues of lesser importance \u2014 for example, supporting candidates who have different ideas about the role of government \u2014 but who agree with them on marriage and life issues. And most important, Mohler says, evangelicals need to reach beyond their suburban walls. \"If we do not become the movement of younger Americans and Hispanic Americans and any number of other Americans, then we will just become a retirement community,\" he says. \"And that cannot, that cannot, serve the cause of Christ.\" And, as this election shows, minorities are the growth area of both politics and religion.",

Ted Cruz, who spoke during the Republican National Convention this summer in Tampa, Fla., is among a number of minority politicians seen as rising stars in the GOP.\n                \n                    \n                    Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Incoming Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who spoke during the Republican National Convention this summer in Tampa, Fla., is among a number of minority politicians seen as rising stars in the GOP. As the nation's first African-American president, Barack Obama benefited from and expanded his party's enormous advantage among minority voters. But as he prepares to start his second term, Obama hasn't managed to usher in behind him many Democrats who are minorities to top elected office. Conversely, Republicans \u2014 despite their highly limited support among non-Anglo voters \u2014 have managed to elevate more top politicians from minority backgrounds. \"It's just an objective, empirical fact that more members of minority groups have done well winning in the Republican Party,\" says Artur Davis, a former Democratic congressman from Alabama who has switched allegiance to the GOP. \"The Republican Party has proven welcoming to minorities, and its voters will elect minorities as long as those minorities share their worldview, as long as those minorities are conservatives,\" Davis says. Thinner Lineup Obama's success disproves the notion that minorities can't be elected as Democrats, and in terms of lower offices, far more minorities are elected as Democrats than Republicans. But when it comes to major statewide offices, Davis is right. Minority Democrats face several obstacles, if only because they often represent congressional districts that are more liberal than their states as a whole. Many of them, in fact, hail from Southern states that are unlikely to elect Democrats of any color statewide these days. For their part, Republicans are happy and eager to promote politicians of color who embrace the party's conservative agenda. When Congress reconvenes next month, Democrats will make history by seating the first caucus in House history comprising more women and minorities than white men. The House GOP caucus will remain dominated by white males. By contrast, the lineup of Democrats holding top statewide offices is thin \u2014 limited to Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, who is African-American, and Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, who is Hispanic. Republicans can boast of a number of minority officeholders whose first two names in news accounts seem to be \"rising star,\" including Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and incoming Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. Once newly elected officials are sworn in, Republicans will have more female governors and more Hispanic U.S. senators than the Democrats. Republican Tim Scott of South Carolina will be the only African-American in the Senate \u2014 appointed by Nikki Haley, one of two Republican governors of Indian descent. (Louisiana's Bobby Jindal is the other.) Minority politicians are likely to have \"a smoother path\" running for top offices as Republicans, says Robert C. Smith, author of several books about race and politics. \"The left highway is crowded, and the right highway's less so,\" he says. Hobbled By Success? The nature of the districts many minority Democrats represent handicaps them when they set their sights on statewide offices, says Lara Brown, a Villanova University political scientist. \"When you look at those minority-majority districts, this is why Democrats don't have statewide elected officials [from minority groups],\" she says. \"Their constituents and these districts are very liberal, and that makes it very hard for these individuals to moderate [their positions] to win their states.\" Smith, who teaches political science at San Francisco State University, says this argument was more true 10 or 20 years ago than it is today. He notes Democratic black politicians with aspirations for higher office \u2014 such as Davis, who ran as a Democrat for governor in 2010, and then-Rep. Harold Ford, who ran for Senate in Tennessee back in 2006 \u2014 self-consciously adopted moderate or even conservative positions to run statewide. \"Twenty years ago, black politicians had little ambition to seek office beyond being in Congress or being a big-city mayor,\" Smith says. \"Now, they're positioning themselves as centrists so they can run for statewide office.\" The Need For Crossover Appeal Still, reaching the top rungs can be difficult for African-American politicians in particular \u2014 because the vast majority of those holding elected office are in the South. Neither Davis nor Ford was able to win election, and other blacks nominated to statewide posts in the South have done even more poorly. In addition to the region's conservative nature, in the Deep South, \"in terms of statewide elections, there's high racial polarization,\" says David Bositis, an expert on black politics at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies. Democratic politicians of color frequently are nominated to statewide office in the South, but they rarely win. In recent races in states such as Mississippi and Florida, black candidates have taken roughly 30 percent of the general election vote \u2014 about the same share as the minority populations there as a whole. Following his keynote address to the Democratic National Convention this summer, San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro was widely touted as a potential star. But despite prognostications that Texas may eventually turn \"blue\" in presidential voting, Castro has to include in his calculations the fact that Texas hasn't elected a Democrat to statewide office in nearly 20 years. Things may be different for Cory Booker, the African-American mayor of Newark, who recently made clear his intentions to run for U.S. Senate. If he's nominated, he'll have a strong chance in the generally Democratic state of New Jersey, Smith says. Minorities running in Northern states with relatively small minority populations \"absolutely\" need to have crossover appeal, says Arturo Vargas, executive director of the National Association of Latino Elected & Appointed Officials. He notes that both Menendez, from New Jersey and former Colorado Sen. Ken Salazar (now Obama's interior secretary) carried states that are both about 15 percent Hispanic. GOP's Welcome Mat By contrast, Vargas notes, even successful minority Republican officials have mostly failed to carry majorities among their own ethnic communities. Rubio, the Florida senator, is a notable exception, having won 55 percent of the Hispanic vote in his 2010 election. Given the usual lack of support for Republican blacks and Hispanics within their own groups, there's a certain quality close to tokenism that prevails on the GOP side, Bositis suggests. \"The Republican Party has always tried to have a certain number,\" he says. \"If they could find some black or Hispanic or Asian person to put out front, they were always happy to do it.\" There's no question Republicans are eager to showcase minority politicians. Their national convention in Tampa, Fla., at times seemed to feature more black and brown faces on the podium than were otherwise in the hall. Smith, the San Francisco State political scientist, says this is done from necessity. Giving prominent roles to minority politicians, he suggests, may not help the GOP make deep inroads into minority communities that find the party's platform hostile to them on issues such as voting rights and immigration. \"But it gives the party the image of being an inclusive, multiethnic party,\" Smith says. \"White suburbanites would not be comfortable with a party that is not inclusive.\" If an ambitious politician who happens to be African-American or Hispanic or Asian also happens to be conservative, the GOP is going to welcome that person with open arms. \"If you're an African-American or a Hispanic of conservative bent \u2014 and you will be, or you wouldn't be in the Republican Party \u2014 you're going to be in the mainstream of your party more often than not,\" says Whit Ayres, a GOP consultant.",

            "article_content": "Activists from the Young Guard, which supports Russian President Vladimir Putin, have been protesting the Mormon church in Russia, calling it a \"totalitarian cult.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Konstantin Zavrazhin/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Activists from the Young Guard, which supports Russian President Vladimir Putin, have been protesting the Mormon church in Russia, calling it a \"totalitarian cult.\" Young supporters of Russian President Vladimir Putin have staged several protests this month outside Mormon meeting houses, claiming that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is an \"authoritarian sect\" with connections to the CIA and FBI. The protesters are members of the Young Guard, a youth organization of Putin's United Russia Party. They insist their actions have nothing to do with Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate and Mormon who called Russia the \"No. 1 geopolitical foe\" of the U.S. Ekaterina Stenyakina, the co-chair of the Young Guard, says the group was inspired to protest by a recent directive that Putin gave to law enforcement groups and legislators, asking them for ways to regulate the activities of \"totalitarian sects.\" Stenyakina says her organization decided to draw attention to some of the groups it considered to be totalitarian sects, and that the Mormons simply became the first on the list. About a dozen protesters recently gathered outside a Mormon meeting hall in Moscow, holding hand-lettered signs that said, \"No to totalitarian cults,\" and \"CIA \u2014 stop!\" Mormon Population Grows While the Mormons are a very small fraction of Russia's religious landscape, their numbers have grown steadily, from a few hundred in 1990 to just under 22,000 today. Stenyakina says her group is relying on the research of experts to determine that the Latter-day Saints church is a cult. For the most part, however, that \"research\" just seems to repeat the claims found on anti-Mormon websites. It includes charges that the Mormons are not really Christian and that they believe in multiple gods. The Young Guard's twist on this anti-Mormonism is the claim that Mormons are promoting an American political agenda in Russia. \"This is absolutely wrong, false [and] not true,\" says Andrey Filimonov, an LDS spokesman for Eastern Europe, based in Moscow. \"The church in every country has nothing to do with political issues at all.\" Filimonov points to the church's statement of political neutrality, which is published in every country where Mormons preach. Stenyakina says the Young Guard sees the Mormon Church as an American enterprise, funded from the United States, with missionaries who act as American operatives. She says they would come under a recently passed Russian law that requires such groups to register as foreign agents. Filimonov argues that the church is not American, but an international organization. \"The leaders in Russia of the church are Russians,\" he says. Filimonov says that most missionaries in Russia today are not Americans, but Russians and people from other countries. In fact, the Mormon Church now claims more than 14 million adherents worldwide, fewer than half of whom live in the United States. The Young Guard contends that Mormon missionaries in Russia cooperate with the FBI and CIA. They repeat another theme that's common on the Internet as well: that American Mormon missionaries go to work for the U.S. security agencies in disproportionate numbers when they return home. The agencies don't divulge the religious leanings of their personnel, and Filimonov says he can only offer his own observations. \"I personally don't know anyone who went, and I've been in the church since '93,\" he says. \"[And] it's their personal choice if they even do because everybody is looking for whatever they want to do and it doesn't mean they're spies.\" Filimonov notes that missionaries' language skills and the cultural knowledge gained from living abroad suit them for many kinds of international jobs. The Young Guard's Stenyakina says her group wants to alert young people in Russia not to get involved with the LDS church. Still, she insists that the timing of the protests had nothing to do with the U.S. election or Romney's religious affiliation. The Russian press labeled Romney as \"the main American Russophobe,\" she says, but that didn't trigger the protests. For now, Stenyakina is not saying whether the Young Guard will continue to target Mormon missionaries or pursue other religious groups deemed to be cults.",

Having won a second term, Obama will seek to set the nation's agenda on issues ranging from taxes to immigration, but he may continue to struggle in selling his ideas to Congress. Winning matters. Having earned a second term, President Obama will attempt to build on and expand the agenda from his first, launching new initiatives on tax policy, education and immigration. But having won the popular vote by a bare majority \u2014 and still facing a divided Congress \u2014 Obama may find it difficult to gather momentum for his policies. Despite the close result in the popular vote nationwide, Obama wasted no time claiming vindication for his ideas. In his victory speech early Wednesday in Chicago, he tied his re-election to two centuries of American progress. His speech was light on policy specifics, but he touched on several priorities including deficit reduction, overhaul of the tax code, immigration and energy independence. \"Tonight, you voted for action, not politics as usual,\" he said. Obama will not view a Republican Party that held on to its majority as something he needs to accommodate, but rather something he needs to work around, says Henry Olsen, vice president of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. Listen to NPR's special coverage and analysis following the 2012 presidential election, hosted by Neal Conan. \"He's going to say, 'They threw the kitchen sink at me and they couldn't take me out and they couldn't take the Senate,' \" Olsen says. Any president gains a boost from re-election. Obama may also be helped by an improving economy. The International Monetary Fund projected last month the U.S. will enjoy the most growth of any rich nation over the next couple of years. Obama will also hold the whip hand in his initial negotiations with Congress, because of the so-called fiscal cliff. Any deal to avoid painful tax increases and spending cuts will require the president's signature. \"I'm confident that he and the Senate Democrats will continue to insist that part of a deal is the expiration of the Bush tax cuts for the top 2 percent [of earners],\" says Jared Bernstein, who has been an economic adviser in the Obama White House. \"Everyone agrees on the other 98 percent.\" In addition, Bernstein notes, Obama now has the chance to solidify two of the major achievements of his first term \u2014 the Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank banking regulations. The president also has made it clear he wants to move major legislation regarding immigration. \"A lot of the time, newly elected and re-elected presidents get more than you think they could,\" Bernstein says. But on those issues \u2014 as well as many others \u2014 Obama cannot count on help from Republicans in Congress. The president's desires will clearly do much to shape the national agenda over the coming years, but his narrow win suggests that there is a lack of consensus for his policies. \"You have to ask the question why it would be any different than the last two years,\" says Alan Cobb, vice president of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group. \"It's stalemate for another four years, isn't it?\" Stephen Hess, an expert on the presidency at the Brookings Institution, a center-left think tank, agreed that was possible. \"There really are some basic splits between the two parties that each represent half the country.\" Obama, in fact, appears, like his predecessor, to have been more of a divider than a uniter. He certainly has not ushered in a post-partisan era of good feelings, as some of his supporters thought possible four years ago. Despite hopes that his historic stature as the nation's first African-American president would lead to a \"post-racial period,\" Tuesday's election was largely divided along racial and ethnic lines. A big majority of white voters supported his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, while Obama won even bigger margins among Hispanic and African-American voters. Obama's presidency has also done nothing, as yet, to alleviate the nation's partisan divide. Republicans will no longer be seeking to deprive Obama of a second term, but there's no indication that they have warmed to his policy ambitions. \"Obama will have a hard time making his case where it counts, on Capitol Hill,\" says Jack Pitney, a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College in California. Just as Obama may feel vindicated by victory, so, too, will House Republicans, Pitney says. They managed to hold on to their majority, surviving campaign attacks from Democrats over Medicare and other issues. With Democrats in the minority in the House and far short, despite their Senate victories, of holding the 60 votes needed to shut off filibusters, governing the country will be difficult, predicts Rick Perlstein, a liberal journalist and historian. \"Ultimately, it [ends] Barack Obama's grand dream of elevating the discourse and the lion laying down with the lamb,\" Perlstein says. Obama is now just the third president in U.S. history to have been re-elected with a smaller share of the vote than during his initial election. The other two were Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose winning percentage ticked down in both 1940 and 1944, and Andrew Jackson, who took less of the popular vote in 1832. Still, the diminished confidence of voters didn't stop FDR from prosecuting World War II or Jackson paying off the national debt and helping to establish the primacy of the federal government over the states. Obama in a second term will find plenty to keep himself busy for \"more than eight hours a day,\" says presidential historian Robert Dallek, quoting John F. Kennedy. \"You have a second-term president who doesn't have control of Congress,\" Dallek says. \"He's probably going to do a lot more foreign policy, because that's where they have running room.\" Despite the status quo nature of the election results, with partisan control of the White House, Senate and House all remaining unchanged, Obama supporters are hopeful in the wake of his win that he can indeed make good on his campaign slogan and move the country \"forward.\" The line of people waiting to vote Tuesday morning at Foundry Methodist United Church in Washington, D.C., stretched for nearly a block outside along P Street. Many said they wanted to show their support for Obama, despite near-freezing temperatures and the certainty he would take roughly 90 percent of the District of Columbia vote. Several people said they wanted to give a boost to his national popular vote total. \"I hope he not only wins in the Electoral College but wins a popular vote mandate,\" said Sara Schapiro, who works at an education policy think tank. In his victory speech, Obama offered a largely communitarian vision of shared values and destinies of individuals in the country. Still, he recognized that the election will not put controversy and \"sometimes fierce\" disagreement to rest. \"That won't change after tonight,\" he said, \"and it shouldn't.\"",

In this election, Christian conservatives seem to be more against President Obama than they are for Mitt Romney. But they do like GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan, who used a speech Friday to vouch for Romney. At the annual gathering of religious conservatives in Washington, D.C., there was also talk of this week's violence in the Middle East. The Values Voter Summit got under way first thing Friday morning, with a speech from Tony Perkins, whose Family Research Council organizes this event. \"The Republican delegates met in Tampa for their convention. The delegates for the Democratic convention met in Charlotte. And now, value voters are meeting in Washington, D.C. And you are the value voter delegates, and this is our convention,\" he said. There is always talk of foreign policy at the summit. Often, it is about the need to support Israel 100 percent. On that topic, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann's speech included a dig at the president. \"President Obama needs to get his priorities straight. What he needs to do is cancel his interview with David Letterman, cancel his meeting with Beyonce, cancel his meeting with Jay-Z, and instead agree to meet with the prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu,\" she said. The hotel ballroom was packed by late morning for the star attraction: Ryan. He first gave a carefully calibrated statement about the violence in Libya, Egypt and Tunisia. He spoke of Ambassador Chris Stevens and the others who died. \"They were there for the most peaceful purposes in service to our country. And today, our country honors their lives and grieves with their families,\" he said. Then, moments later, Ryan portrayed the violence as a product of a weak foreign policy. \"Amid all these threats and dangers, what we do not see is steady, consistent American leadership,\" he said. \"In the days ahead, and in the years ahead, American foreign policy needs moral clarity and firmness of purpose.\" For most of the speech, Ryan went after Obama for pursuing failed economic policies. Because this was an audience of religious conservatives, he also delivered a lengthy message accusing of the president of promoting abortion. \"In the Clinton years, the stated goal was to make abortion 'safe, legal and rare.' But that was a different time, and a different president,\" he said. \"Now, apparently, the Obama-Biden ticket stands for an absolute, unqualified right to abortion \u2014 at any time, under any circumstance and even at taxpayer expense.\" That is not the president's position on abortion rights. The Obama campaign responded that Ryan's speech contained \"over-the-top, dishonest attacks.\" It was last year at this same event that a pastor from Dallas called Romney's Mormon religion a \"cult.\" Many in attendance then said they would support Romney, but only as a last resort. Friday, Miriam Harris from North Carolina said she first wanted Herman Cain, then Rick Santorum, before backing Romney. When asked if Romney is conservative enough, she took a long pause. \"I'm hesitating. But I'm not worried about it because I think a clear message has been sent to him that he must listen to the conservatives,\" she said. Some religious conservatives have complained this election that social issues have taken a back seat to worries about the economy.

That's where the head of the Original North Phoenix Tea Party lives. His name is Wesley Harris, and he used to manufacture precision rifle barrels. These days, his son runs the business, while Harris spends most of his time as a full-time Tea Party activist. Running Against Disenchantment The first rule of Tea Party activists: You do not talk about being a Tea Party leader. No one person speaks for the movement as a whole. But in his personal experience, Harris can trace the ebb and flow of enthusiasm in his community. Wes Harris, founder of the Original North Phoenix Tea Party, has been a registered Democrat, independent and now Republican. He says that while Tea Party activism had dropped off over the past two years, issues like health care and immigration are starting to draw people back.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrea Hsu/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Wes Harris, founder of the Original North Phoenix Tea Party, has been a registered Democrat, independent and now Republican. He says that while Tea Party activism had dropped off over the past two years, issues like health care and immigration are starting to draw people back. He looks fondly on that period back in 2009 when he first started holding meetings under the Tea Party mantle, and when they outgrew their first meeting space in two weeks. \"We've had huge events here,\" he says. \"When we get more Tea Parties together, you know, we number in the thousands.\" Harris says that after the 2010 midterm elections, conservatives became disenchanted with the leaders they elected \u2014 many of them with Tea Party support \u2014 which helped give the Republican Party a majority in the House of Representatives. \"Attendance fell off. People started to get complacent again. Apathy in this country is a tragedy,\" he says. \"If my ox isn't being gored, I don't care. And that's what you found after the election in 2010, when we had, quote, a 'new order,' at least in the House. We saw quickly that that new order didn't perform up to our expectations nor up to their promises, and so as a result, people started to become disenchanted.\" But, Harris says: \"Obamacare has regenerated it. People are starting to rally back to the Tea Parties because of these kinds of things going on. And the fact that the country is going to hell in a handbasket, pardon the English, but that's it.\" Harris cites the national unemployment rate, the California cities that have had to file for bankruptcy, the federal agencies he says that have long overreached in power. But mention immigration, and Wes Harris really lights up. Tea Party activists rallied around the hard-line immigration enforcement cause embodied in the state's controversial law, SB 1070. While the Supreme Court last month struck down three out of four provisions under scrutiny, the most popular provision with conservatives \u2014 allowing police to check immigration status during routine traffic stops \u2014 was upheld. \"Ninety percent of 1070 is in place,\" says Harris. \"The Obama administration has couched it as though it were a great loss. It was not a loss. It was a profound victory.\" Harris says the government's reaction to the ruling has reinvigorated conservative activists. \"I am not a fan of Sheriff Joe Arpaio,\" the hard-line Maricopa County sheriff who has made a name for his tough immigration stances, says Harris. \"I've known him for years. I am a fan, however, of some of the things he has done and tried to do. And I take great exception to the federal government coming down on that one individual. ... So these are rallying points for Tea Party people or activists like myself.\" It's a much-needed boost after a flurry of Tea Party-backed candidates had a tough time last fall in Arizona. Not only was the author of the SB 1070 immigration law, former Republican state Sen. Russell Pearce, recalled from office, Tea Party-supported challengers to the Phoenix City Council flopped, and the mayoral candidate who courted their votes was similarly trounced. Arpaio, who has long enjoyed Tea Party support, is facing a lawsuit over racial profiling and a tough re-election campaign. Refueling For November But Tea Party conservatives remain a coveted demographic in several contests this summer, including the race for Arizona's U.S. Senate seat. Arizona businessman Wil Cardon attends a luncheon in Scottsdale. Cardon faces six-term Rep. Jeff Flake in the Republican primary race for U.S. Senate.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrea Hsu/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Arizona businessman Wil Cardon attends a luncheon in Scottsdale. Cardon faces six-term Rep. Jeff Flake in the Republican primary race for U.S. Senate. At a trendy Scottsdale steak restaurant, a couple of dozen Republican women gather for a meet-and-greet with Senate candidate Wil Cardon, a boyish-looking Republican businessman. It's a well-connected group with many active in the state Republican Party or with Tea Party chapters. There are summer dresses adorned with rhinestone pins of elephants, and one lapel sparkles with a \"Romney 2012\" brooch. Cardon's opponent in the Aug. 28 Republican primary is six-term Rep. Jeff Flake, who is well known in the state. Both candidates are constantly trying to outdo each other's conservative credentials. While some of the women here are still undecided, they do seem poised to jump into action one way or another. \"I think the Tea Party is gone to ground, and we are just as strong, just as motivated as we were during the Obamacare legislation. We're still supporting candidates, and we're in there fighting,\" says conservative activist Susan Leeper. \"I think there are a number of us who were very disappointed with the immigration ruling. It's been put on the back burner right now by the Obamacare ruling. It's still an issue because there are other states that have immigration laws that were modeled after Arizona, and I think it's still an issue, but it's not in the forefront,\" Leeper says. At the end of the day, the top issue for Leeper, Harris and others who identify with the Tea Party is getting President Obama out of office. New voter registration numbers released by the Arizona secretary of state's office show that while Republicans have steadily gained supporters over the past two years, the number of registered Democrats has fallen off by more than 50,000 people in the state. So conservatives are still very much running the show, at least for now.",

Here, he delivers a sermon during Sunday services at Franklin Avenue Baptist Church in New Orleans.\n                \n                    \n                    Gerald Herbert/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Rev. Fred Luter is running unopposed for the presidency of the Southern Baptist Convention. Here, he delivers a sermon during Sunday services at Franklin Avenue Baptist Church in New Orleans. The Southern Baptist Convention is expected to elect its first black president on Tuesday: Fred Luter, a former street preacher who turned a dying New Orleans church into a powerhouse. His election is a milestone for the 167-year-old denomination at a time when minorities make up a growing share of a shrinking membership. Luter, who is running unopposed for president of the nation's largest Protestant body, is a departure from his predecessors. He was the middle child of a divorced mother, and until a motorcycle accident landed him in the hospital at age 20, he had little interest in God. Then God changed him, he told NPR earlier this year. \"I grew up in the 'hood, and my mom worked two or three jobs. So I hung out with a lot of bad guys, did a lot of crazy things I should not have done,\" Luter said. \"And so, when I gave my life to the Lord and saw what God did in my life, then I wanted all those guys I ran the street with to experience what I was experiencing.\" Soon, Luter was preaching on the streets in New Orleans. In 1986, he was invited to take over Franklin Avenue Baptist Church. Under him, its congregation grew from a couple of dozen people to 7,000 \u2014 the largest Southern Baptist church in Louisiana. Then Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005, destroying the sanctuary. \"It would have been easy for Fred Luter to have said, 'I think God's calling me elsewhere,' \" says Russell Moore, dean of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky. \"And he could have gone to a very comfortable pastorate anywhere in the country. \"And yet, he stayed,\" Moore says. \"And he stood with the people of New Orleans and said, 'We'll be back, we'll rebuild' \u2014 and became a spiritual anchor.\" 'The Future Of The Country Is Urban' Luter's decision to stay, and his personal charisma, propelled him to national prominence in the Southern Baptist Convention, says pastor David Crosby. Crosby leads First Baptist of New Orleans, which shared its space with Luter's congregation while they rebuilt. He adds that Luter brings something else desperately needed to this denomination, which has seen its numbers drop: He understands how to reach the only growth area of religion. \"The future of the country is urban; the future of the Southern Baptist Convention is also urban,\" Crosby says. \"We've got to learn how to operate and do our mission and thrive in the urban environment. And Fred brings that. He knows it instinctively.\" The SBC has made some progress in that area. Two decades ago, the denomination was \"as white as a tractor pull,\" as one critic put it. Now it's 20 percent minority. Richard Land, who heads the SBC's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, says Luter's election shows how far the Southern Baptists have come from the days when they supported slavery. \"It's as historic a moment as Southern Baptists have had,\" Land says, \"because the president of SBC is not just an honorific \u2014 it is a position of real power.\" Maybe \u2014 and maybe not, says Dwight McKissic, senior pastor of the largely African-American Cornerstone Baptist Church in Arlington, Texas. 'A Historic Moment' \"This is a great job, but it's somewhat symbolic and ceremonial,\" he says. McKissic says the two-year presidency is a good first step. But he says African-Americans are absent from all the real positions of power. Some say there's a latent racism in the denomination. And many were troubled by a recent broadcast on Land's radio program in which he said President Obama and black leaders were using the death of Trayvon Martin for political purposes. \"This is being done to try to gin up the black vote for an African-American president who is in deep, deep, deep trouble for re-election,\" Land said on the air. \"It was like someone took a knife and stuck it in my heart,\" McKissic says. \"It validated suspicions that many black Baptists have had all along, that this is how a good number, if not the majority, of Southern Baptists felt.\" Land has apologized and asked for forgiveness. \"I don't want anything I've said, or any mistakes I've made, to detract from \u2014 in any way \u2014 from what is going to be a truly historic moment \u2014 a historic moment in which I rejoice,\" he says. Luter has forgiven Land; he says it's time to look forward. He notes that if he's elected, it will be because white Baptists voted for him. \"It won't be because of the handful of black folk that's going to be there,\" Luter says. \"So, it will say something to the country and to the world \u2014 that the Southern Baptist Convention is not just talking this thing, we're actually walking this thing.\"",

Doing well in the state's primary is important for Gingrich because he represented a congressional district there for 20 years.\n                \n                    \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich is facing his most important challenge yet \u2014 winning Georgia on Super Tuesday.  Georgia is considered Gingrich's home because he represented parts of the state in Congress for 20 years, but he hasn't lived there for more than a decade. Over the weekend, Gingrich held several rallies, including one in Peachtree City, south of Atlanta, where he stressed that this area has long supported him. \"It is great to be home,\" Gingrich told the crowd. \"I believe that I carried Fayette County in every single election, including the two that I lost.\" Gingrich admitted that running for the Republican nomination is a tough fight, but he said he is prepared. \"This has been a little bit like riding a roller coaster. In fact, I tell folks it's a little bit like the roller coaster at Disney that's in the dark,\" he said. \"If you've ever ridden Space  Mountain, you don't know what's coming next.  You don't know where you were, and you're not sure where you're going.\" Gingrich called the contest a \"wide-open race\" and said recent polls prove that former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is not the inevitable nominee.  As for former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, he said it remains to be seen how Santorum does in the next few weeks. \"But the fact is I am the only candidate in this race who has stood nose to nose with presidents of both parties and not flinched,\" Gingrich said. Georgia's Conservatives Both Gingrich and Santorum are going after voters seeking an alternative to Romney.  Sunday night, Santorum appeared at First Redeemer, a Baptist megachurch north of Atlanta in the heart of Gingrich's old congressional district. Even Santorum was surprised at the reception he got from thousands who crammed into the sanctuary. Santorum didn't talk about his GOP challengers but instead criticized President Obama, saying the federal government is overreaching, oppressive and threatening religious freedom. \"This is why this election here in the state of Georgia is so important,\" Santorum said. \"You've got the biggest delegate prize on Super Tuesday, the biggest day of this primary election. What are you going to do?\" Four years ago, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee spoke at this same church and ultimately won the Georgia primary. It's clear Santorum hopes to capture that same religious conservative block, and many voters here are behind the former senator. \"I was really impressed.  I've liked Santorum from the beginning, but hearing him speak really inspired me more,\" said Georgia voter Lisa McBryant.  She said she likes Gingrich but that she leans more toward Santorum's conservative values. Gingrich's Challenge Merle Black, a political science professor at Emory  University in Atlanta, said to win here, Gingrich has to get the support of those who classify themselves as very conservative and somewhat conservative. And he has to regain the momentum he had in January and in South   Carolina, whose primary he won Jan. 21. \"In order for Gingrich to really do well, he'd have to kind of bring back a lot of voters that have looked at him and looked away again,\" Black said. \"That's very, very hard in politics. So he needs a big win in Georgia in order to set off the possibility of any kind of Southern strategy.\" Gingrich also has to combat negative ads that started running here last week, well ahead of the March 6 primary, some paid for by the superPAC that backs Romney. Still, Gingrich has his solid backers. At the rally in Peachtree City, Ellen Rodriguez said she has known Gingrich for more than three decades. \"Our sons and his daughters sat on the floor and stuffed envelopes for him, so we have voted for him every time he's ever run,\" Rodriguez said. Gingrich is planning a bus trip around the state next week to attract new supporters and shore up votes from his former constituents.  And while he acknowledges a loss in Georgia would be a problem, he says it wouldn't force him out of the race.",

You're an NPR reporter covering a presidential candidate. Serious stuff, even if it's still early in the election season. As he speaks, you think you hear the candidate say something that negatively singles out African-Americans. You try to get an explanation from the candidate after he finishes, but can't get to him. So, you go back to your hotel and listen to the tape. You're convinced he said it. But it's a little garbled. What do you do? In the balance, as you prepare your story, could be the fate of one man's presidential candidacy, or an increase in racial friction during an election year\u2014or just simple accuracy. This is the situation that Ted Robbins faced covering Rick Santorum in a meeting with voters in Sioux City, Iowa, two days before the Iowa caucuses earlier this month. Unable to get an explanation from Santorum, Robbins went with what he heard, which was a slur against black Americans. Since then, however, many listeners\u2014and the candidate himself\u2014say that in the garbled comment, the candidate did not mention blacks. At the most, others say, the candidate might have started to say \"black\" but stopped himself. All of this raises questions about how far a reporter and NPR should go to be fair and responsible. There is no totally satisfactory answer. If someone in the chain heard what many of us did, they should have stopped a dangerous \"gotcha\" moment. Sides have lined up as the story has set off a chain of accusations, claims and denials among advocacy groups, African-Americans, commentators and talk show hosts. The issue still dogs Santorum in the blogosphere as he campaigns in the South Carolina primary. This is what Robbins' story quoted Santorum as saying in Iowa: They're [undefined who, but probably government and politicians] just pushing harder and harder to get more and more of you dependent upon them so they can get your vote. That's what the bottom line is. I don't want to make black people's lives better by giving them somebody else's money. I want to give them the opportunity to go out and earn the money. Santorum stumbles on what appears to be the word \"black.\"  You can listen to it yourself here and watch CBS' tape of that part of the speech here. Robbins was at the coffee shop event in Sioux City with producer Sam Sanders. He said that the two of them looked at each other after Santorum finished speaking and said, in Robbins' words, \"Did you hear what I heard?\"  It was Sanders who attempted and failed to get through to Santorum, who left quickly, Robbins said. He continued, \"We went back to our hotel. It had sounded like a Freudian slip. Then we heard it on tape and that was when we were surprised that it was as clear as it was.\" Sanders agreed. In fact, Robbins and Sanders were so sure, Robbins told me, that their concern was not whether Santorum said it or whether it was racially explosive, but whether it was factually fair on Santorum's part to single out blacks. \"It was factually inaccurate, and that was what bothered me, or bothered us,\" Robbins said. CNN's Anderson Cooper was tendentious and the NYT's Charles Blow was sarcastic as the report took on a toxic life of its own. Robbins said he believed that more whites than blacks receive welfare benefits. Santorum had mentioned Medicaid as part of the same rambling comment.  There were few people to call on a late Sunday afternoon, and so Robbins said he searched online about Medicaid usage by race but couldn't come up with anything definitive because of the way the statistics are kept. Neal Carruth, the supervising editor for election coverage, entered the picture and heard the tape while it was being edited. He, too, agreed that Santorum had singled out blacks. And like Robbins, Carruth said he did not frame the story in racial tinderbox terms. \"We were doing a daily from-the-trail story on Rick Santorum and his remark about black people getting other people's money was just one element of that story,\" Carruth told me. \"It wasn't the central focus of that story, but it seemed to us a newsworthy comment and worth including.\" And so the resulting story on Morning Edition did not lead with the \"black\" comment or hype it by calling it racially provocative.  It was only midway through the three-and-a-half-minute report that Robbins said on air: For Santorum, that [core message] means cutting government regulation, making Americans less dependent on government aid, fewer people getting food stamps, Medicaid and other forms of federal assistance - especially one group. And then followed the tape of Santorum making the famous quote, which we could all hear for ourselves.  The story then cuts back to Robbins, who adds: Santorum did not elaborate on why he singled out blacks who rely on federal assistance. The voters here didn't seem to care. This last comment can be taken in many ways, but Robbins says he was referring to the lack of reaction in the almost all-white audience, which clapped politely. Curiously, many reporters were at the event, and only NPR reported the highly newsworthy black quote. Had it been Mitt Romney, or, say, President Barack Obama, who had muffed a line, their press spokespeople would have been all over the journalists to correct\u2014or spin\u2014the statement.  Santorum, however, has been running such a shoestring campaign that, as the Associated Press reported last December, Santorum largely moved around Iowa with just a driver and a borrowed pickup truck.  It was only four days later, as he was hustling to play catch-up in New Hampshire, that Santorum said he finally had time to review the video tape of that coffee shop event. If they had had a doubt, the NPR team should clearly have held off until confirming it with Santorum. But Robbins and Carruth said that they did not have a doubt. It was like reporting on any speech: the speaker said it, you report it. It was just one more daily story that rounds out the picture of a candidate. Many more whites receive welfare assistance than blacks, though the proportion of blacks is higher. Seen that way, the story was straightforward and fine. Its limitations\u2014not getting the truth on welfare usage or more explanation from the candidate\u2014were correctly acknowledged. This was done in the line, \"Santorum did not elaborate why he singled out blacks.\" Robbins says that in retrospect, he wishes he would have added that they tried to get an explanation from the candidate but couldn't. This more explicit disclaimer would have been better, though only marginally so. This entire analysis, however, relies on Santorum having said \"black.\"  It changes if you think that the journalists at NPR should have been less certain about what he said, given the garble as he spoke.  The analysis changes even more if you think that not just factual accuracy was at stake, but also the demonizing of a race\u2014blacks are taking other people's money\u2014and the stoking of racial tension. If you think these things\u2014as I do\u2014then it should have been the responsibility of someone in the editorial chain of command to stop that part of the story before it ran and ask if this wasn't an unfair and potentially dangerous \"gotcha\" moment. Robbins is an experienced reporter.  He is based in Arizona, however, and through no fault of his own was covering Santorum for the first time. He said he did the normal background research on the candidate. A more seasoned follower of Santorum might have known that he doesn't have a history of playing the race card. This knowledge would have been a tip-off to be extra cautious. A second tip-off was the context. While Anderson Cooper on CNN much later\u2014and somewhat tendentiously\u2014found that the context of Santorum's comments supported the idea that the candidate meant to say \"black,\" I don't see this contextual inference at all. Immediately before the comment in question, Santorum said the government or politicians are trying to get \"you\"\u2014his mostly white audience\u2014dependent on welfare. The meeting was not a white resentment affair with speakers railing against minorities. I can't condemn the journalists for reporting what they say they heard. In fairness, however, I have to add that Santorum is such a confusing, undisciplined speaker that the context and meaning of his comments are often hard to follow. After the NPR story aired on a Monday morning, CBS.com did a similar short story Monday afternoon, and then followed up on the Evening News with an interview of Santorum by anchorman Scott Pelley. The anchor asked the candidate why he singled out African-Americans on welfare. You can decide for yourself whether you believe Santorum's reply that he couldn't remember what he said. You might first ask yourself, though, if this has ever happened to you. It has to me.  Few of us, additionally, have had to speak off the cuff in a forced campaign march as much as Santorum has. In Santorum's reply to Pelley, he did summarize what has been his historical position on welfare. Here is his full reply: I've seen that quote. I haven't seen the context in which that was made. Yesterday I talked for example about a movie called, um, what was it? 'Waiting for Superman,' which was about black children and so I don't know whether it was in response and I was talking about that. Let me just say that no matter what, I want to make every lives [sic] better.  I don't want anybody\u2014and if you look at what I've been saying\u2014I've been pretty clear about my concern for dependency in this country, and concern for people not being more dependent on our government, whatever their race or ethnicity is. CBS was able to do a fact check. Instead of looking at Medicaid, CBS looked at food stamps, a program much easier to analyze. Pelley pointed out that only nine percent of Iowans who receive food stamps are black; 84 percent are white\u2014somewhat reflecting Iowa's overall racial makeup. Pure objectivity doesn't exist. It must be tempered with fairness, with context that considers consequences, or we lose trust. Nationally, according to the Department of Agriculture, the percentage of food stamp recipients who were black was 22 percent in 2010.  This is larger than their 13 percent proportion in the population, but much less than the 34 percent of food stamp recipients who were white. Seventeen percent were Hispanic. With CBS reinforcing NPR's take on what Santorum said, the story bloomed online and on Fox News, where different interviewers asked Santorum what he meant. The candidate's replies evolved to become that he didn't say black, but he didn't say what else it was that he said.   Finally on Thursday, he told John King of CNN: I've looked at that quote. In fact, I looked at the video. In fact, I'm pretty confident I didn't say black. What I think, I started to say a word and then sort of changed, and it sort of\u2014blah\u2014mumbled it, and sort of changed my thought. By now a number of advocacy groups had weighed in with angry statements condemning Santorum. \"Sen. Santorum's targeting of African-Americans is inaccurate and outrageous, and lifts up old race-based stereotypes about public assistance,\" said Benjamin Todd Jealous, president of the NAACP. \"He conflates welfare recipients with African-Americans, though federal benefits are in fact determined by income level.\" Santorum's vague denial didn't help. New York Times Op-Ed columnist Charles Blow, for example, dismissed it with unbecoming sarcasm: At first, [Santorum] offered a nondenial that suggested that the comment might have been out of context. Now he's saying that he didn't say \"black people\" at all but that he \"started to say a word\" and then \"sort of mumbled it and changed my thought.\" (Pause as I look askance and hum an incredulous, \"Uh huh.\") What began as a few seconds in the midst of an ordinary NPR campaign story had taken on a toxic life of its own.  And yet....and yet it's entirely possible\u2014maybe even likely\u2014that Santorum is telling the truth. That Santorum took so long to make the denial is immaterial. There could have been many reasons for that, not the least of which was that he was busy playing catch-up to compete in the New Hampshire primary. Among the many independent judges who don't hear the word \"black\" are Atlantic senior editor Ta-Nehisi Coates, Washington Post media blogger Erik Wemple, and NPR diversity vice president Keith Woods. I heard \"black\" on the first hearing, but not afterwards. But then, many other people hear \"black,\" just like the NPR team did. Maybe I'm too sensitive. Santorum, after all, survives. The nation's great racial divide recedes. There is a middle ground, and if you have watched the video, many of you may be there. It is that Santorum started to say \"black\" and pulled back.  This is partly supported by his own explanation that he said \"blah\" and then changed course.  There is no way for us to know why he might have started to say \"black,\" if he did. The important thing to me is that if he stopped himself, or misstated himself, then I believe that he deserves some benefit of the doubt, given his history, the context and the potential consequences of a statement that amounts to race baiting. Adding to the tinder is a Republican primary environment in which some candidates and some far-right groups have indeed stoked racial resentments. Some Americans have faulted Santorum for demonizing two other groups\u2014gays and immigrants\u2014but those are separate issues. Robbins maintains that it is not a reporter's place to guess what a candidate is thinking.  He also said that he was not trying to catch Santorum in a \"gotcha\" moment, and I believe him. \"Maybe it was a mistake, but it was his mistake, not ours,\" said Robbins. His is a defensible position.  If journalists start making exceptions for what they think someone meant, where does it stop?  Many journalists will be uncomfortable with my emphasis on such subjective matters as fairness, benefits of the doubt, and consequences. They will maintain that neutral objectivity rules: Just the facts ma'am.  And let the chips fall where they may. But most of us know that pure objectivity doesn't exist.  Reporters and editors must try to be as objective as possible, but objectivity must be tempered with fairness, and must have a context that considers consequences. This doesn't mean pulling punches. But hiding behind objectivity without fairness fuels an image of journalistic arrogance or disregard for the actual truth.  Trust in the press is undercut in the process. I can't condemn the journalists for reporting what they are convinced they heard.  I am only sorry that someone else in NPR didn't hear what so many of the rest of us have heard, or didn't exercise more caution, especially when it comes to a racially sensitive matter. There was one more curiosity linked to this convoluted story. Although many commented at the bottom of the web version of the story, only one listener wrote directly to NPR to complain.  This may suggest that I am being overly sensitive.  Santorum and the Republic, after all, will survive, and the nation's great racial divide will likely continue to recede. I look forward to your responses with great interest. More from the Ombudsman: Rick Santorum's Google Problem Becomes The StoryWe've Been Misled! No One Won Iowa!",

            "article_content": "The Texas State Capitol in Austin. The Lone Star State is gaining four additional congressional seats because of its booming population, but its redistricting plans are in limbo.\n                \n                    \n                    Eric Gay/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption The U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments Monday in a tangle of Texas redistricting cases, with repercussions beyond the Lone  Star State. Consolidated into one test, the cases pit the Voting Rights Act and its protections for minority voters against state legislative powers \u2014 with an overlaying sheen of sheer political calculus. The case has been called a puzzle of three courts, a reference to the interplay between two lower courts and the Supreme Court. A Chance To Redraw The Constitution mandates that, every 10 years, states must redraw their legislative and congressional district lines to reflect population shifts documented in the decennial census. Texas is one of the big beneficiaries this year. The state is gaining four additional congressional seats because of its booming population, fueled largely by Latinos. Of the 4 million new state residents, 65 percent are Hispanic. Legislative redistricting is almost always an ugly process, stoked by partisanship and self-interest. But one thing that redistricting cannot do under the Voting Rights Act is dilute minority voting power. That requirement extends to every state, but states like Texas \u2014 with a demonstrated history of racial and ethnic discrimination \u2014 must submit their redistricting plans in advance for pre-clearance to the U.S. Justice Department or to a three-judge federal district court in Washington, D.C. This, however, is the first redistricting year since the Voting Rights Act was enacted in 1965 that the White House and Justice Department are run by Democrats. It is also the first time that Texas, now controlled by Republican office-holders, has entirely bypassed the quick, 60-day pre-clearance mechanism provided by the Justice Department. District Court Demands The Facts Instead of heading to the Justice Department, the state opted to seek pre-clearance from the federal court in Washington, D.C., a more open-ended procedure that was made longer when Texas rejected an early trial date and sought to win outright without a trial. That didn't work out well for the state. In November, the three-judge court, composed of both Republican and Democratic appointees, ruled unanimously that the state had failed to show that its plan was not discriminatory. The court then ordered a trial to determine the facts. In the meantime, with the Texas primary elections just three months away and no redistricting map in place, the Washington court took an unusual step. It gave the green light to a different three-judge federal court in Texas to come up with an interim electoral map. Texas Court Gives Interim Plan The Texas court rejected the state plan, which would likely have resulted in three out of four new congressional seats going to the GOP. The court redrew the lines to more reflect Latino voting power, with the likely result being that three of the four new seats would go to Democrats. The state then went to the U.S. Supreme Court seeking to block the interim plan.  The high court blocked the plan and went further, agreeing to review the Texas court's interim plan even as the trial is set to begin before the pre-clearance court in Washington next week. The legal dilemma facing the Supreme Court is this: It can't default to the old legislative map. Because of the huge population growth, that map violates the one-person, one-vote principle. But the new map drawn by the GOP-controlled Texas Legislature has not been pre-cleared yet under the Voting Rights Act, and there are strong hints from the Washington,  D.C., court that the state plan illegally minimizes minority voting power. That leaves the interim plan, but the state of Texas contends that it, too, is invalid because the court in Texas \"substituted its judgment\" for the Legislature's without any finding of legal violations. \"Do you just have the courts start drawing from scratch?\" asks former Bush administration Solicitor General Paul Clement, who is representing Texas. \"Or ... we would suggest, you start with the legislative map and you only start redrawing it if you have a finding of a likely constitutional or statutory violation.\" Primaries Approaching The state is asking the Supreme Court to void the interim plan and put in place the state's proposed redistricting plan for now, while pre-clearance is pending. The state notes that with primaries now scheduled for early April, candidates who need to know where to run and election administrators who need to print ballots are in dire need of a map for the 2012 election. But minority groups, backed by the Obama administration, say the state's problems are of its own making because it has long known the timetable. Those defending the interim plan note that the state chose to bypass the quick Justice Department pre-clearance mechanism, and they maintain that the state has deliberately dragged out the pre-clearance process in court. \"Texas' claim that this process has bogged down and, therefore, it should somehow be excused [from complying with the Voting Rights Act] is a little bit reminiscent of the claim of somebody who kills his parents and then throws himself on the mercy of the court because he's an orphan,\" says Pam Karlan, a Stanford law professor who is one of the lawyers challenging the state plan. Take It On Faith? Indeed, Karlan notes that Texas has redrawn a district that the Supreme Court threw out just five years ago on grounds that it illegally minimized Latino voting power. While Texas claims that the state Legislature's map is entitled to the presumption of good faith, those challenging the map contend that allowing Texas to use a plan that has not been pre-cleared would be an end run that effectively nullifies the minority voter protections in the Voting Rights Act. As complicated as the case is, reading the legal tea leaves is even more difficult.  By expediting consideration of the interim plan, the Supreme Court would seem to have signaled serious doubts about the plan devised by the federal court in Texas. At the same time, the Washington, D.C., pre-clearance court has signaled even more overtly that the plan drawn up by the Texas Legislature would seem to be in clear violation of the law. With both the interim plan and the Texas Legislature's plan under the legal microscope now at the same time in different courts, the three-court puzzle could turn out to be something of a Rubik's Cube.",

            "article_content": "How the Media Wields Dangerous Words to Divide a Nation by Eric Deggans Hardcover, 275 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? In his new book, Race-Baiter, media critic Eric Deggans says modern media outlets trade in bigotry and bias to build audience and sell advertising. Deggans dissects media coverage of events such as Hurricane Katrina, the Trayvon Martin case and the 2012 presidential election to build an argument that Americans lack the right vocabulary for having important conversations about race, and that the echo chambers of our fractured media landscape aren't helping. The fix, he says, is a more savvy audience that demands better conversations. Deggans and psychologist Linda Tropp, who studies perceptions of racial differences, join NPR's Neal Conan for a conversation about media, race and what Deggans calls \"a divided America.\" On MSNBC anchor Al Sharpton and Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly Deggans: \"The main thing that bothers me is that Al Sharpton is the most visible anchor on a cable outlet that still calls itself a cable news channel. He's the most visible anchor of color, and he's not only not a journalist, he's very much an advocate, leading a civil rights organization that advocates for specific legislation and advocates for specific electoral results. \"And, you know, that bothers me. ... At the same time, I talked about my own tussles with Bill O'Reilly on Fox News Channel. The book's title comes from the fact that Bill O'Reilly called me a 'race-baiter' on his show years ago for the articles I've written criticizing the way he talks about race, and also talking about conservative voices like Rush Limbaugh and other people on Fox News Channel. \"So I tried to look across the spectrum as much as I could while also acknowledging that my viewpoint is probably more friendlier to the liberal side of things, and I'm talking about talking about race in a way that a lot of liberals would find comfortable.\" On what Deggans calls the \"broad niche\" Deggans: \"At one point we had a media universe where the goal was to amass the biggest audience possible. So the goal was also to avoid anything that might reject parts of that audience. You were constantly trying to figure out how to put together a presentation that would appeal to everyone. Eric Deggans is the TV and media critic for the Tampa Bay Times.\n\n                    \n                    Carrie Pratt/Simply Blue Studios\n                    \n                \nhide caption Eric Deggans is the TV and media critic for the Tampa Bay Times. \"And of course, you know, TV got criticized for that sometimes, for being too milquetoast, for not taking enough chances. But now we're in a media environment where you succeed by targeting the biggest niche of viewers or the biggest niche of media consumers. \"And I call it in the book the tyranny of the broad niche. You try to find these slivers of the audience, the biggest slivers that might be interested in whatever type of media you're presenting, and you target them in a way that draws them to you and also encourages them to reject your competitors. \"And I think sometimes that's done by using prejudice and stereotypes, in everywhere from reality TV to these news and political presentations.\" On where the conversation about racial differences breaks down Tropp: \"What I would see as part of the problem or issue that we currently face in this society is that talking about race is such a taboo topic so that we don't get much practice in doing so, and that by broaching the topic of race, it becomes more anxiety-provoking than it perhaps needs to be. \"And so it makes us perhaps more likely to respond defensively if someone expresses a view that's different from ours. So we basically spend our time focusing on how to get our viewpoint across, make sure that we're understood, rather than being open to hearing alternate viewpoints on this issue.\" On how to restart the conversation about race Deggans: \"One of the things I do in the book is I talk about some concepts for how to have a discussion like this in a way that's nonthreatening and might achieve something. And, you know, whenever I talk about this in public, I sort of set boundaries, and one of the things is, you know, you don't attack people. One of the things is no one owns these subjects. ... \"I know sometimes white people can feel like black people or people of color have the ability to initiate conversations about race that they can't do without fear of being called racist. And, you know, one of the things I want to say is nobody owns these subjects. You know, white people, you have, as I said, you have a culture, and you should be able to talk about this as well as anyone, as long as you do it with sensitivity and an open heart.\"",

            "article_content": "Good luck if you're looking to see what Americans think about the \"Fast and Furious\" gun-running controversy that has escalated into a constitutional fight between President Obama and the GOP-led House. The No. 1 concern of voters is clear: In survey after survey, the economy comes out on top. But the impact of Fast and Furious, the since-killed program that funneled weapons from U.S. gun dealers to Mexican drug gangs, is a lot murkier. (One of the rare polls on the issue, done by Rasmussen through an automated telephone survey, indicated that 40 percent of respondents wanted Attorney General Eric Holder to resign; 33 percent were undecided.) But just because Fast and Furious hasn't been a top-of-mind issue for most voters doesn't mean it lacks its political uses. Ever since the ill-advised project came to light early in the Obama administration, it has been a cause celebre for many in the conservative base. There are the people who are, on principle, suspicious of practically anything the Obama administration does. Then there are those who believe Fast and Furious was all an administration ploy to discredit gun sellers as a pretext for increasing gun control. All that helped fuel Wednesday's party-line vote by the House Committee on Oversight and Governmental Reform. It found Holder in contempt of Congress for not handing over all the Fast and Furious-related documents demanded by Rep. Darrell Issa, the California Republican who is the panel's chairman. Wasting little time after the committee vote, Speaker John Boehner of Ohio and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia announced they would schedule a House vote on the resolution for next week. The decision came on the same day the Obama White House decided to assert executive privilege to protect the documents from Congress, a move that further inflamed the partisan war in the nation's capital. Holder saw a political motive in the contempt vote: \"It's an election-year tactic intended to distract attention \u2014 and, as a result \u2014 has deflected critical resources from fulfilling what remains my top priority at the Department of Justice: Protecting the American people.\" So how much of this process was shot through with politics, so to speak? \"All of it, on both sides,\" says Stan Brand, who served as general counsel to the House when Democrats ran it in the 1970s and '80s and who specializes in cases that often touch politics and Congress. He continues: \"Look, everyone knows for the last 30 years at least, there's no way to enforce these [contempt of Congress actions]. Because the Justice Department has asserted the right not to indict anyone of congressional contempt who's asserting executive privilege. So the House has been forced in one case to file a civil lawsuit. That's the way these have to be resolved now. So all of this brouhaha and hoopla over contempt is largely atmospheric.\" Brand said the only way to enforce the contempt-of-Congress action would be a tedious, time-consuming and unpredictable civil lawsuit, as happened late in the George W. Bush administration when two White House aides, Harriet Miers and Josh Bolten, were cited. That case took two years and never went past the district court level. Given that the Holder case could go all the way to the Supreme Court because it raises separation-of-powers issues, Brand joked: \"Holder could well be on his 401(k) by the time the time it's all said and done.\" But there's an election a lot sooner than that, of course. And in case there was any doubt that Fast and Furious might figure in that election, the National Rifle Association didn't pull any punches. In a letter to House leaders of both parties expressing the group's support for the contempt action, NRA Executive Director Chris Cox wrote: \"The reason we support the contempt resolution is the same reason we first called for Attorney General Holder's resignation more than a year ago: the department's obstruction of congressional oversight of a program that cost lives in support of an anti-gun agenda. ... This is an issue of the utmost seriousness and the NRA will consider this vote in our future candidate evaluations.\" Meanwhile, on the other side of the gun debate, Dennis Henigan, vice president for law and policy at the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said in a blog post earlier in the week that it was the House Republicans, not Holder, who were the problem. \"Although the American people can't hold Congress in contempt, it can hold its members accountable at the polls come November. The American public can start now, by making it clear that there will be a political price to pay for any member who continues to do the bidding of the gun lobby, offering nothing but transparent hypocrisy to families in Mexico, and America, put at risk by weak U.S. gun laws. \"Every American can make an immediate and compelling statement by signing the Brady Campaign's online petition agreeing to make the gun issue a voting issue in the upcoming elections. As Sarah Brady has said, 'If our lawmakers will not change the gun laws, then for God's sake, let's change the lawmakers.' \" Unfortunately for the Brady campaign, there's little to no indication that most voters care enough, at least at this point, about gun violence for it to make a difference come November. On the other hand, there are many conservative gun owners and hunters in battleground states, especially Ohio. The Fast and Furious contempt resolution against Holder could help energize them to the point where they will not only get to polls themselves but get others there as well.",

House Republicans have gone through with their promise: The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has filed a lawsuit against Attorney General Eric Holder, claiming that he is under contempt for failing to turn over documents related to the failed gun-walking operation Fast and Furious. Fox News reports they filed the civil case today. Fox adds: \"That decision is expected to be challenged in the court case. \"Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., ranking Democrat on the oversight committee, released a brief statement Monday chastising his GOP colleagues over the suit. \"'It seems clear that House Republican leaders do not want to resolve the contempt issue and prefer to generate unnecessary conflict with the administration as the election nears,' Cummings said. 'Unfortunately, the American public suffers as House Republicans disregard the real work that needs to be done.'\" The White House has claimed executive privilege over these documents, arguing the documents and emails Republicans seek show internal deliberations after the operation became public. Despite that, back in June, the House found Holder in contempt and gave the panel authority to sue the attorney general in civil court. A day after the House made that decision, Holder's Justice Department refused to move forward with the contempt charge, which brings us to this civil suit. The chairman of the oversight committee Rep. Darrell Issa said in a statement today that this suit alleges President Obama has overstepped his authority by claiming privilege and is asking the court to compel Holder to produce the documents. \"After promising an unprecedented level of transparency, the President is attempting to expand the reach of executive privilege to obstruct the truth about the reckless conduct that contributed to the death of a Border Patrol Agent and countless Mexican citizens,\" Issa said. The Obama administration has repeatedly called this a politically motivated attack by Republicans.",

Update at 4:40 p.m. ET. House Votes To Hold Holder In Contempt: In a dramatic showdown between the branches of government, the Republican-led House voted along party lines to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress. This is the first time in history an attorney general has been held in contempt. As the vote proceeded, droves of Democratic lawmakers protested by walking out of the House chambers. They poured out onto the Capitol building's steps, where Rep. Jim Clyburn expressed his disgust. The Democratic leader in the House Nancy Pelosi was among them. Now, the criminal contempt charge is refered to the U.S. Attorney in the District of Columbia. In other words, Holder's own Justice Department, which will decide how to proceed. House Republicans say they are holding Holder in contempt because the Obama administration has withheld documents related to the failed Fast and Furious gun walking operation. For its part, the White House claimed executive privilege to keep from complying with the subpoena. The White House says the documents and emails Republicans seek show internal deliberations after the operation became public. The House also voted to approve a separate measure, which gives Rep. Darrell Issa's Oversight and Government Reform Committee authorization to sue the Department of Justice in federal court in an effort to enforce their subpoena seeking the documents. Update at 4:57 p.m. ET. 'Politically Motivated': Attorney General Eric Holder called the House vote \"unfortunate\" and \"politically motivated.\" \"Today's vote is the regrettable culmination of what has become a misguided and politically motivated investigation during an election year,\" Holder said in a televised statement. \"By advancing this over the past year and a half, Congressman Issa and others have focused on politics over public safety.\" Holder said that when the flawed Fast and Furious tactics came to light, he took action, ordering the tactics stopped and ordering an investigation. He said Issa and Republicans in Congress have rebuffed his attempts to bring this to a resolution without a contempt vote. Our Original Post Continues: The United States House is set to vote today on whether to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt. House Republicans say Holder and the Obama administration have withheld documents related to the failed Fast and Furious gun walking operation. For its part, the White House claimed executive privilege to keep from turning over the documents, which it says show internal deliberation after the operation became public. The New York Times reports this sets up a constitutionally charged dispute that could make Holder the first attorney general held in contempt. The Times adds: \"In early jostling \u2013 a debate over the rule governing the final debate later in the day \u2013 Republicans repeatedly invoked the death of Brian Terry, a border patrol agent killed in a shootout in December 2010. Two guns that had been purchased by a suspect in the gunrunning case the previous January were found the near the scene. \"'These contempt charges aren't about politics,' said Representative Rich Nugent, Republican of Florida. 'They aren't about Attorney General Holder or President Obama or anything else but this: A man died serving his country and we have a right to know what the federal government's hand was in that. It's clear this country somehow played a role in his death. We need to root it out, find the cause, and make sure this never, ever happens again.'\" Democrats argued this was an election-year ploy by Republicans. Politico reports that top House Democrats are pushing for a mass walkout. Rep. Jim Clyburn, of South Carolina, told Politico they would stay to vote on the rules governing the vote, but once the voting begins, they will walkout. Politico adds: \"'We asked for them to just think about what we're doing and our obligation to this institution, and the fact that we ought not to participate,' Clyburn said. \"Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.), chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said he believes 'many other members' will join the walkout, which was first proposed by black Democrats.\" NPR's Tamara Keith tells us the House will is scheduled to cast its first contempt vote this hour. A second one is scheduled for 4:45 p.m. ET. We'll update this post once we have more news. CSPAN is live streaming all the action.

Issa's committee voted along party lines last week to hold Mr. Holder in contempt, and a full vote of the House on the matter is expected Thursday. Read Another Opinion On Attorney General Holder And The Contempt Vote Mark Hemingway is a senior writer for The Weekly Standard. Last Wednesday, the White House stunned observers by asserting executive privilege in its refusal to turn over documents related to the Fast and Furious gunrunning scandal that resulted in the death of U.S. border patrol agent Brian Terry. The day before, Barack Obama's presidential campaign sent out a missive attacking GOP superPACs for not revealing their donors. The message is clear: The president thinks transparency is a good thing if it allows him to bully citizens who give money to his political opponents. But what about transparency and accountability in the case of a law enforcement agent who died because his government allowed Mexican criminal gangs to acquire thousands of guns from U.S. dealers for reasons it declines to explain? According to a statement from Terry's parents, \"President Obama's assertion of executive privilege serves to compound this tragedy.\" The extraordinary use of executive privilege suggests the administration is attempting to cover up some damning political motive behind the Fast and Furious operation. If it's not a political cover-up, why can't the Justice Department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) give Americans a legitimate law enforcement reason for arming known criminals with sniper rifles and crates of grenades, much less failing to keep track of the weapons? Attorney General Eric Holder's refusal to cooperate with congressional investigators shows why he deserves to be held in contempt of Congress, a move expected this week. He's accused of withholding 92 percent of the relevant documents from investigators, ignoring subpoenas, and silencing Justice Department employees. Holder's most recent behavior continues to erode confidence. In the weeks leading up to the June 20 vote by the House Oversight Committee recommending Holder be held in contempt, the attorney general implausibly argued that Justice Department documents that use the words \"Fast and Furious\" don't actually refer to the Fast and Furious operation. Holder was also forced to retract his claim that the Bush administration's last attorney general, Michael Mukasey, had been briefed on the gunrunning. While Holder might have self-serving reasons for stonewalling Congress, it's less clear why the president would stick his neck out for the attorney general's indefensible behavior in an election year. So far the media have mostly ignored the evidence that a gun control agenda might be behind the operation. CBS News reported in December that emails show top ATF officials discussed highlighting questionable arms purchases made as part of Fast and Furious to deceptively make the case for a new regulation requiring firearms dealers to report certain gun purchases. The president put a very similar regulation into effect by executive order in June last year. The timeline of the scandal is also highly suggestive of political motivations. In April 2009, the new president held a joint press conference with Mexican president Felipe Calder\u00f3n decrying the flow of guns from the United States into Mexico. (The president later took a great deal of heat for using exaggerated statistics in the press conference to make the gun-trafficking problem sound worse than it is.) According to the House Oversight Committee, the Fast and Furious operation is said to have been \"authorized at the highest levels of the Justice Department\" in the fall of 2009. In May 2010, ATF agent John Dodson, distraught by the pointlessness of the operation, asked his supervisors if they \"were prepared to attend the funeral of a slain agent or officer after he or she was killed with one of those straw-purchase firearms.\" Brian Terry was killed by a Fast and Furious gun in December, and a disgusted Dodson finally blew the whistle. Details of the gunrunning scandal started to trickle out in late January 201l. In February 2011, the Mexican government filed Foreign Agents Registration Act paperwork with the Justice Department to retain a U.S. law firm in order to sue American citizens and companies over \"the illegal manufacture, import/export, or sale of weapons, or other conduct that may be harming Mexico.\" The congressional investigation of Fast and Furious began in earnest in the spring of 2011. Curiously, the Mexican government's plan to pursue civil suits in U.S. courts over gun trafficking does not appear to have progressed as the Fast and Furious scandal began generating headlines. The White House is welcome to disprove this explanation, but it adamantly refuses to provide Brian Terry's mother with a full accounting for her son's death. \"My son was a person that believed in justice, and he believed in telling the truth. He was a man of his honor,\" Josephine Terry recently told a Philadelphia radio station. Every day that our nation's top law enforcement officers stonewall on Fast and Furious is a reminder that some of them don't share those same ideals.",

            "article_content": "For the first time since President Obama took office, the White House has invoked executive privilege in a dispute with Congress. Obama sided with his Justice Department and refused to turn over documents to House Republicans in their probe of the botched gun-trafficking operation known as Fast and Furious. But the aggressive move by the president was not enough to stop a Republican committee from voting to hold his attorney general in contempt.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And for the first time since President Obama took office, his White House has invoked executive privilege in a dispute with Congress. Mr. Obama sided with his Justice Department and refused to turn over documents to House Republicans in their probe of a botched operation aimed at netting drug lords that involved gun trafficking. It was known as Fast and Furious. The aggressive move by the president was not enough to stop a Republican committee from voting to hold his attorney general in contempt. NPR's Carrie Johnson reports. CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: Every administration has its share of scandals - oversight fights with Congress, games-of-tug of war over embarrassing information. During the George W. Bush  years, the White House exerted executive privilege to protect papers and testimony about the firings of U.S. attorneys. And during President Clinton's tenure, he invoked the privilege 14 times. But back in 2008, Barack Obama took a dim view of the idea, so recalled Trey Gowdy, a Republican congressman from South Carolina. REPRESENTATIVE TREY GOWDY: And with respect to executive privilege, I'm going to resist the temptation to contrast Senator Obama's position on executive privilege with President Obama's position of executive privilege, but I would just note the juxtaposition is stark. JOHNSON: Administration officials said the move was meant to protect the principle of keeping internal deliberations private and away from the prying eyes of lawmakers. But it raised suspicions for Indiana Republican Dan Burton. Burton's a member of the House Committee that voted yesterday to hold the attorney general in contempt of Congress. REPRESENTATIVE DAN BURTON: Why would the president claim executive privilege unless there was something very, very important that he felt should not be made known to this committee and possibly to the public? JOHNSON: It's not clear exactly what's in the batch of sensitive documents, but correspondence from Attorney General Eric Holder and his deputy seems to suggest the papers detail efforts within the Justice Department to do damage control on Fast and Furious after department officials mistakenly told Congress back in February 2011 that nothing wrong had taken place. REPRESENTATIVE ELIJAH CUMMINGS: This whole idea, everybody - oh, what's he hiding? Well, I don't think he's hiding a damn thing. JOHNSON: Elijah Cummings is a Democrat from Maryland. Cummings met with Holder this week and he says he came away with the idea the decision on executive privilege was about upholding precedent and protecting executive branch decision making. CUMMINGS: He made it clear that this was his watch and that there's certain things that attorney generals protect as a part of this office. JOHNSON: At this point there's no evidence that Mr. Obama played a hands-on role in helping to clean up the Fast and Furious mess last year, though he apparently has been in contact with Republican House leaders recently to try to stave off a contempt vote against his attorney general. So if the president isn't using his privilege to protect direct communications or talks with his closest advisors, the strongest kind of executive privilege, he's using another form of his power known as the deliberative process privilege. Delegate Eleanor Holmes-Norton, a Democrat from Washington D.C., explains. DELEGATE ELEANOR HOLMES-NORTON: Under Republican and Democratic administrations, the executive has often invoked executive privilege with respect to pre-decisional deliberative communications. JOHNSON: Let's break that down. Deliberative privilege covers debates within the executive branch before formal decisions are made over how to respond to lawmakers. Michael Steel, a spokesman for GOP House Speaker John Boehner, characterized the White House argument as pretty weak. Steel pointed out to reporters that deliberative process claims have sometimes been thrown out by courts or withdrawn by previous White Houses in the face of legal challenges. But those legal challenges take time, says Tennessee Republican Scott DesJarlais. REPRESENTATIVE SCOTT DESJARLAIS: And I don't think that's lost on the attorney general's office.  It starts to feel like they're just trying to run out the clock. JOHNSON: As Congress prepares for its July recess, and with elections coming up in November, those Fast and Furious documents could remain secret for a good long while.

MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: And I'm Robert Siegel. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee voted today to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress. He's accused of refusing to turn over certain documents related to the controversial gun-trafficking operation known as Fast and Furious. Just hours before the vote, the White House waded in. As NPR's Carrie Johnson reports, it invoked executive privilege in an effort to keep those papers secret. (SOUNDBITE OF GAVEL) REPRESENTATIVE DARRELL ISSA: The committee on oversight and government reform will come to order. The committee meets today to consider reporting a resolution to the House of Representatives, finding the Attorney General Eric Holder, Junior, in contempt of Congress. CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: And with that, Republican Darrell Issa, the chairman of the committee, opened a raucous hearing that his adversaries say had as much to do with election year politics, as it did with congressional prerogative. REPRESENTATIVE ELIJAH CUMMINGS: Mr. Chairman, it did not have to be this way. It really didn't. JOHNSON: That was Maryland Democrat Elijah Cummings, the ranking member of the Oversight Committee, lamenting a breakdown in settlement talks between the Justice Department and Republicans. The Obama administration has already turned over hundreds of pages, about how Fast and Furious was developed by federal agents and prosecutors in Arizona. Here's the heart of the dispute: What the congressional committee wants and what the administration wants to protect are any internal deliberations at Justice and the White House, starting in February 2011, when they raced to do damage control after they learned details of the botched operation. California Democrat Jackie Speier. REPRESENTATIVE JACKIE SPEIER: We're talking about documents, internal documents between staff members within the Justice Department, after a letter was sent on February 4th that was erroneous. JOHNSON: It's not clear what those documents would show about any high-level conversations at Justice and the White House. Indiana Republican Dan Burton says the possibilities are tantalizing. REPRESENTATIVE DAN BURTON: The president's assertion of executive privilege creates even more questions. One of the big issues that we've been dealing with is, who knew about Fast and Furious? When did they know about it? And how high up did it go? JOHNSON: Speier, the Democrat from California, resisted the old Watergate-era questions. SPEIER: There's no cover up here. There's no 20-minutes of a tape that's been wiped out. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: If the gentlewoman would yield. SPEIER: No, I've already yield. JOHNSON: And that's how most of the hearing went, as Republicans lambasted the Justice Department for flouting a congressional subpoena and Democrats said their adversaries were trying to score points in an election year. The contempt issue next goes to the full U.S. House, unless both sides are able to reach a deal before then. Carrie Johnson, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Republicans, who control the committee, say Holder's Justice Department has not turned over all the documents that the committee needs to see as it probes the so-called Fast and Furious gun-trafficking operation. And they want to know more about why the Justice Department initially told a senator that it had not pursued such an operation.

From the Congressional Research Service \u2014 Congress's Contempt Power and the Enforcement of Congressional Subpoenas: Law, History, Practice, and Procedure. Now, The Associated Press writes, the contempt citation will go to the full House for a vote \u2014 \"although House leaders are not required to call it up for a vote. They could instead use the threat of that to pressure for renewed negotiations. Historically, at some point Congress and president negotiate agreements, because both sides want to avoid a court battle that could narrow either the reach of executive privilege or Congress' subpoena power.\" Update at 4:35 p.m. ET.: House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican from Ohio, and Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a Republican from Virginia, said the House will schedule a vote on the matter next week. \"Fast and Furious was a reckless operation that led to the death of an American border agent, and the American people deserve to know the facts to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again,\" Boehner and Cantor said in a statement. In a statement, Holder said his department had made \"unprecedented accommodations.\" He called the vote, \"an election-year tactic intended to distract attention...\" This morning, as we reported, the White House exerted executive privilege as it informed the committee that it would not be delivering all the documents. That led to questions from Republicans about whether the White House is trying to withhold information about its own involvement in discussions concerning Fast and Furious. During today's committee meeting, Republicans made the case that the Obama administration has resisted efforts to investigate Fast and Furious and may have deliberately misled Congress. Democrats made the case that the GOP majority has gotten more than enough information and is largely ignoring a similar gun operation carried out during the Bush administration. As for the program at the center of the story, the AP writes: \"In Fast and Furious, federal agents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Arizona abandoned the agency's usual practice of intercepting all weapons they believed to be illicitly purchased. Instead, the goal of gun-walking was to track such weapons to high-level arms traffickers, who had long eluded prosecution, and to dismantle their networks. ... \"The agents in Arizona lost track of many of the weapons in Operation Fast and Furious. Two of the guns that 'walked' in the operation were found at the scene of the slaying of U.S. border agent Brian Terry.\"",

            "article_content": "Voters across the country cast ballots on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the presidential candidates spent their days very differently. Lynn Neary checks in with Ari Shapiro who spent the day with Mitt Romney and Scott Horsley who was with President Obama.  LYNN NEARY, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Lynn Neary. It is almost over. After more than $2 billion and about a thousand campaign events, we will soon know the results. MITT ROMNEY: This is a big day for big change. We're about to change America, to help people in ways they didn't imagine they could be helped, with good jobs and better take-home pay. NEARY: Mitt Romney visited Ohio and Pennsylvania today after voting this morning in his home state of Massachusetts. President Obama stopped by a field office in Chicago and made some calls to campaign workers. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Hi, is this Karen? Karen, this is Barack Obama. It is. I'm calling to say thank you. You're working so hard. NEARY: This hour we'll be checking in with NPR reporters at polling places around the country. First, to our correspondents covering the candidates. Earlier, we caught up with NPR's Ari Shapiro, who's traveling with Governor Romney and NPR's Scott Horsley, who was with Mr. Obama in Chicago. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Well, the president, as you say, is in his hometown of Chicago. He got to sleep in his own home last night, something he doesn't do very often. And this morning, he dropped by a neighborhood campaign office in the Hyde Park neighborhood near his home, where he thanked the in-person volunteers and then made those phone calls that you just heard to people who've been working to get out the vote in Wisconsin, which is one, of course, the hotly contested battlegrounds. He's spending a good part of the day at a hotel doing satellite interviews to encourage supporters to go to the polls and he's also going to indulge in a Election Day tradition by playing a game of basketball with some campaign staffers and some old friends. NEARY: And Mitt Romney is taking a very different approach. He did a fair amount of traveling today, right, Ari? ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: Quite a bit of traveling, but interestingly with the same broad brushstrokes as President Obama's itinerary. Mitt Romney came to Ohio and on to Pennsylvania, where, like the president, he went to a victory office, greeted volunteers, thanked people for their get-out-the-vote efforts. And, of course, the big difference between these events and what President Obama is doing is that these are taking place in swing states, Ohio being the most important swing state of all. Pennsylvania being sort of a last-minute attempt by the Republicans to expand the map. These are not formally campaign events, but it certainly does not hurt for him to have a presence here on the ground with his running mate Paul Ryan on this day when people are going to the polls in a state that he is really, really trying very hard to win tonight. NEARY: And, of course, Scott, getting out the vote, very important as well for President Obama. What is the Obama campaign saying about that effort? HORSLEY: Well, they have long bragged about their field organization, their troops, both paid staff and volunteers who are in neighborhoods throughout the country, throughout the battleground states. This is an organization they've been building for more than a year and they expressed confidence that these folks, when they offer to give you a ride to the polls, they're not talking to strangers, they're talking to voters they've been cultivating for months now. So they feel strongly that their ground game is solid and I think it's an expression of that confidence that President Obama feels he has the luxury of staying closer to home today. NEARY: Ari, is the Romney campaign saying anything about the turnout so far? Are they happy about it? What's their... SHAPIRO: Absolutely. They've been talking a lot in terms of comparing to 2008. They say the Obama ground game is falling short of 2008. The Republican's ground game, they say, is far better than it was in 2008. And, in fact, both sides agree that the Romney organization is far better than the McCain organization was four years ago. But remember, 2008 was a landslide election in Barack Obama's favor, so the question is - tonight is guaranteed to be a much smaller margin. Whether it will be a smaller margin for Barack Obama or for Mitt Romney depends on how much that gap has shrunk between 2008 and today. The Democrats had a much bigger buffer from 2008 that they could afford to lose some and still perhaps squeak out a win. NEARY: I think a lot of journalists are expecting that this is going to be a long night for them. What about the candidates? Scott, what can you tell us about how President Obama is going to spend his evening? Is he going to stay up late? HORSLEY: Well, they're not offering any prediction about when the results will be in, but they do say they think they have the votes that will guarantee the president a second term in the White House. Mr. Obama and his family are going to have dinner at their home in Hyde Park and then at some point this evening, the president will make his way over to his election night party, which is being held this year not outdoors in Grant Park, as it was in 2008 with the throngs, with a smaller crowd indoors, but still in a sizable location. It's a sort of a convention-center-type building here in Chicago called McCormick Place. NEARY: And Ari? SHAPIRO: Well, Mitt Romney is going to be watching returns also from his home base in Boston. We've asked campaign aides for details for things like when and where he'll be eating dinner. We asked, you know, what's the candidate going to have for his last meal? Traveling press secretary Rick Gorka replied, he's going to live beyond Tuesday, guys. But he's staying relentlessly optimistic and pushing through to the very last minute with this swing through Ohio and Pennsylvania today. NEARY: Well, thanks to both of you for all of the fantastic work you've done over this campaign and into tonight. It's been good following you through this entire campaign. SHAPIRO: Thank you. HORSLEY: It's really been a privilege, Lynn. NEARY: NPR's Scott Horsley with President Obama in Chicago and Ari Shapiro traveling with Governor Romney today. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.

A smattering of delegates showed up for Monday's brief session. Caroline Wright of Utah brought two of her four children with her. CAROLINE WRIGHT: This is exciting. This is - I feel like this is almost a once in a lifetime. I mean, I don't know if we'll ever be here again. CORLEY: Today, there's plenty on the Republican's agenda. Cam Ward, an Alabama State lawmaker, served on the platform committee. He says final approval of the document will come later this afternoon. STATE SENATOR CAM WARD: Which will serve as our - kind of our party blueprint for the next four years. CORLEY: That blueprint is sometimes at odds with Mitt Romney's position, like the platform's opposition to all abortions, while Governor Romney would allow for abortion in cases of rape, incest and where the mother's life is in danger. Still 33-year-old Virgil Cruz, a delegate from Texas, says he can't wait for delegates to step forward during the convention's roll call to support the Republican ticket. VIRGIL CRUZ: We need to make a change, you know. America has been on the wrong path and I think Americans, by and large, feel an unsettling feeling that things have not gone well. And so the people who are here are energetic and they're ready to move on. And Romney and Ryan are our choices, and we're going to support them in November and make it happen. CORLEY: But there is likely to be some dissent. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I don't need a debate. I'm not here to debate. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Well, I'm just trying to correct you... CORLEY: There were some spirited discussions. Delegates loyal to Ron Paul, the Texas Republican who ran for the presidential nomination, battled with Romney supporters over new party rules. Rules they call a power grab that allow a presidential candidate to select delegates rather than each individual state. Taylor Watered, an alternate from Vermont, said Paul supporters aren't quite ready to throw in the towel. TAYLOR WATERED: We're not trying to demonize any Romney delegates. We want to communicate with the Romney delegates. You know, like have an organized, you know, civil, you know, talk about it. CORLEY: Outside the convention hall there've been protests as well. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Chanting) Hey, hey, ho, ho, the GOP has got to go. Hey, hey, ho, ho... CORLEY: Brent Foushee, an unemployed carpenter, was among the activists who said they were determined to speak out against the Republican agenda. BRENT FOUSHEE: They are so extreme on the other side. There's no moderation. There's no willing to, you know, just to come to an agreeable middle. It's like moderation is like evil nowadays. When did this ever happen? CORLEY: Republicans here offer a different picture and say that Americans are suffering because of the economic policies of President Obama. They're certain the convention will energize Republicans for the November election, and the speakers who hope to do so tonight include Mitt Romney's wife, Ann, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.

            "article_content": "With a program designed both to tell the American people more about Mitt Romney and to make the case that Republicans' ideas for solving the nation's problems are better than Democrats', the 2012 GOP National Convention got going today and Romney officially became the party's presidential nominee. Delegates also officially made Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin the party's vice presidential nominee. We live blogged through the afternoon and evening. Scroll down and read \"up\" if you want to see how the story developed. Update at 11:05 p.m. ET. In Closing, An Appeal For Those In Isaac's Path: Before delivering the benediction, Rev. Sammy Rodriguez urges delegates and those watching on TV to go to RedCross.org to donate for those in the path of Hurricane Isaac. With that, the convention is adjourned until 7 p.m. ET Wednesday. Join us then for more live blogging, and come back to It's All Politics for posts throughout the day. Update at 11 p.m. ET. Stand Up! With his voice rising, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie asks the delegates to rise and they respond with enthusiasm. \"It's now time to stand up!\" he declares \"There's no time left to waste. If you're willing to stand up with me for America's future, I will stand up with you. If you're willing to fight with me for Mitt Romney, I will fight with you. \"If you're willing to hear the truth about the hard road ahead, and the rewards for America that truth will bear, I'm here to begin with you this new era of truth-telling. \"Tonight, we choose the path that has always defined our nation's history. Tonight, we finally and firmly answer the call that so many generations have had the courage to answer before us. Tonight, we stand up for Mitt Romney as the next president of the United States. \"And, together, we stand up once again for American greatness for our children and grandchildren. God bless you and God bless America.\" Among those standing, by the way, were Mitt and Ann Romney. They watched the keynote from a box in the arena. Update at 10:57 p.m. ET. It's Leadership That's Missing, Christie Says: \"There's only one thing missing now,\" says New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. \"Leadership. It takes leadership that you don't get from reading a poll. \"You see, Mr. President \u2014 real leaders don't follow polls. Real leaders change polls.\" That gets a big cheer. Update at 10:55 p.m. ET. Wind-Up Over, Christie Gets To The Nominee: Around word 1,700 of his 2,700-word address, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie moves from explaining why Republicans' ideas are better than Democrats to talking about the party's nominees: \"We have a nominee who will tell us the truth and who will lead with conviction. And now he has a running mate who will do the same. \"We have Governor Mitt Romney and Congressman Paul Ryan, and we must make them our next president and vice president!\" Update at 10:45 p.m. ET. Christie's Refrain: \"We Did It\" And \"Their Ideas Have Failed\": Continuing on a theme hit by several other governors today, New Jersey's Chris Christie is using the refrain \"we did it\" to punctuate the accomplishments he's touting from his time in office \u2014 such as \"real teacher tenure reform that demands accountability and ends the guarantee of a job for life regardless of performance would never happen.\" He then says, \"I know this simple truth and I'm not afraid to say it: our ideas are right for America and their ideas have failed America.\" Update at 10:43 p.m. ET. Christie Says \"We Are The United States Of America\": After saying that leaders need to stop \"tearing each other down,\" New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says that: \"We are the great grandchildren of men and women who broke their backs in the name of American ingenuity; the grandchildren of the Greatest Generation; the sons and daughters of immigrants; the brothers and sisters of everyday heroes; the neighbors of entrepreneurs and firefighters, teachers and farmers, veterans and factory workers and everyone in-between who shows up not just on the big days or the good days, but on the bad days and on the hard days. \"Each and every day.All 365 of them. \"We are the United States of America.\" Update at 10:38 p.m. ET. Christie Starts With His Life Story: The New Jersey governor is beginning the keynote by talking about his family's humble origins and the authority figure \u2014 his mom. He's also quickly worked in a Bruce Springsteen reference: \"I was her son as I listened to Darkness on the Edge of Town with my high school friends on the Jersey Shore.\" Update at 10:33 p.m. ET. And Now, The Keynote From Gov. Christie: One of the week's most anticipated speeches is next \u2014 the keynote address from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who's known for his wit and way with words. Update at 10:32 p.m. ET. \"You Can Trust Mitt,\" And Then A Kiss From Her Man: \"I said tonight I wanted to talk to you about love,\" Ann Romney says as she wraps up her address. \"Look into your hearts. This is our country. This is our future. These are our children and grandchildren. \"You can trust Mitt.\" And moments later, Mitt Romney comes onstage to give her a kiss. They walk off hand in hand to the strains of \"My Girl.\" Update at 10:28 p.m. ET. Yes, Mitt Romney's Rich; But He Also Helps Others: After saying that the company her husband helped build (Bain Capital) \"has become another great American success story,\" Ann Romney says this: \"Has it made those who started the company successful beyond their dreams? \"Yes, it has.\" But, she adds, \"Mitt doesn't like to talk about how he has helped others because he sees it as a privilege, not a political talking point.\" Update at 10:26 p.m. ET. He'll Move Heaven And Earth: Ann Romney gets a huge cheer for this line: \"No one will move heaven and Earth like Mitt Romney to make this country a better place to live!\" Update at 10:22 p.m. ET. The Humble Start To Their Marriage: When she married Mitt Romney, Ann Romney tells the delegates, they \"ate a lot of pasta and tuna fish,\" had a folding dining room table and somehow coped while he went to business school and law school at the same time. Those sort of details are aimed at fleshing out the wealthy family's story. Update at 10:17 p.m. ET. \"I Love You Women!\": If it could somehow be detected, Ann Romney says, each night \"we could hear a collective sigh from the moms and dads across America who made it through another day.\" And, she says, \"you'll hear the women sighing a little bit more than the men. It's how it is, isn't it?\" \"I love you women!\" she shouts. Update at 10:15 p.m. ET. \"I Want To Talk To You About Love\": Ann Romney says she does not want to talk \"about what divides us, but about what holds us together. ... The one great thing that unites us. ... About love.\" Update at 10:08 p.m. ET. Ann Romney Coming Up: Luce Vela Fortuno, the first lady of Puerto Rico, is onstage now to introduce Ann Romney, wife of the GOP presidential nominee. So if you've been waiting for Ann Romney's address, it's time to listen up. Update at 10 p.m. ET. Big Cheers For Voter ID: When Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina says that if you need to show an identification card to get on an airplane you should also need to show an ID to vote, the delegates respond with one of the biggest cheers for any single statement tonight. Update at 9:50 p.m. ET. Former Democratic Rep. Davis: \"Thank You For Welcoming Me\": Artur Davis, who until recently was a Democratic congressman from Alabama, opens his speech with a joke about where he was four years ago: \"Some of you may know, the last time I spoke at a convention, it turned out I was in the wrong place. So, Tampa, my fellow Republicans, thank you for welcoming me where I belong.\" (He was, indeed, a part of the 2008 Democratic convention in Denver and used to be a strong supporter of President Obama.) It's a crowd-pleasing line, to say the least. Of Obama, he says: \"Do you know why so many of us believed? We led with our hearts and our dreams that we could be more inclusive than America had ever been, and no candidate had ever spoken so beautifully. But dreams meet daybreak: the jobless know what I mean, so do the families who wonder how this administration could wreck a recovery for three years and counting. \"So many of those high-flown words have faded.\" Update at 9:35 p.m. ET. When Santorum Speaks Of His Daughter, The Arena Is Hushed: As he talks of the people met on the campaign trail this year and the hands he held along the way, Rick Santorum says, \"I cradled the little, broken hands of the disabled. Hands that struggle and bring pain, hands that ennoble us and bring great joy. They came to see us \u2014 oh did they come \u2014 when they found out Karen and I are blessed with caring for someone very special too, our Bella.\" The arena was the quietest it has been all day as delegates appeared to listen closely. His disabled daughter was introduced to the nation during her father's campaign, and the story touched many hearts. And in comments that draw applause from a crowd where most likely have strong opinions about abortion, Santorum says, \"the doctors later told us Bella was incompatible with life and to prepare to let go. They said, even if she did survive, her disabilities would be so severe that Bella would not have a life worth living. We didn't let go and today Bella is full of life and she has made our lives and countless others much more worth living.\" Update at 9:25 p.m. ET. Rick Santorum Makes His Case Against Obama: The last man to mount a serious challenge to Romney's bid for the GOP nomination is at the microphone. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum is telling the story of his family. \"My grandfather, like millions of other immigrants,\" he says, \"didn't come here for some government guarantee of income equality or government benefits to take care of his family. In 1923 there were no government benefits for immigrants except one: Freedom! \"Under President Obama,\" Santorum continues, \"the dream of freedom and opportunity has become a nightmare of dependency with almost half of America receiving some government benefit.\" Mitt Romney, he says, would change that. As he speaks, a woman is shouting something from above and behind the stage. She's too far from our position to hear. Update at 9:05 p.m. ET. Gov. Walker Is A Big Hit With This Crowd: For the second time today, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin is proving to be a huge favorite with the GOP delegates. Walker, who pushed to limit public unions' collective bargaining rights and then survived a recall vote, said to huge cheers that: \"On June 5th, voters in Wisconsin got to determine who was in charge \u2014 was it the big government special government special interests in Washington ... or the hard-working tax payers of our state. \"The good news is that \u2014 on June 5th \u2014 the hard-working taxpayers won.\" And about Romney's choice of Ryan as a running mate, Walker said \"with this pick he showed us that the 'R' next to his name doesn't just stand for Republican, it stands for Reformer.\" That's a message that will appeal to the conservative wing of the party. Update at 8:55 p.m. ET. Another Republican Governor Touts GOP Policies: \"Look at the results of Republican policies in the states,\" Virginia Gov. Robert McDonnell tells delegates. \"In states with Republican governors, the average unemployment rate is a full point lower than in states with Democratic governors. Republican governors lead seven of the 10 states with the lowest unemployment rates, and 12 of the 15 states ranked best for business.\" McDonnell, says NPR's Ron Elving on our broadcast, \"did an awfully good job of getting through a lot of numbers in a compelling way.\" Update at 8:45 p.m. ET. And Kasich's Black Eyed Peas Reference Has Folks Tweeting: Ohio Gov. John Kasich said during his address that \"I got a feeling, and it's not just because I like the Black Eyed Peas!\" That's got folks tweeting, including fake Jill Biden, a parody Twitter page about the wife of the Democratic vice president (and on a related note: Joe Biden, by the way, doesn't tell the truth about being a good golfer, according to Kasich): \"John Kasich quoted The Black Eyed Peas. Yep, Republicans are in touch with everyday people. #GOP2012.\" Update at 8:40 p.m. ET. Our First Stemwinder! On the NPR broadcast, Senior Washington Editor Ron Elving just declared that Gov. John Kasich's address was \"the most dynamic\" of the evening so far and a real old-fashioned \"stemwinder.\" What's a stemwinder? According to Slate: \"The term dates back to the middle of the 19th century, when the stem-winding watch came into vogue. The newfangled timepiece was a vast improvement over its predecessor, the key-wound watch, because the mechanism for setting it was a stem actually attached to the watch, rather than a key that was easily and frequently misplaced. This technological advance was so widely appreciated that, by the end of the 1800s, the term stemwinder had taken on the figurative meaning of 'excellent' or 'outstanding,' or, as the Oxford English Dictionary puts it, 'a person or thing that is first rate.' \" Update at 8:30 p.m. ET. Kasich Fires Up The Crowd: Ohio Gov. John Kasich is talking about how his state went from being \"$8 billion in the hole\" to being in surplus \u2014 without, he says, raising taxes. Washington needs to do the same, he says, but \"this relationship [with President Obama] is just not working, it is holding us back!\" Ohio Republicans, Kasich says, have made the state fourth in the nation in job growth \u2014 up from 48th when he took office in 2011. He's the second governor to get some loud cheers today. Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin (who will be on again a little later) is the other. Update at 8:15 p.m. ET. Sen. Ayotte On Regulations: Telling the story of the snow removal company she and her husband started, New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte says their experience was that \"from the National Labor Relations Board \u2014 to the Department of Labor \u2014 to the EPA ... under this administration, the regulations are up \u2014 and the job creation is down.\" Update at 7:55 p.m. ET. A Fact Check On \"You Didn't Build That\": The nonpartisan FactCheck.org has looked at President Obama's comment \u2014 \"you didn't build that\" \u2014 and how Republicans have responded. It says that: \"There's no question Obama inartfully phrased those two sentences, but it's clear from the context what the president was talking about. He spoke of government \u2014 including government-funded education, infrastructure and research \u2014 assisting businesses to make what he called 'this unbelievable American system that we have.' \"In summary, he said: 'The point is ... that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together.' \" Obama's critics, FactCheck says, have often been \"out of context\" when using the comment against the president. Update at 7:50 p.m. ET. \"We Built It!\" After saying that \"the America I came to know was centered in personal responsibility and filled with the American dream,\" Mayor Mia Love of Saratoga Springs, Utah (who is running for Congress), says to the current occupant of the White House: \"Mr. President I am here to tell you the American people ... are not buying what you are selling in 2012. This is our story. ... This is the America we know because we built it!\" She gets some of the biggest cheers so far tonight. \"We built it\" is going to be a line used a lot at this convention. Love is among the women and minorities (she's African-American) whom South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley was talking about earlier today when she spoke of those who she says are offended by what she called Democratic attacks aimed at convincing minorities that Republicans hate them. Update at 7:25 p.m. ET. A Shout-Out To Biden, Sort Of: Vice President Biden hasn't come up often tonight, but Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus just got off a zinger aimed at the man Rep. Paul Ryan would like to replace: With Ryan, Priebus said, the nation won't have a vice president who goes around \"just prying his foot out of his mouth!\" Update at 7:15 p.m. ET. Things Are Going Again: House Speaker John Boehner, who grew up working in his family's bar, is trying out an applause line. What would they do in a bar if a customer turned troublesome? \"Throw him out!\" And you don't need to guess who Boehner is suggesting needs to be \"thrown out\" now. Update at 6:30 p.m. ET. Her Husband \"Will Not Fail,\" Ann Romney Will Say: \"This man will not fail. This man will not let us down. This man will lift up America!\" Those are three of the lines Ann Romney is set to deliver when she addresses the convention during the 10 p.m. ET hour, according to excerpts emailed to reporters by the Romney campaign. She also plans to say: \"At every turn in his life, this man I met at a high school dance, has helped lift up others. He did it with the Olympics, when many wanted to give up. ... This is the man America needs. ... This is the man who will wake up every day with the determination to solve the problems that others say can't be solved, to fix what others say is beyond repair. This is the man who will work harder than anyone so that we can work a little less hard.\" Update at 6:18 p.m. ET. Ryan's The Vice Presidential Man: Without a roll call, the Republicans just officially made Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin their 2012 vice presidential nominee. Basically, the \"ayes\" had it. Now things are in recess for about 40 minutes. Update at 6:10 p.m. ET. Shout! House Speaker John Boehner just announced that Romney collected 2,061 delegates' votes (it takes 1,144 to be the nominee). Then Boehner lowered the gavel on the roll call. There was a brief pause, the house band struck up the rockin' strains of \"Shout\" and that was the cue for the delegates to wave signs and do some standing-by-their-seats dancing. Now the party's on to the roll call for vice president \u2014 Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin is the pick. Update at 6:05 p.m. ET. Wisconsin's Governor Gets A Hero's Welcome: Scott Walker, the Republican governor who pushed to limit public unions' collective bargaining rights and then survived a recall vote, just got a huge cheer from the delegates when he announced Wisconsin's vote on the nominees. He'll be getting another rousing cheer, almost certainly, when he takes center stage in the 8 p.m. ET hour. (Reminder: we previewed the night's program here.) (Correction at 7:20 p.m. ET: Our apologies for earlier referring to Walker as the governor of Wisconsin.) Update at 5:40 p.m. ET. The Roll Call Shows: Romney Is The Nominee. It takes 1,144 delegates to become the Republican presidential nominee and New Jersey's 50 just put Mitt Romney over the top. Meanwhile, Ron Paul's total isn't being announced from the podium. C-SPAN says there are 130 votes at this point for \"others.\" Some Paul supporters in the crowd have taken to shouting out where his total stands. Update at 5:20 p.m. ET. Process May \"Turn Some People Off\": As the roll call continues, Maine Republican National Committee member and delegate Rick Bennett tells NPR's Liz Halloran that the process of seating delegates (which has excluded some from Maine who supported Rep. Ron Paul) \"was incredibly messy, and nobody feels treated well. We're operating under an antiquated process, with a lot of opportunity for things to go wrong.\" \"Unfortunately,\" he adds, \"this is going to turn some people off. It's going to turn some real energy and activism off.\" Still, he does not think it will affect Mitt Romney's chances of winning in November. Update at 5:05 p.m. ET. The Roll Call Begins: For those who enjoy the pomp and circumstance of the official roll call, it has begun. Update at 4:50 p.m. ET. You Can Disagree, Just Don't Do It Here: The outbursts over the rules and seating votes by some from his state and in other delegations was embarrassing, 56-year-old Texas delegate Isaac Castro tells NPR's Liz Halloran. \"We elect national committee men and women to represent us. They do and they do a fine job,\" he said. . \"When a majority speaks, we need to abide by these rules,\" said Castro. \"There's room in this party for everyone. There's room to disagree. I just don't want them doing it here.\" \"We need to move forward united behind Romney.\" Update at 4:35 p.m. ET. More On The Dispute: \"This is not about Ron Paul,\" Minnesota delegate (and Paul supporter) Rudy Takala, 23, tells NPR's Liz Halloran. \"This is about future conventions.\" Liz previously posted for us that: \"The Paulites say that there are more of them embedded in state delegations than Republican officials are willing to acknowledge, and they are trying to organize a floor fight Tuesday to take on new proposed party rules that would hobble outsider candidates seeking to seat delegates at future conventions. \"Many of the pro-Paul delegates were chosen at state party conventions, and not through the allocation process based on the results of presidential caucuses and primaries. The rules change would require that delegates be picked based on caucus and primary contest outcomes; not by state conventions.\" Takala says \"we want to be able to submit a minority report and vote on it. We want to at least have a vote.\" In the end, though, it appears that the party has decided to push through and keep things going \u2014 knowing, of course, that while the Paul supporters are very loud they are not in the majority. Update at 4:25 p.m. ET. \"POINT OF ORDER!\": The floor fracas continues. Once again \"NOs\" are as loud as \"AYEs\" when the delegates are asked to vote on rule changes that give nominees more control over who is or isn't a delegate (and, presumably, more of a chance to exclude supporters of such candidates as Rep. Ron Paul). As with the previous vote, the chair declares the motion is passed. Even louder \"boos!\" erupt. From the floor, Liz Halloran reports that \"Texas delegates were screaming 'POINT OF ORDER!' \" She says there's a group of at least 20 in that delegation doing the shouting. \"It's a tumultuous scene down here,\" she emails. Meanwhile, Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell continues to talk at the podium about the change that Republicans hope to bring to the nation. He's basically ignoring any distractions. Update at 4:20 p.m. ET. \"SEAT THEM NOW!\" Vs. \"USA!\": The convention has gotten raucous. When it was moved that the Rules Committee's recommendation that not all of Ron Paul's delegates from Maine be seated should be adopted, the \"NOs!\" were as loud as the \"AYEs!\" And when RNC Chairman Reince Priebus declared that the motion had passed, the arena got even louder. \"SEAT THEM NOW!\" yelled the Paul supporters and others who oppose the decision and the plan to give future presidential nominees more control over which delegates do and don't get seated. \"USA!\" other delegates shouted in an unsuccessful bid to drown them out. Priebus pushed through the fracas, asking delegates to be respectful. It's been several minutes and the volume has gone down, but there are still catcalls. Update at 4:03 p.m. ET. \"I Want You To Love Me\": We were in the hall Sunday when the house band \u2014 led by guitarist G.E. Smith \u2014 ripped through Cheap Trick's classic rocker \"I Want You To Want Me.\" We suggested it's a song that fits most politicians. Well, the band is indeed playing it for delegates. And they seem to be enjoying it. Update at 3:40 p.m. ET. The Congressional Parade: The early hours of conventions \u2014 well before TV's prime time \u2014 are when junior members of Congress and new candidates get their chances to be on the podium for 60 or 90 seconds. This can also be a time when parties try to show some diversity and appeal to minorities. Rep. Sean Duffy of Wisconsin said the GOP will spread prosperity from \"the breweries of Wisconsin to the barrios of California.\" And Tim Scott, an African-American candidate for Congress from South Carolina, ended his turn at the microphone with a few runs through the chorus of \"Hit The Road Jack\" \u2014 the person he want to see hit the road, of course, is President Obama. The early hours also give a party the chance to begin hammering home its message. So far, there have been many comments from the stage that \"we can do better\" and a big sign at one end of the floor says \"we built it.\" Update at 3:25 p.m. ET. Oops. Someone Forgot To Send The Buses For The Florida Delegation: According to the Tampa Bay Times, the Florida delegation \u2014 which is staying 30 miles away as something of a punishment for holding the state's primary earlier than rules allowed \u2014 suffered another indignity today. The buses that were to show up to bring the delegates to the convention didn't arrive. \"The RNC forgot to send them, delegates were told,\" according to the Times. It took a while to round up replacements, and the delegates arrived in town with just minutes to spare. Update at 3 p.m. ET. Compromise In The Works? NPR.org's Liz Halloran reports from the convention floor that she's been told by Oklahoma Republican Vice Chairwoman Pam Pollard that the Rules Committee has agreed on a plan that it believes will satisfy those (many of them supporters of Ron Paul) who were upset by plans to give presidential nominees more control over which delegates get seated. Pollard told Liz that the original plan was akin to \"swatting a gnat with a sledgehammer.\" There may still be some shows of unrest, though. Liz reports that the Maine delegation may seek to have 10 or so Paul delegates recognized whom the party doesn't want to seat. Update at 2:26 p.m. ET. First Mention Of The Debt Clocks: We noted Monday that the GOP has installed two \"debt clocks\" above the convention floor. One tracks the nation's total public debt. The other tracks how much has been added since the convention official opened at 2 p.m. ET on Monday. At 2:26 p.m. ET, Republican National Chairman Reince Priebus made the first mention of the debt clocks and the blame Republicans attach to President Obama for the massive amount of debt. Expect many more mentions over the next three days. Update at 2:20 p.m. ET. Voices Of Dissent: NPR's Ted Robbins, who is in the arena, tells us he spoke with three members of the Minnesota delegation who say \u2014 Ted paraphrases \u2014 that unity (behind the idea of defeating President Obama) isn't as important as liberty. They plan to be among the Paul supporters who try to raise objections to new rules that would allow future nominees to have more control over who does and doesn't get seated as a delegate. Update at 2:05 p.m. ET: And We're Off! The gavel has been dropped, the colors have been presented, the national anthem has been sung and the invocation is being delivered. The GOP convention has started right on time. But one of the first things to happen may be a bit of a floor fight, as we previewed this morning. Ron Paul's supporters aren't happy with changes to the party's policies and procedures on the seating of delegates. Update at 1:35 p.m. ET. Before The Show, Another Ron Paul Moment: As we've posted about a few times this week, Texas Rep. Ron Paul and his supporters took full advantage of the convention's delay to make some noise of their own around Tampa on Sunday and Monday. They just did it again. The man himself made an appearance on the convention floor \u2014 to the loud delight of his fans. A chant of \"Ron Paul!\" went up. A minute later, the soon-to-be presidential nominee's supporters responded with \"Romney!\" They couldn't outshout the Paulites, though (to be fair, delegates are still drifting in; so the majority of delegates \u2014 Mitt Romney supporters \u2014 weren't here to add their voices).",

            "article_content": "Forget the widespread rumor going around in recent weeks that Mitt Romney was going to announce his running mate this month. Perhaps, if the persistent attacks on Romney's taxes, investments and stewardship of Bain Capital started to show sharp erosion in his numbers, he would have moved up a V.P. announcement. But that hasn't happened. With polls indicating a continuous dead heat with President Obama, Romney is about to embark Tuesday on a week-long trip to Britain, Israel and Poland without first naming someone to his ticket. This foreign trip coincides with the Summer Olympics, in London, that last until Sunday, Aug. 12. The Republican convention in Tampa convenes two weeks later. Who will be Romney's VP?  The naming of his running mate is likely going to come in mid-August, after his foreign trip and the conclusion of the Olympics.\n                \n                    \n                    Ken Rudin collection\n                    \n                \nhide caption By process of elimination, Romney's widely-awaited announcement will probably come sometime the week of the 13th. And while I've long argued that the presidential race is always decided by who runs at the top of the ticket and not who is number two, there is no question that a lot is at stake in Romney's choice. And that's why I'm leading with this e-mail question: Q: You have touched on some of the poor choices presidential candidates have made picking a V.P. running mate, such as Sarah Palin, Dan Quayle, Geraldine Ferraro, etc. Could you expand on this subject? I would like to hear more about the good and poor choices and how this affected the election. \u2014 Neil Herness, San Marcos, Calif. A: Many people will argue that the most important thing in naming a vice presidential running mate is that he or she should \"do no harm,\" that, as long as the pick is not controversial or does not cause a distraction, that is a good thing. And if the choice actually helps? Well, that's a bonus. In my view, not since Jack Kennedy picked Lyndon Johnson has the choice of a running mate truly affected the outcome in November. LBJ did, after all, help bring Texas to the Democratic fold in 1960. But the record for subsequent No. 2's is a bit mixed. Here's my scorecard: 1964 Democrat: President Lyndon Johnson, without a vice president since he succeeded the assassinated John F. Kennedy in 1963, named Hubert Humphrey, the Senate majority whip, at the convention. He said the Minnesotan was best qualified to become president should something happen to him. Humphrey's avowed liberalism also helped soften some opposition to Johnson from the left. Verdict: PLUS. Republican: Sen. Barry Goldwater may have picked Rep. William Miller of New York, the head of the National Republican Congressional Committee \u2014 who had already announced his decision to retire in '64 \u2014 because as an Easterner and Roman Catholic, he would bring geographical and religious balance to the GOP ticket. Or, as Goldwater said on more than one occasion, he picked Miller because \"he drove LBJ nuts.\" Ultimately, though, Miller was a non-factor in the election, in which the GOP was buried in November. In fairness, nothing was going to help Goldwater that year. Verdict: MINUS. 1968 Republican: It's not clear whether Richard Nixon even met Spiro Agnew before choosing him as his running mate. Agnew, elected governor of Maryland in 1966 as a liberal, moved steadily to the right in 1968, especially since Agnew's original choice for the White House, New York's Nelson Rockefeller, dillydallied on deciding whether to run. Agnew also received national attention when he directly criticized black leaders in Maryland in the wake of the riots following the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. That apparently won the notice of Sens. Strom Thurmond (R-SC) and John Tower (R-TX), who urged Nixon to go with Agnew \u2014 which he did, one day after Agnew nominated him for president at the convention. Of course, this was in the day when vetting potential VP picks was unheard of; had anyone done the most cursory investigation of Agnew, they might have learned about his corruption and bribe-taking \u2014 an activity that began even before his governorship, when he was Baltimore county executive. But Agnew did provide the red-meat attack-dog rhetoric Nixon clearly sought in his running mate. Verdict: MINUS. Democrat: Sen. Ed Muskie of Maine may have been just as much of a national political unknown as Agnew was, but he was considered a serious and thoughtful, if colorless, legislator. And while presidential nominee Hubert Humphrey took a pounding, mostly from the left, during that divisive general election campaign, Muskie won respect from both wings of the party throughout the fall. Verdict: PLUS. 1972 Democrat: If no running mate was going to help Barry Goldwater in 1964, the same could be said about whomever George McGovern was going to select in 1972. Still, the revelation by Sen. Thomas Eagleton of Missouri \u2014 just two weeks after he was picked \u2014 that he had been treated for depression with electroshock therapy and was hospitalized several times in the early 1960s threw the party for a loop. McGovern may have famously said he was \"1,000 percent\" for Eagleton, but there was tremendous pressure on Eagleton to withdraw ... which he did, 17 days after being named to the ticket. Verdict: MINUS. The Democratic National Committee then named Sargent Shriver as Eagleton's replacement, but he was a non-factor for the rest of the campaign. McGovern had tried to entice other Democrats onto the ticket, including Sen. Edward Kennedy, but they all said no. Verdict: MINUS. 1976 Democrat: If Jimmy Carter was an outsider, from the South, with anti-establishment credentials and no Washington experience, Sen. Walter Mondale of Minnesota, a big-government liberal and a member of the \"club\" in good standing, was the perfect counterbalance. Though Carter was to have a strained relationship with many Democrats in Congress, they never lost their respect for Mondale. He also was a clear winner in his VP debate against Kansas Sen. Bob Dole. Verdict: PLUS. Republican: In choosing Bob Dole as his running mate (and dumping Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in the process), President Gerald Ford did not focus on geographical or ideological balance. He was looking for a take-no-prisoners conservative battler who would appeal to the supporters of defeated presidential hopeful Ronald Reagan. But Dole proved to be a testy campaigner, and his performance in his debate with Mondale was seen as a disaster, notably his description of the two World Wars, Korea and Vietnam as \"Democrat wars.\" Verdict: MINUS. 1980 Republican: Ronald Reagan may have campaigned as a steadfast conservative, but in choosing George H.W. Bush as his running mate, he showed his pragmatic side. Bush was a conservative but in the moderate mode, and the Reagan-Bush ticket unified the party. Bush, of course, had to take back his earlier criticism of Reagan's economic policies and abortion views. It was the first time a GOP ticket was made up of rivals for the nomination since 1944, when New York Gov. Thomas Dewey chose John Bricker, his counterpart from Ohio. Verdict: PLUS. 1984 Democrat: Walter Mondale may have thrown a Hail Mary pass with his selection of Rep. Geraldine Ferraro of New York as his running mate, the first woman in history to appear on a major-party ticket. But the history of the moment, and the ecstatic response the choice received from feminist groups, soon gave way to troubling news about the financial affairs of Ferraro's husband. In the end, though, no one can claim that the distraction about John Zaccaro is what did in Mondale \u2014 who lost 49 out of 50 states to President Reagan. But a distraction it was. Verdict: MINUS. 1988 Republican: On paper, Vice President George Bush's argument for selecting Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana made sense. He was young, but not Jack Kemp; he was Midwest, where Bush needed help, but not Bob Dole. And he had the reputation of being a giant killer, having toppled Democratic Sen. Birch Bayh in 1980. But just as Ferraro's family finances were not properly vetted by the Dems in '84, the process by which Quayle joined the National Guard in the middle of the Vietnam War, and the family connections he used to get him there, became the story from Day One. And his performance against Democratic VP pick Lloyd Bentsen in their debate has forever been described as a \"deer in the headlight\" moment for Quayle. With the Bush-Quayle ticket winning 40 out of 50 states in November, it became one of the instances in which a ticket won despite the VP candidate. Verdict: MINUS. Democrat: Since the Boston-Austin axis worked so well for Kennedy and Johnson in 1960, there was no reason for Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis to think it wouldn't work again when he picked Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen. And although Bentsen won plaudits with his handling of GOP rival Dan Quayle during his famous \"You're No Jack Kennedy\" debate performance, some in the party felt that Bentsen was a wrong fit from the beginning: He differed from Dukakis on many issues, and he was too far to the right for many progressives in the party to accept. And, unlike the 1960 comparison, Bentsen failed to bring along his home state of Texas. Many Republicans suggested that before Dukakis debated Vice President Bush, he might have to settle his differences with Bentsen. Verdict: MINUS. 1992 Democrat: Bill Clinton abandoned conventional wisdom when he selected Sen. Al Gore as his running mate. Rather than seek any kind of geographical, ideological or demographic balance, the Arkansas governor instead picked someone very similar to himself: a young moderate from nearby Tennessee. One way they differed: While Clinton had the reputation as being a draft-dodging womanizer, Gore served in Vietnam, and his wife was a vocal promoter of \"family values.\" And that didn't hurt either. Verdict: PLUS. 1996 Republican: Plain and simple, Bob Dole selected, in Jack Kemp, someone he didn't agree with or especially like. They ran against each other for the nomination in 1988 and were on opposite sides of the deficit reduction vs. supply-side economics debate. But Dole, running behind President Clinton all year, decided that he needed to go for broke, and Kemp, though out of office eight years, remained popular with the Reagan wing of the party. Kemp, however, distinguished himself neither on the campaign trail nor in his debate with Vice President Gore. Verdict: MINUS. 2000 Republican: Dick Cheney, who headed up George W. Bush's search committee for a running mate, perhaps knew better than anyone what the Texas governor lacked: national security and foreign policy experience. And he provided it. As someone who never pined for the White House, Cheney's addition was more about governing than simply campaigning. We can argue whether his policy pushes during his eight years in office were popular or not, but no vice president played a more crucial role in determining the course of the nation than Cheney. Verdict: PLUS. Democrat: Al Gore was tormented by how to deal with a term-limited President Bill Clinton in 2000. The incumbent remained very popular, but Gore \u2014 searching for swing voters who may have been put off by Clinton's personal conduct \u2014 seemed determined to make a statement. He named Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, the first Jew to run on a major-party ticket \u2014 but more important, someone who had publicly and forcefully denounced Clinton's conduct in the aftermath of l'affaire Lewinsky. But if he also picked Lieberman to be an attack dog, he was sorely mistaken. Lieberman went out of his way to be nice, including during his debate with Cheney. And there's no telling how many voters who felt Clinton was a net positive for the party were alienated by Lieberman's selection. Verdict: MINUS. 2004 Democrat: To say that John Edwards was not a successful vote getter during the Democratic primaries would be an understatement; he won only one state, South Carolina, where he was born. But he had a winning campaign style, and presidential nominee John Kerry, despite some personal misgivings, picked him to fill the ticket. Still, Edwards failed to bring in any Southern state in November to the Democratic column, and many partisans felt he was insufficiently aggressive in his debate against Vice President Cheney. And this negative report card does not include his later indefensible behavior in his personal life. Verdict: MINUS. 2008 Democrat: In his two tries for his party's presidential nomination, Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware never got very far. He could be, and was, long-winded and vain. He had a habit of making embarrassing gaffes, and several of his comments about Barack Obama (\"articulate and clean,\" that the White House was not the place for \"on the job training\") threatened to come back and haunt him. If Obama was making the case that he opposed the war in Iraq from the beginning and stood for genuine change, he was naming a running mate who was 65, had been in the Senate since 1973 and voted for the war. But Biden was a great campaigner, very smart and well-liked. And just as Cheney gave the GOP ticket foreign policy bona fides, Biden's vast Washington experience and expertise in foreign affairs helped balance Obama's 15 minutes in the Senate. Verdict: PLUS. Republican: At the GOP convention in St. Paul, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin gave a speech that brought the house down. And in doing so, she helped make conservatives who never fully warmed up to John McCain suddenly get enthused and excited about the ticket. That enthusiasm, and Palin's positive reviews, didn't last long. Verdict: MINUS. (Note: This answer is derived from my Aug. 20, 2008 Political Junkie column, with some changes/updates.) Political Updates. I post periodic political updates during the week on Twitter. You can follow me at @kenrudin. Here's some stuff that appeared in my e-mail in box: Q: Do you think the GOP will win an electoral vote in Maine's Second Congressional district in November? If I remember correctly, Bush came within a few points of winning the district in 2000. \u2014 Joshua Holman, Havelock, N.C. A: Probably not. Yes, George W. Bush came close to carrying the 2nd CD in 2000, which would have given him an additional electoral vote (both Maine and Nebraska award an electoral vote to the presidential winner of a congressional district). But this doesn't look like a good year for Republicans in the Pine Tree State, and Mitt Romney's chances are only part of that calculation. The Senate seat of retiring Republican Olympia Snowe is all but gone, and controversial GOP Gov. Paul LePage would find it quite difficult to win a second term if the election were held this year. And speaking of the state's 2nd CD: Bush's father, incumbent President George H.W. Bush, actually finished third in the district (and the state), to Bill Clinton and Ross Perot, in 1992. For the record, Barack Obama narrowly carried Nebraska's 2nd CD in 2008 and thus picked up an electoral vote in the process. But that's not likely to be repeated in November. Q: I've listened to the argument [in Political Junkie] and I still think you are wrong in insisting \"both sides do it\" regarding Democrats and Republicans using Nazi comparisons to trash their opponents. Yes, there were crazies on the left who portrayed [George W.] Bush as Hitler. But I can't think of anyone of prominence on the left saying what those on the right constantly spew out. You can't compare street protests with people such as Maine's governor LePage. And how can you forget Fox News' Roger Ailes calling NPR \"Nazis,\" an outlandish charge he never apologized for. \u2014 Phyllis Bernstein, New York, N.Y. A: I'll say it one more time. My point was not to say both parties trot out this garbage equally. As for whether respected people on the \"left\" have used this tactic, I remember reading that Al Gore once referring to Bush supporters as \"a network of 'rapid response' digital brownshirts.\" That sounds over the top to me. I think the late Sen. Robert Byrd (D-WV) once said something during the judicial filibuster debate about a reference to Hitler. Look, do I think we've witnessed this kind of behavior more during the Obama years than the Bush years? No question. My only argument is that it's got to stop. Q: I enjoyed your back and forth with [substitute podcaster] Brian Naylor in last week's podcast about the Green Party and when it actually was created. Brian should know not to question your amazing political knowledge. I hope he is not banned forever from the podcast! \u2014 Sherry Krauss, Minneapolis, Minn. A: The only squabbles I ever have with Brian is about baseball; he's a Mets fan. Enough said. What he actually was remembering was covering the Citizens Party, not the Green Party, during its 1980 convention. The pro-environment party, which had contempt for all three major presidential candidates that year \u2014 President Jimmy Carter, Republican challenger Ronald Reagan and independent John Anderson \u2014 nominated Barry Commoner, a writer and environmental science professor. His running mate was La Donna Harris, a Native American activist and wife of former Oklahoma Sen. Fred Harris. The ticket was on the ballot in some 29 states (in Pennsylvania it was called the \"Consumer Party\"), attracting about 234,000 votes. The party also ran a presidential slate in 1984 but it dissolved not long after. Q: Have you had a chance to see the \"Political Animals\" show on the USA network? Wondering what you thought. I liked it a lot. \u2014 D. Newman, Austin, Texas A: I'm not sure. First of all, who's going to believe a TV show based on a woman who runs for the Democratic presidential nomination with the backing of her (former president) husband but loses and then becomes Secretary of State? How do they think up these things? Seriously, while it's always nice to see Sigourney Weaver, I found \u2014 admittedly, after one episode \u2014 the writing and plot lines fairly predictable, sometimes inadvertently comical. And the caricature of Weaver's philandering husband, of course based on Bill Clinton, is just the worst. There has to be a reason why the country elected \"Bud Hammond\" (played by Ciar\u00e1n Hinds), but you'd never know it from what we've seen. He's buffoonish/clownish and, quite frankly, embarrassing to watch. But other parts of the plot (as well as other characters) were intriguing. And so, yes, I plan on tuning in for the second episode.

Larry Hogan (R-Md.), a member of the House Judiciary Committee, becomes the committee's first Republican to announce he will vote to impeach President Nixon for Watergate crimes. Hogan, a conservative who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor of Maryland, said that Nixon \"lied repeatedly\" about the Watergate break-in and coverup. For its part, the White House accused Hogan of being motivated by his gubernatorial campaign (July 23, 1974). It gets worse for Nixon the next day, as the U.S. Supreme Court will unanimously reject the president's claim of executive privilege regarding his refusal to hand over tapes of his Oval Office conversations. As for Hogan, while his call for impeachment will gain him national attention, it will backfire back home; he will lose the September GOP gov. primary in an upset to Maryland Republican National Committeewoman Louise Gore.

I'm talking about the rumors, first appearing Thursday in the Drudge Report, that former Bush Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has surged to the top of Romney's wish list. The supposed book on Rice: she cuts into President Obama's African-American and female vote, and has foreign policy smarts. Sarah Palin, who knows a thing or three about the importance of the vetting process, chimed in, saying Rice would make a \"wonderful\" vice president. And what about the fact that Rice supports abortion rights? Palin said that we \"need to remember\" that \"it's not the vice president that would legislate abortion, and that would be Congress's role. And we'll keep that in mind.\" Somehow I don't remember hearing that argument when Tom Ridge's name was being discussed as vice-presidential material. In any event, one would assume a Rice for Veep pick is not palatable for many conservatives, and that certainly includes Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, who offered this statement: \"Former Secretary Rice's position on the sanctity of human life makes her an unqualified candidate for Governor Romney to choose as a running mate. Throughout the campaign, including at the Palmetto Freedom Forum last September, he has pledged to us in no uncertain terms that he would choose a pro-life running mate. We have taken Governor Romney at his word and therefore believe Secretary Rice will be ruled out of consideration. Secretary Rice's position violates criteria that Governor Romney himself has laid out.\" Ben Jacobs, writing in The Daily Beast, explains why choosing Rice would be problematic: \"Ever since starting his first presidential campaign in 2006, the former Massachusetts governor has faced a higher level of scrutiny from conservatives for his record on social issues. Romney, who ran for the U.S. Senate in 1994 as a pro-choice candidate who would be 'better than Ted [Kennedy] on gay rights,' has had to backtrack considerably since. He has vowed to be 'severely conservative' and spent his presidential primary combating attacks that he was simply 'a Massachusetts moderate.' The result has left Romney uniquely vulnerable to criticism from the Republican base.\" I agree. Compared to every Republican presidential nominee you can think of in recent decades, no one is looked at with more suspicion from conservatives than Romney. (And that includes John McCain, Palin's benefactor, who broke with the GOP on many issues, such as the Bush tax cuts, immigration and campaign finance legislation.) Given Romney's problems with the base, choosing a running mate who supports abortion rights would be an invitation for a right-wing revolt. Lost in all this has been Rice's repeated assertions that she has no interest in being vice president or becoming a candidate of any kind. And for all we know, the Rice trial balloon may have been one person's way of trying to change the subject from Bain Capital. Regardless, it's not going to be Condoleezza Rice. (But if lo and behold it turned out that she was the pick, that would be great news for Demas Jasper of Salt Lake City, Utah. Demas was the first person to predict Rice in my \"Guess The VP\" contest from last April.) There is another blockbuster I'd like to share with you. Five times, between last Thursday night and Friday morning, I received the same e-mail from Romney campaign manager Matt Rhoades giving me a tremendous hint about when the VP choice will be made. When you send something five times, you know it has to be significant. And it was: \"We're getting ready to share some exciting news. Sometime between now and the Republican convention, Mitt will be announcing his choice for VP.\" This is pretty remarkable, given the fact that I always expected Romney to announce his choice in October. Well, you heard it here first. Still, it's not as remarkable as this e-mail, which comes from Jennifer Petty, the executive director of 21st Century Democrats: \"Soon Mitt Romney will make his choice for vice president, and we're curious who you think he will pick. ... It's such an important choice, and it can also blow up in your face if you pick wrong. Look what happened to George Bush when he added Dan Quayle to the ticket. But in the last election, John McCain's campaign regained momentum with his choice of Sarah Palin, which energized the right wing of the Republican Party.\" I kind of sat there for a bit after reading this. Is Jennifer saying that the Quayle pick in 1988 was bad and the Palin pick was good? Anyway, good or bad, here's another look at my tortured record at predicting vice-presidential running mates. I've been living off my Thomas Eagleton (1972) and Dan Quayle (1988) picks for years now, ignoring of course the fact that I've been wrong just about every other time: 1972 Dem Prediction: Tom Eagleton Dem Actual: Eagleton 1976 GOP Prediction: Howard Baker GOP Actual: Bob Dole Dem Prediction: John Glenn Dem Actual: Walter Mondale 1980 GOP Prediction: Richard Lugar GOP Actual: George H.W.

And speaking of Tom Eagleton, last week was the 40th anniversary of the 1972 Democratic convention, which nominated George McGovern (July 12), who then named Eagleton as his running mate (July 13) \u2014 one of the more disastrous choices in convention history. (Check out a new book on the subject, \"The Eighteen-Day Running Mate: McGovern, Eagleton, and a Campaign In Crisis,\" by Joshua Glasser (Yale University Press). It's a good read.) In September of 2010, I had the privilege of coming to St. Louis, courtesy of member station KWMU/St. Louis Public Radio, for a fundraiser, speech and schmoozing. One of the events took place at the home of Barbara Eagleton, Tom's widow. Barbara is not only a tremendous supporter of public radio, but she is also an absolutely delightful person. She opened her home to me and showed me some great items from Tom's political career, including scores of photos from a who's-who in Democratic politics. At one point I asked her about those calamitous days of 1972. She said it was almost surreal, likening it to the center of a tornado \u2014 a strange calmness enveloped them, she said, while all chaos broke loose outside of it. That day with Barbara Eagleton was one of the highlights of my career with NPR and I'll never forget it. Greenstein. The Green Party, at its national convention on Saturday in Baltimore, named Dr. Jill Stein as its presidential nominee. Stein, an internist from Lexington, Mass., easily defeated comedienne Roseanne Barr and several others for the nomination. The Green nominee for governor against Mitt Romney in 2002 (she received three percent of the vote) and again in 2010, Stein dismisses concern that her candidacy could hurt the Democrats in November, as many accuse the Greens and nominee Ralph Nader doing in 2000 (see last week's Political Junkie column), saying, \"You don't get democracy by silencing the voice of the public interest.\" The party is hoping to appear on at least 40 state ballots in the fall, but as of now the number is 22. Political Updates. I post periodic political updates during the week on Twitter. You can follow me at @kenrudin. Here's some stuff that appeared in my e-mail in box: But first, let me talk a little about this disagreement I had with one of the callers during last week's Political Junkie segment on Talk of the Nation. In our political potpourri segment, host Neal Conan played a clip from Paul LePage, the Republican governor of Maine, who said this in his weekly radio address in denouncing Obamacare: \"We the people have been told there is no choice: You must buy health insurance or pay the new Gestapo, the IRS.\" There has been a disturbing increase of people, in trying to make a political point, who compare their foes to Hitler, Nazis, the Gestapo, etc. It is, in my opinion, shameful and despicable. Disagree all you want, but comparing opponents to what went on in Germany in the 1930s is crossing a line that should not be crossed. However, I expressed myself this way on the show: \"We've heard this kind of rhetoric from both sides, going back for several years now, and it's just getting out of hand, between George W. Bush being a Nazi, Barack Obama being a Nazi. ... The Holocaust and what happened back then was pretty horrific, and to describe arms of the government as being Gestapo-related or Nazi-related or fascist-related or communist-related, you are inciting people, and it's just a very dangerous bit of rhetoric that just doesn't seem to stop.\" But it was my \"we've heard this kind of rhetoric from both sides\" that prompted Jim to call in from Iowa City, who complained I \"... just brushed it off as name-calling on both sides and created some sort of equivalency, and there really is no equivalency. The vitriol and name-calling from the right is much, much more extreme. This doesn't come from Democrats and the opposition to the extreme right anywhere near as much. The Republicans are serial abusers in this regard.\" My argument was not about which party does it more; I was just saying that whoever does it is despicable. But I did say that both sides have done it \u2014 I recall posters depicting President Bush with a Hitler mustache and Swastika armband. Harry Belafonte \u2014 an entertainer, true, and not the governor of a state \u2014 famously compared the Homeland Security Department to the Gestapo in 2006. There were other such instances. Do I think it's gotten worse since Jan. 20, 2009? I do, certainly. And maybe I did come off as more dismissive than I should have. But my point was not to list the number of times Democrats said it and compare it to the number of times Republicans said it. Anyway, two e-mails from two different perspectives came in to the mailbox: Eileen Shore, Minneapolis, Minn.: \"You were correctly challenged about this false equivalency by one of the callers, and I just want to reinforce what he said. You seemed to dismiss his comment, and you should not. As long as the radical conservatives get a bye from you and others, and are not held to account, they will continue. You are encouraging them and it needs to stop. At some point bland 'they all do it' non-analysis becomes an primary reason this kind of deadly discourse continues. Please reflect deeply about this. ... By all means, hold Democrats to account when they blow it; but don't just vaguely suggest that they all do it in order to avoid the ire of the crazy conservatives.\" Teresa Dickinson, Napa, Calif.: \"I'm an independent and thus try to watch both sides, and I'm glad Ken Rudin pointed out that both sides do this. I've noticed that liberals or Democrats can be just as raunchy in regards to what any Republican will say. Good for Ken Rudin for reporting objectively. Thank you. I will keep listening to NPR.\" And here are some non-Gestapo related e-mails: Q: Regarding your column about the effect of Ralph Nader's votes on Al Gore in Florida, don't forget, Nader hurt Gore more in New Hampshire. Had Gore won that state, of course, there is no Florida to focus on. \u2014 Scott MacKay, Rhode Island Public Radio, Providence, R.I. A: That is correct. George W. Bush beat Gore by 7,211 votes in New Hampshire, a state where Nader received more than 22,000 votes. Of course, you can also try and calculate what effect Pat Buchanan, running as the Reform Party nominee, had on the race. Gore won Iowa by 4,144 votes; Buchanan got 5,731 votes in the state. Did Bush lose Iowa because of Buchanan? There are more examples. Gore's margin was just 366 in New Mexico, where Buchanan took 1,392 votes. Gore also won Oregon (by 6,765 votes) and Wisconsin (by 5,708) by a smaller amount than what Buchanan received. Perhaps, if Gore had won the election, Republicans would have blamed Buchanan for Bush's defeat. Q: Your Pete McCloskey button [see \"This Day In Campaign History,\" Political Junkie, July 9, 2012] took me back. My first presidential campaign (at age 20) was for George McGovern in New Mexico in 1972, where I ran Dona Ana County for him (as a volunteer--ah, the good old days...). But the reason I mention it is that McCloskey won his only delegate from New Mexico Republicans, winning just enough votes to qualify for the one. The Nixon-controlled GOP, however, would not let an actual McCloskey delegate go in that slot--so a supporter of Nixon went instead. \u2014 Steve Cobble, Washington, D.C. A: McCloskey, who had already dropped out of race, received six percent of the vote in the 1972 New Mexico primary, enough for a delegate. McCloskey hoped that delegate would give a nominating speech for him at the convention but, as you said, Republican officials wouldn't let that happen. Let the record also show that Keith Judd, a convicted felon currently incarcerated in Texas, won 41 percent of the vote against President Obama in the West Virginia primary this year. And John Wolfe, a Tennessee attorney, took 40 percent against Obama in Arkansas. But neither Judd nor Wolfe will have any delegates in Charlotte. Q: I love the \"Ken Rudin for President button\" in this week's ScuttleButton contest. I'd vote for him, but he would probably establish Rudin-care, which would require everyone to laugh at his jokes or pay a tax. I mean, a penalty. Or maybe it is a tax. I'll get back to you. \u2014 Ray Betzner, Philadelphia, Pa. A: Lots of people wanted to know the story behind this button. In October 2010, I gave a speech in Tallahassee, Fla., before the Tiger Bay Club, the great non-partisan political forum. John Clark, an officer of the club, had a slew of buttons appear on every table \u2014 including this one. Click here for an image of some of the buttons.

Butterfield's bombshell comes in a response to a question by Minority Counsel Fred Thompson. The existence of the tapes could well answer the question raised in earlier testimony by former White House Counsel John Dean as to whether or not President Nixon was aware of the efforts to coverup the Watergate scandal (July 16, 1973).

If this were truly a widespread sentiment, wouldn't there be more people calling for a third party candidate?\n                \n                    \n                    Ken Rudin collection\n                    \n                \nhide caption But there is no indication at all, certainly not in this year's presidential race, of any signs of voter independence from the two major parties. Of course, it's rare for any independent or third-party candidate to make a difference in the battle for the White House. You have to have a recognizable name, a ton of money, and a cause worth campaigning on. And even then it may not be enough. Ross Perot had all three when he ran as an independent in 1992. He also attracted some 19.7 million votes, more than any non-major party candidate in history. And how close did he get to attaining the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency? He was 270 votes shy. (For a brief history of recent third-party presidential candidates, see \"Mad at the Democrats and Republicans? Don't Count On a Third Party,\" Political Junkie, Sept. 19, 2011.) This year a different approach was made. This time, an organization provided not a candidate but a mechanism for one to get on the ballot. Americans Elect raised millions of dollars and already attained ballot access in 28 states (on its way to all 50 states plus D.C.), asking supporters to draft a candidate online. The problem? No \"big name\" came forward to run, and the leading online candidate, GOP dropout Buddy Roemer, failed to get the 10,000 signatures that Americans Elect demanded. The organization and its effort folded in May. While many third parties appear on the November ballots, some states have tougher ballot access laws than others. (Check out Richard Winger's Ballot Access News for the most reliable updates.) One party that gets a lot of headlines and ink in the months leading up to the election has historically been the Libertarians, as they regularly appear on every state ballot. This year, their nominee is Gary Johnson, the former Republican governor of New Mexico who tried but failed to make a difference in this year's GOP contest. Perhaps it's more of a Democratic fantasy than anything else, but some insist that Johnson could pull enough votes in some states to harm Mitt Romney's chances. The Libertarians are considered the nation's most viable third party, but they have surpassed 1 percent of the vote only once in 10 tries for the presidency.\n                \n                    \n                    Ken Rudin collection\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Libertarians are considered the nation's most viable third party, but they have surpassed 1 percent of the vote only once in 10 tries for the presidency. The truth is, Libertarian presidential candidates \u2014 going back to their first bid, in 1972 \u2014 have yet to make a difference. Here's how they've done: 1972 \u2014 John Hospers (director of USC school of philosophy) total votes nationwide: 3,673 (less than 0.1 percent) received one electoral vote when a \"faithless\" Nixon elector from Va., Roger MacBride, voted instead for Hospers 1976 \u2014 Roger MacBride (see 1972) total votes nationwide: 173,011 (0.2 percent) 1980 \u2014 Ed Clark (California attorney) total votes nationwide: 921,299 (1.1 percent) first time party was on all 50 state ballots best showing, percentage: 11.7 in Alaska 1984 \u2014 David Bergland (California attorney) total votes nationwide: 228,314 (0.2 percent) 1988 \u2014 Ron Paul (former GOP congressman, Texas) total votes nationwide: 432,179 (0.5 percent) 1992 \u2014 Andre Marrou (former Alaska state rep.) total votes nationwide: 291,627 (0.3 percent) 1996 \u2014 Harry Browne (Tennessee author) total votes nationwide: 485,798 (0.5 percent) 2000 \u2014 Harry Browne total votes nationwide: 384,429 (0.4 percent) 2004 \u2014 Michael Badnarik (Texas constitution teacher) total votes nationwide: 397,265 (0.3 percent) 2008 \u2014 Bob Barr (former GOP congressman, Georgia) total votes nationwide: 523,686 (0.4 percent) Primary colors.  Last week's Political Junkie column focused on the June 26 primary battles facing veteran House member Charlie Rangel (D-N.Y.) and veteran Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). Hatch survived to fight another day. The verdict is still out on Rangel, who as of this writing leads his main challenger, state Sen. Adriano Espaillat, by just 802 votes, with some 2,000 absentees yet to be counted. This one may not be over yet. But one result I never saw coming was the defeat of Rep. John Sullivan in Oklahoma's 1st CD GOP primary. Sullivan's troubles in public life pre-date his tenure in Congress, which began in January 2002 when he won a special election to succeed Steve Largent, who resigned to focus on his gubernatorial bid. Voters knew of Sullivan's history of drinking-related arrests even before he upset then-Oklahoma First Lady Cathy Keating in the primary. But his drinking continued while in office, and in June of 2009 he took a month-long leave of absence to check himself into the Betty Ford Clinic. His victorious primary opponent this year, Navy Reserve pilot and political newcomer Jim Bridenstine, focused not on his addictions but his attendance record, saying Sullivan missed too many votes. With the backing of Tea Party supporters, he also charged Sullivan as insufficiently conservative. By most accounts, Sullivan failed to take Bridenstine seriously until late in the campaign, and then he responded with nonstop negative attacks. Sullivan is the eighth House member defeated in this year's primaries but only the fourth who lost to a non-incumbent opponent. The other seven (names in italics indicate defeated in Member vs. Member primary): Jason Altmire (D-PA), Tim Holden (D-PA), Dennis Kucinich (D-OH), Don Manzullo (R-IL), Silvestre Reyes (D-TX), Steve Rothman (D-NJ) and Jean Schmidt (R-OH). Another House member, Bob Turner (R-NY), whose district was obliterated, ran and lost in his party's Senate primary. The contempt vote on Holder. Last Thursday (June 28), the House voted to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt for failing to share requested information relating to the botched \"Fast and Furious\" operation. The action came just hours after President Obama invoked executive privilege to block the House's request for internal Justice Department documents. The vote was 255-67. Many Democrats, accusing the GOP of a \"partisan witch hunt,\" walked out of the House chamber without casting a vote. But 17 Democrats did vote with the Republicans to hold the AG in contempt: Jason Altmire (PA), John Barrow (GA), Dan Boren (OK), Leonard Boswell (IA), Ben Chandler (KY), Mark Critz (PA), Joe Donnelly (IN), Kathy Hochul (NY), Ron Kind (WI), Larry Kissell (NC), Jim Matheson (UT), Mike McIntyre (NC), Bill Owens (NY), Collin Peterson (MN), Nick Rahall (WV), Dennis Ross (AR) and Tim Walz (MN). Some of the names on this list were not a surprise. A few are retiring. Altmire lost his bid for another term in the primary (losing to Critz, in fact). But I was surprised by a few of these votes, notably those of Boswell, Critz, Donnelly, Hochul and Owens. One reason may be that the National Rifle Association had announced that this vote would be a key one on the NRA scorecard. Two Republicans, Steve LaTourette of Ohio and Scott Rigell of Virginia, voted against the measure. Political Updates. I post periodic political updates during the week on Twitter. You can follow me at @kenrudin. Here are some questions from the mailbox. Q: Throughout the primary process I've seen the option for \"uncommitted\" or \"no preference\" on ballots. If these options were to get the most votes in state, what would happen? Has uncommitted/no preference ever won anywhere? \u2014 Joshua Holman, Havelock, N.C. A: When people talk about the sudden rise of Jimmy Carter in 1976, they often refer to his victory in the Iowa caucuses. The thing is, he didn't quite win. While Carter finished better than any other Democratic candidate that year, the precinct caucuses were in fact won by an \"Uncommitted\" slate, which got 37 percent of the vote. Carter received 28 percent, followed by Birch Bayh with 13 percent and Fred Harris with 10 percent. But all that meant was that an uncommitted slate went into the next round, the county conventions, and those uncommitted folks had the option of staying uncommitted or aligning with a particular candidate. By the time the process reaches the state convention, most of the candidates who were active during the first go-round are long gone. Similarly, \"Uncommitted\" also won the 1972 Iowa precinct caucuses, finishing slightly better than frontrunner Ed Muskie; both slates ended up with about 36 percent. George McGovern was well behind, with 23 percent, but his showing was seen as a big boost in his unlikely path to the nomination. President Bill Clinton essentially ran unopposed in the 1996 Democratic primaries, but for reasons I can't recall, neither he, nor anyone else, was on the Michigan primary ballot that year, which was won by \"Uncommitted.\" But Clinton won all 92 delegates at the convention. Nevada has a \"none of the names shown\" option on its ballots, and sometimes that choice has finished strong. In 1980, its Democratic primary was won by President Jimmy Carter with 37.6 percent. It was followed by \"none of the names shown\" with 33.6 percent, and then Edward Kennedy with 28.8 percent. At the Democratic convention that year, Nevada's 12 delegates were roughly divided as eight for Carter and four for Kennedy. But it's one thing for \"Uncommitted\" or \"None of the above\" to do well in primaries and caucuses. It would be far more interesting if that option performed well (or even won) in November. But that hasn't happened yet. Q: Do you know where I can find the roll call vote on the censure of Joe McCarthy? Different sources have given different results. One had it 67-20, another at 67-22. One had Milliken of Colo. voting yes, while another rightwing list of the 22 \"heroes\" who voted no included him as one, along with Cordon of Ore. But another source said Cordon didn't vote. \u2014 Jeff Rundell, Seattle, Wash. A: On Dec. 2, 1954, the Senate, in a lame duck session, voted to \"condemn\" McCarthy, the aggressive, often reckless, anti-Communist warrior from Wisconsin, by a vote of 67-22. The day before, the Senate voted 67-20 to approve the language of the Subcommittee on Privileges and Elections that McCarthy abused the committee's staff. There was also another vote, by a 64-24 margin, focused on a second count. But the final vote on McCarthy by the Senate \u2014 which decided to replace the word censure with \"condemn\" \u2014 was 67-22. Both Milliken and Cordon stuck with McCarthy. The GOP vote was split, 22-22. Here were the 22 Republicans who supported McCarthy and voted no: Goldwater (Ariz.), Knowland (Calif.), Kuchel (Calif.), Milliken (Colo.), Purtell (Conn.), Dworshak (Idaho), Welker (Idaho), Dirksen (Ill.), Jenner (Ind.), Hickenlooper (Iowa), Schoeppel (Kansas), Butler (Md.), Hruska (Neb.), Malone (Nev.), Brown (Nev.), Bridges (N.H.), Langer (N.D.), Young (N.D.), Cordon (Ore.), Martin (Pa.), Mundt (S.D.) and Barrett (Wyo.). Capehart (Ind.) and Bricker (Ohio) didn't vote but they announced in advance they were against the resolution. And here are the 22 Republicans who voted yes: Bush (Conn.), Williams (Del.), Carlson (Kansas), Cooper (Ky.), Payne (Me.), Smith (Me.), Beall (Md.), Saltonstall (Mass.), Ferguson (Mich.), Potter (Mich.), Thye (Minn.), Abel (Neb.), Cotton (N.H.), Hendrickson (N.J.), Smith (N.J.), Ives (N.Y.), Duff (Pa.), Case (S.D.), Bennett (Utah), Watkins (Utah), Aiken (Vt.) and Flanders (Vt.). McCarthy voted present. Alexander Wiley, his Wisconsin colleague, didn't announce a vote. Every Democrat voted yes, or announced in favor of the resolution, except for John Kennedy of Mass. Kennedy, whose father was a strong McCarthy supporter, underwent spinal surgery on Oct. 21 and did not announce a position on the resolution. Q: I recently listened to your May 18th episode of the podcast and was amused that you celebrated your 300th with a cake in the shape of Arizona, and specifically referenced Yuma. Certainly Arizona is in the news often enough for the wrong reasons \u2013 but I was wondering if there was something specific that inspired your Arizona shaped cake! \u2014 Marilee Malmberg, Grassroots Director, Arizona Democratic Party, Phoenix, Ariz. A: For (far too) many of our podcast episodes, whenever my partner in crime Ron Elving would mention Arizona, or we would be talking about Arizona, I would invariably reply with, \"That's great, because I have a sense of Yuma.\" Yes, I know, I know, the joke is not funny, but that never kept me from saying it ... over and over and over. That explains the cake. And now you know everything. Q: I have a button that says \"I like Judge Sutton and rice pudding too!\" Can you tell me the history/story? \u2014 Allen Johnston, Franklin, Tenn. A: This question actually came up once before, believe it or not, back in the Nov. 1, 2005 Political Junkie column. (I'm not kidding: click here to read it.) As it so happens, the question arrived back when Harriet Miers was a potential choice of President Bush for the Supreme Court. My answer back then was so clever that it's worth repeating: A: To the best of my understanding, Miers left no paper trail about her views on rice pudding. Maybe that's why conservatives \"deserted\" her. I'm not pudding you on; I really want to know the story behind the Judge Sutton button, as well as these other unidentified items.  (Actually, I've since learned the \"Vote the American Way/Berry Whipple Ringle\" etc. is from Jersey City, N.J., in the 1950s. Bernard Berry was the mayor, and Lawrence Whipple and Joshua Ringle were city commissioners.)\n                \n                    \n                    Ken Rudin collection\n                    \n                \nhide caption Well, maybe not as funny as I thought. In any event, I'm thinking of illustrating some unknown campaign buttons as a kind-of-regular feature in Political Junkie. I'll put 'em up, you tell me who they are. And if you can identify any of them, you get your name in this column. (It sure beats winning a non-existent t-shirt.) Disappearing act. Well, there were these, um, medical issues last week that kept me away from both the Political Junkie segment on TOTN (from Aspen, no less) and the It's All Politics podcast. It was not the greatest of weeks. But there was a Political Junkie column (focusing on Charlie Rangel's primary in N.Y.) and a ScuttleButton puzzle as well.

Johnson, in a nationally televised address, called on all Americans \"to join in this effort to bring justice and hope to all our people \u2014 and to bring peace to our land.\" In the House, 153 Democrats and 136 Republicans vote to approve the bill; 35 Republicans and 91 Democrats are opposed. Meanwhile, the ceremony in the East Room of the White House is tempered by the fact that three civil rights workers who had gone missing near Philadelphia, Miss., since June 21, have still not been found (July 2, 1964). On Aug, 4, the bodies of the three workers \u2014 Michael Schwerner, Andrew Goodman and James Chaney \u2014 are found in a shallow grave six miles southwest of Philadelphia. Got a question?

The justices later ruled 5-4 in the case of Bush v. Gore, effectively deciding the outcome of the presidential race. You may already have made a mental note as to where you were when you heard the Supreme Court had upheld the health care law known as Obamacare. It's one of those moments that become touchstones of our memory, personal connections to the history we have witnessed in our lifetimes. The Supreme Court may not be the source of such moments very often, but when its rulings reach this level of our awareness, they alter the course of our lives. Of course, no one knows yet just how history will deal with this particular law. Will Thursday's decision fashioned by Chief Justice John Roberts lead the public to re-examine a law that polls have shown to be a loser? Or will a voter revolt like that of 2010 doom President Obama's re-election chances? And how will the imprimatur of the high court affect acceptance of the various provisions? Such uncertainty, too, is typical of legal history. The effects of a landmark decision may only be revealed over time. But that does not make the decision itself any less momentous. In recent decades, there have only been a handful of cases of comparable impact at the time of their announcement. -- The Citizens United case of 2010 that allowed independent political expenditures without limits by labor unions and corporations reversed assumptions about campaign spending that had been features of federal and state laws for a century. -- In 2003, in Lawrence v. Texas, the court by a vote of 6-3 reversed generations of legal and social presumption in decriminalizing certain forms of sexual activity \u2014 in essence lifting the legal ban on homosexuality. For those whose lives were dramatically changed, these decisions, too, belong in the category of momentous. -- Perhaps the most reverberating thunderclap from the high court in our time came in December 2000, when the court ruled 5-4 in the case of Bush v. Gore, in effect ending five weeks of legal and political wrangling over the presidential election of that November. The case was arresting not only because the court was choosing the nation's chief executive, but also because it was superseding the internal process of a single state to do so. Initially, state officials in Florida had awarded that state's crucial delegates to George W. Bush, making him president-elect on election night. But only a few hundred votes separated the candidates statewide, and many votes were in dispute. An effort at a partial recount had found traction in the Florida courts \u2014 all the way to the Florida Supreme Court. The 5-4 ruling from the Supremes put a stop to that. Bush became the first president since the 1800s to enter the White House despite losing the national popular vote. -- There were several stunning decisions by the Supreme Court during the presidency of Richard M. Nixon, the last of which led to his resignation. In the spring of 1974, Nixon was fighting impeachment and a criminal investigation. Both stemmed from the White House cover-up in the Watergate affair (a botched burglary at the Democratic Party headquarters by operatives of the president's 1972 campaign). A special prosecutor was seeking access to tape recordings from the White House that were relevant to the case. The administration tried to protect these by arguing that the president had \"an absolute, unqualified privilege of immunity from judicial process under all circumstances.\" That claim reached the Supreme Court, which had just taken a turn to the right with the arrival of conservatives appointed by Nixon himself. In a decision that shocked many, the court voted 8-0 to order the tapes released. With impeachment looming and a criminal indictment quite possible, Nixon resigned 15 days later. -- In the year before the Watergate blockbuster, the high court issued the one ruling that still brings thousands of protesters to Capitol Hill each year to mark its anniversary. The case was Roe v. Wade, and it arose from a single woman's lawsuit in Texas growing to represent the right of all women nationally to have an abortion in the first three months of a pregnancy. Several states had already liberalized their abortion laws at the time, but most still prohibited the practice, and in Texas it was a felony to perform an abortion (unless it was done to save the life of the mother). Given the state of the law at the time, it was beyond many Americans' comprehension when they woke up in January 1973 to learn the court had ruled the Texas law unconstitutional. By implication, abortions were legal in all 50 states. The court ruling was 7-2, and just as stunning, the decision was rooted in a \"right to privacy\" the justices had found implicit in the Constitution itself. This became the ultimate example of \"judicial activism\" for a generation of social conservatives. -- The 1966 ruling in Miranda v. Arizona was a head-spinner for many Americans, and the phrase \"Miranda rights\" remains a staple of TV police procedural programs to this day. In this case, the court led by Chief Justice Earl Warren solidified the reputation for defending criminal rights it had established in Gideon v. Wainwright three years earlier. Gideon put real teeth in a defendant's right to legal counsel, and Miranda required that defendants be advised of their full legal rights before being questioned by police. -- Even today, one hears references to the Supreme Court banning school prayer in language that suggests it happened quite recently. In fact, the most famous school prayer cases came a half-century ago, when in Engel v. Vitale (1962) and Abington School District v. Schempp (1963) the high court established a prohibition on state-sponsored prayer in the schools. There have been several modifications since, especially as pertains to school-sponsored activities outside the classroom. But the central element of these cases, the ban on state involvement in the promulgation of a given religious outlook, has shown remarkable staying power despite frequent assaults from religious activists and other opponents. -- The 1962 ruling in Baker v. Carr was hardly the subject of dinner table conversation in the average American household, but it was about to alter the average American legislature and change its decision-making radically. Until this case, the typical state legislature apportioned seats in its lower chamber according to population (each district with roughly the same number of constituents) but allocated Senate seats according to counties (or another comparable source of geographical line-drawing). Under one such scheme, California apportioned one Senate seat to a remote mountain county with a few thousand residents and one to Los Angeles County \u2014 home to a few million. The inequity had been controversial for generations, but defenders could always say the states were emulating the example of the U.S. Senate, where each state had always had two seats \u2014 regardless of population. With this case, the court put an end to that analogy and set the stage for the \"one man, one vote\" principle enunciated the following year in Gray v. Sanders. -- But the granddaddy of all Supreme Court shockers in our era was the case that set the stage for the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, with immeasurable results for the society as a whole. The case was Brown v . Board of Education, which emerged from a lawsuit against the schools of Topeka, Kan., in 1954. The court reversed a precedent more than a half-century old that had declared \"separate but equal\" schools acceptable under the \"equal protection\" clause of the Constitution. Brown held that segregated schools were inherently unequal, as indeed generations of practical experience had proven. Beyond schools, the case provided the impetus for gradual desegregation of other public accommodations over the decades to come. Ron Elving is NPR's senior Washington editor.",

The landmark health care decision that came later ended just one chapter in the nation's long partisan war.\n                \n                    \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption William Temple of Brunswick, Ga., waits for the Supreme Court's decision early Thursday. The landmark health care decision that came later ended just one chapter in the nation's long partisan war. In the wake of the Supreme Court's landmark decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act, one of the burning questions is how will the decision play out politically? President Obama even acknowledged the inevitability of the political maneuvering and handicapping in his comments from the White House soon after the high court delivered its decision. But he did stress that politics wasn't what really mattered in the end. \"I know there will be a lot of discussion today about the politics of all this, about who won and who lost. That's how these things tend to be viewed here in Washington. But that discussion completely misses the point. Whatever the politics, today's decision was a victory for people all over this country whose lives will be more secure because of this law and the Supreme Court's decision to uphold it.\" But, of course, politics do matter, especially because the decision came as it did, amid a general election campaign in our supercharged partisan era. Few could be sure of which side, Democratic or Republican, would ultimately gain the the most advantage from the decision. It was clear, though, that the Supreme Court had shifted the terms of the debate somewhat. Chief Justice John Roberts seemed to close one door on the law's conservative critics, who've argued that the law is unconstitutional. But he opened another for them when he said the individual mandate should be considered a tax. By doing so, he assured that the law would now be open to a new anti-tax line of attack, fueling the desire on the part of may Republicans to repeal the law. In that way, the decision contained something of a poison pill for Democrats. If there was any doubts that the thrust of the Republican argument against the law had changed, a look at the website of Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform would clear up all confusion. Taxpayers are reminded that the President's healthcare law is one of the largest tax increases in American history. Obamacare contains 20 new or higher taxes on American families and small businesses. Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, like many Republicans Thursday, seized on the tax point: \"So, the government could decide that we're going to tax you if you don't eat broccoli on Tuesday, Apparently, that's now constitutional. But I don't that's a wise law... \" \"... I think the real outcome of today's decision is to strengthen our resolve to make sure that, in fact, this law is repealed.\" Boehner's comments reflected the renewed energy that the court's decision seemed to breathe into conservatives who, as Byron York of the conservative Washington Examiner wrote, were mostly confident that the court would, at the very least, overturn the individual mandate. That energy reportedly resulted in Mitt Romney, the all-but-official Republican presidential nominee raising more than $2 million in the 6 1/2 hours following the decision. Romney undoubtedly helped himself raise that money by promising in his public remarks after the decision to make repealing the health care law one of the first things if he becomes president. ROMNEY: \"This is the time of choice for the American people. Our mission is clear: If we want to get rid of Obamacare, we're going to have to replace President Obama. My mission is to make sure we do exactly that.\" While some pundits thought the decision would have the greatest political benefits for Obama and congressional Democrats, Stuart Rothenberg, one of Washington's better known political analysts, wasn't so sure. He wrote: \"...The way the court \u2013 or, Justice Roberts \u2013 justified upholding the law, by calling it a tax, has a substantial downside for the White House and for Democrats who supported it. Had the Court thrown out the law, Republicans would have had to scramble to figure out what to offer as a replacement. Democrats could have raised the specter of people being denied insurance for pre-existing conditions and young adults being thrown off their parents' policies. \"Now, Republicans can attack the law not only for being \"big government\" but for being a huge tax during in weak economy, adding burdens to middle class taxpayers and slowing economic growth. And the GOP doesn't have to come up with a detailed plan to \"replace\" Obama's health care plan.\" But even if Republicans were to ride the Obamacare-is-a-big-new-tax horse all the way to the White House and control of the Senate, they still would encounter political challenges to delivering on their promise of \"repeal and replace\" to their supporters. As Sarah Binder, an expert on Congress and political scientist at George Washington University, points out in a post on The Monkey Cage blog, while the vow to \"repeal and replace\" the health care law is potentially great for fundraising and exciting the Republican grassroots, it's another thing entirely to actually repeal the law. She writes: \"... To do real damage to the future of health care reform, Republicans need to hold the House, and win the White House and (presumably) with it, the Senate. Even then, however, they will find it hard to repeal and replace, assuming that Senate Democrats exploit an effective filibuster against any such effort to deny the GOP the 60 votes they would need to succeed via the regular legislative process. My hunch is that today's decision will be critical in bolstering Senate Democrats' backbone to defend the law, even if they were to find themselves in the minority. Because most of the law's popular insurance coverage protections kick in only in 2014, the window of opportunity for the GOP will be widest in 2013. After 2013, the GOP's road to repeal would get even steeper.\" If Democrats had an effective response to the charge that the health care law represented a big new tax, they were mostly keeping it under wraps Thursday. Not that they weren't obviously overjoyed to be validated by the Supreme Court. Even as Republicans tried to paint them as tax-and-spend liberals, Democrats framed the Republican reaction to the decision as another example of Republicans siding with corporate interests like insurance companies over people. And they framed their own defense of the law in popular terms likely to be heard from here to Election Day. The House minority leader, Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, trotted out a few during a press conference after the ruling. \"We're here to act on our beliefs. A belief that many of us had is that health care is a right, not a privilege in our country. We believe that a health care bill needed to be passed so that families would not be pauperized because they had a diagnosis or an accident that heaped health care costs on them.\" How this will all play out politically is no more knowable than the Supreme Court decision was to outsiders before Thursday. One of the greatest unknowns right now is if the high court's ruling will significantly change the public's opinion of the health care law. Until Thursday, numerous polls indicated a majority of voters opposed the law. The court's seal of approval could help change that sentiment and if so the political calculus around the still controversial legislation. But all that remains to be seen.",

It was Lugar's 31st race, and his last as a senator after he lost a primary challenge this month. The partisan divisions on Capitol Hill are numerous \u2014 but Wednesday morning, about two-dozen members of Congress did something entirely nonpartisan. They ran in a 3-mile race for charity, along with their staffs and teams from the executive and judicial branches and the media (including NPR). The ACLI Capital Challenge is an annual tradition that dates back to 1981, and one senator has run the race every time: Dick Lugar, R-Ind. But Wednesday's race was also his last. When the now 80-year-old Lugar first started running in the Capital Challenge, his goal was to be the fastest senator. That was 31 years ago. \"In more recent years, we've had more modest goals \u2014 like finishing the race,\" the six-term senator said with a chuckle a few minutes before the start. Earlier this month, Lugar lost in a tough primary fight, meaning this would be his last time lining up at the start. \"Just looking forward to a good race, lots of enthusiasm, and try to keep the eye on the ball here,\" Lugar said, sounding as much like an athlete as a senator.

John Thune, R-S.D. \"I mean, I can't believe this guy's been doing this for 31 years. We're going to miss him next year, but obviously he's had a great run here.\" Thune won the medal for fastest senator for the third time in a row, finishing in 18:57. \"It's a bittersweet time for Sen. Lugar,\" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, just moments after crossing the finish line himself. \"This is his last 5K out here for a good cause.\" Lugar was one of four congressional runners this year either retiring or forced out by a primary loss.

He had white hair, an orange shirt and a giant grin. \"Making his way to the finish line as he has every year since 1981,\" an announcer shouted from a loudspeaker. \"A big warm Washington round of applause for Sen. Richard G. Lugar!\" To mark the occasion, the race organizers held up a finisher's tape for the senator to run through one last time. \"Obviously, I would have liked to look forward to a 32nd, 33rd, 34th, but, then again, I have been so fortunate to have these 31 great years in good health and spirits,\" Lugar said, having caught his breath and still grinning from ear to ear. The race director, Jeff Darman, said a lot of people asked him if the senator would show up at the race after losing his primary. \"Of course,\" Darman said. \"There's just never any question.\"",

To White House outsiders and maybe even more than a few insiders, the life of a first lady would seem to be a fairly anxiety-inducing one. After all, there is no greater fish bowl than 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. So NPR's Michel Martin, host of Tell Me More, asked First Lady Michelle Obama during an interview scheduled to air Tuesday how she deals with the pressures of being both the president's wife and the mother of school-age children. Mrs. Obama, however, didn't accept Michel's premise: \"I have to disagree. I don't have the stressful job. He does. I have the privilege of working on the issues that I choose and the issues that I feel most passionate about. \"There are definitely pressures that come from being in the spotlight, but they are far overshadowed by the amount of great things I've been able to do and the impact I've been able to have. And to be able to do it in the warmth of the White House and to do it around people who do care about my kids and a country that has been respectful of my children and their privacy, it has been less stressful than I would have imagined for me. \"The president's job is a lot harder. That's why I'm working hard to get him re-elected. Because he's handled himself with a level of grace and poise that not many people could given the challenges he's faced. \"Our girls are good and I will keep working putting them first as I think any family would, any mother would their children. I don't think I'm any different in that respect. I think in the end I want to make sure my kids come out of this thing on the other end in one piece. But I also know that's how the rest of the country feels as well. For that, I am grateful.\" Among the issues Mrs. Obama has focused on during her time in the White House, perhaps best known is her \"Let's Move\" initiative against childhood obesity. But the challenges facing military members returning from wars abroad, and their families, have absorbed much of her time as first lady as well. Mrs. Obama was on tour last week with Jill Biden, wife of Vice President Biden and a Blue Star Mother with a son who is a military reservist, to promote an initiative called Joining Forces aimed at connecting veterans and spouses to jobs. Obama told Michel that she's encouraged by the better-than-expected progress made so far. \"We knew we'd get a good response because ... there is no American who isn't grateful for what these men and women do, and their families. \"But we've just been overwhelmed by the response. Employment has been a source of excitement because we've called upon the private sector to step up and find ways to hire military spouses and veterans. \"And they have just gone above and beyond. The president asked for a commitment of, I think, 100,000 jobs for veterans and military spouses over the next couple of years and we announced during the tour last week that we have gotten more than 60k jobs and we're well on our way to just crashing that goal out of the water. Asked why the jobless rate for returning military members has been significantly higher than for the overall work force \u2014 12 percent versus 8.2 percent, Mrs. Obama said: \"I think employers need help in understanding how to translate a military career, right. Let's take the average spouse. You show up in an employers' office and its shown that you've changed jobs every two years. Well, to many employers that could be a red flag but the truth is you've made those moves because your serving your country. And each time you've found a career and you've been able to provide for your family and you continue to volunteer and on and on and on. \"So there are many ways a military person's career can be translated and the civilian private sector doesn't know how to make that connection.\" In another part of their conversation, Michel asked the first lady about a couple of stories that have dominated news coverage recently, the Trayvon Martin case and Hilary Rosen-Ann Romney dust-up. Was there something to learn from the shooting of the Florida teenager and all that has followed? Was there a way to talk about the controversial killing in a way that could be healing? Michel asked. MRS. OBAMA: \"... Talking is good. Conversations have to be forever. They can't come in spits (sic) and starts when there's an incident. I think we all need, as a country, to continue to talk about these issues. To understand our communities and the challenges that we face, which are different and unique, depending upon where you live. It's all about continuing to get to know ourselves in a very diverse and complicated country that is America. It is a wonderful place to live. But because it is so diverse, our challenges are complex. As for the Rosen-Romney contretemps, she said: \"Let me tell you, the one thing I believe is families are off-limits. My husband said it, and he was clear on that, and I totally agree with him. Also, my comment that I tweeted was, we need to respect all women in whatever positions and roles that they play in this society. That's where we need to be. And I think that's all I have to say on the issue.\"",

            "article_content": "Puerto Ricans are American citizens who do not vote in U.S. presidential general elections, but they do participate in Republican and Democratic nominating contests. Sunday, Puerto Rico holds a GOP primary. Both Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney visited the island this week. From San Juan, NPR's David Welna reports.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Rachel Martin. The Republican presidential race could take yet another twist today in the U.S. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The four million people who live there are U.S. citizens and in today's primary, they'll help determine the next Republican nominee for the White House. The big issue in that contest is statehood, and that'll be on the ballot there in November. But the presidential race won't be because, first, Puerto Rico would have to become a state. NPR's David Welna has this report from San Juan, Puerto Rico. DAVID WELNA, BYLINE: Neither Newt Gingrich nor Ron Paul bothered to campaign in Puerto Rico. So today's primary is essentially a two-man race between Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney. Each of them did spend a couple of days here this past week. Santorum arrived first and he immediately got himself into some very hot water, talking with reporters about the aspirations here for statehood. Santorum had previously endorsed Puerto Rico becoming the 51st state and set no preconditions for it to do so. But in an interview here with a newspaper El Vocero, Santorum conditioned statehood for Puerto Ricans on one big prerequisite. RICK SANTORUM: They'd have to speak English. That would be a requirement. It's a requirement that we put on other states. It's a condition for entering the Union and participating as a state in the United States. ORESTES RAMOS: He's absolutely wrong. He doesn't know what he's talking about. WELNA: That's Republican attorney Orestes Ramos. Santorum, he says, seemed to invent a law that did not exist to justify demanding that Puerto Ricans learn English. Although Ramos is listed on today's ballot as a delegate for Santorum, he says there is now no way he'd cast a vote for Santorum. RAMOS: You know, one felt that the problem is that the guy may be prejudiced. And we don't want a guy in the White House prejudiced against us. WELNA: Santorum left Puerto Rico on Thursday with his candidacy here in tatters. It was just the time for Mitt Romney's arrival on Friday, when he showed up for a big rally organized by GOP leaders outside the capitol building. (SOUNDBITE OF A SONG) WELNA: It was quite likely the liveliest Romney rally ever. Many in the crowd were still seething about Santorum's insistence on everyone here speaking English if they want statehood. Denise Longo is a 44-year-old lawyer. She told me her fellow Puerto Ricans have gotten a bum rap. DENISE LONGO: They are actually American citizens by act of Congress. So, at a certain level, you can say that their citizenship was imposed on them. And the language that they speak at their home doesn't make them any less American than somebody that was born in Ohio. WELNA: And each speaker at the rally seized on the hot new issue of speaking English to pump up support for Romney. Here's the island's Republican governor, Luis Fortuno. GOVERNOR LUIS FORTUNO: He understands that English is the language of opportunity, but that Spanish is a cherished part of our heritage. WELNA: Romney was then introduced to the crowd in Spanish. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Foreign language spoken) WELNA: Romney, for his part, stuck entirely to the language he knows best. MITT ROMNEY: What a privilege it is to be here. What a beautiful island. What a beautiful place. What a wonderful culture you enjoy. What a wonderful people you are, citizens of this great land. Citizens of America. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) WELNA: But Romney stopped short of calling for statehood. That worried some Republicans here. So yesterday, at another campaign stop in the prosperous suburb of Bayamon, Romney appeared to try to set the record straight. ROMNEY: It was Ronald Reagan, who very famously in our party, said that it was important for people of Puerto Rico to have a choice to become a state. And if... (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) ROMNEY: ...if the people of Puerto Rico choose that path, I will be happy to help lead that effort in Washington. I respect the wonderful people of this extraordinary community. WELNA: Romney hopes to get more than half the votes today and thus win all 20 delegates up for grabs.

So, I got to thinking: What would happen if I invited a bunch of interested foreigners \u2014 all of them Chinese citizens \u2014 to watch the presidential debate from my Shanghai office? We made invites over the Internet for the second debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney. We bought wine and beer \u2014 which practically nobody drank \u2014 set up computers and monitors, and streamed the debate in English (as I couldn't find a Chinese version) for an audience of eight white-collar professionals, ages 24 to 40. Because the debate took place Wednesday morning our time, when everyone was at work, we watched a replay of the debate that night. Like many Chinese, more than half the folks favored President Obama. Living in a nation with a giant income gap and a pronounced resentment of a privileged, connected elite, the Chinese related to Obama's populist tone. They also liked his less confrontational stance toward their country. While some admired Romney's business smarts, they thought his criticism of China was primarily driven by political calculus and overblown. For instance, when Romney vowed to label China a currency manipulator, Alex Shi, who works in manufacturing, thought the Republican was just blame-shifting. \"Do not try to find any scapegoat,\" said Alex, who spoke great English. \"Just try to put your own fiscal house in places. Try to look into your own problems.\" When Romney cited China for taking American manufacturing jobs and pledged to create a business-friendly environment that would encourage companies to bring jobs back to the U.S., the Chinese weren't buying. Stella Xie, who works for a Chinese economics magazine, said Romney seemed to be blaming China for a fact of globalization: low-wage, low-skilled jobs tend to migrate to low-wage countries. \"In the past, the U.S. had these issues over manufacturing jobs with Japan and with other Asian countries,\" said Xie. \"They have an argument with China at this point. Maybe 10 years later, they will have these issues with Vietnam and Cambodia as these jobs shift out from China to other countries.\" Some pressing U.S. domestic issues resonated with the audience here. When Romney lamented that 23 million Americans are struggling to find a job, the Chinese could relate. Although China has seen staggering growth over the past three decades, unemployment is a big problem here, in part because the ranks of educated workers are swelling. One of our guests was a 27-year-old engineer named John. He doesn't want me to publish his Chinese name because he's afraid that even discussing American politics could get him in trouble with the government here. (Sadly, he's not being irrational.) John said landing a job remains tough. Even the master's degree he received a few years ago didn't help much. \"As a postgraduate student, it's hard to find a job,\" said John. \"Not only for America \u2014 employment is also an issue for China. It's not just Obama's problem or someone's problem. It is a problem the whole world faces.\" Stella Xie thought Romney's criticisms of China suggested he'd be harder for the Chinese government to work with. \"I think it more reflects his ingrained mistrust of China,\" she said. \"I think, for the future, if China and the U.S. want to grow their economies, there has to be trust.\" Others thought Romney's attacks were more campaign rhetoric. Andrew Liu, an accountant in the finance industry and a Romney supporter (not that any of these observers can actually vote, of course), thought Romney would take a more practical approach and try to enhance business with China once he got into the White House. \"Traditionally, Republicans are focused on the economy and more pragmatic,\" he said. \"When it comes to U.S.-China relations, they attach more importance to trade.\" In the end, everyone seemed to enjoy the debate. They especially liked seeing ordinary citizens in the town hall-style forum question the people who want to lead them about the most pressing issues of the day. It's something they all said they wished they could do here in China.",

He and his eighth-grade homeroom classmates pose with a slide projector as part of the yearbook's theme of \"Nostalgia.\" From now until Nov. 6, President Obama and GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney will emphasize their differences. But the two men's lives actually coincide in a striking number of ways. In this installment of NPR's \"Parallel Lives\" series, a look at Obama's time at a Hawaii institution called Punahou. Obama shoots the ball while playing for the Punahou School basketball team in 1979.\n                \n                    \n                    Laura S.L. Kong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Obama shoots the ball while playing for the Punahou School basketball team in 1979. Punahou School was founded by missionaries in 1841 \u2014 the campus is just up the hill from Waikiki, and it's built around a historic spring. Punahou occupies a privileged position, not just on the hillside, but in Hawaii society. In his memoir, Dreams From My Father, Barack Obama recalled how his grandfather pulled strings to get him in. \"[F]or my grandparents, my admission into Punahou Academy heralded the start of something grand, an elevation in the family status that they took great pains to let everyone know,\" Obama wrote. For generations, Punahou educated the children of plantation owners, businessmen and politicians. Pal Eldredge graduated from Punahou in the 1960s. \"In the beginning, we were known as the 'haole school,' \" says Eldredge. Haole is Hawaiian for foreigner \u2014 or white person. Eldredge says that when young Obama arrived as a fifth-grader in 1971, the school's complexion was just beginning to change. \"We didn't have a lot of African-Americans. So your first thing is, 'Oh, we've got an African-American. Terrific!' \" says Eldredge. He was teaching at Punahou at the time, and he remembers the future president as a pudgy, cheerful kid. \"He used to wear these shorts and striped T-shirts a lot, and sandals. But after you got to know him, not only was he a bright student, but he was just a funny, all-around kid, and everybody liked him,\" says Eldredge. But in his memoir, Obama dwells on moments at Punahou when his race made him feel conspicuous, such as the time he was teased for playing with the only other black child in his grade. \"When I looked up, I saw a group of children, faceless before the glare of the sun, pointing down at us. 'Coretta has a boyfriend! Coretta has a boyfriend!' \" Obama writes. In the book, Obama's struggles with racial identity grow as he reaches high school, and he recalls intense discussions with another black student, an embittered boy he calls \"Ray.\" \"Ray\" is really Keith Kakugawa. He's part black, part Japanese. Sandy Beach Park, one of Obama's favorite spots growing up in Hawaii.\n                \n                    \n                    Martin Kaste/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sandy Beach Park, one of Obama's favorite spots growing up in Hawaii. Kakugawa says he and young Obama did have some heart-to-hearts about race but, in general, it wasn't a big issue at the school because Punahou kids had to stick together. \"Because we knew once we left that school, there was a target on our backs. No matter what race you are, you're Punahou. You're the rich, white kids. Period,\" Kakugawa says. Of course, young Obama was not rich. He was a scholarship student. He worked at a Baskin-Robbins ice cream shop. It's still there, near the school. So is the apartment building where he lived with his grandparents. In a way, Punahou was his neighborhood \u2014 and this being Hawaii, so was the beach. Sandy Beach Park was one of his favorites. Surfer Turk Cazimero says the scene hasn't changed much since the '70s. \"You come down here on a weekend, you smell every type of weed there is,\" Cazimero says with a laugh. Obama has admitted upfront that he did drugs in high school \u2014 that's in his memoir. But there are lingering questions about how much he did. At Punahou, he and his buddies called themselves the \"Choom Gang\" \u2014 choom means smoke pot. And things sometimes got out of hand. One guy rolled a car. But his homeroom teacher, Eric Kusunoki, says he never saw signs of trouble. Young Obama's grades stayed good, as did his attitude. \"Every day when he'd come in, he'd always walk in the door very positive, very pleasant, big smile, you know, 'Hey, Mr. Kus, how you doing?' \" says Kusunoki Another school friend, Ronald Loui, says that when talking about the Choom Gang, you have to keep a sense of proportion. \"There was a group called the Stoners. And the Choom Gang wasn't the Stoners,\" Loui says. The Choom Gang were the sons of successful people \u2014 one boy's father was a prominent judge \u2014 and there was an expectation that they would be successful, too. Loui says if you're looking for Punahou's lasting gift to Obama, this was it: The elite environment familiarized him with success. \"Everywhere he turned, he could see a path to leadership. The highest level of achievement is something he can touch \u2014 it's tangible,\" Loui says. And it was during that Choom Gang period that young Obama took a class called \"Law in Society,\" taught by attorney and Punahou alumnus Ian Mattoch. \"He was a student who appeared to be serious and yet he was able to socialize with all of his classmates, which isn't an easy thing to do at Punahou School,\" says Mattoch. That may be an early glimpse of political skills \u2014 but he wasn't into politics yet. No student council meetings for him, perhaps because it would have meant less time for basketball. \"Basketball is his passion. He loved the game,\" says classmate Alan Lum. He played varsity with Obama. Today he teaches second grade. In high school, Lum says, if you were looking for the kid known as Barry Obama, the first place to check was always Punahou's outdoor courts. \"Just pickup games. That was his realm,\" Lum says. Always shooting hoops \u2014 it's the one thing everyone remembers about him at Punahou. Another friend says that back then, if he'd had to guess, he would've predicted Obama was destined for a bright career \u2014 as a basketball coach.

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney's presidential campaign is in damage control mode after an article in The Washington Post accused the candidate of bullying in high school. Romney says he does not remember the incidents. Several of his classmates independently recall him going after students who seemed different, vulnerable or effeminate.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. DAVID GREENE, HOST: And I'm David Greene. Mitt Romney's presidential campaign is in damage control mode after a Washington Post article accused the candidate of bullying in high school. Romney says he does not remember the incidents. Yet several of his classmates independently recall him going after students who seemed different, vulnerable, and effeminate. NPR White House correspondent Ari Shapiro joins us now. And, Ari, let's be really careful here. What precisely is Romney accused of? ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: Well, these alleged incidents took place at Michigan's prestigious Cranbrook prep school, where Romney went to school in the 1960s. The most striking incident involved a student with long dyed blond hair. And Romney and a group of his friends allegedly chased this kid down, pinned him down, and forcibly cut his hair while the student cried and screamed for help. Five of Romney's classmates of different political backgrounds told the Washington Post this story, saying that Romney was the one wielding the scissors. One of those students, Phillip Maxwell, who is now a lawyer, called it bullying supreme and told ABC News, quote: \"It's a haunting memory, when you see somebody who is simply different taken down that way and is terrified and you see that look in their eye, you never forget it.\" GREENE: You say perhaps targeted for being simply different. Was the student targeted because he was gay? SHAPIRO: You know, the word gay was not really meaningful to high school students in the 1960s, but everybody who has talked about this incident says the student was effeminate and they describe it as part of a pattern. Students also told the Post about another incident, a boy who later came out as gay, and when he spoke up in class, Romney allegedly shouted: Atta girl. Both of these victims died in recent years, so they can't tell their own story. We're relying here on the accounts of students who watched and in some cases participated in and now regret the incidents. GREENE: OK. Well, Ari Shapiro, this revelation comes, you know, in the middle of a presidential campaign. How has Mitt Romney responded? SHAPIRO: Well, he went on Fox News last night to address the story and here's part of what he said... (SOUNDBITE OF FOX NEWS BROADCAST) MITT ROMNEY: I don't recall the incident myself, but I've seen the reports and I'm not going to argue with that. There's no question but that I did some stupid things when I was in high school, and obviously if I hurt anyone by virtue of that I would be very sorry for it and apologize for it. SHAPIRO: OK. But the Romney campaign also put out statements from supportive classmates of Romney's, saying that Romney had a sense of humor, he may have been a big of a prankster or a clown, but he was not at all malicious. The campaign is clearly concerned that these accounts have the potential to bolster a damaging narrative, portraying Romney as the privileged son of a powerful family who used his power against people who were relatively defenseless. GREENE: You know, Ari, sometimes when things like this come out it's hard to tell at first how damaging it's going to be and whether the story just sort of disappears after a few weeks or whether it really sticks. Any sense at this point? SHAPIRO: You know, we're in something of an anti-bullying moment in America right now, between the It Gets Better campaign and the documentary called \"Bully.\" And the timing of this story is interesting, because it was published the day after Romney's opponent, Barack Obama, expressed support for gay marriage. Clearly the Romney campaign is concerned enough about this story to go into high gear responding to it. Romney emphasizes that he's changed a lot in the nearly 50 years since high school and that everybody did things when they were a teenager that they may regret today. GREENE: All right, Ari, thanks very much. SHAPIRO: Good to talk to you, David. GREENE: That's NPR News White House correspondent Ari Shapiro. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Several times in the next few months, we'll travel to a battleground state, then to a vital county in each state. In that county, we find a starting point for our visit \u2014 an iconic American corner \u2014 First and Main streets. Near the corner of First and Main, in a trailer park in Hillsborough County, Fla., Gregory Brown sticks the key into the motorcycle he has for sale. Brown is a glazier. He installs plate-glass windows in high-rise buildings \u2014 or he did, when he had work. Now he's living on unemployment checks plus a disability check from the woman who lives with him. It's still not quite enough to pay the bills, which is why he's selling the motorcycle for $4,000. \"That $4,000 will probably carry me through the next two months in bills,\" he says. \"And after that, I don't know what I'm going to do.\" In Hillsborough County, which includes Tampa, the economy is recovering more slowly than in the rest of the country. \"I've never been more broke in my life,\" Brown says. In his free time, Brown has been following politics. He's been listening to Rush Limbaugh and says he intends to register to vote this fall. He blames President Obama for his economic trouble. As we talk, Brown brings up the president's onetime minister, Jeremiah Wright. \"I know what I believe in, and I believe that Jesus Christ spilled his blood for my soul, and Rev. Wright doesn't believe that,\" he says. \"He believes that white people are evil, and so does our president and so does his wife.\" When asked specifically if he thinks the president believes white people are evil, Brown says: \"Yes. I believe that if you go to a church long enough and you hear that kind of rhetoric, after a while it gets into your soul.\" The St. Paul AME Church in downtown Tampa was a focal point of the city's black community, but is now a community center for an adjacent apartment complex. A dwindling congregation forced the church to close.\n                \n                    \n                    Becky Lettenberger/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The St. Paul AME Church in downtown Tampa was a focal point of the city's black community, but is now a community center for an adjacent apartment complex. A dwindling congregation forced the church to close. It has been years since Obama denounced his former pastor's remarks attacking the United States, but Wright is still on Brown's mind today. 'The Bellwether County' The economy is the central issue in this fall's campaign. But when you talk with people in Hillsborough County, they link the economy to other issues, ranging from health care to public safety to their children's future to race. That last subject affects voters in different ways in this county of close to 1.3 million people. We drove through parts of it with Susan MacManus, a Florida political scientist. \"Hillsborough County is extremely diverse,\" she says. \"It's why a lot of the political ads are tested here; a lot of focus groups are done in Hillsborough County. Because of all the counties in Florida, it's considered the bellwether county for a lot of reasons.

And, of course, it has the three key geographies of politics: very rural areas, suburban areas and, of course, downtown Tampa, the urban core.\" It also has a wide range of opinions, as we heard moving away from First and Main and toward that urban core. Tampa has a substantial Hispanic and black population. Downtown, not far from where the Republicans will hold their national convention later this month, is the St. Paul African Methodist Episcopal Church,  a beautiful old brick structure with stained-glass windows that is actually no longer a church. It's another place that tells a story about Tampa and Hillsborough County today. We step into a courtyard and spy three people next to a fountain. Joselyn Walker-Saffore is an Obama supporter but says the middle class has been suffering.

She attended St. Paul's for decades before it was converted into a community center. Joselyn Walker-Saffore attended this church for decades, as did Robert \"Pete\" Edwards. His grandson Michael, who's 2 1/2, was the last baby baptized at St. Paul's, Edwards says. We walk into the old sanctuary, with its high wooden ceiling. Michael runs off to play while the grown-ups talk. \"This church \u2014 they called it a 'big hat' church because your hat and your purse and your shoes all match,\" Walker-Saffore explains. \"This was the church to belong to if you thought you were or wanted to be somebody in the city of Tampa.\" It was a center of Tampa's black community. \"Some of the speakers that we've had at this church: Rev. Jesse Jackson, President Bill Clinton, Thurgood Marshall,\" she says. But in recent years, the congregation dwindled, and the church had to close. The building became the community center for a nearby apartment building \u2014 which, in a way, was a sign of racial progress. The black middle class that once gathered here spread to other communities as racial segregation declined. 'There's No Jobs' Recently, however, Walker-Saffore says, the middle class has been suffering. \"I have a daughter and she was an insurance adjuster. She was laid off and she's been laid off since March,\" Walker-Saffore says. \"And, you know, you search and search and can't find anything. I have another friend that's recently been laid off after 10 years with the city. \"So, you know, it just seems to be rampant,\" she says. \"And I have so many friends looking for jobs and there's no jobs\" \u2014 even for people with college degrees. \"For me, as a black person, it's always been hard. So it is hard. But I think the playing field has been leveled a little bit so that's why people are more concerned,\" she says. Michael Bailey, 2, was the last baby baptized at St. Paul's. Jesse Jackson, Thurgood Marshall and President Clinton all spoke at the church. (The Florida Channel has produced a documentary about the role of black churches in the state, including St. Paul's.)\n                \n                    \n                    Becky Lettenberger/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Michael Bailey, 2, was the last baby baptized at St. Paul's. Jesse Jackson, Thurgood Marshall and President Clinton all spoke at the church. (The Florida Channel has produced a documentary about the role of black churches in the state, including St. Paul's.) In other words, while the black unemployment rate has always been higher than the white unemployment rate nationally, there has also been a strong black middle class \u2014 like the people who built St. Paul's. And now, even that middle class is feeling the economic pain, she says. And here in the former black church, Obama does not escape criticism. Edwards is a registered Republican who argues that the president has not done much for the black community. \"When you look at the way he has avoided addressing any major issues in the Afro-American community, that tells me two things,\" Edwards says. \"One: He's really, in my opinion, not in tune to it. And two: Even if he gets elected for the second term, you still won't see that much significant change to it.\" This onetime voter for George W. Bush will vote for Obama. But he says that's only because he's unimpressed with Republican Mitt Romney. Walker-Saffore, however, says she feels the president was \"dealt a bad hand.\" \"Like you say, you can't pick your family members but you can choose your friends. He didn't pick the situation he was elected to, he inherited it,\" she says. \"So I think we need to kind of let him keep working a little bit longer to see what happens.\" Her deeper concerns are closer to home. \"I have four adult children and I have 11 'superchildren' \u2014 I don't like that word that starts with G-R-A,\" she says with a laugh. We are in the state where a black teenager was shot this year by a neighborhood watch volunteer.

The political impact of Monday's Supreme Court ruling that three of four provisions of Arizona's immigration enforcement law are unconstitutional \u2014 and that a fourth could eventually be found to be \u2014 certainly appeared, at first blush, to be a significant political win for President Obama. The Obama administration, after all, had challenged Arizona's controversial SB 1070 legislation as usurping the federal government's power to enforce the nation's immigration laws, a stance the high court mostly agreed with. Because many Latinos and immigrant-rights groups found the Arizona law to be repellent owing to features they feared would encourage racial profiling and discrimination, that the Obama administration sided with them had already helped the president deepen his support with Hispanic voters. The 5-3 decision from a conservative court in which Chief Justice John Roberts joined the majority only strengthens the president's argument that he was right, and Arizona officials wrong on an issue with special significance to a key bloc of voters \u2014 Latinos \u2014 whose support he is counting on for re-election. For the same reason, the Supreme Court decision seemingly complicates the political picture for Mitt Romney, the all-but-official Republican presidential nominee. Romney, who took a hard-line immigration stance during the Republican primaries, has been forced to try to walk the tightrope between appealing to conservatives wanting tougher enforcement while at the same time doing what he can to keep the wide gap in Latino support that exists between him and the president from getting any wider. The statements issued by both Obama and Romney captured the differences in their situations. Obama welcomed the Supreme Court decision and vowed that his administration would police Arizona's use of the so-called papers-please provision the court upheld. That provision requires Arizona police to inquire about the immigration status of people stopped for other causes if the police have reason to suspect someone's immigration status. Obama said: \"I am pleased that the Supreme Court has struck down key provisions of Arizona's immigration law. What this decision makes unmistakably clear is that Congress must act on comprehensive immigration reform. A patchwork of state laws is not a solution to our broken immigration system \u2014 it's part of the problem. \"At the same time, I remain concerned about the practical impact of the remaining provision of the Arizona law that requires local law enforcement officials to check the immigration status of anyone they even suspect to be here illegally. I agree with the Court that individuals cannot be detained solely to verify their immigration status. No American should ever live under a cloud of suspicion just because of what they look like. Going forward, we must ensure that Arizona law enforcement officials do not enforce this law in a manner that undermines the civil rights of Americans, as the Court's decision recognizes ...\" In his statement, Romney blasted the president but did not specifically say whether he agreed with the Supreme Court's ruling: \"Today's decision underscores the need for a President who will lead on this critical issue and work in a bipartisan fashion to pursue a national immigration strategy. President Obama has failed to provide any leadership on immigration. This represents yet another broken promise by this President. I believe that each state has the duty \u2014 and the right \u2014 to secure our borders and preserve the rule of law, particularly when the federal government has failed to meet its responsibilities. As Candidate Obama, he promised to present an immigration plan during his first year in office. But 4 years later, we are still waiting.\" Gary Segura, a Stanford University political scientist, viewed the decision as a decidedly mixed one for Latinos, since the most repugnant part of the law to them, police inquiries into immigration status, survived. But he saw the decision as having substantial benefits for Obama, giving the president the best of both worlds: \"I think it's a huge win for two reasons. First, losing on that one provision is very likely to mobilize voters. The threat is still there; the threat is still meaningful. But the president and his administration intervened on behalf of Latinos and defeated three of the four provisions. ... \"And of course Gov. Romney and the Republicans embrace the part of the law that was upheld. So the president can go to Latino voters and say, 'I had your back. I sued on [your] behalf ... I got three out of four of them overturned. But there's still a threat since Republicans think it's such a great idea.' So, politically, I think it's a huge win for the administration.\" Charles Foster, a prominent Houston immigration lawyer, thinks the Supreme Court decision didn't do Romney any favors. Foster, by the way, has been a bipartisan immigration-policy adviser, first to George W. Bush in 2000 and 2003, then to Obama in 2008. He also filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting the Justice Department's challenge of the Arizona law. \"This decision puts more pressure on Gov. Romney than on President Obama. The Obama administration has been criticized for having challenged the Arizona law in the Supreme Court, but here you have a fairly conservative court by and large upholding Obama's position that this is a federal issue. \"On the other hand, Gov. Romney, I think, in ways that didn't really reflect his true beliefs, tactically took hard positions during the primary. He wound up taking the position that adopting Arizona-type laws was a good thing for the states to do. \"This decision will put him in the potentially awkward position of having to say that as president he would seek federal approval to do precisely what the Supreme Court has struck down.\" Not everyone thought that Romney would necessarily have to play defense after the high court decision. Did Romney need to distance himself from the Arizona law or revise his rhetoric? Scott Cottington, a Minnesota-based Republican consultant and former political director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee was asked: \"No, not necessarily. \"It seems to me that if a candidate for national office makes statements in support of federalism, and the rights of states to do things even if turned back by the Supreme Court, that's a good thing. States try things, the Supreme Court rules, and there's more clarity. I tend to think that indicates the process is working. \"What Romney needs to do over the next four of five months, I don't know. I do know that you can't outpander Obama.\" Romney's statement provides some clues about what he is likely to continue doing to undermine the president's approval ratings with Latino voters. That is to point out that Obama, who promised comprehensive immigration reform legislation as a presidential candidate in 2008, has failed to deliver. As Segura said: \"What he is trying to do is accentuate the president's failures on immigration which are there, which are meaningful and which, prior to a week ago, I think were a real drag on the enthusiasm of Latino voters.\" That was an allusion to the president's announcement that he would essentially implement parts of the DREAM Act legislation stalled in Congress. Besides deferring deportation proceedings for some young illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. by their parents, the president's move would also allow such immigrants to get work or student visas. Segura said: \"What he's not saying, and what every Latino voter already knows if they pay attention to Jorge Ramos or any Spanish-language media or for that matter, English-language media, is that the obstacle for immigration reform has been and continues to be the Republican Congress. \"You'll notice that the statement doesn't have any immigration policy in it. It's not the case that Romney's promising to deport less people. It's not the case that Romney's arguing for going beyond the president's suspension of deportation for DREAM-eligible kids. It's none of the above, and he sides with Arizona. Arizona has the right to defend its borders. So I think that has very little effect. They're trying to thread the needle and they're not going to do it.\" Still, while unpopular with many Latino voters, the Arizona law has many supporters in the rest of the electorate. A recent Pew Research Center poll found that a solid majority of voters, 58 percent, supported the law while 38 percent didn't. True, that level of support was down from the 64 percent who two years ago said they approved it, but it was still a substantial majority. Updated at 6:08 pm \u2014 Romney spokesman Rick Gorka had an exchange with reporters on the Romney plane Monday did little to shed much light on the candidate's views. An excerpt from Politico.com: GORKA: \"The governor supports the states' rights to craft immigration laws when the federal government has failed to do so. This president promised as a candidate to address immigration in his first year and hasn't, and waited actually 'til four and a half months before the election to put in place a stopgap measure.\" QUESTION: So does he think it's wrongly decided? GORKA: \"The governor supports the states' rights to do this. It's a 10th amendment issue.\" QUESTION: So he thinks it's constitutional? GORKA: \"The governor believes the states have the rights to craft their own immigration laws, especially when the federal government has failed to do so.\" QUESTION: And what does he think about parts invalidated? GORKA: \"What Arizona has done and other states have done is a direct result of the failure of this president to address illegal immigration. It's within their rights to craft those laws and this debate, and the Supreme Court ruling is a direct response of the president failing to address this issue.\" And so it went for minutes more. At an appearance in Scottsdale, AZ, Romney did go beyond his statement of earlier in the day. An excerpt from The Wall Street Journal which reported on what he said at a fundraiser: \"Now you probably heard today there was a Supreme Court decision relating to immigration and, you know, given the failure of the immigration policy in this country, I would have preferred to see the Supreme Court give more latitude to the states not less,\" Mr. Romney told donors at a Scottsdale, Ariz., fundraiser. \"And there are states now under this decision have less authority, less latitude, to enforce immigration laws.\"",

            "article_content": "Next week, North Dakota voters will decide whether to add an amendment to the state's constitution that supporters say will guarantee religious freedom. But the ballot measure has prompted debate over precisely what it safeguards; opponents argue that it's a solution in search of a problem and worry about its consequences. Measure 3 is worded this way: \"Government may not burden a person's or religious organization's religious liberty.\" Its supporters call it the Religious Liberty Restoration amendment; they say it's needed because of a 22-year-old U.S. Supreme Court decision they believe has put limits on religious freedom. \"What this amendment is attempting to do is to restore that level of protection to what it was pre-1990,\" says Tom Freier, who heads the North Dakota Family Alliance. The group led the effort to put the measure on the ballot. Freier says that making Measure 3 part of the constitution would give it permanence and help prevent attacks on religious freedom. \"So, the analogy would be: We live in Fargo, and most recently in Bismarck and in Minot, you've had floods. And you want to prepare for that. You don't know exactly when or how things are going to happen, but you want to make preparation,\" he says. \"This measure would really put in place the protection for North Dakota that would make sure that people are protected, and religious organizations are protected, when and if they do need that protection.\" But the measure's opponents worry about unintended consequences. They say it could allow parents who abuse children to hide behind the curtain of religious liberty. One opponent is Tim Hathaway, executive director of Prevent Child Abuse North Dakota. \"We are urging a 'no' vote on Measure 3,\" he says, \"because it will seriously undercut protection for children in our state by opening the door for people to claim religious freedom as a justification for maltreatment.\" Renee Stromme of the North Dakota Women's Network agrees, saying if it passes, Measure 3 could also lead to discrimination. \"An employer could use religious beliefs to fire a pregnant woman because she is unmarried,\" Stromme says. \"So let's think that through: We now have a single mother, unemployed, struggling to make ends meet, to care for the welfare of her family \u2014 and her employer would have a protected defense for his action. And a judge would have to determine otherwise.\" But Measure 3 supporters like Christopher Dodson, who heads the North Dakota Catholic Conference, say those claims are unfounded. \"The measure itself says that it doesn't affect those acts which the state has a compelling interest in preventing,\" he says. \"And it's somewhat irresponsible to even imply that the state doesn't have an interest in protecting children, women and vulnerable persons.\" North Dakota's Legislative Council, the state Legislature's research arm, agrees with that assessment. Still, opponents argue the measure is both unnecessary and potentially dangerous \u2014 and could raise new ways for people to define their own extreme religious views. Gladys Cairns, the former administrator of North Dakota Child Protective Services, says she worries that criminals will hide behind a religious cloak. \"If I were a defense attorney, I'd be making sure that my client would be doing that,\" she says. Recent polls point to a close vote. Both sides are running a number of radio and television ads between now and the June 12 election.",

            "article_content": "A plan for how to redraw Texas' congressional and state legislative districts that was put together by a three-judge federal court in San Antonio was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court this morning because, the justices ruled, the lower court should not have disregarded the Texas state legislature's wishes and should not have stepped into that legislature's shoes. In an 11-page \"per curiam\" opinion that does not say how the nine justices voted but instead speaks on behalf of the full court, the judges in Texas are basically told to come up with new district lines and not to ignore the Republican-controlled legislature's maps when doing so. Time is of the essence. Texas' 32-member House delegation is set to expand to 36 because of the state's population growth \u2014 much of it Hispanic. SCOTUSBlog points out that there is a \"Feb. 1 deadline for creation of new maps.\" Texas holds its primaries on April 3. As NPR's Nina Totenberg has reported, the GOP-controlled Texas legislature drew up House maps that likely would have resulted in three of the four new districts going to Republicans. Critics went to court to stop it, saying the lines discriminated against minorities. The Justice Department, now run by the Democratic Obama administration, also weighed in against the legislature's plan, NPR's Carrie Johnson tells us. The plan the three-judge panel in San Antonio came up with likely would give three of the four new districts to Democrats. Federal approval of Texas' plans is necessary, as Nina has reported, because \"states like Texas, with a demonstrated history of racial and ethnic  discrimination,\" are required by the Voting Rights Act to \"get pre-clearance before putting into effect a new redistricting  plan.\" Still, in its ruling today the Supreme Court writes that \"redistricting is 'primarily the duty and responsibility of the State,' \" citing a 1975 opinion. \"The failure of a State's newly enacted plan to gain pre-clearance prior to an upcoming election does not, by itself, require a court to take up the state legislature's task.\"",

According to Lyle Denniston at SCOTUSBlog: \"Specially at issue is the constitutionality of the law's Section 5, the most important provision, under which nine states and parts of seven others with a past history of racial bias in voting must get official clearance in Washington before they may put into effect any change in election laws or procedures, no matter how small. The Court came close to striking that down three years ago, but instead sent Congress clear signals that it should update the law so that it reflects more recent conditions, especially in the South. Congress did nothing in reaction.\" As The Associated Press adds: \"The basic question is whether state and local governments that once boasted of their racial discrimination still can be forced in the 21st century to get federal permission before making changes in the way they hold elections. \"Some of the governments covered \u2014 most of them are in the South \u2014 argue they have turned away from racial discrimination over the years.

Following Mitt Romney recently to an American Legion convention in Indianapolis, correspondent Ari Shapiro worked the audience with his recorder as he waited for Romney to speak. It was, he would say in his report, \"not an Obama-friendly crowd.\" He aired comments from Bobbie Lussier, a veteran's wife, as illustration. \"I just\u2014I don't like him,\" Lussier said of the president. \"Can't stand to look at him. I don't like his wife. She's far from the first lady. It's about time we get a first lady in there that acts like a first lady and looks like a first lady.\" Alarm bells went off in NPR's listening audience. Many wrote to complain that Lussier's interview should not have been aired, but for different reasons, each of them compelling. \"I find this quote highly offensive, likely racist and clearly outside the range of acceptable dialogue and exchange regarding politics and the upcoming election,\" wrote Jonathan Hertz from Allentown, Pa., representative of one group of listeners. Val Larsen of Bridgewater, Va., and others said that the comment went beyond offense to African Americans and the first couple to offend veterans. \"By using just that one quote to characterize the views of the conference attendees, you implied that these racist views are typical of veterans,\" he wrote. \"To slander them by implying racist views and political motives is a gross breach of our social contract with soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines.\" And Tom Kenny, of Gilbert, Ariz., said it was unfair, and maybe slanderous, on a third front that at first might seem surprising: to Bobbie Lucie herself. \"The report left me and possibly others with the impression that the speaker is a racist. In fact, the report failed to establish that,\" wrote Kenny. \"Assuming this was not a case of editing, Mr. Shapiro should have followed up with the simple question, 'What should a president and first lady look like?' The report may have left the audience with a totally wrong impression about the individual.\" I asked Shapiro about his decision to include Lussier's comment and whether it was NPR's responsibility to keep racist opinions off the air. He wrote: I leave it to listeners to interpret her comment as they wish, but I have to disagree that if a comment reflects racism we should refrain from airing it unless a story is explicitly about racism. Over the course of the campaign I've put hundreds of voters' views on the air. Imagine for a moment that some percentage of those voters told me, \"I won't vote for President Obama simply because he's black.\" If I excluded that sentiment from any stories that weren't explicitly about racism, I think I'd be presenting a distorted portrait of the electorate. Lots of people tell me \"I'm voting for Romney because of his business experience,\" and I'd never think to restrict those voices to stories that are explicitly about business. No one voice will ever be wholly representative of Americans' views on anything, which is to say that listeners should not hear a particular quote as representing a universal view. But my goal is to paint a complete picture over the course of the campaign using a pointillistic approach, where each voter's voice is a dot of color that, viewed together from a distance, reflects the 2012 electorate in its entirety. Her comment may make people uncomfortable. But I don't consider that to be an argument against including her in the story. Shapiro separately tweeted about the matter of a follow-up question: \"Lots of ppl asking if I followed-up w the woman in my @MorningEdition piece. No. Romney's speech was starting so I had to run & tape him.\" I'm a great fan of Shapiro's work, and I think that he is right that a story need not be about racism to include a racist comment by someone. But I think that he and his editors were wrong to let Lussier's interview run without clarifying what she meant. If she indeed was being racist, then I would have to question how representative she was of the audience. To viscerally not like President Obama and Michelle Obama is one thing. Many Democrats felt the same about former President George W. Bush. To not like the Obamas because they are black is another thing altogether. This is hate speech that offends a whole class of Americans (and many, if not most, of the rest of us). We as citizens need to know how many among us share such views, and it should be reported so that an informed citizenry can choose how to react. But if a racist comment is presented as just a gratuitous interview without useful context, then we as journalists have behaved irresponsibly, inflaming the country and lending legitimacy to hate. Some in the profession might call this self-censorship. So what? I once took today's common journalistic stance that it is not our place to self-censor, that press freedom and honesty means hands-off, laissez-faire reporting, whether the public likes it or not. But I'm a lot older now, and I have seen how the news media has contributed to polarization and to the loss of the media's own public support and trust. To be an ayatollah for an imagined ethic in which the news media should not take into account how the American audience will receive something is self-defeating and wrong. We have always self-censored. The wiser stance is to discuss what and how, and do it openly with the audience, however subjective the standards might be. In this particular case, I have no idea what Lussier meant. But the fact that so many of us immediately thought that she was being racist says that race is still an issue in the body politic, even if the sort of racial hate, violence and discrimination that I knew growing up in Georgia is largely a thing of the past. The Lussier quote is ambiguous, however, precisely because Michelle Obama doesn't in fact act and look like previous first ladies. She's been known to shop at Target and dance around with students as part of her \"Let's Move\" campaign. She is muscular and wore a sleeveless dress in her first official photo op. Four years later, news reports still mentioned her arms when covering her DNC speech. For unclear cases like this one, NPR's vice president for diversity, Keith Woods, recommends a process-oriented news standard that agrees with listener Kenny and those tweeters. He wrote me: If there's a problem here, it's not that the comments are racist. The problem is, I don't know if they're racist. I don't know, in fact, what the woman meant when she said any of that. I have a strong suspicion, but I could be completely wrong. When she said she couldn't stand the look of the president, was she talking about his race or his ears? When she implied that Mrs. Obama doesn't look like a first lady, did she mean that she's not white or did she dislike the way Mrs. Obama wears sleeveless dresses? I believe a reporter's obligation here is to ask the question \"What do you mean?\" and either use the answer in the story or tell the listener whether the follow-up question led in one direction (racist) or another. Several people, including the woman now adjudged by many as a racist, have a stake in that question and answer. I can't tell from the piece whether the question was asked. Even if we \"know\" that something someone says is racist or hateful, there's great value\u2014for the source and for the public\u2014in asking another question. It may not be \"What do you mean?\" But it might be: \"People will hear that as a racist statement. What would you say to them?\" What it allows is for the story to use reporting to go beyond words and get to meaning and guide conclusions (rather than just letting people draw their own). The answer to the second question also allows the journalist (and NPR) to demonstrate that we understood we were in this offensive territory and weren't being cavalier in putting that stuff on the air. The second question further informs; deepens our understanding of what's being said. That's all better journalism. I make that point to push this conversation out of the predictable\u2014and false\u2014dichotomy that suggests we either offend our audience or coddle them. Better journalism informs them. Simple as that. It is understandable that Shapiro ran out of time to ask the follow up. But then the incomplete interview should not have been aired. Meanwhile, NPR does have a content standard. Only it's for reader comments on the Web. NPR's terms of use state: You may not submit any User Materials or links to material that is libelous, defamatory, false, obscene, indecent, lewd, pornographic, violent, abusive, threatening, harassing, discriminatory, in violation of the law, harmful to children, in violation of third party privacy rights, or that constitutes hate speech or a personal attack. Journalists have to report on all of the above, and should. But the list is a good reminder that each of these is special in how they are received by American society. Each of these should be reported and edited with care, whether you call that self-censorship or not. ......... Since this post was written Shapiro has been involved in a public debate over whether or not he should have stood up for the Pledge of Allegiance at a Romney rally. He responded in a post on the \"It's All Politics\" blog. You might have thoughts you want to add. ......... Shapiro later caught up with Bobbie Lussier for a follow-up interview: A Second, Chance Interview With Subject Of Controversial First Lady Remarks Assistant to the ombudsman Lori Grisham contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "When NPR announced the hiring of Gary Knell as CEO in October, Joel Dreyfuss of The Root, an African-American oriented website, published an open letter challenging Knell and NPR to work harder to diversify its staff and programming. Dreyfuss said he wanted NPR to be \"a reflection of the America I live in,\" which, of course, is part of public radio's mission. Dreyfuss's demand has been a running one for decades among some racial and ethnic minority advocates and listeners. Discrimination lawsuits, messy firings and various diversity attempts helped fuel the attention. So, over recent months, I have been building my own notes in an attempt to measure just how good a job NPR is doing now. What I find so far is that, racially and ethnically, NPR is not doing badly, and is getting better. Why does it matter that journalism sounds like America? Because that is how ethical journalism sounds. Keith Woods, VP Diversity To see if Latino, black and Asian listeners find programming that appeals to them, I broke down NPR audience figures by higher education and income. I discovered that within these categories, the levels of representation of the minority groups and whites are not far apart. Minority staffing in the newsroom and on air, meanwhile, continues to improve. NPR does significantly better than the industry averages in radio, television and newspapers. But then, we expect NPR to do better. Knell has publicly committed himself to further improve diversity, not just of race and ethnicity, but also of age, geography and what he calls \"thought.\" He is aided by the vice president for diversity, Keith Woods, whose role has taken on greater internal importance in the wake of the fiasco over the firing of Juan Williams. Additionally, Ellen McDonnell, the executive director who oversees the news shows, is in the midst of creating and implementing a strategy to push the shows, as she puts it, \"to bring in more diverse voices to reflect the rich diversity of this country.\" Her effort follows on similar earlier projects, but brings a methodological strategy that she is developing with Columbia University's schools of business and journalism. With national elections approaching in November, the political coverage in particular is too Washington-focused and filled with white voices, she said. She doesn't want to eliminate those voices, she said, but explained: \"That lens is too narrow.\" My sense is that NPR and the national news media have done  a poor job in recent decades of covering the white working and middle class. In my own study, I don't actually quantify a breakdown of the news coverage by race, and to my knowledge no one else has either. I tried, but found that it is impossible to classify stories as black, Latino or Asian. Most stories cross over and are of interest to many groups\u2014even stories that might focus primarily on one racial group. There were so many caveats that any numbers I tried to come up with were useless. But I do have a separate caveat. To look at race and ethnicity does not mean that I believe NPR should write any goals into stone. Race and ethnicity still matter in America, but less as time goes by. I used to teach immigration policy at Harvard, and that background tells me that the United States is the single most successful example in world history of a multi-racial and multi-ethnic society. Sociologists and market researchers today have identified what some call \"a new mainstream\" in which the educated and the young identify with each other more than with their ethnic and racial roots, though the roots don't disappear. Indeed, I am also trying to follow how NPR is doing in covering the white working and middle class. My sense is that the national news media, of which NPR is part, has done a poor job in recent decades of covering this segment of Americans. The recent coverage of the Tea Party, which to some degree represents this group, has been mostly political, not social in character. I am a critic of some of Charles Murray's earlier books, but feel that he is on to something in his latest, Coming Apart. His study uncovers a huge cultural chasm that has opened between poor and working class whites, on the one hand, and upper income and highly educated whites on the other. This latter group includes most national journalists. The important question is what percent of listeners is NPR attracting among college graduates within each racial and ethnic category. Looking at NPR, the overwhelming majority of its radio audience is in fact white \u2013roughly 87 percent, according to research pulled together for me by Lori Kaplan of NPR's Audience, Insight and Research Department. This is substantially higher than the 77 percent of adult Americans (18 and older) who are white. Asian-Americans make up nearly 4 percent of the audience, but roughly 3 percent of the adult population. African-Americans and Latinos, however, are under-represented among NPR's listeners. Blacks make up nearly 12 percent of the adult population but just a little more than 5 percent of NPR listeners. For Hispanics, the numbers are 14 percent versus 6 percent. Fine. But irrelevant. Using the total adult population is the wrong baseline. NPR appeals overwhelmingly to college-educated Americans. As you can see in the accompanying chart, more than two-thirds of NPR listeners have a college degree, compared to less than one-third of all Americans. Because college graduates earn more than people with just a high school degree or less, the NPR audience trends to higher-than-average income, too. Forty-five percent of listeners have a household income of more than $100,000 a year. A quarter of all American households earn that much. Source: Percentage of US adults who listen to NPR based on Arbitron Nationwide, all other data from 2011 Doublebase GfK MRI. Credit: Stephanie d'Otreppe/NPR The sophistication of its audience\u2014combined with its sheer size of more than 25 million people listening to an NPR program each week\u2014reflects the trust in NPR news, as well as the appeal of its storytelling. Whether these listeners have a college degree or not, they are smart, informed, interested in the world around them and they tend to be opinion leaders. It is an audience that has few or no other alternatives for independent and fair news on radio. It is also the audience that NPR wisely goes after. So, it seems to me that the important question in looking at minority listenership is what percent of the audience is NPR attracting among college graduates within each racial and ethnic category. I went back to Lori Kaplan. The gaps now narrow significantly. This chart shows adult listeners with a college degree in the four principle racial and ethnic categories. The first bar records what percent within each group listens to NPR at least once a week, regardless of income. The second bar measures listenership in households that earn more than $100,000 a year. Source: 2010 Doublebase GfK MRI. Credit: Stephanie d'Otreppe What you see is that the groups aren't so far apart in how they index. Among all income levels, more than 11 percent of whites with a college degree listen to NPR. This compares to 9 percent of Asians with a college degree, nearly 7 percent of Hispanics and 6 percent of blacks. The gap is even narrower among those with household incomes of more than $100,000. Asians in this category actually out-index whites. Nine percent of these wealthier college educated Asians listen to NPR, compared to less than 8 percent of whites. The percentage among Latinos is close behind at slightly more than 6 percent, followed by African-Americans at 5 percent. In an ideal world, the same percentage of all groups would listen to NPR. This would imply that the programming and news coverage speaks to them equally. Many factors might explain the current differences, among them marketing. But the size of the gaps suggest that while NPR should work to close them, the differences are not major. A qualifier: Some audience members list belonging to more than one race or ethnic group. The number of people who do this is small and doesn't substantially change the above results. This then brings us to staffing. Diversity in staffing is important for two reasons. One, it assures that there are voices in the newsroom raising the concerns and points of view of different segments of our society. Two, it assures that all listeners hear voices with which they can identify on air, making NPR their radio. Your radio. Woods said it best in a speech at the University of Colorado Boulder this past week: Let me speak first in terms of ideals. Journalism is the only profession mentioned in the U.S. Constitution. That's how attached it is historically to democracy. Freedom of the press carries with it an incumbent responsibility that tends to get lost in the noise that sometimes envelops conversations about the First Amendment... My profession does not always act responsibly. But the ideal that underlies our actions, honorable or otherwise, is simple, evergreen, and at its core, democratic. That ideal is expressed in the three ethical pillars upon which responsible journalism stands: Tell the truth as fully as possible; Remain independent of undue influence; Minimize harm to vulnerable people; So if you ask, \"Why does it matter that journalism 'sounds like America,' \" I would say this: Because that is how ethical journalism sounds. Tell the truth as fully as possible means you have to seek out that truth wherever it will be found. Blacks, Latinos, Asian Americans, Native Americans and Hawaiian Islanders, or \"people of color,\" make up 23 percent of NPR's newsroom, meaning reporters, editors, producers and managers, according to NPR's Human resources Department. This compares to just 7 percent for radio in general, according to a survey by the Radio Television Digital News Association and Hofstra University. The television news industry average approaches that of NPR at a rounded off 20 percent. Daily newspapers fall far behind at 13 percent, according to a survey by the American Society of News Editors. Source: NPR Newsroom percentage provided by NPR's HR Department, News Industry averages from 2011 ASNE survey and 2011 RTDNA/Hofstra survey. Credit: Stephanie d'Otreppe/NPR Seen another way, NPR falls short. People of color make up roughly 28 percent of the adult population, compared to their 23 percent representation in the newsroom. But once again, the more important measure is by staffers with college degrees, as almost all journalist and management positions require one. People of color in 2010 made up roughly 20 percent of Americans with college degrees, according to Kaplan. She pulls her numbers from the demographic source widely used by news media organizations, the GfK MRI Doublebase, which in turn reflects U.S. Census numbers. This 20 percent overall compares to the 23 percent of NPR reporters, editors, producers and managers who are people of color.   NPR does not quantify the education levels of its staff, but almost all\u2014if not all\u2014of these journalists and managers have college degrees. We thus can feel confident that we are pretty much\u2014and perhaps totally\u2014comparing apples to apples. The newsroom numbers I use, moreover, do not include support staff that does administrative work. In other words, we are just looking at the people who bring you the news, and therefore control it. Seen this way, NPR shines in its minority hiring. Let's look more closely at each individual racial and ethnic minority group. Seven percent of U.S. college graduates are African American. Blacks make up 12 percent of the newsroom\u2014much more than their 7 percent weight among college graduates. Hispanics, however, are slightly under-represented. They make up six percent of the Americans with college degrees but five percent of the newsroom. Asians do exactly the reverse. They are five percent of Americans with degrees and six percent of the newsroom. The Native American sample size is too small to draw many conclusions. There is one person among NPR's journalists and managers who said he or she was Native American, according to Human Resources. This is 0.2 percent of the newsroom, compared to the 0.6 percent of college graduates who are Native American. Given the large black population in Washington, D.C., where NPR is headquartered, it may make sense that they are the largest minority group in the newsroom. I haven't looked into this. My anecdotal sense, however, is that black males\u2014as opposed to black women\u2014are under-represented, but that is a separate issue. The bottom line here is that in terms of the nation's largest racial and ethnic minority groups\u2014blacks, Latinos and Asians\u2014NPR staffing may have arrived. Why do I hedge by saying \"may\"? You need college graduates to produce the level of NPR's journalism. Many staffers actually have graduate degrees. But to \"sound like America,\" does NPR need a staff that more closely mirrors the total demographic weight of each ethnic and minority group? I don't think so, but I recognize the legitimacy of the tension among the three goals of reflecting the American population, reflecting NPR's target audience and reflecting journalism's talent pool. There is no one good answer. But I think it is safe to say that in resolving this tension, NPR is not doing badly, and possibly very well. By my way of thinking, it is truly doing well. The following chart with information prepared for me by the Human Resources Department further breaks down NPR's newsroom by racial and ethnic categories, and by managers, journalists and support staff. Source: NPR's Human Resources Department Credit: Stephanie d'Otreppe/NPR What follows are two charts that give more detail on NPR staffing, according to NPR's Human Resources Department. The first chart separates journalists, senior editors or managers, and support staff. The second chart includes all of NPR's staff. As you can see, people of color are distributed throughout the hierarchy and are strongly represented among senior management. Source: NPR's Human Resources Department Credit: Stephanie d'Otreppe/NPR Source: NPR's Human Resources Department Credit: Stephanie d'Otreppe/NPR I am a news ombudsman, not a corporate one, and so I consider NPR's non-news staffing and corporate management to be outside my purview. But as all the numbers were given to me by Human Resources, I pass them on to you. In general, the numbers update NPR data released in 2009 for all departments and represent a small but respectable improvement in two years. This is especially so in upper management, production and editorial positions. I can also say with certainty that NPR has a Latino ombudsman, its first. In the coming weeks, I will be doing a quantitative regional bias study and a qualitative look at who gets interviewed on air. I welcome suggestions on other ways to analyze diversity.

Research suggests those who agree with Supreme Court decisions tend to have a favorable view of the Court, while those who don't, have a negative view. David Fontana and Donald Braman are associate professors of law at George  Washington University. The results of their study will be published in the May 2012 issue of the Columbia Law Review. In late 2010, before the midterm elections, a few thousand people across the United States went online to learn some surprising news. The Supreme Court, they were informed, had recently issued a decision guaranteeing a constitutional right to gay marriage. Gay rights groups had cheered the ruling as a \"major step forwards in the history of American civil rights.\" Opponents, meanwhile, were attacking the decision as a \"blow to the people and traditions of the United States and to the importance of the institution of traditional marriage.\" Do not fear \u2014 you didn't somehow miss a landmark event in the history of American constitutional law. The report was part of a research experiment: We hired one of the most reputable public opinion firms in the country, Polimetrix, to survey a representative sample of Americans. One of the issues we tested was gay marriage. The first group of survey participants read a fictional story in which the Court found that a right to gay marriage was guaranteed by the Constitution. Another group read the same narrative \u2014 but this time it was Congress that passed legislation protecting that right. (In each situation, survey participants overwhelmingly believed the development actually happened.) The purpose of the surveys was to discover whether the American people react differently to a Supreme Court decision on a controversial issue, as opposed to an act of Congress. For at least a generation, many have assumed that the Court provokes a fiercer and more lasting backlash than do legislative institutions. But what if that assumption is wrong? THE DEBATE ABOUT whether the Court should be making sweeping decisions about American society has a history as long as the country itself and has spawned numerous intellectual camps. But many discussions about the Court return, either implicitly or explicitly, to a single, fundamental claim: that the public has a more negative reaction to controversial decisions when the Court makes them. Those who seek an energetic Supreme Court see it as independent of the sordid machinations of politics and thus intrinsically respected by the public. Those urging the Court to stay away from hot-button issues tend to portray justices as a small cadre of meddling elitists, unpopular with ordinary Americans. Over the years, the constituencies supporting and opposing a vigorous Supreme Court have shifted with the political winds. During the 1930s, the Court was a powerful impediment to the New Deal Congress, blocking many of Franklin Roosevelt's signature economic efforts. During this time, anti-Court critiques came mostly from the left. But this shifted during the years of the Warren   Court, which played a central role in combating some of America's most intractable social problems. The Court declared racial segregation unconstitutional in Brown v. Board of Education, expanded the rights of criminal defendants in Miranda v. Arizona, and, in the early days of the Burger   Court, declared a constitutional right to abortion in Roe v. Wade. This string of liberal victories caused great alarm among conservatives, and, when Richard Nixon ran for president in 1968, he took direct aim at the \"judicial activism\" of the Warren Court. Since then, attacks on the Court have proved to be a major \u2014 and potent \u2014 part of the conservative agenda. As president, Ronald Reagan railed against courts \"short-circuiting the electoral process and disenfranchising the people.\" George W. Bush stated during a presidential debate in 2000 that \"judges ought not to take the place of the legislative branch of government.\" And, this year, Republican primary candidates have proposed various limits on the Court's power to hear certain important constitutional issues. The onslaught against \"activist judges\" has had a powerful effect on liberals, too. During the Warren Court era, many liberals believed that the Court should be deciding major issues. Under this philosophy, the Court was an institution less tainted by politics and inherently more principled. And, after all, the Court had proved itself equal to the great challenge of advancing racial equality and women's liberation. But, in the past generation, significant parts of the left have moved away from this narrative of a heroic Supreme Court changing the country for the better. Now, some liberals argue that, while Brown v. Board of Education furthered the cause of racial equality, it did so at the cost of unnecessarily alienating the public. Similarly, Roe v. Wade created a backlash that might have even helped create the modern evangelical and conservative movements. As a result, the most significant intellectual trend on the constitutional left in the recent past has been the trend toward \"popular constitutionalism\" \u2014 the idea that the Court should leave more major issues to popular institutions like Congress. Many leading thinkers on the left \u2014 from Harvard Law School Professor Mark Tushnet to Stanford Law School Dean Larry Kramer, among others \u2014 have argued for a lesser role for the Court in interpreting the Constitution. (Not all of these arguments are based on strategic grounds; some scholars believe it is preferable for the legislative branch to make landmark decisions, because it is more directly democratic.) Likewise, liberal activist groups have become more wary of seeking justice via the courts. Many leaders in the gay rights community, for instance, have been reluctant to take gay marriage to the Court. And, for a time in 2007, the No. 1 book on The New York Times best-seller list wondered whether, \"in our reliance on the courts to vindicate not only our rights but also our values, progressives had lost too much faith in democracy.\" The author was the junior senator from Illinois, Barack Obama. MANY ACADEMICS have tried to answer the question of what the public thinks the Supreme Court's role should be. But it is hard to make convincing claims about counterfactuals. What would have happened if the result reached in Brown or Roe had come via a congressional statute rather than a judicial opinion? Some great scholars have provided thought-provoking answers to such questions, but in the end their answers have real limitations. To date, a major part of the discussion has assumed that the public has an unfavorable reaction to the Court that is very different from its reaction to Congress. Our research found that the reality is more complicated. Americans of all stripes \u2014 conservative and liberal, pro-gay and anti-gay, pro-gun and anti-gun, political junkies and political neophytes \u2014 do not have a more detrimental reaction to big decisions just because the Court made them. Consider the question we posed to Americans about whether the Supreme Court or Congress should decide the gay marriage question. When supporters of gay rights were told that the Court had ruled in favor of gay marriage, they were much more likely to say that the Court should make such decisions, rather than Congress. But, when they were told Congress had ruled in favor of gay marriage, they were also more likely \u2014 by similar proportions \u2014 to say that Congress should play this role instead of the Court. The same dynamic prevailed in reverse for gay rights opponents. When told the Court had ruled in favor of gay marriage, they disagreed that it had the right to do so \u2014 but they also said the same thing if the decision was made by Congress. This poses a challenge to the notion that, for strategic reasons, activists should push for gay rights via Congress rather than the Court. Ultimately, it seems likely that both supporters and opponents of gay rights will focus on the outcome, not the institution that arrived at it. We also tested public opinion on a cherished conservative cause to see whether that changed people's feelings about the Court. One group of respondents read a fictional article in which the Supreme Court recognized a constitutional right to carry a concealed weapon; another group read an identical narrative in which Congress granted that right. The same dynamic prevailed. When supporters of gun rights were told that the Court had ruled in their favor, they believed the Court should be making these decisions, and opponents of gun rights disagreed. But, when told Congress has understood the Constitution to protect gun rights, supporters again believed the institution producing their favored result was the right institution to be deciding these issues. In other words, people's views of our major institutions shift significantly based on whether or not they support what it does. Respondents in our survey were far more likely to think that \"judges are not beholden to the political wheeling and dealing of lobbyists in the way that legislators are,\" for instance, if they liked the judges' decisions. We did find two ways in which people had different reactions to a constitutional development based on where it originated. Conservatives appear to be moderately more opposed to gay marriage when the Court acts than when Congress acts. However, as liberals are moderately more supportive when the Court acts, these changes cancel each other out. In the aggregate, Americans are no more likely to support gay marriage or gun rights if the Court decided in favor of one than if Congress decided in favor of one. The Court also affects voter turnout somewhat differently. Regardless of whether the Court reached a conservative or liberal outcome, when the Court issued a major decision conservatives were slightly more likely to vote and liberals were slightly less likely to vote than if Congress had acted. However, these differences in turnout were not major. EXPERIMENTAL research, of course, has its limitations. We tested two issues, and at one moment in time. We did not include the presidency. We measured general public opinion, but sometimes \u2014 in ways that cannot be predicted \u2014 the opinions of some matter more than others. Nevertheless, our findings are enough to suggest that how Americans think about the Supreme Court is perhaps not so different from how they think about the rest of the federal government. This provides us with valuable insight into how our democracy works. But it provides a particularly significant lesson for liberals: Perhaps they have become too fearful of using the Court to advance their goals. In the next few years, many of the great issues of our lifetime will come before the Court \u2014 immigration, gay marriage, free speech \u2014 and liberals should not be afraid to vigorously press their causes.",

            "article_content": "The police commission in East Haven, Conn., voted Tuesday night to urge the mayor to fire the police chief amid allegations the department abused Latinos. Chief Leonard Gallo announced his retirement earlier this week, but the commission doesn't think Gallo should be able to cash-in on his retirement package.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: Police commissioners in East Haven, Connecticut, voted last night to recommend that the mayor fire the police chief. As Diane Orson of member station WNPR reports, East Haven police have been in the national spotlight since four officers were arrested and charged with civil rights abuses against Latinos. DIANE ORSON, BYLINE: The senior center was packed last night as East Haven police commissioners called on the mayor to fire chief Leonard Gallo. Gallo announced his retirement earlier this week, but commission chairman Frederick Brow says his performance does not merit a graceful exit with perks. FREDERICK BROW: There's mention of a package for retirement. The board's objecting to the package. We believe he should be terminated and there be no package. ORSON: Chief Gallo has faced criticism for his handling of allegations of racial profiling, harassment and intimidation of Latinos in East Haven. The U.S. Department of Justice Office for Civil Rights launched an investigation of the East Haven Police Department in 2009, and Gallo was placed on leave by the mayor at the time. But last November, that mayor lost her bid for re-election. Joseph Maturo had hired Gallo when he was mayor 14 years ago, and reinstated him when he was took office again last November. That was just before the DOJ announced its findings, describing a deeply rooted pattern of discriminatory policing in East Haven. The FBI also began a criminal investigation. That resulted in four East Haven cops charged last week with conspiracy and obstruction of justice. Janice Fedarcyk is assistant director in charge of the New York City office of the FBI, which worked on the case. JANICE FEDARCYK: The four East Haven police officers were a cancerous cadre who routinely deprived East Haven residents, particularly members of the Latino community, of their civil rights. ORSON: The officers have pleaded not guilty. Attorney Jonathan Einhorn represents chief Gallo. He says the police commissioners are motivated by politics, and have no real say over chief Gallo's departure. JONATHAN EINHORN: It means absolutely nothing. It means as much as if the guy on the corner selling coffee made that recommendation. Under the town charter of the Town of East Haven, the Board of Police Commissioners has absolutely no authority over the police chief. ORSON: Einhorn acknowledges that Gallo is an unnamed co-conspirator in the FBI's criminal indictment, as well as a named defendant in a separate civil action brought by victims of the abuse. Many are Latino congregants of St. Rose of Lima Church. Pastoral council leader Angel Fernandez Chavero says the community wants to see real change in East Haven, not just a new police chief. ANGEL FERNANDEZ CHAVERO: So that this stuff never, ever happens again. We don't want to have to worry about - ABC chief is now there, and then we worry when that person leaves, and God knows what the next one is going to be like. That's not what we want. We want permanent change. ORSON: But that will require action by Mayor Maturo, who was roundly criticized recently after a reporter asked him what he would do to help Latinos in the wake of the arrests. He answered by saying that he might have tacos for dinner. Fernandez Chavero says the mayor has yet to acknowledge the depth of the problems in the community. CHAVERO: And specifically, that the mostly Ecuadorian community, the Latino community of East Haven, has been harassed, that it has suffered racial discrimination, that it has actually suffered physical intimidation and actual physical force. You know, we won't be able to move forward until that happens because you can't solve the problem until you acknowledge that you have it. ORSON: Members of the Latino community plan to unveil a series of recommendations on ways to reform the East Haven Police Department, later today. For NPR News, I'm Diane Orson in New Haven.

            "article_content": "In political terms, 2012 was not the greatest of years. We witnessed an ugly, personal, petty, and often childish presidential election. Living in a \"battleground\" or \"swing\" state often meant being bombarded 24/7 by an incessant barrage of negative campaign commercials. And just as we were finally emerging from the campaign, we ended the year with an unfathomable tragedy, the gunning down of 20 children at an elementary school in Connecticut. But before we enter the new year with new dread, it's time to stop and remember those voices in the world of politics we lost. The list includes George McGovern, whose unlikely battle for the Democratic presidential nomination led him to become his party's standard bearer for 1972, only to go down in a monumental landslide. South Dakota lost two other political giants as well: Republicans Bill Janklow and Jim Abdnor. Arlen Specter was a Democrat turned Republican turned Democrat who became an icon in Pennsylvania political lore. Donald Payne was New Jersey's first African-American member of Congress and served as head of the Congressional Black Caucus. New Hampshire's Warren Rudman had a relatively short tenure in the Senate but he made up for it with a strong effort at bipartisanship and comity. (And the guy he unseated in 1980, John Durkin, was a part of one of the most contested contests in history.) And then there was Daniel Inouye, whose 50 years representing his beloved Hawaii made him the second longest serving senator in history. Presented here is a chronological list of those who died this year. It doesn't claim to be complete, but it includes many of those who made our lives more interesting and the world a better place. Ed Jenkins, 78, who served 16 years in the House as a conservative Democrat from Georgia (1977-92), who famously took on Col. Oliver North during the 1987 Iran-Contra congressional hearings and who was defeated by fellow Democrat Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) in a 1989 bid to become majority leader. He retired in 1992. (Jan. 1) Gatewood Galbraith, 64, a lawyer who ran for governor of Kentucky five times, twice as a Democrat and thrice as an independent or third party candidate, never coming close to victory. He was an early supporter of the legalization of marijuana. (Jan. 3) Charles Bailey, 82, a co-author of the cold war novel \"Seven Days in May\" who also served as editor for the Minneapolis Tribune in the 1970s and later as the Washington editor for NPR. (Jan. 3) Tony Blankley, 63, the press secretary to House Speaker Newt Gingrich from 1990-97 who later became an editor and columnist for the Washington Times. (Jan. 7) Alex DeCroce, 75, the Republican minority leader of the New Jersey state Assembly who was instrumental in getting Gov. Chris Christie into politics. (Jan. 9) William Janklow, 72, a larger-than-life Republican from South Dakota who served as governor and the state's House member, and whose political career came to an end after he killed a motorcyclist while speeding. Elected attorney general in 1974, he won the first of his four gubernatorial terms in '78. Term limited in 1986, he challenged fellow Republican Jim Abdnor for his Senate seat but lost in the primary. Undeterred, he returned for another gov. career in 1994. The incumbent Republican, George Mickelson, had died in a plane crash in 1993, and he was succeeded by his lt. gov., Walter Miller. But Janklow took Miller on in the 1994 GOP gov. primary and beat him convincingly. Once again term limited, he ran for the state's lone House seat in 2002, which was being vacated by Senate hopeful John Thune. Janklow walloped Larry Pressler, the former senator, in the GOP primary, and outlasted Democrat Stephanie Herseth in the general. In August of 2003, Janklow, who relished a reputation that he often drove too fast, went through a stop sign and killed a motorcyclist. Convicted of second degree manslaughter, Janklow resigned from the House the following January, and Herseth went on to win the June 2004 special election. (Jan. 12) Richard Threlkeld, 74, a longtime correspondent for CBS and ABC who covered, among other things, the assassination of Robert Kennedy in 1968. (Jan. 13) Ed Derwinski, 85, a longtime GOP congressman from Chicago's South Side who was the nation's first Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Derwinski, a state rep at the time, became his party's nominee for Congress in 1958 following the August death of Rep. William McVey (R). He won and, at the age of 32, was one of the youngest members of the new 86th Congress \u2013 the youngest was fellow Illinoisan freshman Dan Rostenkowski (D), who was 30. Derwinski's tenure in the House ended in 1982, when redistricting put him in the same CD as his close friend, fellow Republican George O'Brien; Derwinski lost the primary 52-48. Popular in American Legion halls throughout his district, he became the senior President Bush's choice as V.A. Secretary in 1989. (Jan. 15) Hulett Smith, 93, a West Virginia Democrat elected governor in 1964 under whose tenure the state's death penalty law was abolished and environmental regulations were put in place. (Jan. 15) J. Joseph Garrahy, 81, a Democratic governor of Rhode Island who served from 1977 until his retirement in 1984. Immensely popular in an overwhelmingly Democratic state, Garrahy won a second term in 1978 over future governor Lincoln Almond, and a third term two years later over Providence Mayor Buddy Cianci; both elections were landslide victories. (Jan. 24) Kevin White, 82, who served four terms as mayor of Boston during the city's long racial tension over school busing. First elected in 1967 over busing opponent Louise Day Hicks, he helped keep calm a city not known for welcoming desegregation in its schools or neighborhoods. He was also the Democratic gov. nominee in 1970 (running mate: Michael Dukakis), but lost badly to GOP incumbent Francis Sargent. He was thought to be on George McGovern's V.P. short list in 1972. With members of his administration caught up in scandal, the economy crumbling and his popularity tumbling, White didn't seek a fifth term in 1983. (Jan. 27) Jim Lloyd, 89, a California Democrat who unseated GOP Rep. Victor Veysey in the Watergate election year of 1974 and held for three terms until falling to Republican challenger David Dreier in 1980. (Feb. 2) Robert Daniel, 75, a five-term Republican from Virginia who served in the House from 1972, when he won an open Democratic seat, until 1982, when he was defeated by Norm Sisisky (D). (Feb. 4) Irving Swanson, 99, who as the House of Representatives' reading clerk took the roll call when the chamber voted to declare war on Japan in 1941 (as well as Germany and Italy) and who read into the Congressional Record the message of Japan's surrender in 1945. (Feb. 13) Harry McPherson, 82, a top aide, adviser and confidant to President Lyndon Johnson who later became a prominent D.C. lobbyist. (Feb. 16) Katie Hall, 73, the first African-American House member from Indiana who was a prime sponsor of the legislation that established a national holiday for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Hall won a special election in 1982 following the death of Rep. Adam Benjamin (D), and almost immediately focused on a holiday honoring King. Her career was cut short in 2003, when she got caught up in corruption charges \u2014 she plead guilty to mail fraud \u2014 and was sentenced to house arrest. She was defeated in the 1984 Democratic primary by Peter Visclosky, who still serves. (Feb. 20) William Raggio, 85, the 1970 GOP Senate nominee in Nevada, where he lost to Democratic incumbent Howard Cannon, and who then went on to become the longest-serving member of the state Senate, from 1972 until his retirement in 2010. (Feb. 24) Andrew Breitbart, 43, a rightwing blogger, commentator and provocateur best known for putting undercover videos on the Internet to embarrass and discredit liberals and the mainstream media. Among his targets were ACORN, the community organizing group, and then-Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), who resigned his House seat following the Breitbart-inspired release of sexually explicit photos Weiner sent to various women. (March 1) George Firestone, 80, a Democrat who served as Florida's Secretary of State from 1979 until his resignation in 1987. (March 2) Steve Bridges, 48, an entertainer known for impersonating President George W. Bush. (March 3) Rep. Donald Payne, 77, a former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus and the first African-American elected to Congress from New Jersey. After two unsuccessful primary challenges to Rep. Peter Rodino (D), who headed up the House Judiciary Committee, Payne was elected in 1988 when Rodino retired. During his years in Congress he worked on famine relief to Africa and health-related legislation. His seat was taken in November by his son, Donald Jr., a member of the Newark city council. (March 6) Thomas Puccio, 67, who as a federal prosecutor helped convict Sen. Harrison Williams (D-N.J.) and several House members during the 1980 Abscam scandal. (March 12) Ted Strickland, 79, who was briefly lt. gov. of Colorado but lost in his bid for a full term in 1974, and lost twice more as the Republican nominee for governor in 1978 (when he lost to Dem incumbent Dick Lamm) and 1986 (when he lost to Roy Romer). (March 14) Henry Ruth, 80, who as Watergate special prosecutor helped lead the investigation into and ultimate resignation of President Richard Nixon. (March 16) Priscilla Buckley, 90, the sister of the late William F. Buckley Jr. and a leading conservative force who was the longtime managing editor of National Review. (March 25) Len Blaylock, 93, the GOP nominee for governor of Arkansas in 1972, when he lost in a landslide to Democratic incumbent Dale Bumpers. (March 25) Frank Strickler, 92, a Washington attorney who represented Nixon aides H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichmann during the Watergate scandal. (March 29) Bernard Rapoport, 94, a millionaire patron of Democratic politicians who helped found the Texas Observer, a liberal magazine. (April 5) Mike Wallace, 93, one of the nation's foremost TV news interrogators during his decades on CBS' \"60 Minutes.\" In 1968 he was offered, but turned down, the job as Richard Nixon's press secretary. (April 7) J. Quinn Brisben, 77, the Socialist Party USA's presidential nominee in 1992 who was also the party's candidate for vice president in 1976. (April 17) Charles Colson, 80, a special counsel to President Richard Nixon, practitioner of political hardball and one of the architects of the administration's \"dirty tricks\" unit who went to prison in the wake of the Watergate scandal. It was Colson who hired Howard Hunt, who led the Watergate break-in in June of 1972; Colson himself went to jail on obstruction of justice charges. Upon his release, he became \"born again\" and dedicated his life to religious life and Christian redemption. (April 21) Nicholas Katzenbach, 90, who as deputy attorney general during the Kennedy administration confronted Alabama Gov. George Wallace in June 1963 as Wallace stood in the doorway of the University of Alabama to block two black students from registering; Wallace backed down without any outbreak of violence. He later served as attorney general in the Johnson administration. (May 8) James Abdnor, 89, a South Dakota Republican who ousted George McGovern from the Senate in 1980 but who himself was defeated six years later by Thomas Daschle. A former state senator and lt. gov, Abdnor was elected to the House in 1972, replacing Jim Abourezk (D), who was running for the Senate. In 1980, a big conservative year, he easily defeated the liberal McGovern, the 1972 Democratic presidential nominee, by nearly 20 points. In 1986 he had to fend off a fierce primary challenge by GOP Gov. Bill Janklow, who insisted Abdnor was too weak a candidate to win a second term. The party split hurt Abdnor in November, as he fell to Daschle 52-48. (May 16) William Wampler, 86, who had two runs as a Republican congressman from Virginia. He was first elected in 1952 but was defeated two years later. He returned to the House in 1966, knocking off Democratic incumbent Pat Jennings, the man who unseated him in '54. He served until 1982, when he was defeated by Rick Boucher (D) by just over 1,000 votes. (May 23) T. Garry Buckley, 89, who became lt. gov. of Vermont even though he lost the election in 1976. Because no candidate received a majority of the vote in the three-way race \u2014 Buckley even trailed his Democratic opponent \u2014 the election went to the state legislature, which was Republican controlled and which chose Buckley. As LG, he often clashed with Gov. Richard Snelling, a fellow Republican. In 1978, he lost his bid for renomination in the primary to Peter Smith, later a member of Congress. In 1980 he finished a weak fourth in his bid for the GOP Senate nomination. (May 23) Alice Kryzan, 63, an environmental attorney and the Democratic nominee for Congress in New York's 26th CD in 2008, when she lost to Republican Chris Lee. (June 2) Norman Lent, 81, a moderate Republican from New York's Long Island who served 11 terms in the House. He was first elected to Congress in a memorable 1970 campaign, defeating one-term Democratic incumbent Allard Lowenstein in which the Vietnam War played a huge role. In Congress, Lent was a leading voice in shaping environmental legislation, an issue he focused on until his retirement in 1982. (June 11) John Caulfield, 83, the chief of security during the Richard Nixon's 1968 campaign who was said to be responsible for some of the administration's \"dirty tricks\" that preceded the 1972 Watergate break-in. (June 17) Norbert Tiemann, 87, a Nebraska Republican who served one term as governor, and whose support for higher taxes contributed to his defeat in 1970. In 1966 he won the governorship over Lt. Gov. Phil Sorensen, the brother of former JFK aide Ted Sorensen. He supported a combination of a sales-income tax system that, while keeping the state solvent, drew a strong GOP primary opponent in 1970. Bloodied by the close primary challenge, he lost to Democrat Jim Exon in November by ten points. (June 19) Judy Agnew, 91, wife of the late Vice President Spiro Agnew. (June 20) Edward Costikyan, 87, a Democratic Party bigwig in New York who advised governors and mayors and who began his long career in politics by helping oust Tammany Hall boss Carmine DeSapio in 1961. He was briefly a candidate for mayor of NYC in 1977 but later withdrew and backed ultimate winner Ed Koch. (June 22) Julian Goodman, 90, who while working for NBC News produced the second Kennedy-Nixon debate in 1960 and later rose to head the network, where he famously sparred with members of the Nixon administration. (July 2) Richard Tonry, 77, a Louisiana Democrat who served only four months of his congressional term before resigning amid charges he bought votes to win his party's primary. In 1976 he won an open seat, defeating Republican Bob Livingston, but shortly afterwards federal investigators uncovered his vote-buying scheme. He resigned his seat and went to prison, and was succeeded in the House by Livingston, who won a special 1977 election. (July 3) Andy Griffith, 86, a folksy TV actor who behind the scenes was a Democratic Party force in North Carolina, refusing however to ever jump into the political arena as a candidate. (July 3) Peter Kyros, 86, a four-term Democratic member of the House from Maine. In 1966, a strong Republican year, he won an open GOP House seat, and in 1974, a huge Democratic year, he was narrowly unseated by David Emery (R). (July 10) William Raspberry, 76, a Pulitzer Prize-winning syndicated columnist for the Washington Post who wrote extensively on race relations. (July 17) Fioravante (Fred) Perrotta, 80, who unsuccessfully ran for New York City Comptroller in 1969 on the ticket led by Mayor John Lindsay, who lost that year's GOP primary but went on to win re-election as a Liberal and Independent. (July 20) Gene Stipe, 85, an Oklahoma Democrat who held one of the longest continuous serving record for any state senator (1957-2003) and who finished third in the 1978 Dem primary for U.S. senator, won by David Boren. In 2003, involved in a campaign finance scandal, he resigned from office (July 21). Alexander Cockburn, 71, the leftwing journalist who wrote for The Village Voice and The Nation. (July 21) Patton Echols, 86, the Republican nominee for attorney general of Virginia in 1973. (July 26) Gore Vidal, 86, the great American writer and novelist who merits mention in this column for his two campaigns \u2013 running as the Democratic nominee for an upstate New York House seat in 1960, where he lost to GOP incumbent J. Ernest Wharton, and in the Democratic primary for the Senate in California in 1982, where he finished second to Gov. Jerry Brown. Vidal, a leftwinger, also got into a memorable on-air battle with rightwinger William F. Buckley Jr. when both were analysts covering the 1968 Democratic convention for ABC News. (July 31) Paul McCracken, 96, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Nixon. (Aug. 3) R. Peter Straus, 89, a former director of the Voice of America under President Carter who helped run Bobby Kennedy's 1964 Senate campaign in New York and was instrumental in changing the way legislative districts were drawn. After the death of his first wife, he married Marcia Lewis \u2013 mother of Monica Lewinsky \u2013 in 1998. (Aug. 6) Raymond Harding, 77, who as head of New York's Liberal Party for decades wielded far more power than his party warranted. It was long said the Liberal Party was neither liberal nor a party, but Harding \u2013 and his predecessor, Alex Rose \u2013 made tremendous use of its influence, with politicians of both parties seeking his party's position on the ballot. Ultimately, the party lost its ballot line in 2002 and in 2009 Harding was caught up in a corruption scandal that sent state Comptroller Alan Hevesi (D) to prison. (Aug. 9) James Naughton, 73, a Pulitzer Prize-winning former White House and national correspondent for the New York Times during the Nixon, Ford and Carter administrations, who later served as a senior editor for the Philadelphia Inquirer. (Aug. 11) Nellie Gray, 88, who in 1974 began the annual March for Life anti-abortion demonstration in Washington, held each January on the anniversary of the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion. (Aug. 13?) Aubrey Dunn, 84, a conservative Democratic former state senator from New Mexico who lost his party's gov. primary for governor in 1982 to Toney Anaya in what was considered one of the dirtiest contests in state history. (Aug. 23) George Gunther, 92, a maverick Connecticut Republican who was the longest serving state senator (1967-2006) in state history. (Aug. 26) Donald Tewes, 96, a Wisconsin Republican who served one term in the House before losing a 1958 re-election bid to Robert Kastenmeier (D), whom he defeated two years prior. Tewes also lost the 1960 rubber match. (Aug. 29) Charlie Rose, 73, a champion of tobacco interests during his 24 years in the House as a Democrat from North Carolina. He won an open seat in 1972 and during his tenure battled efforts to combat anti-smoking legislation. He rose to become chair of the House Administration Committee but also was under an ethics cloud later in his career over campaign funds. In 1994, after the Republican won control of the House, Rose challenged Rep. Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) in the race for minority leader, a contest he lost decisively. He retired in 1996. (Sept. 3) Bob Gammage, 74, a Texas Democrat who lost to, defeated, and lost again to Ron Paul in three memorable congressional contests. In 1975, Rep. Bob Casey, a conservative Democrat, resigned to join the Federal Maritime Agency. In a big surprise, Paul beat Gammage, then a state senator, in the Feb. 1976 special election. Gammage returned the favor in November, beating Paul by 236 votes, but Paul won the 1978 rubber match. A former judge, Gammage came out of retirement in 2006 but lost his party's gov. primary to Rep. Chris Bell, who went on to lose the general to GOP Gov. Rick Perry. (Sept. 10) Russell Train, 92, one of the country's leading conservationists who became the first chair of the Council of Environmental Quality in 1970 and headed up the EPA under President Nixon. A Republican, he was later the first president of the World Wildlife Fund's American chapter. (Sept. 17) Henry Champ, 75, who covered politics and Congress as a journalist with NBC News and who later returned to his native Canada and the CBC. (Sept. 23) Sam Steiger, 83, a colorful and sometimes outlandish Republican member of the House from Arizona who served five terms. In 1966, on his second try, he ousted Rep. George Senner (D). He served until 1976, when he ran for the Senate seat being vacated by fellow Republican Paul Fannin. But a bitter primary battle with Rep. John Conlan \u2013 one filled with allegations of anti-Semitism and corruption \u2013 damaged Steiger's chances in the general election, where he was defeated by Democrat Dennis DeConcini. He also ran for governor as a Libertarian in 1982 and lost the GOP gov. primary in 1990. And he served one term as mayor of Prescott. (Sept. 26) Eugene Genovese, 82, who as a Marxist professor at Rutgers Univ. in 1965 said he welcomed a Viet Cong victory in Vietnam \u2013 which became an issue in the N.J. gov. race that year \u2013 but who later in life became a conservative Catholic. (Sept. 26) John Silber, 86, a controversial and cantankerous president of Boston University whose one stab at elective politics came in 1990, when he was the Democratic nominee for governor of Massachusetts and narrowly lost to Republican Bill Weld. (Sept. 27) Arthur O. Sulzberger, 86, the publisher of the New York Times who led the newspaper into the modern age and whose decision to publish the \"Pentagon Papers,\" a classified history of the Vietnam War, enraged President Nixon and led to a landmark court decision. (Sept. 29) Barry Commoner, 95, an environmental and anti-nuclear activist who was the presidential nominee of the Citizens Party in 1980. (Sept. 30) Joe Meyer, 71, the state Treasurer of Wyoming since 2007, who previously served as attorney general and secretary of state. (Oct. 6) Mervyn Dymally, 86, who was the first black elected to California's state assembly, state senate and lt. gov.; he also served in the House. First elected to the Assembly in 1962 and then the Senate four years later, he was elected lt. gov. in 1974, winning in the Democratic sweep that also pulled in Jerry Brown as governor. But four years later, amid rumors of corruption and imminent indictment (which never came), Dymally was unseated by Republican Mike Curb. In 1980, Rep. Charles Wilson, a white Democrat representing parts of Los Angeles County that included Compton, was under investigation for his role in a South Korean bribery scandal. Wilson faced both Dymally and former Rep. Mark Hannaford in the primary, which was won by Dymally (Wilson finished third). Dymally kept the seat until his retirement in 1992. In 2002, he returned to the same Assembly seat he occupied in the 1960s. (Oct. 7) Sam Gibbons, 92, a Florida Democrat who served 17 terms in the House and reached the chairmanship, albeit briefly, of the Ways and Means Committee. First elected to Congress in 1962, he was a leader in crafting anti-poverty legislation but also voted against various civil rights bills early in his career. He made an ill-advised challenge Rep. Tip O'Neill (D-Mass.) for majority leader in 1973, a move that basically isolated him from attaining true power. Long the number two on Ways & Means to chairman Dan Rostenkowski, he moved up after the Illinois Democrat was indicted in June 1994 on corruption charges. But his stay as chairman didn't last long, as the GOP took control of the House that November. He retired in 1996. (Oct. 10) William Friday, 92, the former president of the University of North Carolina system who rebuffed numerous pleas from Tar Heel State Democrats to run for office, notably the Senate in 1986. (Oct. 12) Arlen Specter, 82, the longest serving senator in Pennsylvania history who defied and often disappointed members of both political parties, even as he resided in them. Tremendously bright but often prickly and possessing an oversized ego, Specter spent 29 of his 30 years in the Senate as a Republican, where he frustrated conservatives during the 1987 Supreme Court nomination confirmation battle of Robert Bork and angered liberals during the 1991 confirmation battle of Clarence Thomas. Specter was first elected district attorney of Philadelphia on the Republican line in 1965, even though he had been a Democrat. Switching to the Republicans, he was his new party's nominee for mayor two years later but lost to incumbent Democrat James Tate. In 1973 he was ousted as Philly D.A. after two terms. His losing streak was extended in bids for the Senate in 1976 and governor in 1978, losing the respective primaries to John Heinz and Dick Thornburgh. In 1980, with Sen. Dick Schweiker (R) retiring, he finally triumphed, defeating former Pittsburgh Mayor Pete Flaherty. A pro-choice Republican in an increasingly conservative party, he drew the ire of the right with his cross-examining of Robert Bork, President Reagan's ill-fated Supreme Court nominee in 1987. Four years later, his long alliance with feminists became frayed with his relentless questioning of Anita Hill, who accused Bush Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. With many on the left and right less enthused about his candidacy, he struggled to win a third term in 1992. Three years later, in a \"what was he possibly thinking\" moment, he made a bid for the GOP presidential nomination, but withdrew when he ran out of money, well before the primaries. He relied on endorsements from President Bush and fellow GOP Pa. senator Rick Santorum, a strong conservative, to withstand a 2004 rightwing primary challenge from Rep. Pat Toomey. But as 2010 was approaching, Specter \u2013 with his votes for many of President Obama's initiatives \u2013 was never going to win another GOP primary against Toomey. So, with encouragement from Obama, he switched to the Democratic Party in 2009. But rank and file Democrats weren't as thrilled with having Specter in their ranks as the White House was, and Specter, hoping for a sixth term, wound up losing the Democratic primary to Rep. Joe Sestak (who wound up losing the general to Toomey). Earlier in his career, he was an attorney on the Warren Commission, which was responsible for uncovering what happened during the assassination of President Kennedy. Specter was a proponent of the \"single bullet\" theory, that it was one bullet that claimed JFK's life. (Oct. 14) James Grover, 93, a low-key Republican House member from Long Island who was first elected to Congress in 1962 and served until he was narrowly defeated in 1974 by Democrat Tom Downey. (Oct. 14) John Durkin, 76, a New Hampshire Democrat who triumphed in one of the most controversial Senate election decisions in recent history. Running against GOP Rep. Louis Wyman in 1974 for the seat being vacated by Sen. Norris Cotton (R), Durkin was initially thought to have lost the race by 355 votes out of more than 222,000 cast. After a recount, it was determined that Durkin won by ten votes. Then, a second recount, conducted by a Republican-majority three-member ballot commission, decided Wyman the victor by two votes. Meanwhile, the Democratic-led U.S. Senate refused to seat Wyman and eventually declared the seat vacant \u2013 until both sides agreed to a September 1975 special election, which Durkin won comfortably. In 1980, Durkin was defeated for re-election by Warren Rudman. In 1990 he again tried for the Senate but lost in a landslide to Robert Smith (R). (Oct. 16) George McGovern, 90, a liberal anti-Vietnam War Democratic senator from conservative South Dakota who took on the Old Guard to win his party's presidential nomination in 1972, only to get crushed in a 49-state landslide loss to President Richard Nixon in November. In 1956, McGovern knocked off GOP Rep. Harold Lovre and won re-election two years later over Gov. (and war hero) Joe Foss. In 1960, he ran for the Senate but was beaten by Republican incumbent Karl Mundt. Two years later, after Sen. Francis Case (R) died, McGovern again sought the Senate, this time narrowly triumphing over Joe Bottum, a former lt. gov. who was appointed as Case's successor. (\"McGovern is tops,\" read his campaign button.) In 1968, the same year he was up for another Senate term, he briefly became a presidential hopeful following the assassination of Bobby Kennedy. In the years after the disastrous Democratic convention, he was a leader in the effort to change the party nominating rules. Taking advantage of same, and running as a full-fledged opponent of the Vietnam War, he stunned the Democratic establishment by winning the presidential nomination on the first ballot. If the '68 convention was utter chaos, the '72 convention wasn't much better, with McGovern accepting the nomination in the early morning hours, well after the TV lights went off, and nominating the ill-fated Thomas Eagleton as his running mate; 17 days later Eagleton withdrew and was replaced by Sargent Shriver. Many Democrats and union leaders refused to get behind McGovern, who lost in a popular- and electoral-vote landslide to Nixon. He won a third Senate term in 1974 but his tenure ended in 1980, when he was clobbered by GOP Congressman Jim Abdnor. McGovern, always popular with the \"peace\" wing of the Democratic Party, made another bid for the presidential nomination in 1984, but it went nowhere. (Oct. 21) Russell Means, 72, a Native American activist and leader of the American Indian Movement that occupied Wounded Knee, S.D., in a famous 1973 protest. He sought the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination in 1988 but lost out to former GOP Rep. Ron Paul. In 2002 he ran an independent campaign for governor of New Mexico. (Oct. 22) Letitia Baldrige, 86, the social secretary to First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, later becoming an authority on etiquette. (Oct. 29) John Reed, 91, a Republican who during his seven years as governor of Maine worked to improve the state's education system. On Dec. 30, 1959, Gov. Clinton Clausen (D) died in his sleep; Reed, as president of the state Senate, automatically succeeded him. He won a special election in 1960 and, in 1962, he was re-elected by fewer than 500 votes. In 1966 he was defeated by Kenneth Curtis, a Democrat. He was later the U.S. ambassador to Sri Lanka, first under President Ford and later under President Reagan. (Oct. 31) David Cornwell, 67, an Indiana Democrat who won an open House seat in 1976 only to lose it two years later to Joel Deckard (R). (Nov. 2) Joseph Early, 79, whose nine terms as a Democratic congressman from Massachusetts came to an end in 1992 for his involvement in the House banking scandal. He won an open House seat centered around Worcester in 1974 and usually won re-election by overwhelming margins, often running unopposed. But the revelation that he was among those who bounced checks at the House bank cost him his seat in '92, when he lost to Peter Blute (R). (Nov. 9) Helen Milliken, 89, who as Michigan's First Lady \u2013 she was married to Gov. Bill Milliken (R) \u2013 was an outspoken advocate for abortion rights and the Equal Rights Amendment. (Nov. 16) Warren Rudman, 82, a two-term (1981-92) centrist Republican senator from New Hampshire who waged a long and lonely battle to balance the federal budget, including the passage of the Gramm-Rudman Act of 1987, which was designed to limit government spending. In 1980 he unseated Sen. John Durkin (D) and was re-elected six years later, before retiring in '92. He also served on the committee investigating the Iran-Contra scandal in 1987 as well as the Senate Ethics Committee during the Keating Five scandal in 1991, opposed the GOP's alliance with the religious right, and played a major role in the selection of David Souter to the Supreme Court in 1990. (Nov. 19) David O'B. Martin, 68, a six-term Republican congressman from upstate New York, a strong protector of pet military projects crucial to Fort Drum, located in his district. In his first race, in 1980, he handily defeated former Lt. Gov. Mary Anne Krupsak (D). He retired in 1992. (Nov. 20) James Hodgson, 96, who in 1970 replaced George Schultz as Secretary of Labor in President Nixon's administration and later served as ambassador to Japan. (Nov. 28) Jerry Finkelstein, 96, a longtime Democratic powerbroker in NYC who spent freely to get his son, Andrew Stein, elected to various local and citywide offices for two decades beginning in the late 1960s, and who himself ran just once, an unsuccessful bid for state senator in Manhattan in 1942. (Nov. 28) Jack Brooks, 89, a folksy but powerful Texas Democrat who served on the House Judiciary Committee during the impeachment hearings of President Nixon and later chaired the committee until he was shockingly unseated in the 1994 GOP tidal wave. First elected to Congress in 1952, he was close with two fellow Texas Democrats, House Speaker Sam Rayburn and Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson. Brooks was with Johnson in the 1963 Dallas motorcade where President Kennedy was assassinated. In that famous photo of LBJ being sworn in on Air Force One, he is standing behind a grieving Jacqueline Kennedy. In the mid 1950s, he was one of the few Southern Democrats who refused to sign the so-called Southern Manifesto, which called for continuing segregation. In 1974 he helped write articles of impeachment against Nixon. After Rep. Peter Rodino (D-N.J.) retired in 1988, Brooks became chairman of the Judiciary Committee \u2013 a position he held until the 1994 elections, when he fell to Republican Steve Stockman after the committee approved a bill that banned assault weapons, even though he himself was considered pro-gun. (Dec. 4) Jon Kest, 57, a New York community organizer who was one of the founders of the Working Families Party. (Dec. 5) Doyle Conner, 83, a Florida Democrat who in 1957 became the youngest House speaker (age 28) in state history and then went on to spend 30 years as the state's agriculture commissioner until his retirement in 1990. (Dec. 16) SEN. DANIEL INOUYE, 88, who has represented Hawaii in Congress as long as it has been a state, and who at the time of his death was the second longest serving senator in history. A highly decorated World War II combat veteran, Inouye was elected to the House in 1959, the year Hawaii became number 50. He served until 1962, when he won the first of nine Senate elections. He was the first Japanese-American to serve in the House or the Senate. Long considered a \"conscience\" of the Senate who worked with Republicans, he was never known to be a seeker of publicity or personal acclaim. But he played key roles on both the Senate Watergate Committee, in 1973-74, and later on the committee that investigated the Iran-Contra affair. He also gave his party's keynote address at the 1968 Democratic convention. At his death he was the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, a position that now falls to the senior member of the majority party, Pat Leahy of Vermont. (Dec. 17) Frank Macchiarola, widely considered to be one of the most effective school chancellors in New York City history and who finished third in the 1989 Democratic primary for NYC comptroller. (Dec. 18) Robert Bork, 85, whose rejected nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1987 split the Senate in two, with implications that continue to this day. Bork had long been a controversial figure; as Solicitor General under President Nixon in 1973, he fired Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox when others, such as the Attorney General, decided to resign instead. As a federal appeals court judge, he was seen as a \"strict constructionist\" and a strong conservative, and when he was nominated by President Reagan in '87, to succeed the retiring Lewis Powell, he did not hide his philosophy. Conservatives welcomed the nomination; liberals detested it, with Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) famously saying, \"Robert Bork's America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions,\" and \"blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters.\" Hurting Bork's cause was an article he wrote for the New Republic in 1963 when he argued against the public accommodations sections of the proposed 1964 Civil Rights Act that was aimed at integrating restaurants. The Senate, as well as the nation, was divided over the nomination. The debate became unusually personal and political; ultimately, the Senate defeated the nomination by a vote of 58-42. Many trace the total lack of comity in the Senate today to the Bork hearings. (Dec. 19) Bill McBride, 67, a Florida attorney and the Democratic nominee for governor in 2002, when he lost to incumbent Republican Jeb Bush. McBride had defeated former U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno in the Dem primary. His wife, Alex Sink, was the 2010 Dem gov. nominee.

Louis Wyman (R) is the winner, by two votes, of the 1974 Senate race to replace the retiring Republican Norris Cotton. After an earlier recount, the Democratic nominee, John Durkin, had been declared the winner by ten votes. Both Wyman and Durkin say the fairest way to decide the matter is to have a runoff election (Dec. 24, 1974). The U.S. Senate will later declare the seat vacant. By the time the candidates agree to another election, in September 1975, Durkin will win easily. Got a question?

            "article_content": "Win or lose on Election Day, Republican Mitt Romney has already made history as the first Mormon to win a major party presidential nomination. But has his race for the White House changed Americans' perceptions and stereotypes of the small, insular but fast-growing religion, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints? And, by extension, has Romney affected how Mormons view their place in the nation? The Mormon Salt Lake temple in Salt Lake City.\n                \n                    \n                    George Frey/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Mormon Salt Lake temple in Salt Lake City. Two noted Mormon experts we turned to as the 2012 presidential campaign draws to a close said that they see national perceptions of the religion emerging largely unchanged by Romney's run, but that perhaps it has helped Mormonism shed a bit of its mystery. \"I think the general reader has become more educated about Mormonism, and some of its reputation for strangeness has worn off, though it retains its deserved reputation for difference,\" says Kathleen Flake, author of The Politics of American Religious Identity: The Seating of Senator Reed Smoot, Mormon Apostle. \"Certainly, more people will have heard of it,\" says Flake, a Vanderbilt Divinity School American religion professor. \"But with few exceptions, what they have heard pro and con seems remarkably similar to what was being said in the 1970s.\" Matthew Bowman, author of The Mormon People: The Making of An American Faith and an assistant religion professor at Hampden-Sydney College, says he has come to a similar conclusion. \"The main obstacle to integration for any religion in the U.S. is, simply, size,\" Bowman says. \"Fear and antagonism toward Catholics in America declined in tandem with the growth of the Catholic population in the U.S.\" \"Mormons,\" he said, \"still make up only 2 percent of the American population; they likely still have hills to climb.\" A Pew Research Center survey of American Mormons released in January, well before Romney captured the GOP nomination, explored the church members' vision of themselves, and how they believe they are perceived by non-Mormons. We also asked Flake and Bowman to help us discern how the past 10 months may have affected attitudes reflected in the study. Romney isn't the first Mormon to seek the presidency. In fact, nine others sought the nation's highest office before Romney. They include Mormon founder Joseph Smith in 1844, and Romney's father, George, in 1968. Additionally, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman made a brief run for the GOP nomination this year. Here's what we wanted to know, and what Bowman and Flake had to tell us: NPR: The church, along with its attributes of community and giving and focus on family, has also been consistently portrayed as inward looking, and with a complicated history that includes polygamy, discrimination and accumulation of wealth. Has Romney's run done anything to change that, and, if so, what and how? Bowman: Romney, unfortunately, tends to embody some of the more benign stereotypes: wealthy, awkward and so on. What his run has done, however, is bring attention to the diversity of Mormons in the United States. The variety of Mormons who have become prominent in the media, and Romney's occasional head-butting with his co-religionist [Senate Majority Leader] Harry Reid [the Nevada Democrat], have done a fair amount to refute the great myth of Mormonism: that it's a monolith. Flake: Probably not. More than sound bites, drive-by photo ops and editorials are needed on these complex issues and common canards. This is not to fault the press. Electioneering is not given to much more than this and most Americans have never had any patience for theology. NPR: The question of whether Mormonism is a Christian religion still divides the general public and has made Romney's path to the Republican nomination even more historic. Mormons say they feel hostility from evangelical Christians, an important part of the GOP base, and they should, given Pew's findings. We're now seeing numbers that suggest [a] party highly motivated to support Romney. Politically, what have you seen happen over the past 10 months that brought this part of the Republican electorate around? Bowman: I don't know that the electorate has, actually, changed much. Evangelicals are rather bitterly divided over Romney, but that's been true from the beginning, and I suspect most of that faction of evangelicals who make up the religious right are in the religious right because of their politics, and will swallow hard and vote for the candidate who best matches those politics. That said, there is probably some small faction who are just going to stay home. Mitt Romney, his wife, Ann, and then-Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, attend the 2008 funeral of Gordon B. Hinckley, president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in Salt Lake City.\n                \n                    \n                    Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mitt Romney, his wife, Ann, and then-Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, attend the 2008 funeral of Gordon B. Hinckley, president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in Salt Lake City. Flake: Romney's nomination necessitated the silencing of evangelical anti-Mormonism. Other explanations, it seems to me, underestimate their antipathy \u2014 racial and religious \u2014 of the present administration and their fear of a second term. NPR: There are still people uncomfortable with the notion of a Mormon president; some cite the Mormon belief that the Constitution, and, with it, democracy, were \"divinely inspired,\" as Richard and Joan Ostling wrote in \"Mormon in America.\" If Mitt Romney wins the White House, how do you see his faith informing his decisions? How is this different from John F. Kennedy becoming the first Catholic president? Bowman: Romney is far different from Kennedy. Kennedy's election marked the culmination of a long process of Catholic integration in the U.S. Romney's run is still early in Mormonism's integration. Of course Romney's faith might inform his decisions as president, just as the faith of any believer informs the ways they live their lives and do their job. Mormon faith in American exceptionalism, though it differs in origin from that of, say, conservative Protestants in America, is not so different than that held by, for instance, Ronald Reagan or George Bush, which means it's well within the spectrum of American politics. Some might be worried, as some were worried about Kennedy, that the leader of their faith would dictate the decisions of the president. Kennedy specifically repudiated this possibility; Romney has not. But in practice it's extraordinarily unlikely that the LDS leadership would do something like it; they are well aware of these suspicions, have been since the early 20th century. Flake: Our times and his party, not Romney's faith, would mark the difference. Whereas Kennedy could satisfy his electorate by pledging separation from religion, Romney will have to offer special status to religion, as promised in his 2007 speech on the subject. As for the extent to which Mormonism will inform his decisions, the campaign seems the best measure of that. If you can find Mormonism in his current policy decisions, you will see it in future ones. NPR: Nearly half of the Mormons surveyed by Pew said that there is \"a lot of discrimination\" against Mormons. In what context do you think Mormons experience discrimination, and how might Romney's run, and potential presidency, alleviate the perception and/or the condition? Bowman: There's a lot of residual sense of persecution within Mormonism, deriving, of course, from the church's historic experience in America, but also from the rather unending barrage of evangelical countercult organizations that target Mormonism. Regardless, I think a lot of Mormons were rather distressed at much of what came out in the past couple of years: [Former Arkansas Gov.] Mike Huckabee's comments in Romney's first run, the Book of Mormon musical, and so on. What's interesting is that while traditionally anti-Mormonism presented Mormons as a dangerous threat to America, more recently, Mormons have been presented as naive, uptight, and unbearably nice. Caricatures of Romney himself certainly fall into the latter category, and thus will probably reinforce rather than eliminate stereotype. Flake: \"Discrimination\" is an inapt term for the treatment of Latter-day Saints. In America, they are simply too white and middle class to deserve its use. More accurately, they are ridiculed and stereotyped from the right and left as wrongly religious or too religious, respectively. This estimation of them as presumptively threatening or foolish will, I expect, continue to diminish as they become better known. If Romney is elected, press coverage of him may lead to greater familiarity with his religion. At least, this will be the case if the press continues to try to explain his politics in terms of his religion. NPR: Another interesting Pew finding was that only 30 percent of Mormons said that others see Mormonism as mainstream, yet 63 percent said acceptance of Mormonism \"is rising.\" Where do you think that Mormons find this rising acceptance, and has Romney specifically done anything the 10 months since the survey was released to make Mormonism \"mainstream\"? Bowman: To many Americans the problem is that Mormons are \"too\" mainstream, with their white shirts, conservative haircuts, and so on. They're a poor fit in an America that increasingly prizes diversity and informality. I don't know that Romney has specifically tried to persuade Americans that Mormons are mainstream because, in fact, many Mormons \"feel\" mainstream, even if other Americans don't think so. Romney has almost certainly had about zero angst over whether or not his religion's particular theology might prevent him from running for president, just as Stephenie Meyer (author of the Twilight series) probably sees no conflict between writing about vampires and going to a Mormon chapel on Sundays. That, I think, may account for the discrepancy in this poll: Mormons are talking about how they perceive others perceiving them, not about themselves. Flake: Latter-day Saints probably see improvement in the mere fact of the general public's attempt to understand them as they see themselves, not simplistically as their sectarian antagonists have caricatured them. Romney's refusal to be drawn into theological discussions has probably helped to direct the conversation away from historically internecine debates and toward understanding his church as a contemporary social phenomenon.",

As both parties turn to the general election, and the potentially pivotal role of minority voters, battles over voter identification and other new state election laws are intensifying. Voting rights groups, who say the new laws discriminate against minority voters, won a key victory Thursday with a federal judge's decision to strike down portions of a Florida law that tightened rules for third-party groups that register voters. In his opinion, U.S. District Court Judge Robert L. Hinkle said: \"Together speech and voting are constitutional rights of special significance; they are the rights most protective of all others, joined in this respect by the ability to vindicate one's rights in a federal court. ...[W]hen a plaintiff loses an opportunity to register a voter, the opportunity is gone forever ... And allowing responsible organizations to conduct voter-registration drives \u2014 thus making it easier for citizens to register and vote \u2014 promotes democracy.\" The ruling comes as Florida faces similar challenges to its effort to purge its voter rolls of potential noncitizens. The Justice Department has filed suit to stop the practice, arguing that it violates the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which protects minorities, and the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, which governs voter purges. The Tampa Bay Times reported that Florida officials are considering fighting the lawsuit: \"We are firmly committed to doing the right thing and preventing ineligible voters from being able to cast a ballot,\" said Chris Cate, spokesman for Secretary of State Ken Detzner. Florida also has been criticized for reversing rules that had made it easier for former felons to vote. Since 2008, controversial changes to state election laws have spread across the nation to restrict voter registration drives, scale back early voting periods or stop people from registering to vote on Election Day. Before the changes, all three practices were credited with helping to increase the young and minority voter turnout in 2008 that elected President Obama. Young and minority voters are expected to again be key in this year's election. That's why Obama's re-election campaign recently launched an effort to educate voters about the new requirements. The campaign's new website, www.gottavote.org, helps voters register, lays out legal changes in all the states, and asks lawyers to volunteer their expertise in election law. The effort is designed mainly to address the roughly 31 states that now have laws requiring voters to present identification at the polls. About 15 of the states have adopted the strictest rules, requiring people to show state-issued photo IDs. The voter ID and other laws are the result of a push mostly by Republicans who say they want to prevent election fraud. Democrats and voting rights activists argue that they are unnecessary because voter fraud is rare \u2014 often citing the findings of a federal panel. Opponents also say the laws are part of a Republican strategy to suppress turnout among eligible voters \u2014 particularly the young, the poor and African-Americans \u2014 who tend to favor Democratic candidates. The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, which opposes the laws, says as many as 5 million voters could be turned away at the polls. About 18 percent of seniors and 25 percent of African-Americans don't have state-issued photo identification, according to the center. The Brennan Center, which represented plaintiffs in the Florida lawsuit, found the laws have passed primarily in presidential battleground states. The voter ID states hold 171 electoral votes, or 63 percent of the 270 votes needed to win the presidency. Voter ID advocates cite numerous polls showing strong support among both Democrats and Republicans. A Rasmussen Reports survey in April found that 73 percent of respondents believe the ID requirement isn't discriminatory. Supporters also say voter ID laws aren't intended to discourage voters, but to protect the authenticity of their ballots. In Virginia, after Gov. Bob McDonnell signed a new voter ID bill recently, he issued an executive order directing the state to send new registration cards to every active voter. The move by McDonnell, a Republican, is unusual among voter ID states and is widely seen as an effort to blunt accusations that the state is trying to suppress voter turnout. McDonnell wrote in his executive order: \"All eligible voters regardless of income, race, age, and other factors should be able to have equal access to the electoral process and should be made aware of any changes that may impact their ability to vote.\" At the center of many of these legal challenges is Attorney General Eric Holder. His Justice Department has gone to court to overturn numerous state laws and blocked implementation of voter ID laws in states such as South Carolina. In each case, the Justice Department has argued that the laws would disenfranchise minority voters. On Wednesday, Holder told a gathering of the Congressional Black Caucus that \"both overt and subtle forms of discrimination remain all too common and have not yet been relegated to the pages of history.\" Holder continued: \"If a state passes a new voting law and meets its burden of showing that the law is not discriminatory, we will follow the law and will approve that change. ... When a jurisdiction fails to meet its burden in proving that a voting change will not have a racially discriminatory effect, we will object, as we have in 15 different cases.\" Critics complain that Holder is taking an unabashedly, and unethically, political stance against voter ID laws. They say that, as the nation's top law enforcement officer, Holder instead should be enforcing these laws, particularly since the Supreme Court upheld Indiana's voter ID measure in 2008. That ruling found that requiring voters to produce identification is not unconstitutional, and that states have a \"valid interest\" in improving election procedures and deterring fraud. Supporters believe the decision should have settled the controversy. On Friday, The Wall Street Journal's conservative editorial board accused Holder, who is African-American, of trying to \"inflame racial antagonism\": \"The United States of America has a black President whose chief law enforcement officer, Attorney General Eric Holder, is also black. They have a lot of political power. So how are they using it? Well, one way is to assert to black audiences that voter ID laws are really attempts to disenfranchise black Americans. And liberals think Donald Trump's birther fantasies are offensive?\" \"... The two most powerful men in America are black, two of the last three Secretaries of State were black, numerous corporate CEOs and other executives are black, and minorities of many races now win statewide elections in states that belonged to the Confederacy, but the AG implies that Jim Crow is on the cusp of a comeback.\" The editorial says Holder's strategy is to scare minorities into seeing voter ID laws as a threat, hopefully energizing them to turn out for Obama in large numbers in November.",

Maybe Robert De Niro didn't know. Or maybe he forgot. But when the superstar actor joked at a New York Obama campaign fundraiser Monday evening which Michelle Obama attended about the country not being ready for a white first lady, he got into dangerous territory for President Obama. According to an Obama campaign pool report, De Niro deadpanned: \"Callista Gingrich. Karen Santorum. Ann  Romney. Now do you really think our country is ready for a white first lady?\" The well-heeled audience laughed uproariously. Someone shouted \"No!\" De Niro then added, \"Too soon,  right?\" The Obama campaign distanced itself from De Niro's joke Tuesday. \"We believe the joke was inappropriate,\" said Olivia Alair, Mrs. Obama's campaign press secretary. Meanwhile, Newt Gingrich, the Republican presidential candidate, pounced: \"What De Niro said last night was inexcusable and the president should apologize for him. It was at an Obama fundraiser, it is exactly wrong, it divides the country...\" While De Niro was clearly being mock ironic by recalling the kind of comments that many whites made about blacks within living memory, he ran afoul of the unwritten rule Obama and his tight knit team of advisers have operated under going back to his 2008 campaign. Anything that reinforces racial divisions or focuses attention on the president's race should be avoided. Obama succeeded in winning office, in part, because he didn't run as an African American politician. Instead, he ran as a politician who happened to be African American. Some might not see the difference in that but it's significant. The former places the stress on group identity and would have risked making him seem like too much of \"the other\" to too many Americans than he already seemed. The latter emphasized his personal story, parts of which many Americans could identify with. It doesn't take a Harvard-trained social scientist to figure out that in a society that has a way to go before it is post-racial, if indeed it ever gets there, Obama needed to walk the tricky line of downplaying race where ever possible without doing it to such a degree that he hurt himself in the eyes of black voters. As he campaigned, so he has mostly governed. He's a president who happens to be African American, the first to occupy that office. Not that it's been easy to avoid being pulled into the racial vortex. He interjected himself into the controversy that ensued after Cambridge, Mass. Police Sgt. James Crowley, who is white, handcuffed the Harvard scholar-celebrity Professor Henry Louis Gates, who is black, in the historian's own home. Then there was his Agriculture secretary's summary firing of Shirley Sherrod after the African American former Agriculture Department official was victimized by the release of a selectively edited video by the late conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart. The abridged video made it appear Sherrod boasted to a black audience of practicing reverse discrimination when she had done nothing of the kind. But as reporters who have written about the 2008 campaign and Obama presidency have noted, the nation's sorry racial history and continued difficulties on the issue are just a political minefield the president would rather not have to walk through if he doesn't have to. For De Niro it was just a joke. For Obama, anything that could prevent him from reaching 270 electoral votes couldn't be less funny.",

            "article_content": "The U.S. Supreme Court has ordered a lower court to redo an interim legislative redistricting plan in Texas, giving greater deference to the plan drawn up by the Republican-controlled Legislature. The unsigned and unanimous ruling came 11 days after the justices heard arguments in the case, but the decision is unlikely to be the last word on how the Texas reapportionment will play out. The 2010 census showed that the Texas population grew by more than 4 million people, and as a result, the state was allocated four new congressional seats. But when the Republican-controlled state Legislature came up with its redistricting plan, black and Hispanic voters \u2014 who accounted for three-fourths of that population growth \u2014 challenged the plan in court. They contended it violated the nondiscrimination provisions of the Voting Rights Act. Under the voting rights law, states such as Texas with a demonstrated history of discrimination are required to clear their redistricting plans in advance, with either the Justice Department or a special three-judge court in Washington, D.C. When Texas failed to win timely pre-clearance, a federal court in Texas drew up an interim plan that maximized the power of the state's booming Latino population. The result was that three of the four new congressional seats would probably go to Democrats; under the plan drawn up by the GOP-dominated Legislature, three of the four seats would most likely go to Republicans. 'Texas Won More Than It Lost' Texas appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, and on Friday the high court ruled that the lower court had not given adequate deference to the state plan. The justices rejected the notion that a plan that has not been pre-cleared is totally invalid, and they told the lower court to use the state plan as the starting point, make an educated guess as to what parts of it are illegal under the Voting Rights Act, and fix just those parts. Although minority groups sought to put an optimistic gloss on the decision, voting rights experts said Texas was the victor, at least for now. \"I think it's clear Texas won more than it lost,\" says Yale law professor Heather Gerken.  \"What it really wanted was something close to the plan that its own Legislature proposed, and that's ultimately what it's going to get.\" In its unsigned opinion, the Supreme Court told the lower court in Texas that it had erred in several ways. Most important, for the first time the court said that to depart from the state Legislature's plan, the lower court must first make a determination that there is \"reasonable probability\" that the plan violates either the one-person, one-vote principle or the Voting Rights Act. But if that sounds definitive, it is not.  'A Train Wreck For The Federal Judiciary' The reason is that here the Supreme Court was dealing only with an interim plan, and right now, a federal court in Washington, D.C., is hearing evidence about whether the Texas Legislature's plan deserves to win pre-clearance under the Voting Rights Act. There is every indication that sometime in the next month or so, the D.C. court will issue an opinion saying that at least some parts of the Texas plan illegally dilute minority voting strength and therefore, the plan cannot be pre-cleared. And once the D.C. court does that, that ruling becomes the new baseline. You have two different federal courts both being asked ... to make legal decisions about the same redistricting plan, with both courts kind of looking over their shoulders and trying to speculate to some extent what the other court is going to do. Richard Pildes, New York University law professor \"The whole situation is sort of a train wreck for the federal judiciary,\" says New York University law professor Richard Pildes. \"You have two different federal courts both being asked, under tremendous time pressures, to make legal decisions about the same redistricting plan, with both courts kind of looking over their shoulders and trying to speculate to some extent what the other court is going to do.\" All of this takes place against a backdrop of imminent primary elections in Texas, now set for April. The Texas congressional primaries are among the earliest in the country. The federal courts do have the authority to push the primary date back if necessary. Or the fight could continue, with the 2012 elections held under one redistricting plan and the next election under a different plan. After all, there are some core issues presented in this case that have not been tackled yet \u2014 testing, for example, whether in cases where there is a huge bulge in the minority population, as there was in Texas' Latino population, the state can be required to maximize Latino voting power with a larger number of majority-Latino districts. \"I think it's highly likely to be back at the Supreme Court this year,\" Yale law professor Gerken says. \"Texas has won the first battle, but there is a long war ahead of it, and it may well lose.\" Separate Ruling On West Virginia Case Texas wasn't the only state with a redistricting plan that the Supreme Court dealt with Friday. In a case from West Virginia, the court blocked a lower court order that had overturned a redistricting plan because there was some minor population variance between districts. The lower court said there needed to be \"zero variance.\" The Supreme Court prevented that decision from going into effect to allow an appeal to go forward. The practical effect would seem to be that elections will go on this year in West Virginia under the bipartisan plan drawn up by the state Legislature. Pildes, the NYU professor, notes that for years, the Supreme Court has driven redistricting plans to be absolutely equal in population, while many academics and voting rights experts have wanted a little play in the joints, for instance, to follow county lines. \"The fact that they issued a stay here may be a signal that the court is open to rethinking that issue ... at the margins,\" Pildes says.",

The NAACP Legal Defense Fund has been called the law firm for black America. Once run by Thurgood Marshall, the group played a major role in desegregating public schools and fighting restrictions at the ballot box. Now, the Legal Defense Fund is preparing for a new leader \u2014 just as the Supreme Court considers cases that could pare back on those gains. What does it mean to fight for civil rights when the nation's first black president has been re-elected and his attorney general is African-American, too? That's the challenge for Sherrilyn Ifill, a law professor at the University of Maryland. Next month, she's set to become the next leader of the Legal Defense Fund. \"There are adult generations that have no memory of the civil rights movement, who are unaware of its sights, its sounds, what it meant, the seminal way in which it shaped how many of us think about America and think about the world,\" Ifill says. So, Ifill says, a lot of people have a hard time squaring \"the picture of a black president and his family and the reality of what life is like for people at the bottom.\" She means people of color who fell into a deep hole of poverty during the economic crisis. Too many of them, she says, still have a hard time finding homes and a good education because of the color of their skin. Theodore Shaw, a Columbia University law professor who used to lead the Legal Defense Fund, says Ifill is more than up to the task of making that case to the public. \"She's tough in the right way,\" Shaw says. \"And when I say she is tough, I mean she can make difficult decisions. She is not going to be pushed around. She can run an institution and run it well.\" One of the first, and biggest, items on Ifill's agenda is a pair of cases at the U.S. Supreme Court this term. The first involves a test of the affirmative action system at the University of Texas, where a student who says she was rejected because she's white has sued to overturn the school's admissions regime. The second is a case that calls into question a key part of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Section Five of that law gives the Justice Department the power to pre-approve election changes in states with a history of discrimination. \"The bottom line is that there's another storm coming right now,\" Shaw says. \"A lot of the basic core civil rights laws and the values we have adopted over the decades since the end of the civil rights movement ... are under attack. And they're being taken up by a Supreme Court that by a very narrow margin is hostile in many respects.\" But the Supreme Court's look at those cases gets applause from Roger Clegg. Clegg works at the Center for Equal Opportunity, a conservative group that fights the use of racial preferences. \"The principal use of the Voting Rights Act now, or Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, is racially gerrymandered, segregated voting districts, which is completely at odds with what the civil rights movement was supposed to be about,\" Clegg says. Ifill, who started her career doing voting rights cases in the South at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, says one need only look at the voter ID laws some states enacted before this year's election. \"These cases demonstrate how Section 5 is such an important stopgap, because the requirement of those states to submit these changes to the Justice Department allowed the department and allowed communities to see what these voter ID laws were going to look like, to see the ways in which they were going to disproportionately, disparately and negatively affect racial minorities,\" Ifill says. Nearly 35 years ago, in a speech at Howard University, one of Ifill's predecessors at the Legal Defense Fund put it this way: \"Be careful of these people who say, 'You made it,' \" then-Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall said. \"Take it from me: It has not been solved. You can't stand still. You must move. And if you don't move, they will run over you.\" The question for Ifill and the Legal Defense Fund is how much things have changed and how much they remain the same.",

But the most effective civil rights law in U.S. history faces its most serious challenge as the Supreme Court prepares to re-examine its constitutionality. Why now? Some say it's because of the law's own success. The plaintiff in the case blames Congress for failing to amend part of the legislation to reflect changing times. Enacted in 1965, the law relies on a key provision requiring jurisdictions with a discriminatory history to get approval from the federal government before changing their election procedures. The \"preclearance\" requirement, in Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, covers nine states, mostly in the South, and parts of several other states. This year, courts used the preclearance provision to block voter identification requirements and other rule changes leading up to the recent election. The plaintiff in the Supreme Court case, Shelby County, Ala., says it should be released from the preclearance requirement because it no longer engages in voter discrimination. Shelby County argues that the mandate is unconstitutional because it's outdated and unfairly holds the county to a higher standard than the rest of the nation. From 1972 To The Present The law imposes preclearance on areas where fewer than 50 percent of minorities were registered to vote in 1972. Shelby County says its minority registration rates have risen above the threshold. The law was last reauthorized by Congress in 2006, for another 25 years. The case before the Supreme Court has raised questions about whether Congress had sufficient evidence to extend the law given that minority voting participation in most parts of the South had substantially increased by then. Similar concerns were expressed by some Supreme Court justices in a 2009 decision. The court declined to answer the constitutionality question, but in the majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts suggested that the law may not be \"justified by current needs\" and urged Congress to revisit it. The court is expected to issue a ruling next year. NPR interviewed two members of Congress who voted on the 2006 extension. The congressmen \u2014 one supported it, the other opposed it \u2014 explained their reasons for their votes and addressed criticisms about the extension. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., chaired the House Judiciary Committee at the time, overseeing the hearings on the law's extension. He also helped write the bill. Rep. John Duncan Jr., R-Tenn., a former state judge, voted against the extension. Also weighing in was Richard Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, and author of the Election Law Blog. What's your opinion of the evidence presented to Congress alleging that voting discrimination was continuing? Sensenbrenner: \"What the 12,000 pages of [testimony] showed is that in many of the jurisdictions, particularly in Georgia and Texas, there still was pervasive discrimination, and that there were [election rules] changes ... that were not cleared because they had a discriminatory effect. \"It really was a mountain of testimony. It was overwhelming. We had opponents of Section 5 come in and attempt to testify that this really wasn't the case, and they weren't able to make out a clear case.\" Duncan: \"It was not an easy vote for me because I have always gotten, by far, the highest African-American vote of any Republican in the country ... But when I looked at, I thought, you know, they haven't shown one case of anybody being denied the right to vote. Not one case in all that time. \"The key word that you said there was alleged. There was no actual proof of anybody being denied the right to vote. The proof is in the pudding ... You have the highest percentage of minority officeholders in those states ... You have just as high or higher numbers of [minority] voter registration and voter turnout in those states as in any other states in the country. \"If we did away with the law and they ever could show some instance of somebody being denied the right to vote, we could easily come back in and do something about that. But the law now solves a problem that does not exist.\" Hasen: \"When all that evidence came, the House hearings were pretty much a collusive affair between ... the chair of the Judiciary Committee, Jim Sensenbrenner, and the civil rights community. There was no real debate on the House side as to the evidence. \"I do think that there is certainly a controversy over whether much of the evidence ... was sufficient to justify the continuation of the preclearance rules.\" The preclearance formula is based on minority voter data from 1972 that are no longer accurate for most covered areas. Doesn't that weaken the argument for upholding the law? Why didn't the Congress amend the formula? Duncan: \"I actually voted for an amendment that went down to defeat that said if we're going to have this law, let's apply it to all 50 states. I just didn't think it was any longer necessary to have that law.\" Sensenbrenner: \"There's been a huge change in the South between 1965 and 2005. I don't think proportionately that there's been that much change in the South between 2005 and the end of 2012. \"But, again, there's a safety valve. If you don't think you have to be under Section 5, then you can petition to get out. That's the procedure that the people who are objecting in this court case should have done. If you can prove you have cleaned up your act and are not passing election laws that discriminate against minorities, then go convince the Justice Department, and you will be out from under the Voting Rights Act.\" Hasen: \"I certainly advocated [in blog posts and other writings] looking at whether the coverage formula should be updated, but that created a political problem ... For example, I think many people would believe that Ohio and Florida tend to be places with big problems of voting rights. Yet it would be politically difficult to single out those states for special federal supervision. Any new kind of coverage formula would create new fights in Congress. \"One thing I had proposed as a way of getting around this problem would be for the bailout provision of the law to be changed dramatically. The Justice Department would determine which jurisdiction should be entitled to a bailout, and then it would be required to bail everyone out unless there was continuing evidence of a problem with racial discrimination in voting. I thought moving to that kind of system would help the constitutional case before the Supreme Court.\" How do you think the Supreme Court will rule? Hasen: \"There is still evidence of unconstitutional conduct as found this year in the Texas redistricting case ... There certainly is some evidence of continued racial discrimination in voting, although it is far less common than in the 1960s. And when it occurs, it is more subtle. Section 5 has served to be an important bargaining chip. It's what helps minority communities get redistricting laws softened, voter identification requirements softened or changed. \"The question is whether that evidence will be sufficient to satisfy the more conservative members of the Supreme Court, who are, first of all, critical of all race-based remedies and, second, seen as already having warned the Congress that something needed to be done to fix Section 5. \"I think the mostly likely outcome is a 5-4 vote striking down the act, and the second-most likely outcome is a 5-4 vote upholding the act.\" Sensenbrenner: \"I'm proud of this law. I can say that all civil rights laws are important, but the crown jewel has been the Voting Rights Act. It has empowered minorities to be able to have a say in government. \"Going up to the Supreme Court, saying that the court should make findings that are opposite of the findings that Congress made after extremely extensive deliberation, I don't think is the way the system ought to work. \"Now those who complain about judicial activism and not deferring to the legislative decisions that have been made are forgetting about what their previous statements are, in trying to get the court to reverse a decision that has been made by an overwhelming vote of the Congress, not once but several times since 1965.\" Duncan: \"I hope that the Supreme Court strikes down most of this law, or all of it. It would have gotten much more attention in the Congress if it applied to more states and localities. \"Most members of the House regard it as simply a free vote because it didn't really apply to their states or districts ... It was just an easy way for members to show their support for civil rights even though they knew, I think almost everybody knew, the law isn't needed any longer and had outlived its time. I think they thought, 'Well, this would look good politically.' ... They saw no need to cast a futile vote against it.\"",

His enrollment came after a standoff between state segregationists and the federal government that led to a deadly riot on the Oxford campus. Today, black and white juniors and seniors at Ole Miss sit together around a table in an Honors College class on the school's turbulent history. The course is called \"Opening the Closed Society,\" and is an in-depth look at the integration of Ole Miss. Journalist Curtis Wilkie, who is white, was a senior at Ole Miss during the riot. He teaches the course with a younger black political science professor, Marvin King. King says teaching around this pivotal moment shows students the broader implications of the battle here. \"Mississippi was finally going to integrate. And if Mississippi was going to integrate ... it wasn't the last test, but it was probably most severe test,\" King says. Wilkie tells the students that 50 years ago, no one knew what would come of the standoff. Undergraduate Ole Miss students sit in an Honors College course called \"Opening the Closed Society,\" on the school's turbulent history.\n                \n                    \n                    Debbie Elliott/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Undergraduate Ole Miss students sit in an Honors College course called \"Opening the Closed Society,\" on the school's turbulent history. \"I thought, as a student, that there was a possibility the university would be closed. There was even thought that Mississippi might try to secede from the union again. That was how intense the situation was,\" Wilkie says. Learning about the intense resistance to desegregation before they were born sparks conversations about what the students have experienced in their own lives. Zack Huffman now looks differently at racial practices from his high school. \"I never really thought about until now, this conversation, but I remember having a separate white and black homecoming queen,\" says Huffman. Kaitlyn Barton went to high school just outside Jackson, the state capital. \"Still, to this day, we have elections for a white student body president and a black student body president, and that's 2012,\" says Barton. After class, Wilkie says that kind of dialogue is what talking about the past can foster. It's been unfortunate that we've been so resistant to the change. That's almost an Ole Miss tradition:  We resist change. Student Hardy DeLaughter \"If we're not willing to confront race and deal with it, especially in a place like Mississippi, we've got problems,\" he says. \"So, this is an opportunity, obviously in an integrated class, to deal with some issues that may be a little uncomfortable, but I think most of the students are willing to thrash it out.\" Indeed, as the class breaks up, Claire Douglas of Nashville asks why no one talks much about the segregated Greek system on the Ole Miss campus. Neil McMillan is a member of an all-white fraternity, and finds it troubling. \"My fraternity, the Kappa Alpha Order, is the one most closely associated with the Old South. And that is something that, I think it bothers a lot of us,\" McMillan says. \"I think it makes us reflect on how we bear ourselves, how we show that we aren't defined by the past.\" Students are confronted with symbols of the Old South daily, says Hardy DeLaughter of Biloxi. School officials have tried to curtail the use of Confederate battle flags at sporting events, and replaced the controversial mascot Colonel Reb. But DeLaughter says there's push-back. \"People say, 'Oh yeah, that's a symbol of the old way, of our roots; we don't want to get rid of that,' \" DeLaughter says. \"And it's been unfortunate that we've been so resistant to the change. That's almost an Ole Miss tradition: We resist change.\" Even the university's nickname \u2014 Ole Miss \u2014 harkens back to different times, and a connotation that student Daniel Roberts says most of his peers were unaware of. \"I just assumed it was something along the lines of Old Mississippi, or something like that, and just the Southern dialect threw it off. But come to find out that it's more of something that's associated with the colonial era of Mississippi,\" Roberts says. \"Apparently, allegedly it came from the plantation owner's wife. ... That's how the slaves referred to her, as Ole Miss.\" Roberts, who is black, and Douglas, who is white, both say that's not what Ole Miss means to them today. They are proud of strides made on campus. The student body president is a young black woman. And African-American enrollment is at a record high 16 percent of the student population. Still, Kaitlyn Barton says students are not as comfortable with each other as you might expect 50 years after the wall of segregation came down. Just take a look at the student union, she says. \"There's typically one section that's African-American and one section that's white. It's not that anyone tells us to sit there, it's just the way we separate ourselves out,\" Barton says. Student Hope Owens-Wilson says it can be daunting for black students to find their place here. \"Still there's kind of an indescribable atmosphere on campus that's alienating to students of color, which is difficult to explain. And it's often hard to talk about, because it is a kind of unpleasant thing to mention, especially during the 50th anniversary. But it's definitely something that, as we progress as a university, it needs to be aware of,\" Owens-Wilson says. As for James Meredith's legacy of integration, Owens-Wilson says: \"I don't think it's done. We still have a ways to go, so definitely there's more work to be done.\" But, she says, courses like \"Opening the Closed Society\" can keep the focus on making the University of Mississippi a more open campus.",

            "article_content": "A federal court has rejected a Texas law that would have required voters to show a photo ID before allowing them to cast a ballot, saying the measure would effectively discriminate against racial minorities and the poor. A three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., said the Texas law \u2014 passed by the state's Republican-dominated Legislature in 2011 but not yet enacted \u2014 \"imposes strict, unforgiving burdens on the poor, and racial minorities in Texas.\" Strict photo ID laws are in force in seven states and pending in two others, including Texas. Many other states require some form of identification to vote. The judges sided with critics who have argued that the requirement would disenfranchise many minority voters who are less likely to have photo identification. Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott has vowed to appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. He says Thursday's ruling is \"wrong on the law,\" and that the requirement for photo IDs is needed to prevent election fraud and impersonation. NPR's Wade Goodwyn reports that the judges determined that the witnesses presented by the state of Texas to support the law were \"unreliable\" and their methodology \"unsound.\" Goodwyn says: \"Because of the state's history of voting discrimination, it fell upon Texas to prove that its restrictive voter ID law did not tilt the playing field against minorities.\" The Houston Chronicle quotes the judicial panel as concluding that the costs of obtaining photo IDs would \"fall most heavily on the poor and that a disproportionately high percentage of African-Americans and Hispanics in Texas live in poverty.\" According to the newspaper, about 80 Texas counties \u2014 particularly those in low-income areas \u2014 have no driver's license offices, which would make it difficult for many voters to obtain a photo ID.",

Massachusetts Democratic Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren isn't backing down from her claim of Native American ancestry, despite the apparent lack of primary documents proving that she's 1/32nd Cherokee. The controversy surrounding Warren's heritage led us to wonder \u2014 how much of a racial or ethnic heritage constitutes minority status? Should percentages of a bloodline matter at all? The Census Bureau lets individuals self-identify. Since the 2000 count, people have been permitted to check multiple boxes for race or ethnicity. But history has shown a wide variance in how people of different backgrounds come to be identified as part of ethnic groups. Notably, the issue of racial identity surfaced recently following the fatal shooting of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin, who was African-American. The boy's shooter, George Zimmerman, initially was identified as white, prompting accusations that he racially profiled Martin. Once it was reported that Zimmerman's mother is Latino and his father is white, he was identified as Hispanic and later as white Hispanic. The early 20th century's \"one-drop rule\" stated that a person with a single drop of African blood in their lineage was considered black, and the classification was used for discriminatory purposes. \"This is the story of the tragic mulatto, right? A person who looks totally white was denigrated as a black person,\" said Anne Cheng, a professor who specializes in race studies at Princeton University. For generations, people have used their mixed-race background to gain advantages in society. Many of those who were half black, for instance, \"passed\" for white to avoid discrimination. Today, some people have flipped the \"one-drop rule\" to claim minority status to try to gain perceived advantages in scholarships, college admission and in the workplace. In response, the Coalition of Bar Associations of Color passed a resolution last year urging law schools to treat the practice of \"box checking\" as \"academic ethnic fraud.\" So the question of membership in a distinct racial or ethnic group matters to those both inside and outside the groups. But the ways we define minority status are as diverse as the people defining themselves. Among the 400-plus federally recognized Native American tribes in the U.S., questions about the authenticity of people's tribal memberships have led to power struggles and in some cases expulsions. \"It's an answer all over the place,\" said Michael Woestehoff of the National Indian Gaming Association. Woestehoff said for Navajo Nation membership, a person must have one-quarter or more Navajo blood. \"For elections and holding office, my tribe requires you to speak fluent Navajo.\" A similar percentage standard is used by the Cherokee Nation, of which Warren's campaign says her great-great-great-grandmother was a part. Mother Jones' Tim Murphy waded in earlier this month: \"Prior to 1963, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians granted tribal membership to anyone who could prove he was 1/32 Cherokee. ... \"For those who applied after 1963, the standards went up to 1/16. Bill John Baker, principal chief of the Cherokee Nation \u2014 an umbrella group which includes the Eastern Cherokee \u2014 is 1/32 Cherokee, which was the subject of a minor controversy prior to his election, but obviously not a deal-breaker. In other words, without wading too deeply into ongoing debates within the Native American community, Warren could make a fairly legitimate claim to the title.\" Different tribes handle the question differently, especially when it comes to health care and education benefits tribe members receive and how tribes use profits from tribal gaming businesses, which generate an average of $26 billion in revenue a year. For the Salt River tribe of Phoenix, which runs two casinos in Arizona, criteria for membership require at least a quarter Indian blood from the Pima or Maricopa lines. Membership then affords a person the opportunity to sit on the board that regulates the casinos and how gaming revenue is spent. \"If you're going to state you're Native American, where does that bloodline come from?\" said Janet Johnson, director of the Salt River Tribe. \"The proof is important. If they have the proof that they have some lineage, then it's their right [to be a member].\" That proof of Warren's heritage is now in question, but Warren has said she remains \"proud\" of it. Her campaign strategist says Warren learned about her background \"through conversations with her grandparents, her parents and her aunts and uncles.\" By some people's definitions of racial identity, that's enough to classify her as Native American. But personal preferences and percentage don't seem to matter as much as perception. For the columnists making \"warpath\" and \"wampum\" jokes about Warren's claims of heritage, the problem may be that she simply \"looks white.\" \"It really is revealing how fraught racial identity is to America, and how uncomfortable we become when the visual is not telling,\" said Cheng. \"Even though it doesn't seem like the kind of racial profiling that we think of historically, [the Warren issue] seems to suggest we are in the exact same place as we used to be.\" Cheng and others warn that judging race or ethnicity by appearances is increasingly difficult in a time when mixed-race marriages and immigration from a wider swath of foreign countries is more common. \"The problem is that there's this disconnect between the way we tend to define these things and the reality, which is that race is socially constructed,\" said Camille Charles, a professor of sociology at University of Pennsylvania and author of Won't You Be My Neighbor: Race, Class and Residence in Los Angeles. \"We have tried to make race biologically determined, so we use blood and genes and those sorts of things ... [but] if you think of the assimilation process, groups who look distinct are the least assimilated in terms of persistence of prejudice. We've paid attention to skin color.\" Charles argues that ethnic heritage should be determined by each individual, the way the Census allows. But many people's self-identification remains limited by their skin color, which influences the perceptions of others. As we've seen with Warren, lack of primary proof combined with public perceptions can be politically problematic.",

Romney has said that he does not believe gay couples should marry.\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Rogash/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, sits in the stands with his wife Ann Romney before start of a game between Boston Celtics and the Atlanta Hawks at TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts. Romney has said that he does not believe gay couples should marry. Read Another Opinion On President Obama's \"Insincere\" Support For Gay Marriage Read Another Opinion On Whether The President's Support For Gay Marriage Hurts His Re-election Effort Ben Adler is a writer for The Nation. Conservatives can't seem to get their story straight on gay marriage. Some claim President Obama announced his support for marriage equality on Wednesday afternoon to gain political advantage. They reason that he wants to enthuse his base and distract attention from high unemployment. Others confidently predict that Obama has awoken the sleeping giant of socially conservative voters, and they will come out in November to punish him. Meanwhile, some concede that Republicans may not want to aggressively position themselves on \"the wrong side of history,\" and still others declare that Obama has declared \"war on marriage.\" And the latter two both work for Fox News. Obama's move has thrown Mitt Romney's regressive position on marriage equality into stark relief. While Obama was already the most pro-gay rights president in history, Romney is actually further to the right than George W. Bush on gay marriage. Romney not only opposes gay marriage but also opposes civil unions that offer equivalent benefits to marriage. That means Romney would deny benefits such as hospital visitation rights to same-sex couples. Bush, on the other hand, supported civil unions, and his former vice president, Dick Cheney, supports gay marriage. Romney also supports a federal amendment to the Constitution that would ban gay marriage. On other aspects of civil rights for gays and lesbians, Romney is a fairly standard Republican: he was against letting gays serve openly in the military, although he would not reverse the policy now that it has been changed. He opposes the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. And while he says that he does not discriminate in his own personal hiring practices, his openly gay foreign policy spokesman Richard Grenell resigned after being attacked by religious social conservatives and feeling that the Romney campaign was not publicly supporting him. Any concerns that Romney will use gay marriage as a wedge issue to drum up evangelical voter turnout, as Republicans did in 2004, should be assuaged by the fact that Romney clearly hates talking about social issues. He has complained that he was forced to talk about them too frequently in the last campaign, and he has been known to begin answers to questions on social issues in debates by saying that instead of that subject he should be asked about the economy. He did that again in an interview with a local Colorado television station on Wednesday. After being asked about gay marriage, in-state public university tuition for the children of illegal immigrants and medical marijuana, he interrupted his interviewer and demanded, with audible irritation, \"Aren't there issues of significance that you'd like to talk about? The economy, the growth of jobs, the need to put people back to work, the challenges of Iran; we've got enormous issues that we face.\" In other words, Romney thinks the only significant issues are the ones he prefers to discuss. The Romney campaign did not issue any statement, press release or even blog post in response to Obama's comments. Romney did speak briefly on television, during which time he reiterated his standard talking point that \"states are able to make decisions with regard to domestic partner benefits.\" Other Republicans and conservatives were not so recalcitrant. Many of them are portraying Obama's move as mere election-year politicking. Rick Santorum, in an attempt to seize his last shred of relevance, put out a statement calling it \"an attempt to galvanize [Obama's] core hard left supporters in advance of the November election.\" \"President Obama has consistently fought against protecting the institution of marriage from radical social engineering at both the state and federal level,\" said Santorum. \"I will continue to fight to make sure that the cultural elites don't further undermine the institution that gives the best opportunity for healthy, happy children and a just and prosperous society.\" Congressional Republicans have echoed those talking points, albeit in less hysterical language. \"There appears to be a plan to try to distract Americans from the thing they care most about, which is too many people out of work and the sad state of the economy, and the runaway and reckless spending going on here in Washington,\" Texas Senator John Cornyn, who runs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, told Politico. But social conservative leaders are unintentionally contradicting Santorum and Cornyn by arguing that Obama's embrace of marriage equality will actually be a boon to Romney. \"Combined with his administration's opposition to the Defense of Marriage Act, it reveals a president who is tone-deaf and out-of-touch with the time-honored values of millions of Americans,\" said Ralph Reed, founder and chairman of Faith & Freedom Coalition. \"This is an unanticipated gift to the Romney campaign. It is certain to fuel a record turnout of voters of faith to the polls this November.\" Family Research Council President Tony Perkins went even further, arguing that Obama could harm himself even among minority voters: As demonstrated by yesterday's overwhelming vote in North Carolina, redefining marriage remains outside the mainstream of American politics, especially in the critical battleground states and among minority voters. In North Carolina, the amendment received more than 60 percent of the vote in majority-black counties. Considering that ten of the sixteen battleground states have marriage amendments that could be overturned by the President's new policy position on marriage, today's announcement almost ensures that marriage will again be a major issue in the presidential election. The President has provided a clear contrast between him and his challenger Mitt Romney. Romney, who has signed a pledge to support a marriage protection amendment to the U.S. Constitution, may have been handed the key to social conservative support by President Obama. Fox News seemed to be more in tune with Mitt Romney's desire to just make the issue go away. After a fairly cursory discussion of the topic, it moved on to covering John Edwards's trial. Anchor Shepard Smith reacted to the news by saying, \"The president of the United States, now in the twenty-first century.\" He also wondered \"if Republicans would go out on a limb and try to make this a campaign issue while sitting very firmly, without much question, on the wrong side of history on it.\" But his colleagues at Fox's website were simultaneously posting a piece with the nonsensical headline, \"OBAMA FLIP FLOPS, DECLARES WAR ON MARRIAGE.\" Of course, a conservative might say Obama has declared war on traditional marriage. But to say he has declared war on marriage itself simply doesn't make sense, since he proposes not to eliminate the institution of marriage but to expand it. They later changed the headline to a more accurate, \"OBAMA FLIP FLOPS ON GAY MARRIAGE.\" It's fair to say Obama flip-flopped. But social progress has caused many Americans to flip-flop on any number of civil rights issues. This is only the most recent one, and it clearly caught Republicans off-guard.",

            "article_content": "The Justice Department is suing Arizona's most controversial sheriff on civil rights violations. Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio is being charged with racial profiling of motorists, mistreatment of inmates and retaliation against his critics.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: The man who calls himself America's toughest sheriff has a new fight on his hands, this time with the U.S. government. The Justice Department today sued Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, alleging discrimination against Latinos and retaliation against his critics. Civil rights leaders say the sheriff broke the law in an effort to chase illegal immigrants out of the community. NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson has our story. CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: For months, the Justice Department and Sheriff Joe Arpaio have been playing a game of chicken, driving toward each other with the gas pedal to the floor, daring each other to swerve away. Today, that game ended with these words from Assistant Attorney General Tom Perez. TOM PEREZ: At its core, this is an abuse of power case involving a sheriff and a sheriff's office that disregarded the Constitution, ignored sound police practices, compromised public safety and did not hesitate to retaliate against perceived critics. JOHNSON: For only the second time, the U.S. Justice Department used its power under civil rights laws to sue a police agency over a pattern of discrimination. The lawsuit outlines three kinds of alleged misconduct. First, stopping Latino drivers without cause. Second, failing to provide language help for jail inmates who don't speak English. And, third, arresting and suing judges, lawyers and other people in the community who criticize Sheriff Arpaio and his anti-immigration stance. Again, Tom Perez. PEREZ: The police are supposed to protect and serve our communities, not divide them. JOHNSON: A few hours later in Phoenix, Sheriff Arpaio delivered his own message. He told Fox News he won't back down. SHERIFF JOE ARPAIO: I'm not going to give it up. I'm going to continue to enforce state laws and federal laws. And I look forward to court because then we can put our case out and they're going to have to put up and stop these press conferences to embarrass me, especially in a election year. JOHNSON: But news of the federal case got a warmer reception from Latino advocates. Clarissa Martinez is a spokeswoman for the National Council of La Raza. She says her group's been calling for Arpaio's resignation, but as the five-term office holder seems unlikely to leave, she says federal scrutiny... CLARISSA MARTINEZ: Is needed to ensure that if you live in Sheriff Joe Arpaio's jurisdiction, whether you are served and protected doesn't depend on the color of your skin. JOHNSON: Martinez says she's been hearing complaints about the sheriff for years. MARTINEZ: This kind of behavior has intensified, particularly in light of the toxic nature of the immigration debate and the openings for some members of law enforcement to start looking at the enforcement of immigration laws. JOHNSON: That's important because several states, including Arizona, want to take immigration matters into their own hands. The Supreme Court is deliberating on that very issue in a separate case that pits Arizona leaders against the Justice Department. In the policing case, the federal government says it tried to negotiate with Arpaio for months but talks broke down when Justice insisted on an independent monitor to oversee Arpaio's department. PEREZ: How long it takes to resolve this case is a very good question and the answer to that question is entirely in the hands of Sheriff Arpaio. JOHNSON: Meanwhile, the American Civil Liberties Union says it plans to meet the sheriff in court, too, for a racial profiling lawsuit it filed on behalf of Latino drivers that's set to go to trial in July.

The USPS, which is projecting a $14.1 billion loss this fiscal year, is discussing restructuring options with potential advisers.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Harrier/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption An employee loads flat trays onto a truck at the U.S. Postal Service processing and distribution center in Merrifield, Va. The USPS, which is projecting a $14.1 billion loss this fiscal year, is discussing restructuring options with potential advisers. The planned downsizing of the U.S. Postal Service, which wants to shed thousands of jobs and reduce hours at post offices, struck Baltimore native Eric Easter at his core. For him, it will mark the end of an era in which a post office job has meant stability and a path to a better life, as it did for him and his six siblings living in public housing in the 1960s. \"You hate to see that disappear,\" says the 49-year-old Easter, now a documentary filmmaker and producer, who describes his mother's hiring at the post office as a defining moment in his childhood. \"It meant moving to a nicer neighborhood, sort of establishing that I have a place in the world,\" Easter says. \"I remember my mom having cocktail parties, and she and her co-workers could hold their heads up among teachers and other folks as people who had taken solid positions in the middle class.\" Rivaled only by the manufacturing industry, postal and other government jobs built the modern black middle class. Blacks are 30 percent more likely than nonblacks to work in the public sector, according to the University of California, Berkeley's Center for Labor Research and Education. And roughly 21 percent of black workers are public employees, compared with 16.3 percent of nonblacks. A Crumbling 'Pillar' Of The Black Middle Class But government jobs, long considered the most secure form of employment in America, have rapidly disappeared since the start of the last recession in December 2007 \u2014 particularly at the state and local levels, where officials have  cut budgets to cope with declining tax revenues and the rising costs of unemployment benefits, employee pensions and Medicare. Source: Roderick Harrison, senior research scientist, Howard University Credit: Julia Ro/NPR Government has shed 2.6 percent of its jobs over the past three years, marking the greatest reduction in history, according to the nonprofit Roosevelt Institute, a progressive-leaning organization. Roughly 265,000 workers were shed from all levels of government last year, after about 221,000 job cuts in 2010. \"Most government jobs have good pay and benefits and are probably what we would consider a good foundation for middle-class incomes, so any loss of government jobs is going to disproportionately hit the middle class,\" says Howard University research scientist Roderick Harrison. \"The black population, which is more dependent on government for middle-class job opportunities, is going to be more heavily hit.\" Source: Roderick Harrison, senior research scientist, Howard University Credit: Julia Ro/NPR Though the recession has ended, government job losses continue to be one of the most powerful drags on the economic recovery. In April, private employers added 130,000 jobs, but that growth was partially undermined by the loss of 15,000 government jobs. As a result, the net growth of 115,000 jobs fell well below most economists' projections and was down from March's revised 154,000 jobs added. The unemployment rate dropped slightly, to 8.1 percent. After the civil rights gains of the 1960s opened opportunities in government, blacks began a steady move into local, state and federal government, particularly in civil servant and teaching positions. And since the collapse of U.S. manufacturing, the public sector has been the biggest employer for African-Americans. Beyond the jobs themselves, their relatively competitive pay scales have lifted generations of blacks into the middle class. Berkeley's labor center found that among industries that pay blacks the highest wages, the biggest proportion of those blacks work in the public sector. The earnings gap between whites and blacks, which exists in all industries, is the narrowest in government, the Berkeley research has shown. For every dollar earned by white government workers, black women in government earn 89 cents and black men earn 80 cents. Overall, black women earn 85 cents and black men earn 74 cents for every dollar earned by whites. Cuts Trigger Resentment But that security is waning. To express their frustrations about the economy, many African-Americans often invoke an old metaphor, to their chagrin: When everyone else gets the sniffles, we catch the flu. April's jobless rates bear out the same, showing unemployment for whites at 7.4 percent, Latinos at 10.3 percent and blacks at 13 percent. The three pillars of middle class African-American life were the public sector, good manufacturing jobs, and black entrepreneurs that served the black community during segregation. Steven Pitts, economist \"The three pillars of middle-class African-American life were the public sector, good manufacturing jobs, and black entrepreneurs that served the black community during segregation,\" says economist Steven Pitts, who led the Berkeley Center's research. \"With the end of segregation, you put pressure on the black entrepreneurs, and then there was the decline in manufacturing. Now we see the erosion of the third pillar \u2014 the public sector.\" Not surprisingly, then, government cuts trigger resentment among African-Americans, especially since \"big government\" has become a politically polarizing phrase. Republican elected officials who rode Tea Party support to victory in the 2010 midterm elections placed government cuts at the center of their plans to eliminate state budget shortfalls and reduce the federal deficit. The impact of their strategy is most clearly seen in state government jobs. More than 70 percent of last year's government job cuts occurred in just 12 states, all of which are controlled by majority-Republican legislatures, according to the Roosevelt Institute. The legislatures in 11 of those states came under Republican control in 2010. What Republicans call an attack on \"big government,\" many blacks see as an attack on their livelihoods, given their heavy reliance on the public sector for employment. Credit: Julia Ro/NPR Pitts, the Berkeley economist, calls it \"nonracial policies with racialized outcomes.\" Since the employment peak of July 2008, blacks and whites have borne most of the job losses in government, according to Harrison. During and after the recession, blacks have lost more jobs in federal and local governments, while whites have gained slightly at the state level. Marc Morial, president and chief executive of the National Urban League, blames the recession for eliminating \"almost all the economic gains that blacks have made over the past 30 years,\" he says. \"It took away substantially the gains in employment and the gains in homeownership. We went back to the unemployment rates similar to the 1970s recession.\" At the same time, Hispanics are bucking the trend. Despite their high unemployment rate, enough of them are joining government to post a net increase in job growth at all levels of government. The number of Latinos in government has increased every month since November 2008.
