It happens to be a swing county in a swing state that's gone for Democrats in recent presidential races \u2014 but that could change now that Donald Trump wants to compete.\n                \n                    \n                    Danny Hajek/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption This neighborhood on Tearose Lane is part of the iconic early suburb of Levittown, Pa., in Bucks County. It happens to be a swing county in a swing state that's gone for Democrats in recent presidential races \u2014 but that could change now that Donald Trump wants to compete. This story is part of \"The View From,\" an election-year project focused on how voters' needs of government are shaped by where they live. The series started in Illinois, visited Appalachia, and this week, NPR took a road trip across two Northeastern states. The Northeast Corridor is technically a rail network, running from Washington, D.C., through Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York, ending in Boston. Every state in the corridor voted Democratic in the 2012 election, along with the rest of the Northeast region, helping Barack Obama win a second term. In fact, the last time a state in the Northeast went red in a presidential election was in 2000, when New Hampshire went for George W. Bush. But despite that electoral solidarity, a trip through the Northeast Corridor takes you to communities that are anything but uniform, and to places where Republicans are hoping to make inroads in November. We visited two spots just outside some of America's biggest cities to find out more about what voters in the region are thinking ahead of the election. Bucks County, Pa. The first stop on our itinerary is the planned suburb of Levittown, Pa. It's about half an hour northeast of Philadelphia, just across the Delaware River from Trenton, the capital of New Jersey. It's not far from where George Washington crossed the icy Delaware River on Christmas Day of 1776, to launch a surprise attack on Hessian mercenaries during the Revolutionary War. Levittown was built in the 1950s. The houses were uniform then, and the people are still overwhelmingly white. But despite the homogeneity on Levittown's surface, it's in the heart of a hotly contested congressional district in a swing state. The divisions between people are visible to the trained eye, according to Levittown resident Colleen Bateman. \"Those that are doing well, you can see it in their homes, they're adding on second floors, and their houses look very good,\" she says. \"Other people seem to be having a problem finding jobs, and you can see in those homes, they look sort of rundown and not well-kept.\" Bateman, a Democrat, says she is voting for Hillary Clinton, despite being a supporter of Bernie Sanders in the primaries. Levittown itself leans Democratic, but Bucks County at large, which makes up most of Pennsylvania's 8th Congressional District, is very much up for grabs. With Republican Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick leaving office, Democrats see it as a place where they can pick up a seat, and the money from outside groups is sure to pour in. But most of the chatter we heard was about the presidential race. Traditionally, places farther north in the county lean Republican, but that geographic distribution could change. At a bar in town, we meet Republicans Pat Deon, a Pennsylvania Turnpike commissioner, and attorney Albert Mezzaroba. Deon owns the building, and the two sit in a sun-filled back room, smoking cigars and taking in a Phillies game on several big-screen TVs. Deon tells us a lot of the working-class, union voters in Levittown could go for Donald Trump. Pat Deon (right), a Pennsylvania Turnpike commissioner, and attorney Albert Mezzaroba, sit at the Puss N Boots tavern in Bucks County. Both are Republicans. In this election based on change, Mezzaroba says he doesn't understand why. \"Things aren't that bad,\" he says. \"I don't know why everybody thinks they're so terrible.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Danny Hajek/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Pat Deon (right), a Pennsylvania Turnpike commissioner, and attorney Albert Mezzaroba, sit at the Puss N Boots tavern in Bucks County. Both are Republicans. In this election based on change, Mezzaroba says he doesn't understand why. \"Things aren't that bad,\" he says. \"I don't know why everybody thinks they're so terrible.\" He says people are fed up with the status quo. But when we ask why, Mezzaroba says he is not sure. Times have certainly been worse. \"I don't know,\" Mezzaroba says. \"Things aren't that bad. I don't know why everybody thinks they're so terrible. I mean, I don't get it. I truly don't get it. But they do.\" But one thing is clear: Mezzaroba says he couldn't vote for Clinton. Farther north, we meet some people who could be key to Republicans' fortunes in this county. Jim Worthington, a GOP delegate, says he put up $35,000 of his own money to campaign for the honor during Pennsylvania's primary election. His day job is overseeing the massive gym he owns in Newtown. \"It's called a lifestyle center. We coined the phrase like four years ago,\" he tells us, as we stroll by indoor basketball courts, down a flight of stairs through an open cardio room, and finally outside to a sprawling pool complex, complete with slides, fountains, a bar and a raised deck. Worthington is trim, sharply dressed. You can tell he spends a lot of time in his gym, and not just behind his desk. Tonight, he is hosting a gathering of Trump supporters who belong to the grass-roots organization People 4 Trump. About 80 people are waiting on the deck as Worthington makes his way up the stairs to the microphone. He works the eager crowd like a seasoned politician \u2014 something, he insists, that he is not. \"I go to Cleveland, I say 'Donald Trump' \u2014 probably once \u2014 and I'm done. My career is ended.\" The purpose of the outdoor meeting is to organize local Trump supporters. Worthington tells the crowd the Republican Party doesn't plan to ramp up its efforts until after the convention. In Worthington's mind, that would be far too late, if it happens at all. \"Is the GOP going to get behind Trump?\" he asks the group. \"The way I look at it is, I'm assuming they're doing nothing, and we're doing everything, and anything we get out of them is a plus.\" Supporters take turns voicing their concerns and reasons for backing Trump: immigration, economic concerns and outrage at a broken political system. Wearing a Trump T-shirt, Terry Rubin takes the mic to tell a story about meeting a veteran. \"When you serve two tours in Afghanistan, you meet those people,\" Rubin says. She's angry. \"The people that are in Afghanistan wearing those same kind of burkas and those same type of dresses are the same people that are being sent over here,\" she says. \"The same kind of people that we're going to be filled with!\" Most of the people here are fed up with the system. Volunteers sign up to canvass door-to-door, and they suggest ways the group can organize online. But for a place that Republicans are hoping to keep red, there's some uncertainty. At the end of the meeting, host Worthington asks supporters if they'll back the GOP candidate should Trump be denied the nomination at the Republican convention. On that issue, this group of passionate Trump believers is divided, and the meeting ends with no clear consensus. Jersey City, N.J. Just across the Hudson River from Lower Manhattan, you find Jersey City, where, from Liberty State Park, you can take in spectacular views of the New York skyline and the Statue of Liberty. The view of Ellis Island is fitting: By some counts, 40 percent of Jersey City's residents are foreign-born. People come from all walks of life and all corners of the world, but the city is solidly Democratic. The new, gleaming high rises here are a sign of new wealth, Jersey City's development and gentrification. But there's another side of the story. At 31 years old, Raj Mukherji, a Democrat, has already served as a deputy mayor of Jersey City. He also spent time in the Marine Reserves. When he was a teenager, his parents had to go back to their native India for economic reasons. Mukherji stayed in the U.S. as an emancipated minor, building websites for political campaigns. \"I think the ethnic stereotype might have actually helped me out,\" he says, chuckling. \"When I walked into these offices, adults would first wonder where my father or chaperone was, and then think, like, 'OK, you know, we can have this kid do our website! He must know IT!' \" Raj Mukherji, 31, is an entrepreneur, former Marine reservist, and state assemblyman from Jersey City. He's Indian-American \u2014 one of many residents here with immigrant parents, hoping other immigrants will vote in November.\n                \n                    \n                    Danny Hajek/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Raj Mukherji, 31, is an entrepreneur, former Marine reservist, and state assemblyman from Jersey City. He's Indian-American \u2014 one of many residents here with immigrant parents, hoping other immigrants will vote in November. Mukherji has a new job now, one for which he certainly doesn't fit any stereotype. He's a state legislator representing his district in New Jersey's General Assembly. He represents a town that is roughly evenly divided four ways: between white, black, Asian and Latino. And within those communities, there's a range of economic fortunes as well. Mukherji is clearly proud of his city \u2014 he calls New York his favorite suburb of Jersey City \u2014 but he rattles off problems, like health care costs and education inequality. He is also concerned that immigrants in his town aren't voting. \"I hope that in this presidential election, people understand the importance of turning out to vote. Because there are states in play that otherwise wouldn't have perhaps been in play,\" he tells us, without mentioning New Jersey explicitly. In Jersey City's Journal Square, Jessica Abdelnabbi Berrocal also wants to make sure immigrants turn out to vote in November. Abdelnabbi Berrocal is the daughter of Colombian mother and Peruvian father. She was raised Roman Catholic, but a few years ago, she converted to Islam. Now, in her hijab, she has made it her mission to register voters. Donald Trump famously claimed that Muslim residents in Jersey City were celebrating on rooftops, watching as the twin towers of the World Trade Center collapsed on Sept. 11, 2001. \"When I read that, I was like, what?\" Abdelnabbi Berrocal is clearly annoyed. \"How dare you? How dare you say that? God knows where he was at.\" She remembers where she was. \"When that happened, I saw it with my own eyes. We looked out of the window from the gym class, and we saw them fall.\" She had Muslim friends, and she didn't associate them with the terrorists. \"For me, I couldn't fathom the fact that they were putting it on a religion.\" Jessica Abdelnabbi Berrocal stands in Journal Square in Jersey City. She's a Latina who was raised Roman Catholic, but is a recent convert to Islam. Her mom's background is Sephardic Jew. \"This is what it is,\" she says. \"I am what you see in America right now.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Danny Hajek/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jessica Abdelnabbi Berrocal stands in Journal Square in Jersey City. She's a Latina who was raised Roman Catholic, but is a recent convert to Islam. Her mom's background is Sephardic Jew. \"This is what it is,\" she says. \"I am what you see in America right now.\" That moment set Abdelnabbi Berrocal in search of answers about Islam, and eventually, she converted. Now she spends most time trying to register voters at a Sept. 11 memorial in the city's Journal Square. It's a central location where commuters from all different backgrounds catch a train and where homeless people congregate. But she realizes it's also a symbolic place. Abdelnabbi Berrocal says Trump is spreading xenophobia and a false narrative about Muslims and immigrants, and that is motivating immigrants and their children to vote against him. She herself married an Egyptian man. \"My kids are Egyptian-Colombian-Peruvian, born in America,\" she says, laughing. \"I am what you see in America right now.\"",

Clinton Surpasses Trump In Popular Vote Tally As the final votes were tallied, Clinton became the fifth U.S. presidential candidate to win the popular vote but lose the election.

During the campaign, Donald Trump promised to punish \"sanctuary cities\" \u2014 jurisdictions which limit local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. Since the election, cities such as Chicago and San Francisco have doubled down on their sanctuary policies, saying local police need to build trust with communities, including people in the country illegally. Critics of sanctuary policies say the cities are fostering a sense of amnesty for people who break federal law. It's a long-running argument, and it's not unique to the U.S. Our neighbors to the north and south have also been grappling with the question of police involvement with national immigration law. A few Canadian cities have adopted the \"sanctuary city\" label, but in practice they don't offer the same kind of protection from law enforcement that American sanctuary cities do. \"When American jurisdictions are saying they're sanctuary cities, and they're actually saying they will not cooperate with immigration enforcement, that's a really strong stand,\" says Harsha Walia, an activist with a Canadian pro-immigration group called No One Is Illegal. \"That is not what municipal sanctuary cities here mean at all. They're not at all talking about not collaborating with detention and deportation.\" Byron Cruz is a naturalized Canadian citizen, originally from Guatemala, who works with recent immigrants.

He says the ones who don't have legal status fear encounters with the police because he says there is no protection from the Canada Border Services Agency. In the U.S., local law enforcement and jails can choose whether to assist federal immigration enforcement; in Canada, local police and jails are usuall expected to help. \"When an individual is subject to the CBSA immigration warrant, the police would be required to notify us of that,\" says David Lothian, with the Canada Border Services Agency. In Vancouver, transit police have reported fare-beaters to immigration authorities, and hospitals have notified the CBSA about patients who appear to be in the country illegally. Campaigners have been pushing against that kind of enforcement, and the Vancouver Police Department now say they don't detain people \"for the sole purpose of determining their status in Canada.\" But Walia says people without legal status still have reason to steer clear of cops. \"The VPD doesn't only see its jurisdiction as upholding the criminal code, it sees its jurisdiction as upholding all laws,\" Walia says \"And so they do very much see [immigration law] as part of their law enforcement duties.\" Migrants in Mexico In Mexico, police have been adapting to a different reality, resulting from a 2008 rewrite of its immigration law. \"[It] decriminalized migration, so in theory it's no longer a crime to be an illegal immigrant in Mexico,\" says Jaime Arredondo Sanchez Lira, a former government official and currently resident fellow, at the Center for US-Mexican Studies at the University of California, San Diego. \"That was a consequences of violence ... tied to human trafficking,\" Arredondo says. By making illegal immigration punishable only by a civil fine, the hope was that migrants moving through Mexico would be less vulnerable to abuse and extortion. Unfortunately, Arredondo says migrants are still often targeted by corrupt police and military. \"Many of the police forces are associated with drug dealers or smugglers, and in many cases they will hand you over [to smugglers] or extort money, or in some sad cases, kill you if you refuse to take part in their activities.\" Officially, local police in Mexico aren't supposed to go around asking people about their immigration status, says Alejandro Lares, former chief of municipal police in Tijuana. But things change once they have probable cause of an immigration violation, or the person commits another crime. \"We are able to detain them, and once they're detained, we can actually call Mexican immigration, and they can find out if they're legal or illegal in our country,\" Lares says. The American \"sanctuary city\" concept is largely foreign to Mexico; Lares says local jurisdictions don't prohibit their police from working with national immigration officials. \"I don't think [police] would ever consider not to voluntarily cooperate with an immigration authority,\" he says, \"if things are being done by the book.\" More enforcement, but more paths to citizenship In Vancouver, Canadian immigration lawyer Peter Edelmann says he also sees a difference between the way things are done in his country and the U.S. \"There does seem to be more acceptance of people living undocumented in some of the cities in the United States,\" he says. He says he's surprised to hear how people can go for decades in the U.S. without legal status. He says he rarely sees cases of people who go that long without legal status in Canada, but he doesn't think it's just because people are more likely to get caught. \"The other big difference in Canada is that there's a lot more mechanisms for regularizing status,\" he says. For instance, he says, people brought into the country illegally as children can usually get legal status on humanitarian grounds. So while it's true Canadians enforce immigration law more than the U.S. does, their law can also be more forgiving.",

But small towns are focused on re-inventing themselves to attract a new generation.\n                \n                    \n                    FrankvandenBergh/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Who speaks for rural America? Farmers want international trade deals and relief from regulations. But small towns are focused on re-inventing themselves to attract a new generation. The day after Donald Trump swept to victory, the head of the American Farm Bureau Federation, Zippy Duvall, released a videotaped statement aimed at the President-elect and other political leaders in Washington. \"Rural America turned out and made their voice heard in this election,\" he said. \"Now it's time for our elected leaders to support rural America.\" In his statement, Duvall referred interchangeably to \"rural Americans\" and \"America's farmers and ranchers,\" suggesting that those are the same people. In reality, they're not. Farmers make up a small minority in the rural population, with different priorities and agendas than their non-farming neighbors. I explored these differences recently during a trip across parts of northern Indiana. It's a landscape dominated by wide fields of corn and soybeans and giant grain silos. In Kosciusko County, near the tiny town of Leesburg, I met Kip Tom, a farmer who joined the Trump campaign as an adviser on agricultural policy. Tom's farm is one of the biggest in the region. It covers almost 20,000 acres, scattered across seven counties. In those counties, about 70 percent of the votes went for Donald Trump. And Kip Tom thinks Trump will indeed listen to what farmers have to say. \"I see Trump being good for agriculture, absolutely,\" he told me. On some issues Trump has been right in sync with the major farm groups. They both want less environmental regulation, for instance. Trump has promised to ditch a new Clean Water Rule that defines which streams are considered \"waters of the United States,\" and thus covered by the Clean Water Act. The rule hasn't actually made much of a practical difference for farmers, but many farmers fear that down the road, it might give the EPA the authority to regulate what they do on the fields that surround small streams. \"Waters of the U.S. was an overreach by the federal government on our private property rights, to come out here and tell us how to operate our farms,\" said Tom. But when it comes to other issues, farm organizations want Trump to change his mind. They favor trade deals that Trump attacked during his campaign, such as the Trans Pacific Partnership, which could expand their exports of pork, beef, and grain. Farm groups also don't want the government to crack down on immigration. Dairy farmers and vegetable growers rely heavily on immigrant workers. Tom says more people should \"walk a day with somebody who's a migrant, who was willing to do the work that others turn their nose to. I think we need to find some passion for those people and find a path toward citizenship for them,\" he says. This is the policy wish list for supporting \"rural America\" that Zippy Duvall, from the American Farm Bureau Federation, mentioned in his post-election statement: Free trade; environmental deregulation; immigration policies that don't take away farm workers; and continued funding for programs that help farmers financially when prices fall or bad weather ruins their crops. But does the rest of rural America care about these issues? To find out, I drove to the town of Warsaw, the county seat of Kosciusko County. Warsaw is doing better than a lot of rural towns. It's home to several thriving companies that make orthopedic devices, which provides a solid economic base. But like most small towns in the Midwest, it still worries about its future. Average incomes here have fallen below the national average. Poverty has been rising. The historic downtown, with its century-old brick storefronts and grand county courthouse, is eerily quiet during most of the day. And here's Warsaw's biggest concern: Young people and how to keep them from moving away. \"Millennials, they go where they want to live, and then they decide where they want to work,\" says Joseph Thallemer, Warsaw's mayor. According to census data, a couple of hundred more people leave Kosciusko County each year than move here. This, in fact, is why many Midwestern mayors and county commissioners are no longer quite so focused on getting companies to move to their communities, in order to bring in new jobs. Jobs aren't enough to make their millennials stay. Thallemer says that Warsaw has jobs in local factories that are waiting for people to fill them. And yet, young people choose to move away to places that seem more exciting. \"We have plenty of opportunity. But we don't have 70 degree average temperatures. We don't have palm trees. We don't have oceans,\" he says. What Warsaw needs, he says, is to find other ways to make the town special and attractive. Farms surround this town, but Thallemer barely mentions agriculture's priorities. That's because the number of farmers is tiny, compared to half a century ago. According to the latest census of agriculture from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, there are just 497 people in all of Kosciusko county who say that farming is their principal occupation. That's out of a total population of 80,000. This is the situation, in fact, in much of rural America. Chuck Fluharty, president of the Rural Policy Research Institute at the University of Iowa, which focuses on the economic health of rural communities, says small towns don't depend much on farmers anymore \u2014 yet farmers need their struggling rural towns. Farmers \"are worrying about that car dealer, and they're worrying about that bank, and they're worrying about the small insurance company, and they're hoping to God that they don't lose their school,\" he says. But Fluharty thinks it is possible to revive small towns like Warsaw and keep young people from leaving. It may sound counter-intuitive, but jobs follow people, he says, rather than the reverse. If people want to live in a place, they'll inevitably create the economic activity that sustains that community. So what rural America needs, basically, is more people like Parker Beauchamp. Beauchamp grew up in Wabash, Indiana, about an hour south of Warsaw. He went off to college, but came back home to run the family insurance company. And he convinced his big-city wife to move there with him. \"That was a major, major sales job,\" he says. He and his wife still debate about staying here. \"We talk about it every day.\" Beauchamp doesn't have to be in Wabash. His company, Inguard, is competing for customers all over the country, not just in northern Indiana. He's recruiting employees from all over, too. But he wants to be in his home town. And he's thrown himself into the job of building a Wabash that more people from Denver or Chicago would want to move to. \"We just hustled,\" he says. \"We did whatever we could in order to get some energy into downtown.\" They've had some success. There's art and entertainment in the center of Wabash now, along with a renovated historic hotel. Shops that were boarded up are now open for business again. Government grants got some of this off the ground. But Chuck Fluharty, from the Rural Policy Research Institute, says rural communities, don't get nearly as much federal economic development money per resident as cities do. This is where he wants farmers to help, he says, because farm organizations have political clout. He thinks those farm organizations should be pushing Congress, and the new Trump Administration, on behalf of policies that help their small towns; not just their own farms.",

Many have been talking about what it all means and how this country can find common ground and reunite. One particular person who has been pondering on this is British rock star, Sting, who has made the U.S. his home for several years now. The 16-time Grammy-award winning musician has sold millions of records and this week, he released a new album called, 57th & 9th. It's his first collection of original songs in more than a decade. Also this weekend, Sting performed at the Bataclan in Paris, the first concert there almost a year to the day that brutal terrorist attacks left 130 people dead in the city. Sting talks with NPR's Michel Martin about his new album, what it means to perform at the Bataclan, the U.S. election, Brexit, the migrant crisis and about the special impact of three of his songs, one old and two new. Interview highlights contain extended Web-only content. On what he thinks about the elections Like everyone, I'm bemused and I'm a little bit in shock. But I think we have to be optimistic, it's the only strategy we are allowed, really. I haven't formulated any ideas. It's similar to what happened in my country in June when 52 percent of the people voted to leave something that was actually beneficial for us. Forty-eight percent of us decided we wanted to stay, as I did. But we now have a constitutional crisis in my country, which is not helpful. But yeah, the world is in a state of change. On if he sees comparisons with U.S. elections and happenings in other parts of the world To speak about Brexit, I think it was nothing whatsoever to do with the EU. I mean, the most Googled question the next day in Britain was, \"What is the EU?\" I think people were given the opportunity to kick the government in the backside and they took it. But I think [it] was much too complex an issue to reduce to a simple yes or no. We have a very very sophisticated parliamentary system, which is designed to work these things out through the political process, so a referendum in my opinion was a huge mistake. But there's no going back. On his Broadway play The Last Ship which addresses the issue of job loss I'm from the northeast of England. I'm from a working-class background. My ancestors were shipyard workers, who were left out of a job by the market forces that [were] beyond their control. So I feel a sympathy for people who feel left out, as the people in the northeast, the Rust Belt. ... Here in America, I feel it. And I'm not sure what the answer is. But the solutions being offered or the promises being made at the moment don't seem particularly convincing to me. On the refugee crisis and what inspired his song, \"Inshallah\" that pays homage to refugees Well, the migrant crisis is something that isn't going to disappear tomorrow. It's driven by warfare in the Middle East. It's driven by poverty in Africa. It may be driven by climate change in the very near future. So it's not going to be something can we can hope to end tomorrow. I don't have a political solution, but I feel if there's a solution to it, it has to be grounded in some kind of empathy for those people in those boats. Because we as a species all migrate. We're all migrants. Everyone in this country is a migrant, I'm a migrant, our ancestors were migrants. It's not going to stop, that's what we do. So I think if we have a feeling of empathy, just a little intellectual exercise of putting yourself in a boat like that with your wife and your children, how does that feel? And I think it's an important exercise if you like. On his choice to use the word \"Inshallah\" as a song title and if in part it's to \"sensitize\" people to its meaning It's a beautiful Arabic word. Literally it means, \"If it's God's will and then it shall be.\" But also implies resignation, it implies humility, it implies hope, it implies courage. And for me, it implies solidarity. I feel for those people. No, it's not my strategy at all. It's a beautiful word from a beautiful culture. We must not forget that; that Islamic culture, Arab culture has given us extraordinary things: science, astronomy, architecture, music, many things. On how he came to be performing at the Bataclan in Paris a year after terrorist attacks I was just invited to do it. I think the venue was struggling for obvious reasons. I just feel I'm, doing my job. My job is to entertain people. But also because it's the anniversary of the appalling attack, I think that it's important that we honor the dead, that remember the dead, but also celebrate this very famous venue, which I worked in 1979, I think. It's part of my history too, so when I was asked if I'd do it, I immediately said, \"Yes, I think it's important.\" We are a pluralist society, we love music, we love getting together and joyfully celebrating life, so that's what we must do. On his decision to open the Bataclan concert with his 1986 hit \"Fragile\" I think it's an appropriate beginning, I think that song has a lot of uses that we never foresaw. I wrote the song in the '80s, I think. But every time something happens, it seems an appropriate song to play on the radio. On \"Fragile\" being a song that people turn to for comfort after a tragedy It's a best compliment a songwriter can receive \u2014 much more than awards \u2014 when someone comes up to me and says, \"We got married to your song, we fell in love to your song,\" or \"We played your song at Uncle Charlie's funeral.\" That actually makes you realize that by accident, you've created a kind of emotional soundtrack to people's lives, an emotional landscape that's touched by ... the memory is touched by these songs. And so, I didn't set out to do that at all. I wanted to be a songwriter and a singer just for the glory of it, but by accident you realized that you've done this for people and it's very nourishing when you hear that. On the Prince-inspired song, \"50,000\" on his new album It was a tough year in my business. A lot of notable cultural icons were taken from us: David Bowie, Prince, Glenn Frey from the Eagles and many many others. It was shocking. And of course, like all of us, there's a child in me that sees these cultural icons as being somehow immortal. And we all are shocked irrationally when they prove to be very mortal. I am 65 years old, I imagine I've lived most of my life already so it definitely makes you have to accept your own mortality and the song is really about that. It's about someone like me, a rock star looking back on his stadium days, playing to 50,000 people, 100,000, 200,000, in the spotlight and the hubris of that. And then on reflection, wondering where he learned his philosophy. On his own mortality and why he thinks he's still here I don't really have survivor's guilt. ... I obviously have a purpose. My purpose is to entertain people. ... I can't teach people anything unless I entertain them first.",

She is considered one of the leading candidates in France's 2017 presidential elections. There's an expression in French, \"Jamais deux sans trois,\" or \"Never two without three.\" After Brexit and Trump, will Marine Le Pen be next? France holds its presidential election next spring, and Le Pen, the leader of the country's far-right National Front party, could well be one of the top two candidates in the first round of voting, which would propel her to the second-round runoff in May 2017. But she hasn't been seriously considered as a candidate who could actually become president. Until now. \"I think we can have the same surprise in France,\" said National Front Secretary General Nicolas Bay, speaking Wednesday on French radio. Bay called Trump's victory a victory of the people who were \"betrayed by the elites.\" He said both Trump and the National Front have the same platform: rejection of multiculturalism, rejection of globalization and free trade, and strengthening national borders. There are other important similarities: Both Trump and the National Front want to limit or even halt immigration. Both are wary of Muslims. Trump has toyed with the idea of the U.S. weakening its bonds with NATO, or perhaps even leaving. The National Front wants France to leave, too. It would also remove France from the European Union. \"Congratulations to the new president of the United States Donald Trump and to the free American people,\" Le Pen tweeted, even before Trump had accrued the necessary number of electoral votes. Her father, Jean Marie Le Pen, who founded their party 44 years ago, also chimed in on Twitter: \"Today the United States, tomorrow France.\" \"The election of Trump is a turning point,\" says Philippe Moreau Defarges, a political analyst with the French Institute of International Relations. \"A taboo has been broken. It's a watershed moment because we have seen that a populist can be elected to high office.\" Defarges says Trump's victory gives fresh hope to a swath of populist parties across Europe that have been able to boost membership by exploiting issues including the refugee crisis, immigration and lagging economies. These parties are surging in a way that hasn't been seen since before the Second World War. Defarges says it could alter the entire political and economic landscape of Europe. Cas Mudde, a Dutch political scientist at the University of Georgia, says, \"Trump's win gives a narrative of success, of possibility, to far-right parties in Europe, because Trump won despite all the predictions. So they can say to people, 'You're not wasting your vote if you come out and vote for us. We will actually do much better than what everyone says.' \" In the Netherlands, Dutch far-right politician Geert Wilders called Trump's victory a sign that the West was living through a \"patriotic spring\" and that it proved that people are fed up with politically correct politicians. His party tops polls and is poised to be the deal-maker in a new Dutch government to be voted next spring. In Germany, Frauke Petry, the head of the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany, or AfD, party, was quick to send her congratulations to President-elect Trump. In an early-morning tweet, a German news outlet reported that Petry said, \"This night changes the USA, Europe and the world!\" \"Americans have chosen a new beginning free of corruption and sleaze,\" she also tweeted. \"This is a historic chance.\" The AfD wants a ban on minarets and Muslim face veils. Though many believe it has no chance of emulating Trump's success, German analysts say the party will use Trump's victory to mobilize people who normally would not have voted but see that things can change now. In Greece, which is struggling to deal with the arrival of hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East and Africa, the far-right Golden Dawn party hailed Trump's election as a victory against \"illegal immigration\" and in favor of ethnically \"clean\" nations. In Austria, a candidate of the populist Freedom Party, Norbert Hofer, is poised to become the EU's first far-right head of state in a Dec. 4 runoff with the Green Party. Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache said Trump's win shows \"the political left and the aloof and sleazy establishment are being punished by voters and voted out of various decision-making positions.\" Across Europe, mainstream conservative parties are getting a wake-up call. If a host of anti-establishment, anti-free trade, xenophobic parties gain more power, analysts say it could reshape the EU. Defarges, the French political analyst, warns that major international agreements such as the global climate treaty and the Iran nuclear deal may also be in danger. Mudde, the Dutch political scientist, says Trump will normalize the radical right in Europe, \"because every politician will have to deal with Trump as if he's a normal U.S. president. And if national politicians are going to deal with Trump in a normal way, it will be harder to exclude radical-right politicians nationally. The parties will say, 'Oh, you're OK working with Trump, but you're not OK working with us.' Clearly this is not about ideology, it's about keeping your power.\"",

Jim James, the leader of the Louisville, Ky., band My Morning Jacket, has a new solo album, Eternally Even. It's a political album \u2014 not because it is directly about climate change or immigration or this election's other hot-button issues, but because it addresses the mindset that has led to such a divided nation. It's about love and fear. These are issues that James has been grappling with over the last year or so \u2014 but the album couldn't have been released at a more opportune time. This is also an extremely enjoyable album to listen to from a purely musical standpoint. Guitarist and producer Blake Mills, who also worked on the most recent Alabama Shakes and Ray LaMontagne albums, helped illuminate James' vision.

Jin Park remembers where he was when Donald Trump announced his presidential bid in June, 2015. He was alone in his Harvard dorm room and watching Trump on TV. \"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best,\" Trump told the crowd at New York's Trump Tower, \"They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\" Then he proposed a wall along the United States border with Mexico. \"I watched that and had this realization that this guy is serious about what he wants to do. I had an instinct to immediately call my parents,\" Park said, \"I was pretty scared.\" Park isn't Mexican, but he is in the country illegally. So are his parents. They brought him to the U.S. from South Korea on a temporary visa when he was seven, just in time to start second grade in Queens, N.Y. When their plan for permanent residency fell through, they decided to overstay the visa. \"This is just one part of myself,\" said Park, 20. But it has influenced him: He wants to go to medical school to treat people who can't access health care. \"My dad, when I was in third or fourth grade, he had a really bad burn from the restaurant,\" Park recalled. \"We dealt with that together at home. It's something I think about a lot.\" When he heard Trump's plans for illegal immigration, he saw how his own plans could unravel. \"I'm going to fight to not be deported. If that literally means chaining myself to the gate here, I'm going to do that,\" Park said. \"It's my home.\" Park is one of the estimated 11.4 million immigrants living in the U.S. without authorization, according to the most recent accounting from Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The discussion around their presence in the country has been particularly heated this election year. But while the rhetoric is loud, the actual people living with that status are largely invisible. About half of the people in the U.S. without legal documentation come from Mexico, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. The rest are from all over: El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, the Philippines, India, Korea and a mix of other countries, according to DHS. The estimate of 11 million has been relatively stable for nearly a decade, even though Trump has referenced the \"record pace of immigration.\" Unauthorized immigration actually peaked in 2007. The downturn is largely due to a decline in people coming from Mexico. Between 2009 and 2014, more Mexicans left the United States than entered. A quarter of the unauthorized population lives in California and Texas but Florida, New York, and Illinois also have large numbers - about a half million each. Around half the people who have entered the country illegally or overstayed their visas are younger than 35. And one in three live below the poverty line, according to the Migration Policy Institute. There isn't a poll that specifically targets immigrants living in the country illegally and how they're feeling about the election. But there is data on immigrants in general. As the immigrant population has become larger and less white over the last few decades, they have also become more left-leaning. That means Trump's hard-line policies on immigration may be isolating a population that was already moving away from his party. Eight out of ten Hispanics have a negative opinion of Trump, according to a recent poll. And while not every Hispanic person is an immigrant and not every immigrant in the country illegally is Hispanic, that demographic does represent 76 percent of people in the U.S. illegally. Donald Trump has promised to triple the number of deportation officers at Immigration and Customs Enforcement and hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents, an increase of about 25 percent. He also plans to end President Obama's executive actions addressing illegal immigration. He has repeatedly said immigrants in the U.S. illegally are dangerous and he has highlighted murders committed by people without documentation. At an August rally, he said \"countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders.\" Donald Trump has given a platform to racism and xenophobia in this country. Adrian Reyna, advocate for immigration reform Of course some immigrants have committed crimes but as a group, immigrants are actually less likely to break the law. Regardless, the allegations of criminality can sting. \"Donald Trump has given a platform to racism and xenophobia in this country,\" says Adrian Reyna, a 25-year-old advocate for immigration reform. Reyna and his family are in the U.S. without authorization. \"For my younger sister, who is 14, she can't see the complexities,\" Reyna says. \"Imagine being 14 and feeling really afraid of what people are saying at your school and in the public about immigrants and you know you're undocumented and your parents are undocumented and living with that fear every day.\" If elected, Trump says those here illegally will have one option: \"To return home and apply for re-entry like everybody else under the rules of the new legal immigration system.\" For many, that means putting their name on a wait list with tens of thousands already ahead of them in line. Reyna came to the U.S. from Monterrey, Mexico in 2004 with his parents and two younger sisters. They crossed the border with tourist visas and settled in Houston. Reyna said he thinks it's important to keep pushing for reform, even if he doesn't know what will happen after Nov. 8. That's a lesson he said he learned from his parents. \"I always ground myself in the memory of seeing my mom going into school and not knowing any English and just going at it,\" Reyna said. \"To me that's the spirit I carry with me.\" If elected, Hillary Clinton has promised to introduce a pathway to citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. illegally. In a 2015 Gallup poll, 65 percent of Americans supported that pathway. Clinton has also said she will uphold President Obama's executive orders on immigration, only one of which is actually in effect. That order is Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which allows certain people brought to the country illegally as children to apply for protection against deportation for two-year periods. They can then work legally in the U.S. during that time. More than 1.2 million people have received DACA. The other order, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA), would extend the deportation exemption to parents of U.S. citizens or permanent residents. The Pew Research Center estimates that 4.5 million U.S. born children have parents who are not in the country legally. A federal district court has blocked the order from taking effect. We're here. We're not hypothetical. If you vote to deport undocumented people, they're physical people that you have to remove from the country. It's not a joke. It's people's lives. Jin Park For Harvard student Jin Park, DACA made a huge difference. \"President Obama changed my life,\" he said. \"It changed what was possible for me legally and for my parents through me.\" He said the most important thing about Hillary Clinton is that she says she won't remove DACA. Reyna said he felt a sense of relief when he received DACA, but he said Obama's legacy is not without fault. \"When we have deportation numbers in the numbers we have, it's very difficult to be in a position of saying the Obama administration has championed immigration,\" Reyna said. Obama has overseen more deportations than both George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. During his first term, the number of people deported increased each year, peaking at more than 400,000 in 2012. The number has since gone down. Clinton has addressed the issue of mass deportation. At the March 9 Democratic debate, she said she plans to pursue \"comprehensive immigration reform, but at the same time, stop the raids, stop the round-ups, stop the deporting of people who are living here doing their lives, doing their jobs.\" Reyna is skeptical. \"I remember the promises Obama made. They were very similar to what Clinton is introducing now,\" he said. \"She has an opportunity here to come out boldly with a firm strategy to bring swift relief for our community.\" For Park, Clinton's plans aren't what matter most. \"What I know of Hillary Clinton has been informed by what she's not, and by what Donald Trump is,\" he said. Park can't vote, but he said if he could tell voters one thing, it would be this: \"We're here. We're not hypothetical. If you vote to deport undocumented people, they're physical people that you have to remove from the country. It's not a joke. It's people's lives.\"",

In Scandinavia, ostensibly one of the most progressive regions on the planet (then again, maybe not), a conservative movement is picking up speed in the form of the counterintuitively named Sweden Democrats. On Sunday night, Swedish Prime Minster Stefan L\u00f6fven, a Social Democrat, called the nationalist group \"a Nazi party, a racist party\" during a debate on national TV, prompting the organization to file a complaint with Sweden's parliament. The Sweden Democrats have seen their popularity rise in part because of their objection to Sweden's immigration policies. During the country's elections in 2014, the party promised to reduce immigration by 90 percent; that mission has helped it more than double its numbers in the polls, from less than 13 percent two years ago to almost 27 percent now. What does nationalist sentiment have to do with a new album? In the case of The Radio Dept.'s Running Out Of Love, just about everything. While Sweden's politics were shifting, the long-running Swedish synth-pop duo was writing and recording its fourth album. Beginning with the non-album single \"Death To Fascism\" in 2014, Johan Duncansson and Martin Larsson have used their platform as one of the country's most popular independent acts to protest the rise of Sweden's far right. Yes, their drum machines kill fascists. On Running Out Of Love, Duncansson and Larsson pair upbeat, sometimes joyous pop with political and cultural critique. \"Sloboda Narodu\" continues where \"Death To Fascism\" left off, with Duncansson singing, \"Don't ask for patience / 'Cause we just don't have the time / Freedom now / Freedom now.\" The album's best song, \"Swedish Guns,\" calls attention to Sweden's thriving arms business: \"And guess what came to town (the Swedish guns) / And guess what burned it down (the Swedish guns) / And every life they took (with Swedish guns).\" In \"We Got Game,\" Duncansson recounts a scenario that might sound familiar to Americans: \"You keep talking middle ground / So sick of hearing about that middle ground / This is it, you can't go 'round / There's just no other middle to be found.\" It's easy to overlook The Radio Dept.'s messages while listening to Running Out Of Love: For 13 years, Duncansson and Larsson have demonstrated a tremendous gift for effervescent hooks that often obscure the lyrics buried beneath. Dig deep and pay attention: This album was made for 2016.",

The ad, titled \"Two Americas: Immigration,\" will air in four battleground states \u2014 Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Florida. The Trump campaign is putting $4.8 million behind it for now, and it will run over the next 10 days.

The ad focuses on security, specifically immigration. It tries to contrast an America with Hillary Clinton in charge with that of Donald Trump. An announcer says, over faded images, that in Clinton's America, \"The system stays rigged against Americans. Syrian refugees flood in. Illegal immigrants convicted of committing crimes get to stay. Collecting Social Security benefits, skipping the line. Our border open. It's more of the same, but worse.\" The imagery shows immigrants (presumably) with blurred-out faces being handcuffed or simply walking around. That's all replaced by bright color images in Donald Trump's America, with shots of the border being tightly patrolled by helicopter. Trump's America is simple: \"secure. Terrorists and dangerous criminals: kept out. The border: secured. Our families: safe. Change that makes America safe again.\" The ad comes a day after Trump expressed \"regret\" for sometimes choosing the wrong words and causing \"pain.\" He is heading to Louisiana on Friday, where floods have ravaged the state. The state's Democratic governor said he welcomed Trump to the state, but not for a \"photo op.\" He wants him to volunteer or make a \"sizable donation.\" LA gov office on @realDonaldTrump visit: don't come for photo op; volunteer or donate instead. (via @gabegutierrez) pic.twitter.com/CLGnmqllxW It all appears to be part of the much-promised shift now that Trump has yet another new team of leaders in his campaign. The \"regret\" remarks and different tone from Trump certainly have the hallmarks of Republican pollster KellyAnne Conway, installed as his campaign manager earlier this week. Trump's campaign has promised to focus on more \"themes.\" It appears evident that the Trump campaign is going with a \"Two Americas\" theme for their ads, the first being on immigration. (Two Americas is the theme used by 2008 Democratic candidate John Edwards, not to contrast his worldview with another candidate's but to highlight the gap between those doing well and those struggling to get ahead.) That's something he has landed in controversy for during this campaign right from the start. In his speech announcing his run last year, he said that immigrants coming to the U.S. illegally from Mexico were bringing drugs and were rapists, and some, he assumed, \"were good people.\" Trump has a lot of ground to make up in this campaign. The Clinton campaign has outspent Trump on air $61 million to $0, according to data from Advertising Analytics/NBC News. With outside groups supporting the campaigns factored in, Team Clinton is outspending Team Trump $104 million to $12 million. During the primary, Trump famously ran very few ads, spending only a sliver of what others spent. He was able to do this because of his high name identification and the megaphone he possessed. His campaign rallies (and even empty lecterns anticipating one of his events) were routinely carried live and in full on cable TV. But that strategy is proving ineffective in a general election, where the electorate is far different from the nearly all-white GOP primary's electorate. Trump is trailing Hillary Clinton badly in the polls in battleground states with just 11 weeks to go until Election Day. Still, he hopes he can get back some of those traditional GOP voters, particularly white women, who have abandoned him \u2014 and security is one way to try to reach them.",

            "article_content": "A far-right Austrian presidential candidate was narrowly defeated after an election that focused on the European migrant crisis.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Let's turn now to Europe where we are just getting results in an election that was dominated by a debate over immigration. In Austria, voters have narrowly elected a left-leaning, independent candidate who says immigration helps the economy. A far-right, populist candidate who talked tough about immigration and about Muslims lost barely. These results were being watched closely across Europe where the migration crisis has upended establishment politicians. Reporter Joanna Kakissis is on the line from Vienna. Joanna, good morning. JOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: So this sounds like an incredibly close election. We're talking a razor-thin margin here. KAKISSIS: That's correct. It was very, very close, and it was decided today while officials were counting something like up to 900,000 ballots, mail-in ballots, absentee ballots. And those ballots, those voters went for Alexander Van der Bellen who is an independent candidate backed by the Green Party. He's actually a former leader of the Green Party. He's an economist. He's 72. He's a retired professor. And many Austrians saw him as the safe choice. They weren't crazy about him, but they saw him as a safer choice than Norbert Hofer, the leader of the far-right party, who also energized many Austrians but was also seen as very dangerous. GREENE: OK. Well, talk about - I mean, for a far-right candidate who is seen by some as dangerous to come this close, I mean, what exactly was he tapping into and what was significant here? KAKISSIS: That's a good question. What he was tapping into is unease about many, many migrants who have come to Austria in the last year. Austrians felt overwhelmed. They felt like they couldn't take care of all the people that were coming. Ninety thousand asylum-seekers arrived in Austria last year. They thought, will our money go - will our money be able to provide for them? Will we have places for them to live? And some Austrians were also scared that there would be a rise in violence. There were - there was a - there were a spate of crimes in the last few months that were caused by migrants. But people thought, OK, this is a trend, even though it - overall crime statistics did not go up. So there was this sense of fear, this sense that we can't manage this crisis. And the establishment politicians didn't do anything to help us. They just sort of let this ship go unmoored and were watching it. So this is one reason why Norbert Hofer did win so much support. GREENE: And where does he go from here politically? I mean, is that far-right movement that he tapped into - I mean, is it in trouble in Austria or are there places for him to go now? KAKISSIS: You know, this is actually a victory for him. Even though he's not president, he came very, very close. And I was at a party last night. They were celebrating - the Freedom Party was celebrating it. Norbert Hofer's party was celebrating it because they said even if Norbert Hofer is not president tomorrow, we won. We have half of Austrians behind us, and we are going to be a political force in Austria in the years to come. That's pretty accurate. And that's also - even though the Green candidate is now the president, it's troubling many European Union politicians that here we go, this party won half of Austrian support, half of Austrian votes. GREENE: All right. We've been speaking to reporter Joanna Kakissis this morning in Vienna as we're just getting results from a presidential election. A left-leaning independent candidate who supports immigration, says he helps the - it helps the economy, has narrowly defeated a far-right candidate. Joanna, thanks very much.

Donald Trump has energized millions of Republican voters this primary season with his tough talk of building a wall along the Mexico border and deporting people who entered the country illegally. But, that same language could have an unintentional side effect in a general election and energize legal immigrants to become citizens before November so they can vote against Trump. Jose Lovos moved to the U.S. legally 20 years ago from the war-torn country of El Salvador. These days, he lives in Virginia with his wife and three kids. Lovos was eligible to become a citizen years ago, but he said he never got around to filling out the paperwork. \"I wasn't very interested before in becoming a citizen because we weren't too worried about anything,\" Lovos said in Spanish outside a hotel in Washington D.C. where he works as a maintenance man. \"But now there's all this rhetoric about deporting 11 million undocumented people.\" So on Christmas Day, he and his wife decided it was time to become citizens. \"We want to help elect a good president for people in this country who don't have a voice or a vote,\" said Lovos. \"I want to become a citizen to help other people, because other people have done it for me in the past. Citizens are the people who have power to make change.\" Lovos said the primary reason he's becoming a citizen now is so that he can vote in November against Trump. \"I don't understand why [Trump] has to generalize. Candidates can't say all immigrants are bad or that we have to deport them all,\" said Lovos. There are an estimated 8.8 million people like Lovos in the country \u2014 legal permanent residents who are eligible to become citizens. And, in the months after Trump announced his bid for president, citizenship applications were up 14.5 percent compared to the year before, according to data from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. Of course, applications tend to spike in election years. And, from year-to-year applications also fluctuate because of other factors: possible fee increases or organized citizenship drives. This year, there's also been an intense push by immigrant groups because of Trump. A coalition called \"Stand Up To Hate\" has held held more than 300 workshops across the country in recent months. In March, they helped nearly 13,000 people with their citizenship applications. At one workshop in Miami, Mauricio Lotero, 42, sat in a college classroom listening to instructions from USCIS officers. Lotero says he came to the workshop because of presidential politics. \"If Donald Trump is the president of the United States, maybe the immigrants or my citizenship will be affected in the future,\" he explained. Lotero says he wants to have a vote in the presidential election. \"I don't want Donald Trump as president, so that's one of the reasons I want to vote, because I want to vote against Donald Trump,\" he said. It's hard to say for certain whether the spike in citizenship applications is a correlation or a causation. But, David Damore, a professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and an analyst with the public opinion research group Latino Decisions, remembers a similar pattern in recent history. \"We found this in California in some of the work I did with Latino Decisions on the effect of Proposition 187 in the early 1990s,\" said Damore, referring to the ballot initiative in California that sought to eliminate government services \u2014 including K-12 schooling \u2014 for people living in the state illegally. The measure passed, but it was never implemented. Still, in the years following the controversial vote, Damore said Latinos were mobilized in new ways. \"You saw more participation, but you also saw more people who were eligible to naturalize, naturalizing,\" he said. And, data from USCIS confirm there were record numbers of citizenship applications in 1996 and 1997. \"It's that threat that has been proven to be an important mobilizer among immigrants to get them to naturalize and eventually participate in the political process,\" Damore said. Citizenship applications are currently higher than normal. The Pew Research Center points out that \"the number of legal permanent residents applying for U.S. citizenship in the four months starting last October is at its highest level in four years ... up 5 percent from the same period before the election.\" But, still the current surge in applications is a fraction of the growth seen in some previous years. In 2007, ahead of a proposed fee increase, roughly 1.4 million immigrants applied for citizenship. According to Pew, that 2007 bump was \"an 89 percent increase over the previous year \u2014 the single largest annual increase since the government started tracking naturalization applications in 1907.\" So, it may be too soon to definitely say what's happening this presidential cycle. Anecdotal evidence from immigrant groups and attorneys suggest thousands of additional immigrants have applied for citizenship this Spring, but up-to-date citizenship data from USCIS is not yet available. Even if the current surge is nowhere near as high as the record years, activists point out that Latinos and Asians who become citizens are more likely to play an outsized role in the election because history shows they tend to vote at a higher rate than their counterparts who were born citizens.",

Maria Sanchez is a 63-year-old widow, grandmother of three and a legal permanent resident who has lived and worked in Sonoma County, Calif., for more than 40 years. But she has also come close to being deported. Four years ago, Sanchez was almost separated from her family here in the U.S. for a crime she committed in the late 1990s. Hers is a story that brings up one of the most volatile issues in this election season \u2014 immigration, and by extension, deportation. President Obama has said he wants to prioritize the deportation of immigrants with criminal records. In 2014, he stressed that immigration agents would target \"felons, not families.\" Sanchez's situation, however, reveals that some immigrant felons are not what they seem. And many may still have a strong case for remaining in the United States. Sitting in her suburban home, Sanchez remembers how close she came to being deported. She was returning from a vacation in Mexico, as she had several times before without a problem. But this time, Sanchez was detained at the Oakland airport and questioned for several hours by immigration officials. \"They treated me like I was a criminal, and all I've ever done is work,\" Sanchez says. The authorities had found a 14-year-old drug conviction on her record. According to court documents, in 1998, Sanchez had pleaded guilty to one charge of cultivation of marijuana. She says she had grown four small plants and soaked the cannabis in rubbing alcohol as a tincture for her arthritis. Sanchez was sentenced to four months of house arrest, three years of probation and a fine. She thought the case was over. But she was slated for deportation because her conviction qualified as an aggravated felony. It's a category that can apply to a broad range, from the activities of a drug cartel leader to an incident of someone growing marijuana for personal use. According to government data released to Human Rights Watch, between 2007 and 2012 the government deported more than 34,000 non-citizens for marijuana possession. But the data don't break down how many were here illegally, or how many were legal residents like Sanchez. \"I don't feel that the law itself is inherently unjust,\" says Jessica Vaughan, the director of policy studies for the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring immigration limits. She says she can't think of a reason why someone holding a green card should escape the consequences of their actions. \"Anyone who is granted permanent residency is able to have that privilege with the condition that they are not going to commit crimes or otherwise be causing problems in the United States, and the law provides for deportation if the crimes are of a certain severity,\" Vaughan says. Rose Cahn, an attorney with the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights in San Francisco, says, \"Let's just be absolutely clear \u2014 we're not talking about people with murder convictions on their records.\" She runs a program matching immigrants like Sanchez with pro bono lawyers who negotiate with prosecutors to get the original conviction erased on the basis of a 2010 Supreme Court ruling. \"There is a right to know the immigration consequences of a conviction before you enter into a plea agreement,\" Cahn adds. \"And if the defense counsel has not told the defendant about the looming immigration consequences, then that conviction is legally invalid.\" And if the conviction is invalid, it can be vacated or erased. So if there is no conviction, there's no deportation. Cahn's program has 50 cases pending. Most involve immigrants facing deportation, because in the 1990s, the government expanded the definition of aggravated felony to include low-level drug offenses. And the immigrants face removal even though they already had paid a penalty, such as a jail sentence or probation, in some cases more than a decade ago. Cahn's team has never lost a case. As a result, Maria Sanchez just learned a few weeks ago that her ordeal is over. She won't be separated from her family. But as she tells her story, she still wrings her nervous hands. \"I never would have planted the marijuana if I would have known that this was going to happen,\" she says.",

            "article_content": "In an emergency, hospitals, by law, must treat any patient in the U.S. until he or she is stabilized, regardless of the patient's immigration status or ability to pay. Yet, when it comes time for the hospitals to discharge these patients, the same standard doesn't apply. Though hospitals are legally obligated to find suitable places to discharge patients (for example, to their homes, rehabilitation facilities or nursing homes), their insurance status makes all the difference. Several years ago I began caring for a man who'd been in our hospital for more than three months. He was in his 50s and had suffered a stroke. Half his body was paralyzed and he couldn't swallow food. After weeks of intensive physical, occupational and speech therapy, he regained his abilities to eat, drink and walk with only minimal help. But he still wasn't well enough to live on his own, prepare food or even get to the toilet by himself. Ideally, we would have discharged him from the hospital to a rehabilitation facility so he could continue therapy and make more progress toward his prestroke state. But our plan faced insurmountable barriers. First off, the patient was an immigrant who had entered the country illegally. Second, he didn't have insurance. Because he lacked health coverage, no other facility would accept him. His immigration status meant that we couldn't find an outside charity that would cover the costs of his care or pay for insurance. Our comparatively expensive acute care hospital was therefore compelled to hold him \u2014 with the meter running. After another month, it began to seem that he'd become a permanent resident of our hospital ward. \"Could he go back to Mexico?\" our case manager asked. We were startled. No one on my team had ever experienced a situation like this, so we began researching the possibility. As it turned out, it's a murky legal and ethical area that drew some public attention after an expose in The New York Times in 2008. Nevertheless, our hospital faced a real financial burden, and the case manager pressed on. After reaching the patient's family in Mexico, and discussing issues with the Mexican consulate, the case manager began making travel arrangements to a rehabilitation hospital in Mexico. Medical air transport to another country is an expensive proposition \u2014 roughly $50,000, depending on the equipment needed and the distance to the receiving facility in the patient's home nation. From the hospital's point of view, it was easy to see that this large one-time expense would be worthwhile. The transfer to Mexico would put a stop to the indefinite, uncompensated costs of continued hospitalization. Further, the transfer would open up the patient's bed to a new (and presumably insured) patient. After several meetings between our medical team, case management services, and a hospital administrator, I reluctantly agreed to sign off on the transfer. Though the discharge plan left me feeling uncertain, I became more comfortable with the idea because our patient had the capacity to make his own decisions. He consented to return home to Mexico because it was clear that he was no longer physically able to work, and his family was also on board with the plan to help him. A few weeks later the transfer was completed. The last I heard about the man, he had successfully arrived at the rehabilitation hospital near his hometown in Mexico. I hadn't thought of this case for years until the combination of a recent Shots piece about dialysis and the heated rhetoric of the election season about immigration caused the memory to bubble back up into my consciousness. Reflecting on the man's case, I began to wonder all over again: Who were we to send him back to Mexico? On the other hand, what alternative did we have for a safe and reasonable discharge? I also hoped to understand if our experience was part of a broader trend or a sporadic occurrence. I could only find estimates of the number of so-called medical deportations because there isn't any required reporting or specific oversight. It's a murky area that falls in the gap between federal health and immigration regulations. The best estimates suggest dozens or maybe a few hundred cases occur each year. I called several air ambulance companies to gauge the demand for such services, but none was willing to provide numbers or even go on record to discuss the practice in general. One group that has studied the phenomenon offered a conservative estimate of 800 cases of medical deportation over a period of six years. \"We field calls from across the country, so it is a national problem and not confined to border states,\" Lori Nessel, director of the Center for Social Justice at Seton Hall University School of Law, told me in an email. Even in the absence of hard numbers, the medical community has responded to the investigative reporting and advocacy around the practice. In 2012, the American Medical Association added an opinion to its Code of Medical Ethics that states, in part, a \"discharge plan should be developed without regard to socioeconomic status, immigration status, or other clinically irrelevant considerations.\" A 2014 piece in The New England Journal of Medicine concluded with the opinion that doctors \"...are uniquely equipped to display the moral courage necessary to advocate effectively for patients by calling attention to the profound ethical issues raised by repatriation,\" using a slightly fancier word for deportation. Health care for immigrants is a hot button issue. Though the Affordable Care Act excludes immigrants who entered the country illegally from the mandate to purchase health insurance, many U.S counties have taken steps to provide preventive and chronic care for them. The obvious rationale is that this care saves money and prevents suffering in emergency situations. I'm confident that the transfer home of the Mexican man who'd had a stroke was both consensual and sensible. But given reports of patients being transported without their consent, this practice needs legal clarity to match the ethical aspirations of my profession. One thing is clear: Without a policy change, hospitalized people who entered the country illegally and who don't have insurance will remain vulnerable to the seemingly irreconcilable conflict in our society between commerce and medicine.

Every election, there's that chorus of people who insist they are moving to Canada if candidate so-and-so wins. Everyone knows these people. They're tweeting and Googling about it as you read this. One Nova Scotia island is even specifically appealing to the anti-Trump crowd. Searches for \"Move to Canada\" are higher than at any time in Google history #SuperTuesday pic.twitter.com/0KBJPrHdEO And, yeah, some people actually follow through with it. The Guardian dug up one such couple earlier this year. Another immigration lawyer tells NPR that he has definitely seen this happen on a wider scale. \"I did a lot of American immigration in the late 1990s, 2000s, [and] there was a huge spike in liberal-leaning individuals moving north,\" said David Aujla, a Vancouver-based immigration lawyer. But is there ever a mass movement? Kind of. Maybe. It depends on what you mean by \"mass,\" really. We know. It's a crappy answer. But it's a tough question to answer because the Canadian government has data on how many people move there, but not on why they move. When asked the \"I'm moving after this election\" question, Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada sent NPR data on Americans who gain permanent residency status in Canada (gaining permanent residency is a necessary step toward gaining Canadian citizenship). Here's what it shows: So there's a spike in the 2000s, when the total number of people getting permanent residency status each year roughly doubled, to nearly 10,200 new permanent residents in 2008. Is this evidence that politics drove emigration to Canada? Aujla thinks so. \"Bush was elected [in] November 2000 and was president for eight years. If you were a disgruntled Democrat and applied for immigration to Canada at the beginning of 2001, it would take about 18 months to 30 months to finalize the permanent resident application,\" he wrote in an email. He reads that as a spike because of Bush's election, followed by a downturn that he attributes to both President Obama's election and the economic crisis. It's true, of course, that plenty of conservative Americans were upset enough to want to leave when Obama was elected. But Obama didn't inspire this kind of migration, Aujla said, because Canada is (broadly speaking) more liberal than the U.S. \"A lot of people call to vent. I remember even getting a call from this fellow in Texas as soon as Obama got elected,\" Aujla said. \"And suddenly I'm thinking to myself, 'Well, why are you calling Canada?' \" But seriously. Why did they move? The problem is that it's hard to know for sure. Changing countries is a major, complicated decision, and a lot of factors can play into it. Another lawyer said he thinks economics \u2014 and not politics \u2014 likely explains a lot of this movement. \"I think there is probably a more direct correlation to the strength of the U.S. economy than to presidents,\" said Joel Guberman, a Toronto-based immigration lawyer, in an email to NPR. He said the statistics tell him a different story. \"It appears that the high is 2008-09. The worst years for the U.S. are the highest exits, while very prosperous years are lower.\" Guberman doesn't buy that politics is the primary force driving U.S. movement to Canada. Mostly, he says, the threats to move to Canada never become more than that: just threats. \"Did we get an increase in phone calls? Sure. Does real activity take place? Not really. It's a handful,\" he said. \"It causes a stir and that vocabulary starts being used, but does it actually materialize? Not really.\" He has practiced immigration law for more than 30 years, and his firm currently has 17 lawyers on hand, so he has handled a lot of clients trying to move into the country. How many Americans has he helped to gain residency in Canada? \"I can count them on one hand,\" he said. \"Oh, it's minuscule.\" For context, the figures in that above graph aren't huge numbers \u2014 8,000 or 9,000 new Canadian permanent residents from the U.S., out of the roughly 260,000 total people getting permanent residency in Canada each year, aren't that many. Not to mention 8,000 or 9,000 out of nearly 320 million total Americans. And a few thousand is certainly far fewer than however many people are driving those spikes in Google searches. Also, it would probably be a little, um, American of us to assume that our politics are the only things driving people over the border. Aujla, for example, said that a lot of Americans moved to Canada in the 1990s and early 2000s not only because of politics but because of exchange rates. A strong dollar helped convince people they could afford life in Canada. In addition, he said, Canadian politics plays a role in determining how many people move into the country. Tighter immigration rules in the past few years, under former Prime Minister Stephen Harper's conservative government, may have cut down on the number of people moving to Canada after around 2012, Aujla says. One other important point: Politics is only one factor in why a lot of people move to Canada. Politics \"was a very minor consideration\" for Jim Gauer, a 63-year-old architect and writer, who moved to Canada in 2004. That was right in that prime, Bush-era, emigration wave \u2014 but he said the reasons behind moving to Canada weren't very political. Rather, he was tired of New York City's high cost of living. He had recently been to Victoria, in British Columbia, on vacation and had always thought it was a nice city. But he added that today's politics have cemented that his decision was the right one. \"Now that I'm here, the gong show that passes for presidential campaigns south of the border reminds me that politics have a lot to do with my desire to stay here.\" Americans increasingly renounce their citizenship Semi-relatedly, while the number of Americans fleeing to Canada may not be skyrocketing right now, the number of Americans who give up their U.S. citizenship each year sure has. But, again, it's probably not politics; rather, they just might be fed up with the IRS. Tax attorneys Andrew Mitchel and Ryan Dunn have been compiling expatriation data at International Tax Blog, and the numbers show that more than 4,200 Americans expatriated (that is, \"renounced their U.S. citizenship or terminated their long-term U.S. residency\") last year. That's 10 times higher than in the late 1990s. To be clear, these aren't people running away from the U.S.; lots of them already live overseas but are only now choosing not to be U.S. citizens. As with the Canadian permanent residency data, there are no official data on exactly why people are doing this. For their part, Mitchel and Dunn have said they doubt that it's politics or tax rates themselves. Instead, Mitchel says it's about U.S. tax reporting rules. \"The rules are really complicated, and it costs them a lot to have their tax returns prepared,\" he said. While some Americans abroad may be actively avoiding paying their taxes in the U.S., he says that plenty of others simply don't know what the rules are. And when they do finally discover what they have to pay and what the rules are on reporting their taxes, they decide to renounce their citizenship. He credits the recent spike in expatriation, then, in part to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, a 2010 act that ramped up enforcement of tax laws and, in his word, \"flushed people out of the bushes.\" So lots of people might say that they're leaving the country if (pick one) Trump/Clinton/Cruz/Sanders/Kasich is elected president. But lots of people will give up their citizenship for entirely different reasons. And of those who do actually say they want to leave, few will probably end up going to Canada.",

She plans to caucus for Bernie Sanders because she likes his message on \"race\" and \"social classes.\" So far this campaign season, much of the political conversation involving millennials has centered around college debt. And, no doubt, as we've reported previously, student debt and college affordability are major concerns for many young people. But a majority of young people do not have a bachelor's degree, according to U.S. Census data analyzed by CIRCLE, the Center for Research and Information on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University, for NPR. CIRCLE found that, in fact, about two-thirds of millennials between the ages of 25 and 34 do not have a bachelor's degree. And in Nevada \u2014 which holds its Democratic caucuses Saturday \u2014 that number is even higher. About 80 percent of 25- to 34-year-olds don't have a college degree. For some of these millennials, the hefty cost of college is what steered them away from trying to go to college in the first place. For many others, there are other complex political priorities this campaign that have nothing to do with college. They range from economic inequality to affordable child care to immigration reform. Andrea Perkins, 23, works at a day care making $8 an hour, and she said that's not enough money to live. (Consider: That's less than $17,000 a year working full time.) \"Reasonable to me would be like $10, $11,\" she said flatly. She was in a rush to get home to her sick 3-year-old son. For many young parents, affordable child care is a top priority. But Perkins is worried about more than her son's life as a toddler; she's worried about his future as a teenager. \"I have a 3-year-old son who is African-American,\" she said and then paused. \"Black women shouldn't be scared for their son's life. I am scared that when my son gets older, he may not make it back home to me because of the color of his skin.\" She wants the next president to focus on improving race relations and policing. Jose Renteria, 28, says his main priorities this campaign are immigration reform and curbing the high cost of health care.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jose Renteria, 28, says his main priorities this campaign are immigration reform and curbing the high cost of health care. Las Vegas is a city where minorities are the majority. They're a mix of black, Latino and Asian. About 1 in 5 people in the state is foreign-born. Many, like 28-year-old Jose Renteria, are the children of immigrants. \"I'm Mexican-American. My parents are from ... kind of down near the Texas border,\" explained Renteria, a union carpenter, as he walked off work with a bottle of water in one hand and a lunch cooler in the other. He stopped for a few minutes to explain that his top issue this election season is immigration. \"Just open up the doors,\" he said. \"Open up the doors. Do more background checks. Let people who really want to be here, be here.\" For Renteria, immigration policy is personal. Plenty of his relatives still live in Mexico. \"I get phone calls from them all the time,\" he said. \"They want to be out here; they would love to be out here; they would love to be making the wages that we make. To them, somebody getting paid good is $80 a week.\" So he wants the next president to focus on immigration reform. He thinks Hillary Clinton ought to be the country's next president. He's also deeply concerned about the high cost of health care now that he has two kids and thinks Clinton would be the best candidate \u2014 though he won't actually be caucusing for her or anyone else Saturday. He's working. But one of his fellow carpenters, Amanda Durio, said she's not going to miss out on the Saturday caucuses. \"I'm going in for Bernie,\" she explained. She likes his focus on economic inequality. \"There are very dramatic differences between lower class and middle class now,\" she said. Durio knows, because she's actually lived between those economic divides. At 31, she said she's making good money now \u2014 almost $29 an hour \u2014 but before she joined a union, she was struggling financially. \"There were plenty of weeks and months where bills were coming, and I wasn't sure if my paycheck was going to cover it,\" Durio said. \"And there were times when it didn't. And I just had to juggle like which bill is more important to pay right now, literally. I [was working] 40 hours a week; I come home, and I still can't pay my bills.\" Alma Gonzalez, 19, voted in the midterms and says she wanted to caucus Saturday but can't afford to take the day off work. She makes $9.50 an hour at Macy's.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Alma Gonzalez, 19, voted in the midterms and says she wanted to caucus Saturday but can't afford to take the day off work. She makes $9.50 an hour at Macy's. Higher wages was a common concern for young working people in Nevada. At an upscale shopping mall on the Las Vegas Strip, just across the street from the gilded Trump tower, Alma Gonzalez works at Macy's making $9.50 an hour. She has thought about going to college, but said she isn't sure what to study and doesn't want to waste money figuring out her major. So for now, the 19-year-old works at the mall and lives at home with her mom. Finances are tight. \"My mom makes about $32,000, $34,000 a year, and she has nothing for herself,\" Gonzalez said. \"That's all it goes to \u2014 mortgage, bills, everything. She's, like, scraping it.\" The economy, specifically higher wages, is one of her top priorities, but so is immigration. Nevada is home to the largest percentage of people living in the country illegally, according to data from the Pew Research Center. And, for Gonzalez, that abstract number \u2014 7.6 percent of the state's population \u2014 includes one of her best friends. \"A path to citizenship, a quicker one, would be great,\" she said. Gonzalez is an anomaly as a millennial \u2014 she voted in the 2014 midterm elections, when youth voter turnout is traditionally low. And she was hoping to caucus Saturday. \"It's not that I don't want to go,\" she said, \"it's that I can't. I would love to \u2014 I really would.\" But she's working from noon to 7 p.m. and said she can't afford to take the day off.",

During World War II, thousands of Americans lied about their age to enlist in the military. During the Iraq war, Daniel Torres lied about something else. \"I didn't want to be just another Mexican living in the U.S. I wanted to say I'd done something for the country,\" said Torres. Torres' parents came to the U.S. legally, but overstayed their visas \u2014 leaving him without a green card. But in 2007, with the death toll in Iraq and Afghanistan peaking, a Marine Corps recruiter in Idaho was happy to rush through the formalities. Social Security number? Check. High school diploma? Check. Criminal record? None. \"Well, what about your birth certificate?\" Torres remembers the recruiter asked. \"I'm from Mexico,\" Torres said. \"He's like, 'Well, come back Monday.' \" Torres came back Monday with a U.S. birth certificate \u2014 it was fake, but for a good cause, he thought. He deployed to Iraq, near Fallujah, in 2009. When his unit came home and started gearing up for a tour in Afghanistan, Torres lost his wallet. When he tried to get his ID replaced, his story came apart. Instead of going to Afghanistan, Torres wound up in Tijuana, Mexico, unable to return to the country for which he had fought. Immigrants have always made up a portion of the Armed Forces in America \u2014 joining the U.S. military has always been one of the fastest ways to get U.S. citizenship. About 8,000 troops with green cards became citizens that way last year alone. But it doesn't happen automatically. And veterans who did not go through the process of becoming citizens \u2014 they can be deported, if they get in trouble later on, just like any other noncitizen. \"Many people are unaware that the United States deports military veterans,\" says Margaret Stock, a former Army lieutenant colonel and an immigration lawyer. Stock says immigrants have been enlisting since 1775, and it's always been a fast track to citizenship.

Naturalization used to be part of basic training, but the laws changed, Stock says. As a result, lots of green card holders went to Iraq and Afghanistan without becoming citizens. She says the Obama administration has been aggressive about deporting immigrants who commit crimes, including veterans, though no one knows an exact number. It's rare enough that even Marine Daniel Torres says he'd never heard of it. \"When I got to Tijuana, I thought my case was unique. It wasn't until I found this place that I realized it was a bigger issue,\" Torres says. This place is The Bunker, or the Deported Veteran Support House. It's a small storefront in eastern Tijuana with a few dormitory rooms. An Army vet named Hector Barajas has been running the shelter for about five years \u2014 at first from his home.

At left is a collection of photos from Hector Barajas' service in the U.S. Army. \"When they'd deport any veterans, they would usually end up in my apartment. That's the system we had,\" Barajas says. Barajas served in the Army for 5 1/2 years. He got out in 2001, after trying to get help for drug and alcohol addiction. Soon after, he was involved in a shooting in Los Angeles \u2014 no one was hurt, but he did prison time. Then authorities drove him to the border and dropped him in Mexico. Barajas spent time on the street himself. By the time he set up The Bunker, he knew what he was doing. \"Somebody coming in, they gotta sign in, go get a medical report. They have a certain time to stay here; everybody's got to look for a job. If you want to run a men's home, you gotta have some kind of a system for everything,\" Barajas says. That includes drug rehab. When the guys who come to him need to clean up, Barajas sends them across town \u2014 to another deported veteran. Pastor Robert Salazar (center) prays before giving his sermon at the \"Cruising for Jesus\" mission of Tijuana. Salazar's church also runs a men's drug-rehab shelter nearby to help deported veterans.\n                \n                    \n                    David Gilkey/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption In a warehouse a few miles away, a band opens services at the \"Cruising for Jesus\" mission of Tijuana. Pastor Robert Salazar preaches on a stage flanked by classic East LA low-rider cars and trucks inside the church. Salazar's church also runs a men's drug rehab shelter, and he's happy to help deported veterans. Salazar was a U.S. Marine in the mid-1990s. Just like Barajas, he got hooked on drugs and ran into trouble with the law. After a robbery conviction, Salazar was deported in 2005 \u2014 dropped at the Tijuana border at 3 a.m. \"I hadn't been here since I was 3 years old,\" Salazar says. \"You might as well have dropped me off in China \u2014 that's how foreign this place was to me,\" he says. He did all right, though. Salazar got religion and started his church. His wife came down and joined him. Ten years later, he says he wants to stay, but he'd like to be able to visit his family in California. \"I think I should have the right to visit my mother; my mother's 76 years old, with failing health,\" he says. \"My daughter now is a Marine. She's been in the Marine Corps for nine months. I served in the Marine Corps. I should be able to see my daughter graduate boot camp.\" Margaret Stock, the immigration lawyer, says the rules about deportation are confusing and not evenly applied. Congress could fix that, she says, but Washington is gridlocked, and immigration is now chained to election-year politics.

            "article_content": "Thousands of immigrants are trying to become U.S. citizens ahead of the presidential election. Immigrant groups encourage people to become citizens so they can vote in November against Donald Trump.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Donald Trump has energized millions of Republican voters with his tough talk on immigration. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. GREENE: But that same language could have an unintentional side effect in a general election. Many immigrants are trying to become citizens before November so they can vote against Trump, as NPR's Asma Khalid reports. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Jose Lovos has been living in the U.S. legally for 20 years. He moved from the war-torn country of El Salvador. And these days, he's a maintenance guy at a hotel. He lives in Virginia with his wife and three kids. And he tells me he could have become a citizen years ago, but he just never got around to filling out the paperwork. JOSE LOVOS: I never before have interest to apply for citizen. KHALID: We started speaking in English, but Lovos is more comfortable speaking in Spanish. LOVOS: (Through interpreter) I wasn't very interested before in becoming a citizen because we weren't too worried about anything. But now there's all this rhetoric about deporting 11 million undocumented people. KHALID: And on Christmas Day, he and his wife decided it was time to become citizens. LOVOS: (Through interpreter) Because we want to help elect a good president for people in this country who don't have a voice or a vote. I want to become a citizen to help other people because other people have done it for me in the past - citizen to the people who have power to make change. KHALID: Lovos tells me the main reason he's becoming a citizen now is so that he can vote in November against Trump. LOVOS: (Through interpreter) I don't understand why he has to generalize. Candidates can't say all immigrants are bad or that we have to deport them all. KHALID: There are about 9 million people like Lovos in the country - legal permanent residents who are eligible to become citizens. And in the months after Trump announced his bid for president, citizenship applications were up 15 percent compared to the year before. Applications tend to spike in election years. But this year, there's also been an intense push by immigrant groups because of Trump. Together, they've held more than 300 workshops across the country in recent months. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Why choose naturalization? (Speaking Spanish). KHALID: I went to one in Miami, and I met Mauricio Lotero in the crowd. Lotero is from Colombia. And he says he came to this workshop because of Trump. MAURICIO LOTERO: If Donald Trump is the president of the United States, maybe the immigrants or my citizenship will be affected in the future, you know? KHALID: He says he wants to vote. LOTERO: I don't want Donald Trump expressing. So that's one of the reasons that I want to vote because I want to vote against Donald Trump. KHALID: It's hard to say for certain whether the spike in citizenship applications is a correlation or a causation. But David Damore with the public opinion research group Latino Decisions says he's seen this pattern before. DAVID DAMORE: We found this in California - some work I did with Latino Decisions on the effect of Proposition 187 in the early 1990s. KHALID: Prop 187 was a ballot initiative in California. It sought to eliminate government services, including K-12 schooling, for people living in the state illegally. The measure passed, but it was never implemented. Still, in the years following, Damore says Latinos were mobilized. DAMORE: So you saw more participation, but you also saw more people who were eligible to naturalize naturalizing. KHALID: And it's true. Stats from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services show there were record numbers of citizenship applications in 1996 and 1997. DAMORE: It was that threat that has been proven to be an important mobilizer among immigrants to get them to naturalize and then eventually participate in the political process. KHALID: We don't know for sure how many people are naturalizing this cycle because we don't have the final data yet. But people who become citizens tend to vote at a higher rate than people who are born citizens. Asma Khalid, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Major demographic changes are driving contentious debates over immigration in Washoe County, Nevada, this year. Voters there represent both sides of deep divisions the campaign has exposed.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: The third and final presidential debate will be in Nevada tomorrow. It's a state where the presidential race is close and where control of the Senate could be decided. Washoe County in western Nevada is predominantly white. Its Hispanic population has grown dramatically over the years, and that's the kind of demographic change that has sparked the sometimes contentious debate over immigration during this election. NPR's Sarah McCammon traveled to Reno to get a sense of what voters there are thinking. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Brent Harger (ph) has always voted. But until this year, the 57-year-old former mechanic says he'd never really gotten involved in politics. BRENT HARGER: I've always been told my voice means nothing. I don't believe that. MCCAMMON: Harger is disabled, and he's using some of his free time to volunteer for the Republican Party's get-out-the-vote efforts in Washoe County. HARGER: And there's a lot of people that are scared to even say anything today because they don't think their voice means anything. MCCAMMON: Harger says he doesn't feel free to express his opposition to same-sex marriage. His wife, Leslie Harger (ph), expresses fear along with frustration. She says there are people in the community who look suspicious to her. And Harger says the taboo of racial profiling keeps her from freely speaking out. LESLIE HARGER: We just keep our eyes open, and we're vigilant because of the way that terrorists, you know, are coming into our country now. MCCAMMON: The Hargers met at a wedding in Reno more than 35 years ago, married and raised two sons now 28 and 30. Both are living at home and have struggled to pay for college and get good jobs. And over the years, the Hargers have seen the area change. When they met, Hispanics represented 1 in 20 residents of Reno. Today they're 1 out of every 4. Since 1980, the percentage of Reno residents born outside the U.S. has more than doubled. Leslie Harger says she supports legal immigration, but sometimes she feels like newcomers have it better than they do. HARGER: We can all enjoy each other's multi-cultures, and, like, we all like Mexican food. Or we like, you know, all different kinds of food and things. But don't come here and take. And that's what I think that I'm seeing. A lot of people are taking. MCCAMMON: Despite working for decades, the Hargers say they've struggled to get disability payments for Brent's back and neck injuries. Meanwhile, they see some immigrants getting good jobs and worry they're taking work from native-born citizens. Across town at a Mexican restaurant and grocery store, two young women are keeping the family business going while their parents are out of town. GRACIA MORA CHAVEZ: Hi, my name's Gracia Mora (ph), and we are here at (speaking Spanish). MCCAMMON: Gracia Mora Chavez (ph) is 19, and she puts in about 50 hours a week here. She's quiet and reserved but not shy about her role in running the family business. MORA CHAVEZ: I'm the boss, you know? (LAUGHTER) MCCAMMON: You're kind of proud of that, aren't you? MORA CHAVEZ: Yeah, I'm proud of it. MCCAMMON: Mora Chavez was here on a recent day when Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine made a surprise campaign stop. She became a U.S. citizen as a small child, and she plans to cast her first vote for the Democratic ticket. She says Donald Trump is unfairly singling out her community with his rhetoric on immigration. MORA CHAVEZ: He stereotypes Mexicans or Latinos. And we are the ones who actually work to have a better future. MCCAMMON: Her cousin Daniela Araya Chavez (ph) is 21 and does not have legal status. She's been here since she was a young child. DANIELA ARAYA CHAVEZ: I didn't choose to come here by myself, you know? My mom decided to come here, and it was actually a really good choice because I just have better opportunities here. MCCAMMON: Araya Chavez says she's hoping to get legal status through her fiance and go to school. She says Trump's talk about crimes committed by undocumented immigrants paints an unfair picture of the people she knows. ARAYA CHAVEZ: Do you ever see, like, a Hispanic person, like, asking you for money outside or whatever - no. They'd rather, like, go work. I've seen a lot of people, like, struggling even selling, like, ice cream or stuff like that, (unintelligible) knocking at your house, you know, to, like, get money or whatever to support themselves and their family. MCCAMMON: Gracia Mora Chavez switches to Spanish for a moment to try to express her thoughts about Trump. MORA CHAVEZ: (Speaking Spanish). MCCAMMON: \"He's an ignorant person,\" she says, \"who critiques Latinos without knowing who they are.\" Leslie Harger feels like Trump is the first politician in a long time really knows what's going on. And that's brought her comfort. HARGER: I live in a lot of pain and stuff that I have to deal with every day. MCCAMMON: Trump's candidacy has been a bright spot in her life, especially since her cancer diagnosis last year. HARGER: This thing when Trump came along - it's been a dark eight years, and I mean a dark eight years. I've watched my country go from a place where I felt safe to a very unsafe world. I don't feel safe anymore here. And you know, I just - Trump has given me hope that we can get somebody who's got his fingers on the pulse of what's going on. MCCAMMON: A source of hope for some and fear for others in a year when divisions have been laid bare. Sarah McCammon, NPR News, Reno, Nev. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

But most of the conversation around millennials focuses on college graduates and their concerns about student loan debt. So what issues matter most to young people who don't go to college?  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: So far this campaign season, the political conversation with millennials has centered mostly around college debt. But think about this. About two-thirds of people between the ages of 25 and 34 do not have a bachelor's degree. In Nevada, which holds its Democratic caucuses Saturday, that number is even higher. So what issues matter most to those voters? NPR's Asma Khalid reports from Las Vegas. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Let's meet 23-year-old Andrea Perkins. She works at a daycare. ANDREA PERKINS: I make $8 an hour. KHALID: She says that's not enough. PERKINS: Reasonable to me would probably be 10, $11. KHALID: Perkins is in a rush when we're talking because she's got to get home to her 3-year-old son, and like many other millennials who have kids, affordable childcare is a top priority. But she's worried about more than her son's life as a toddler. She's worried about his future. PERKINS: Black women shouldn't be scared for their son's life. I'm scared that when my son gets older, he may not make it back home to me because of the color of his skin. KHALID: And she wants a president to focus on improving race relations and policing. Las Vegas is a city where minorities are the majority. There are a mix of African Americans, Latinos and Asians. Many, like 28-year-old Jose Renteria, are the children of immigrants. JOSE RENTERIA: I'm a Mexican-American, and my parents are from Durango. It's down by - kind of by the Texas border. KHALID: Renteria's a union carpenter, and I meet him as he's getting off work - a bottle of water in one hand, a lunch cooler in the other. He stops for a few minutes to explain that his top issue this election season is immigration. RENTERIA: I mean, just open up the doors. I mean, open up the doors. Do more background checks. Let people that really want to be here be here. KHALID: For Renteria, this is personal. He's still got plenty of relatives in Mexico RENTERIA: I get phone calls from them all the time. They want to be out here. You know, they would love to be out here. They would love to be making the wages that we make. To them, somebody getting paid good is $80 a week out there. KHALID: He wants the next president to focus on immigration reform. He's also concerned about the high cost of health care, and he thinks Hillary Clinton ought to be that next president. Though he won't actually be caucusing for her or anybody Saturday because he has to work. But one of his fellow carpenters, Amanda Durio, says she will definitely be there. AMANDA DURIO: I'm going in for Bernie. KHALID: She likes his focus on economic inequality. DURIO: There are very dramatic differences between a lower class and middle class now. KHALID: And Durio has actually lived between those lines. She says she's making good money now - almost $29 an hour. But before she joined a union, she was struggling financially. DURIO: There were plenty of weeks and months where bills were coming, and I wasn't sure if I - if my paycheck was going to cover it. And there were times when it didn't, you know? And I had to just kind of juggle, like, OK, which bill is more important to pay right now? KHALID: Higher wages is hands down the most common concern I hear again and again from young working people in Nevada. At an upscale shopping mall on the Las Vegas Strip just across the street from the gilded Trump Tower, I meet Alma Gonzalez. ALMA GONZALEZ: Today, I actually picked up a shift in the back where we package everything that people order online, so that's what I've been doing all day. KHALID: She works at Macy's making 9.50 an hour. She's living at home with her mom. GONZALEZ: My mom makes about, like, 32,000 or 34,000 a year, and she, like, has nothing for herself. That's all the groceries, like, mortgage, bills, everything, and she's, like, scraping it. KHALID: Gonzalez voted in the 2014 midterms and wants to caucus Saturday.

            "article_content": "More than 700,000 people have been temporarily shielded from deportation by President Obama's immigration program. Many are watching the presidential race to see how long the policy will last.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: One of the groups with the most at stake at this year's presidential election cannot vote. JUNG RAE JANG: Yes, I cannot vote, you know, go to the polls because if I do then I think it's a felony, right? MARTIN: That's because Jung Rae Jang is not a U.S. citizen. He's one of the estimated 11 million people living in the U.S. without authorization. But he's temporarily protected from deportation by President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. It's called DACA, and it may end if Donald Trump wins the presidency. NPR's Hansi Lo Wang has more on how some of these DACA immigrants are preparing for the next president. HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Even though Jung Rae Jang won't be lining up at the polls on Tuesday, he has been going door to door in New York City reminding U.S. citizens to vote. JANG: So the election is coming on... UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Speaking Mandarin). JANG: November 8, yeah. So see you at the poll site. All right. WANG: Jang flew from South Korea to the U.S. with his mom when he was 15. He overstayed his student visa. But about four years ago, he received DACA, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. It's allowed him to work as a community organizer for the MinKwon Center for Community Action in Flushing, Queens. He's been meeting with other DACA recipients, mainly from South Korea and China. JANG: I see a lot of people that are very worried about what might happen after the, you know, president's election. They might lose their DACA. You know, they might - in the worst case, getting deported from the United States. WANG: More than 700,000 immigrants staying in the U.S. illegally are temporarily protected from deportation. For now, they have work permits and Social Security numbers, but they're not legal residents and their lives could be up-ended if the next president decides to end President Obama's executive action. MONICA SIBRI: So when do you think you can have the target audience done? ESCARLETH FERNANDEZ: The target audience is, like, undocumented... WANG: Escarleth Fernandez is working through her fear of the election results. She's at a coffee shop in New York, planning a conference for students who are also staying in the U.S. illegally. FERNANDEZ: I've known that I'm different since I can remember. WANG: Fernandez was 4 years old when she and her parents left Bolivia. A car took her across the U.S.-Mexico border illegally before her family settled in New York. Now she's trying to help DACA recipients like her find ways to pay for college through the conference. FERNANDEZ: This is a way for those students that feel so much pressure to feel like there are other people like them and there are other opportunities. WANG: Whoever wins the White House, immigrant advocates say they're worried about how immigrants will be treated after the election finally ends. Monica Sibri has been working with DACA students at the City University of New York on a T-shirt campaign. SIBRI: T-shirts say, I am an immigrant. WANG: Immigrant students wore the shirts to spark conversations on campus. But Sibri says some students were worried. SIBRI: Because of the rhetoric of our immigration as a whole, one of them in particular was like, will this have an impact with one of my professors who is not so pro-immigrant? WANG: Having uncomfortable conversations about immigration, though, is how Ivy Teng Lei is coping with the election. IVY TENG LEI: Did you say the I-word? JEFFREY CHAN: That's illegal status - yes, I did. LEI: No, it's called undocumented. CHAN: Oh, OK, undocumented. I'm sorry. WANG: Lei's having a dinner chat with an old college friend, Jeffrey Chan, about her immigration status and the election. LEI: I am constantly having political conversations with my friends, and I have been told that I shouldn't. WANG: Lei left China when she was 7 and then overstayed her visitor visa in New York. After college, she worked in marketing for a major fashion brand because of DACA. Lei says if the program ends and she has to leave the U.S., she'll organize protests against immigration officials. LEI: I will bring an overwhelming amount of people to knock on their door and ask them, how many planes are you going to fly to bring us back? Is this really where you want your tax dollars to be spent? I refuse to give up without a fight. WANG: The legal fight over an expansion of the DACA program will continue after the election. It would have temporarily protected about 4 million parents of U.S. citizens and green card holders from deportation. But a lawsuit put that program on hold. And after a tied decision at the Supreme Court, the case is back in a lower court in Texas. Hansi Lo Wang, NPR News, New York. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Cuba is seeing a surge in tourism, helped in part by the arrival of Americans. But it is suffering economically, in part because of its reliance on fuel from Venezuela, which is itself collapsing.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: It's been a hot and tough summer in Cuba. Despite a tourism boom in the wake of warmer relations with the U.S., the Cuban economy is hurting. The island's benefactor, Venezuela, is suffering its own economic spiral downward and has drastically cut oil subsidies to Cuba. For the first time in decades, Cubans are dealing with power outages and transportation shortages. Communist Party officials say the last half of this year will be even tougher. NPR's Carrie Kahn is in Havana and joins us now. Good morning. CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: And ever since, Carrie, the U.S. and Cuba re-established diplomatic ties, we've been hearing about this flood of tourists rushing to the island. Why isn't that helping the economy more? KAHN: Well, there are other really important moneymaking sectors here, and they're hurting. Like, for example, nickel is a commodity that's just had a worldwide price plunge. And the Cuban sugar crop, it hasn't been so great. So tourism is growing, but it can't do it all. You know, they've seen 3 million - more than 3 million tourists in the last year. That's a 20-percent rise over the previous year. But they just don't have the infrastructure to really get at all that money. There's two large construction cranes on the historic Old Havana Skyline. I've never seen that before. They're building big, huge hotels. And direct flights from the U.S. to the island started last week, so they're expecting even more tourists. It's just how can Cuba really grab at that money and really take advantage of this boom? MONTAGNE: Well, at the moment, to deal with this weakening economy, I gather the government has announced austerity measures. KAHN: Yes, they have. They began in July. They started putting out all these warnings that they're really going to have to cut back on gas supplies, and that's been a big hit to Cuba's rough-and-tumble transportation system here. There are very few public buses, and there's always long lines. And you see these buses just stuffed to the gills. So many depend on this network of private taxis to get around the city. You know, we see all those old, fancy cars, but those are for the tourists only. What the regular Cubans use are old, rundown cars. Nearly all those independent taxis bought their gas on the black market. And now, with these cuts and the oil subsidies and cuts to the gasoline supply, the black market's really drying up. And they just take their taxes off of the streets, so there's a lot of trouble getting around. It's really tough right now. MONTAGNE: Well, all of what you just described suggests that detente with the U.S. hasn't necessarily helped ordinary Cubans, even though, in a way, that was how it was billed - better relations would help, not hurt at all. KAHN: Right. What it also did was it raised expectations among foreign investors that came here and from Cubans, too, especially after Obama's historic visit here. That was in March, so just three months later they announced these austerity measures. It's just been a rough rollercoaster of emotions for Cubans. MONTAGNE: Does that mean, then, that a lot of Cubans are leaving, given these tough times? KAHN: Yes, a lot of Cubans are leaving, especially with, you know, all the tough talk in the U.S. election about cracking down on immigration and the possible end of the preferential immigration treatment that Cubans get who land on U.S. soil. So there is a fear that that's going to end, and that's pushing this tide of Cubans out, too, along with the terrible economic situation here. The numbers are up of the amount of Cubans coming to the U.S. that, even in the last three years, if you total up those numbers, Renee, it's approaching that number that came during the Mariel boatlift. If you can imagine that now, when the austerity measures and the times are not as difficult, it's a huge number of Cubans that are leaving. MONTAGNE: Carrie, thanks very much.

            "article_content": "President Obama has some advice for his successor \u2014 don't strike out on your own. Obama turned to executive actions and regulations on a number of big issues like labor, climate and immigration \u2014 where Congress had blocked his agenda. It's something Republicans have decried. Some call the president \"lawless\" for going around the legislative branch. In an interview with NPR's Steve Inskeep airing on Morning Edition, Obama made it clear it's not the approach he preferred. \"My suggestion to the president-elect is, you know, going through the legislative process is always better, in part because it's harder to undo,\" Obama said. It's a lesson weighing on his mind as Trump's incoming administration has vowed to reverse many of the steps Obama took through executive order and administrative rules. \"Elections mean something\" The Obama administration's efforts to increase overtime pay, curb the carbon dioxide emissions of power plants and protect people living in the country illegally from deportation are all suddenly vulnerable. That's something Obama said he accepts: \"If he wants to reverse some of those rules, that's part of the democratic process. That's, you know, why I tell people to vote \u2014 because it turns out elections mean something.\" Obama told NPR that Trump is \"entirely within his lawful power\" to sign new executive orders of his own. \"Keep in mind, though, that my strong preference has always been to legislate when I can get legislation done. In my first two years I wasn't relying on executive powers because I had big majorities in the Congress and we were able to get bills done, get bills passed. And even after we lost the majorities in Congress, I bent over backwards consistently to try to find compromise and a \u2014 a legislative solution to some of the big problems that we've got.\" Obama pointed to immigration, saying he \"held off for years in taking some of the executive actions that I ultimately took in pursuit of a bipartisan solution.\" He was referring to a big immigration reform package that was crafted by a bipartisan group of senators and passed the Senate in 2013, only to be stalled in the House with objections from conservatives, in particular to the \"path to citizenship\" that the bill would have provided for many in the country illegally. The White House promised at the start of 2014 that it would be a \"year of action\" after being frustrated by Congress, particularly since 2011 when Republicans took control of the House and had enough votes in the Senate to sustain filibusters. \"I've got a pen, and I've got a phone,\" the president said at the time, as Republicans accused him of turning his back on bipartisan solutions. Obama signed sweeping executive orders in 2014 that shielded millions of people living in the country illegally from facing deportation. \"If House Republicans are really concerned about me taking too many executive actions, the best solution to that is passing bills,\" he said then. \"Pass a bill. Solve a problem.\" In June, a deadlocked Supreme Court ruling effectively killed one of those immigration orders, which shielded about 4 million people from deportation. Drones: \"We're getting too comfortable\" Obama also reflected in his NPR interview on the controversial decision to expand drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen and the Horn of Africa. \"I'm the first one to admit that we didn't get it all right on Day 1,\" he said. \"There were times where, for example with respect to drones, that I had to kind of stop the system for a second, and say, 'You know what, we're getting too comfortable with our ability to take kinetic strikes around the world' without having enough process to avoid consistently the kinds of civilian casualties that can end up actually hurting us in the war against radicalization.\" The administration acknowledged in July that drone strikes in countries where the U.S. has not been engaged in ground combat have killed up to 116 civilians since Obama took office. The president told NPR, in reference to drone strikes and surveillance by the National Security Agency, that he was confident his administration had built the \"guardrails\" needed to \"set up a whole series of processes to guard against government overreach, to reform some practices that I thought over time would threaten civil liberties.\" Obama has issued an executive order instructing the director of national intelligence to release statistics on the use of drone strikes each year \u2014 another measure Donald Trump could overturn if he wants to.",

Born in Bhutan, Dorjee is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has lived in upstate New York for nine years. He runs a successful restaurant, as well as an arts festival, in the tiny town of Plattsburgh, near the U.S.-Canadian border. Over the years, he has been singled out a few times \u2014 but nothing like what he experienced the day after the election. \"It was a couple of guys standing next to a couple of trucks. And that's when they say, 'Hey chink, get the F out of my country. Go back to where you came from.' And I just smiled at them,\" he says, sighing. \"Then it happened again.\" In fact, in the past few weeks, he has been harassed repeatedly for being an immigrant, from racist slurs hurled his way to vandalism of his car. Dorjee is a Buddhist. But the recent events shook him up so much that he considered buying a gun for protection, of himself and his family. Then, his community rallied \u2014 powerfully and publicly \u2014 behind him. A longer version of this story is available at North Country Public Radio.",

Two days before the presidential election, a remarkable media narrative was taking shape. Latinos, huge numbers of them, were turning out to vote early, and they were doing it in crucial swing states. It looked like the election, in which many Latinos had felt attacked by the Republican candidate, Donald Trump, was going to end with the most poetic justice. Latinos were going to deliver Trump's candidacy its final death blow. But just as important to Maria Teresa Kumar, the president of Voto Latino, was the flip side of that justice. After many elections in which Latino voters had been important but not decisive, they would finally be able to say that they had delivered the presidency \u2014 in this case to Hillary Clinton. That would be the most powerful narrative, because it would also portend big things for the future. Kumar and other Latino leaders were already getting ready to whip out what Kumar had taken to calling their \"De Nada\" agenda (de nada is Spanish for \"You're welcome\"). It was a list of policy priorities they knew they'd be able to demand of the new president thanks to the crucial role Latinos were going to have played in electing her. At the top of the list \u2013 as it has been for years \u2014 was immigration reform. Also on the list: Improvements to health care, education, and women's reproductive rights. Then, of course, the unexpected happened. On Nov. 8, Kumar had been at MSNBC serving as an on-air commentator all night. After Trump won it all, she said she was walking through the hallway and ran into one of the few Latinos who works at the network. He was crying. \"Because he knew what had just happened to our community,\" Kumar said. Latino leaders had expected to be able to finally pass immigration reform, including protections for the 16 million immigrants who are either undocumented or live in homes where someone is undocumented. With a Clinton victory, they expected to pass it even if Congress remained in Republican hands. \"When people feel heat, they coalesce and end up doing the right thing if only to save their own political skins,\" Kumar said. Instead, the expectation of power and influence that Latino leaders thought they would have come inauguration day was dashed by the Republican sweep. Trump, a man who promised mass deportations, called Mexican immigrants rapists, and who Latino civil rights leaders say has, to date, refused to meet with them, had ascended to the presidency. Two days after the election, a coalition of Latino groups called a press conference at the National Council of La Raza's headquarters in Washington, at the same time that President Obama was welcoming President-elect Trump into the Oval Office just four blocks away. At the lectern, leaders of those groups spoke of their pride over what had, in fact, been record Latino voter turnout. But they were also on the defensive. They implored the media to stop citing exit poll data that suggested 29 percent of Latinos had supported Trump. They pointed instead to data from Latino Decisions, a widely respected polling firm that claims a more precise methodology, that indicate the number was actually 18 percent. \"The Latino population is significant enough in numbers that there is no excuse to keep getting these numbers incorrect,\" said Clarissa Martinez, deputy vice president of the National Council of La Raza. \"Or at least to not know enough about challenging the data that is coming out.\" For Latino leaders, the distinction is crucial, because it defines the final narrative about the role Latinos played in this election. At 18 percent, Trump's support among Latinos is a record low for Republicans, becoming a bargaining chip for Latino leaders who might warn that this kind of under-performance becomes even more consequential in the next election, when Latinos will be a larger share of the electorate. But at 29 percent, Trump would have done better among Latinos than Mitt Romney did in 2012, a number Republicans can point to to show that they already have significant Latino support without ever having engaged the advocates on their issues.",

            "article_content": "Following Donald Trump's victory Tuesday, many undocumented immigrants are uncertain and anxious about their future under his presidency.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: One group especially on edge following Donald Trump's victory - immigrants in the U.S. illegally and the people who love them. During his campaign, Trump promised mass deportations. Today many families are grappling with what their future may look like under a Trump presidency. NPR's Adrian Florido reports. ADRIAN FLORIDO, BYLINE: As results came in Tuesday night and a Trump victory seemed likely, a group of undocumented activists marched to the White House to declare that despite everything Trump has promised, they are not afraid. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting) Undocumented, here to stay. Undocumented, here to stay. FLORIDO: But in immigrant homes across the country, conversations sounded different last night. LAURA MARQUEZ: It's just going to add so much more fear for my family. FLORIDO: Laura Marquez is 24, lives in San Diego. She was born in the U.S., but her dad is undocumented. He was deported to Mexico once but came back. After Trump's victory Tuesday, Marquez called her parents. MARQUEZ: My mom's really positive. She doesn't think he can deport all of us because there's not enough money. And my dad's just quiet, but his voice cracked a lot. But my dad's pretty typical macho, so he was trying to hide it. I just heard, like, sadness and fear. He couldn't believe it either. FLORIDO: Pablo Colindres is also 24 and works in Nebraska. He is undocumented, as is his family. PABLO COLINDRES: I was telling them, you know, well, I'm pretty sure that he will, you know, carry on with this promise and deport us all. FLORIDO: Colindres is able to work legally because of DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that President Obama created in 2012. It's given work permits to hundreds of thousands of young immigrants and temporarily shielded them from deportation. But Obama implemented DACA by executive order, and Donald Trump has promised to end it. So Colindres says... COLINDRES: I've already looked into some shipping crates for all my books so I can send them back to my grandmother's house in Guatemala where I'm from. FLORIDO: Colindres is hoping that Trump won't make good on his deportation promise. But the possibility he will is sinking in for a lot of young immigrants on DACA. When President Obama announced DACA, many thought twice about applying because it meant the government would then know who they were. Thirty-two-year-old Erick Huerta, who came to the U.S. when he was only 7, had those fears when he applied for DACA. ERICK HUERTA: I knew eventually that in the world of possibilities if something like this were to happen, that I was in that basket. So while there is that sense of fear, it's also kind of just like, OK, you know, this is the kind of stuff we've thought about and prepared ourselves for. FLORIDO: He, too, hopes Trump will reconsider his deportation plan. And like many immigrants here illegally, he says he will fight to stay in this country. But Huerta also sent a message to the Mexican consulate in Los Angeles. He asked if it could offer any tips on how to start a new life in Mexico just in case. Adrian Florido, NPR News, Washington.

Brent Harger of Washoe County, Nev., says he has always voted, but until this year, he'd never really gotten involved in politics. \"I've always been told my voice means nothing. I don't believe that,\" Harger says. \"And there's a lot of people that are scared to even say anything today because they don't think their voice means anything.\" Brent and Lesley Harger don't like the kind of change they see in Washoe County, Nev. \"We just keep our eyes open and we're vigilant because of the way the terrorists, you know, are coming into our country,\" Lesley Harger says.\n                \n                    \n                    Sarah McCammon/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption At 57, Harger can no longer work as a mechanic because of problems with his neck and back. He has been using some of his free time to volunteer for the Republican Party's get-out-the-vote efforts in Washoe County on behalf of GOP nominee Donald Trump. Harger says he feels like the culture has changed, and he doesn't feel free to express his opposition to same-sex marriage. His wife, Lesley Harger, 59, says she feels like she can't freely point out people in her community who look suspicious to her because racial profiling is taboo. \"We just keep our eyes open and we're vigilant because of the way the terrorists, you know, are coming into our country,\" she says. Washoe County is one of the most hotly contested battlegrounds in one of the most important swing states this year. The area around Reno is seeing some of the demographic changes that have been at the center of some of the most contentious debates of this campaign. For some native-born residents, that rapid change is a cause for concern that Donald Trump is addressing like no politician they've seen before. For new residents, Trump's campaign is alarming. The Hargers met at a wedding in Reno more than 35 years ago. They married and raised two sons, now 28 and 30. Both sons are still living at home, and the Hargers say they've struggled to pay for college and get good jobs. In that time, the couple has seen the area change dramatically. Since 1980, the percentage of Reno residents born outside the United States has more than doubled. When the Hargers met, Hispanics represented 1 in 20 residents; today, they're 1 out of every 4. Trump's message on immigration resonates with them. Lesley Harger says she feels the culture around her changing rapidly in ways that don't always feel right. \"We've noticed more and more in Reno that there's more and more different ethnicities,\" she says. \"Come here and enjoy America. Come here and assimilate \u2014 that's all I'm asking.\" She says she supports legal immigration \u2014 but sometimes feels like newcomers have it better. \"We can all enjoy each other's multicultures \u2014 like we all like Mexican food, or we like all different kinds of food and things. But don't come here and take. And that's what I think I'm seeing \u2014 a lot of people are taking,\" Harger says. Despite working for decades, the Hargers say they've struggled to get disability payments for Brent's back and neck injuries. Meanwhile, they see immigrants getting good jobs \u2014 and worry they're taking work from native-born Americans. Across town at a Mexican restaurant and grocery store, two young women are keeping the family business going while their parents are out of town. Grecia Mora Chavez is 19, and she puts in about 50 hours of work each week here. She's quiet and reserved, but not shy about her role in running the family business. \"I'm the boss, you know,\" she says with a laugh. Mora Chavez was here on a recent day when Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine made a surprise campaign stop. She became a citizen as a young child and plans to vote Democratic. Mora Chavez thinks Trump is unfairly singling out her community with his rhetoric on immigration. Grecia Mora Chavez (left) and Daniela Arrella Chavez at their family's restaurant and grocery in Reno.\n                \n                    \n                    Sarah McCammon/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Grecia Mora Chavez (left) and Daniela Arrella Chavez at their family's restaurant and grocery in Reno. \"He stereotypes Mexicans or Latinos, and we are the ones who actually work to have a better future,\" she says. Her cousin, Daniela Arrella Chavez, 21, talks of being brought to the United States as a young child without documentation. \"I didn't choose to come here by myself. You know, my mom decided to come here, and it was actually a really good choice because I just have better opportunities here,\" she says. Arrella Chavez is hoping to get legal status through her fiance and go to school. She says Trump's talk about crime committed by undocumented immigrants paints an unfair picture of the people she knows. \"Do you ever see a Hispanic person asking you for money outside or whatever? No, they would rather go work,\" she says. \"I've seen a lot of people struggling, even selling ice cream, or stuff like that, tamales, knocking at your house to, you know, get money or whatever to support themselves and their family.\" Mora Chavez switches to Spanish for a moment to try to express her thoughts about Trump: \"Muy ignorante.\" She says he critiques Latinos without knowing who they are. For Lesley Harger, Trump seems like the only candidate in a while who really understands what's going on \u2014 and that comforts her. \"I live in a lot of pain, and stuff that I have to deal with every day,\" she says. Since a cancer diagnosis last year, Trump's campaign has been a bright spot in Lesley's life. \"It's been a dark eight years. I mean a dark eight years. I've watched my country go from \u2014 go from a place where I felt safe to a very unsafe world. I don't feel safe anymore here,\" she says. \"Trump has given me hope, that we can get somebody who's got his fingers on the pulse of what's going on.\"",

            "article_content": "Immigration is one of the most divisive issues in the presidential race. NPR takes a look at Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's policy proposals on the subject.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will have one last chance to debate policy tomorrow night. We are going to get an early start with Platform Check. It's our look at what the candidates say they will do if they become president. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: We should raise the national minimum wage. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: And we will build the wall. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: ...Tunnels, our ports, our airports - they need work. And there are millions of jobs to be done. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: New trade policies that put American workers first. MCEVERS: Today, we are talking about immigration. There are an estimated 11 million immigrants living in this country illegally. And the candidates have very different ideas about how to deal with that issue. With us to talk about this is NPR's John Burnett, who covers immigration. He's in south Texas, not far from the U.S.-Mexico border. Hi there. JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: Hi, Kelly. MCEVERS: So let's start with Donald Trump. I mean, immigration, of course, has been a signature issue for him. What are his positions? BURNETT: Well, first of all, this is just an amazing presidential race, in terms of the issue of immigration. People who follow this stuff have never seen such polarized positions before. And not only that - but Trump has just, you know - he's found this rage over illegal immigration. He's made it such a broad election theme. It's almost defined his candidacy in some ways. Trump's main position is still the wall, which everybody that I've spoken to, from security experts to border patrol agents, say is a complete non-starter. It's not going to happen. But still, it really fires up his crowds. Here he is in Cincinnati criticizing Hillary Clinton. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Behind closed doors, when she thought no one was listening, she pledged to dissolve the borders of the United States of America. It's what's happening, folks. That's what's happened. We are going to have strong borders. We are going to have a great wall. (CHEERING) BURNETT: A few more of his positions on immigration - Trump wants the detention of more unauthorized immigrants, to stop the so-called catch-and-release. And it would mean no more ankle monitors or community release. Effectively, it would dramatically expand the U.S. government's reliance on the private prison industry. And for her part, Clinton has said she would do away with private prisons for immigrants. So Trump also says he wants to cancel President Obama's executive order of November 2014 that would expand the categories of immigrants who could be protected from deportation and given work permits. That was that very controversial executive action by the president. MCEVERS: Early in his campaign, Donald Trump called for a deportation force to round up and send back people in the U.S. illegally. Where does he stand on that now? BURNETT: You know, it's really interesting, Kelly. He's quietly dropped this position of mass deportation of 11 million unauthorized immigrants, which was one of his earlier signature positions. Now he talks about zero tolerance for criminal aliens with this special deportation task force, which would catch and deport them. And interestingly, Hillary Clinton says the same thing. She says, I want to focus on those who pose a violent threat to public safety. And when I hear them talking about that, I think, well, there's already a deportation force. It's called Immigration and Customs Enforcement and removal. Under Obama, deporting criminal aliens has been a big priority. Even today, 60 percent of ICE deportations are convicted criminals. MCEVERS: Let's talk about Hillary Clinton now. Here she is talking about immigration back in August. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: And in my first 100 days, I'm going to introduce legislation for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship... (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: ...As not only the right thing to do. Every independent analysis shows it will add hundreds of billions of dollars to our economy. BURNETT: You know, immigration policy people who watch this stuff say hers is an unbelievably generous platform for immigrants - maybe the most generous ever. She says she would expand the president's executive actions. She would include even more categories of immigrants who would be allowed to stay here legally and get work permits, such as immigrants with a history of service and contribution to their communities. Obama's action, of course, is now blocked in the federal courts. Clinton says she would pass comprehensive immigration reform. This was the law that was blocked in Congress in 2013. It's been dead in the water ever since. And in her idea, it would include a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. It would reduce family visa backlog and include smarter border security. MCEVERS: The Border Patrol and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement unions have endorsed Donald Trump. Neither has endorsed a presidential candidate before. Why? Why are they endorsing now? BURNETT: Well, I've talked to them just as kind of part of my reporting. And what they say is they just appreciate that Donald Trump has put border security so high in his platform - that no other presidential candidate has made it, you know, such a standout issue. And the Border Patrol agents know this terrain well. And they know that it's completely impractical to build a wall in some of these, you know, mountainous areas and all the private property - and all the problems that would be caused. But still, for the first time ever, the Border Patrol and ICE union have both endorsed him because they appreciate that he's paying attention to them. MCEVERS: That's NPR's John Burnett. Thanks a lot. BURNETT: You bet, Kelly. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

And it often took a while for those who stayed to learn English and integrate into American society. With just weeks to go until election day, our airwaves are filled with debates about immigrants and refugees. Who should be in the United States, who shouldn't, and who should decide? These modern debates often draw upon our ideas about past waves of immigration. We sometimes assume that earlier generations of newcomers quickly learned English and integrated into American society. But historian Maria Cristina Garcia says these ideas are often false. \"Most immigrants who came to the United States did not immigrate to become American,\" she says. \"In many cases immigrants came to replicate the best of the old country in more favorable circumstances.\" Garcia says in the 19th century, it often took a long time for new immigrants to learn English. \"Our founding documents were all published in German to accommodate the German-speaking populations. For most of the 19th century, instruction in public schools across the country \u2013 from Pennsylvania to Texas to Wisconsin \u2013 occurred entirely in languages other than English, or bilingually. And this practice was not abolished until the first decades of the 20th century.\" Nor did immigrants of that era classify themselves as legal or illegal. \"They just didn't think in those terms,\" she says. \"During much of our history people moved across our borders with ease. If your ship docked outside of New York City, chances were you weren't even interviewed. So when someone says to me, 'My ancestors immigrated legally, why can't [immigrants today]?', my first question is, 'When did your ancestors immigrate?' Because if they immigrated in the 19th century or in the early 20th century, they simply didn't use that vocabulary. They didn't think in those terms.\" This week, Shankar talks with Maria Cristina Garcia as part of a series of shows exploring the underlying frames and assumptions at play in the lead-up to the U.S. election.

            "article_content": "Arizona, a traditionally red state, is in play for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton this year. The state has voted Republican since 1952, except for Bill Clinton's win in 1996. But today, some polls show Clinton looking competitive, or even with a slight advantage in the state. And The Arizona Republic recently endorsed Clinton for president, the first time the paper has backed a Democrat since it began publication in 1890. Immigration is a big issue in this border state. Arizona may have a reputation as a state that favors a hard-line stance on illegal immigration because in 2010, former Republican Gov. Jan Brewer signed into law the toughest immigration enforcement legislation in the country. But a recent poll found that a majority of Arizona voters do not support building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, or deporting all undocumented immigrants, two of the policies that have come to define GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump's candidacy. Morning Edition traveled to Arizona as part of NPR's Divided States series, where we profile voters in several battleground states ahead of the presidential and vice presidential debates. We met with four voters from across the political spectrum, learning what issues are important to them ahead of the debate, and then later, heard their post-debate take. (Click on the audio above to hear the voters on immigration and implicit bias. Click here to hear them discuss the death penalty and abortion.) Before the debate, two voters were undecided; one was a Clinton supporter, and another an enthusiastic Donald Trump backer. Did the match-up between vice presidential nominees Indiana Gov. Mike Pence and Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine move the needle for any of them?

Let's face it, this election cycle has been a bit disheartening for many voters. The candidates are the two most unpopular major party presidential candidates on record and a massive number of people won't commit to either one. #DearWashington I served with a brave man who gave his life to save others. The GOP candidate savaged his family then hid behind generals. pic.twitter.com/1dwZhJTXAc Our country is facing grave challenges and serious threats \u2014 from terrorism, climate change and a growing wage gap, to name just a few \u2014 yet the campaign is also full of noise \u2014 from the latest insult to spats on Twitter. But beyond the noise, politics and \u2014 more broadly \u2014 government affect our lives, our communities and the direction of our nation. To that end, NPR is passing the mic to you, our audience. We're asking you to share something that you want your leaders in Washington to know about why this election matters to you, your families and your communities. We kicked off the conversation on Monday, Sept. 26, and some common threads have already emerged. Many of you are overwhelmed by student debt. You're worried about the well-being of your neighbors. You're paying too much for health care and child care. We've shared some of these and other stories below. Many of them have sparked their own online conversations. What else? What are your concerns this election cycle? Tell us, using #DearWashington. Share your story on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or Snapchat.

I went back to work when my youngest was only 5 weeks old, and even though I'm fortunate enough that he can come with me, it is hard! It is not just about being generally healed from physical childbirth trauma, but emotionally we need to be able to spend time with our babies, making sure they are getting the quality of care they deserve. Most babies don't sleep through the night until they are a year old, and sometimes longer than that! Parenting is hard enough...we don't need the additional challenges such as choosing between a career and a family, or family size. We live in rural America, we don't have our pick of daycares and even then some areas don't provide for jobs outside of the typical 9-5.At this point, anything is better than what we currently receive.#DearWashington.

We can't afford the American dream! We have a system that rewards banks and corporations for stealing our future, all while it kills innocent civilians in the street. We see our friends and families sent to fight perpetual wars, all while corporations make record breaking profits selling weapons. Our elderly starve, our youth are uneducated, and our middle class is gone. This is the America we know, but it shouldn't be. It's not a question of confronting hardship for some greater good, it's a question of confronting inequality. Too few have too much, while too many have too little. We are the most productive and wealthy society in human history, yet somehow there is nothing left for those of us who make it so. Future President, we want you to know all of these things.

Memo to candidates: Stop generalizing and psychoanalyzing your opponents' supporters. It never works out well for you. The latest to fall into that trap is Hillary Clinton. The Democratic nominee, at a New York fundraiser Friday night with liberal donors and Barbra Streisand, said \"half\" of Trump supporters fit into a \"basket of deplorables,\" while the other half are people who feel the government has let them down and need understanding and empathy. The comments have rocketed around the Internet, infuriated conservatives and threaten to once again throw salt in the wound of the American cultural divide in a presidential election that has seen vitriol and insults, fueled by Donald Trump, that have become the norm. The remarks also remind of inflammatory remarks in recent presidential elections on both sides \u2014 from Barack Obama's assertion in 2008 that people in small towns are \"bitter\" and \"cling to guns or religion,\" to Mitt Romney's 2012 statement that 47 percent of Americans vote for Democrats because they are \"dependent upon government\" and believe they are \"victims,\" to his vice presidential pick Paul Ryan's comment that the country is divided between \"makers and takers.\" Here are Clinton's full remarks, per reporter Ruby Cramer at Buzzfeed: \"I know there are only 60 days left to make our case \u2014 and don't get complacent, don't see the latest outrageous, offensive, inappropriate comment and think well he's done this time. We are living in a volatile political environment. \"You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? [Laughter/applause]. The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic \u2014 you name it. And unfortunately there are people like that. And he has lifted them up. He has given voice to their websites that used to only have 11,000 people, now have 11 million. He tweets and retweets offensive, hateful, mean-spirited rhetoric. Now some of those folks, they are irredeemable, but thankfully they are not America. \"But the other basket, the other basket, and I know because I see friends from all over America here. I see friends from Florida and Georgia and South Carolina and Texas, as well as you know New York and California. But that other basket of people who are people who feel that government has let them down, nobody cares about them, nobody worries about what happens to their lives and their futures, and they are just desperate for change. It doesn't really even matter where it comes from. They don't buy everything he says but he seems to hold out some hope that their lives will be different. They won't wake up and see their jobs disappear, lose a kid to heroine, feel like they're in a dead-end. Those are people we have to understand and empathize with as well.\" Elitism and generalizations Clinton's remarks, like Obama's in 2008, smacked of liberal elitism \u2014 liberals talking to liberals about a group of people they don't really know or hang out with, but feel free to opine about when talking to each other. It's always problematic to speak in generalizations, something liberals would be the first ones to point out. At the point in which you hear yourself saying that you might begin talking in \"grossly generalistic terms,\" it's probably best to re-think what's coming next. That's especially true when you don't have data to back up your point. The biggest problem in Clinton's statement is that she said \"half\" of Trump supporters are racists, xenophobes and otherwise bigots. Half means equal or near-equal parts. There's no data to support such a specific number. \"I won't stop calling out bigotry and racist rhetoric in this campaign.\" \u2014Hillary pic.twitter.com/C3Z7GybJ53 Clinton acknowledged that Saturday afternoon in a statement: \"Last night I was 'grossly generalistic,' and that's never a good idea. I regret saying 'half' \u2014 that was wrong. But let's be clear, what's really 'deplorable' is that Donald Trump hired a major advocate for the so-called 'alt-right' movement to run his campaign and that David Duke and other white supremacists see him as a champion of their values. It's deplorable that Trump has built his campaign largely on prejudice and paranoia and given a national platform to hateful views and voices, including by retweeting fringe bigots with a few dozen followers and spreading their message to 11 million people. It's deplorable that he's attacked a federal judge for his 'Mexican heritage,' bullied a Gold Star family because of their Muslim faith, and promoted the lie that our first black president is not a true American. So I won't stop calling out bigotry and racist rhetoric in this campaign. I also meant what I said last night about empathy, and the very real challenges we face as a country where so many people have been left out and left behind. As I said, many of Trump's supporters are hard-working Americans who just don't feel like the economy or our political system are working for them. I'm determined to bring our country together and make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top. Because we really are 'stronger together.' \" Trump picked up on Clinton's Friday remarks in a tweet: Wow, Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard working people. I think it will cost her at the Polls! He elaborated in a statement, saying Clinton's statement was \"disgraceful\" and called her original comments \"the worst mistake of the political season.\" He said Clinton is \"unfit and incapable\" of serving as president and that he would \"be President for all of the people.\" Clinton would have been on firmer footing if she had stuck to the kinds of careful caveats used in her speech about the alt-right. As recently as Thursday, Clinton used the \"basket\" analogy. And on Sunday, Politico wrote about the analogy, noting Clinton's attempts to appeal to Republicans \u2014 in the other basket: \"Former California gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman even introduced Clinton at multiple closed-door August fundraisers in California. There, the candidate explained her approach to Republicans interested in Trump, according to one Bay Area attendee. Clinton divides Trump voters into two baskets, she said: the everyday Republicans \u2014 her targets \u2014 and what she called 'the deplorables' \u2014 the 'alt-right' crowd she excoriates and has no hope of wooing.\" Neither instance received much attention, because of her wording. Note the lack of \"half.\" Clinton's latest remark comes at a time when Clinton was beginning to open up with the press more and planning to speak in more personal terms around issues, in an effort to reduce her near-record unfavorable ratings. (Only Donald Trump has worse ratings for a presidential candidate). She took questions from reporters at length three separate times this past week. And the reason reporters know what Clinton said Friday night is because it was one of just six fundraisers that has been open to the press out of more than 330 she's done in this campaign. The impact of similar remarks: Do they doom or just damage? Romney's presidential campaign was severely damaged by his \"47 percent\" remarks, because it revealed a different kind of elitism for many \u2014 that of a wealthy person who appeared to look down his nose at those who weren't as well off. It fit a narrative that may have deeply hurt Romney's campaign. But even at that point Romney was down in the polls. (His remarks were revealed almost four years ago to the date \u2014 Sept. 17, 2012.) Exit polls on Election Day showed that for voters who said it mattered most to have a candidate who \"cares about people like me,\" Obama won them 81 to 18 percent. Romney lost in an electoral landslide to President Obama. On the other hand, President Obama won in 2008 despite his \"bitter\" remark. Obama's comment was specifically about those affected by job losses in small towns in Pennsylvania and the Midwest. He said they feel left behind and \"cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them, or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment, as a way to explain their frustrations.\" Obama still wound up winning Pennsylvania, many states in the Midwest and the election in an electoral landslide. That's because the political environment was very different and clearly favored Democrats. George W. Bush was wildly unpopular, the war in Iraq had gone wrong and the economy cratered. That's not to mention demographic change. The country is becoming more diverse, and that's helped Democrats in the last two presidential elections. (More on the impact of demographic change in this election below.) Still, Obama's \"bitter\" remarks resulted in days of bad news for him, years of bad feelings and arguably made governing more difficult for the man who proclaimed there was no red or blue America. Yes, there was staunch and calculated GOP congressional opposition against him, but his remarks made it easier to galvanize those forces. Often in the 2008 campaign, the most energy on the GOP side was with Sarah Palin, John McCain's vice presidential pick \u2014 and the very people who took the most offense to Obama's remarks. When the GOP ticket lost, it was, well, bitterness toward Obama that, in part, gave rise to the Tea Party. His \"bitter\" remarks became a mantra for many of these activists. For the right, Clinton's \"basket of deplorables\" remark has become an \"ah ha\" moment, much like Obama's \"bitter\" remarks. (Just check out #basketofdeplorables on Twitter.) The Trump campaign put out a statement from communications adviser Jason Miller that reads: \"Just when Hillary Clinton said she was going to start running a positive campaign, she ripped off her mask and revealed her true contempt for everyday Americans. Tonight's comments were more than another example of Clinton lying to the country about her emails, jeopardizing our national security, or even calling citizens 'super-predators' \u2014 this was Clinton, as a defender of Washington's rigged system \u2014 telling the American public that she could care less about them. And what's truly deplorable isn't just that Hillary Clinton made an inexcusable mistake in front of wealthy donors and reporters happened to be around to catch it, it's that Clinton revealed just how little she thinks of the hard-working men and women of America.\" A backdrop of animosity, conspiracies and unease with demographic change But let's not be Polyannish about this: Donald Trump has benefited from animosity toward Obama that had its roots in the 2008 campaign and the Tea Party; conspiracy theories, many of which he's propagated \u2014 and many of his supporters believe \u2014 against Obama and Clinton; and unease with demographic change. The backbone of his candidacy has been a steady barrage of insults and innuendo for anyone who disagrees with him. And that's something that has animated his base, about two-thirds of which believes the U.S. is becoming too soft and feminine and is bothered by immigrants who don't speak English. (For more on that, see the PRRI/Atlantic poll below.) On conspiracy theories, a Fairleigh Dickinson University poll from this spring, for example, found: \"Trump supporters are also more likely to think that Clinton knew about the Benghazi attacks before they happened, with 50 percent saying that she 'definitely' knew that the consulate was going to be attacked. This figure is far higher than the 12 percent of Sanders supporters who say the same, and the 23 percent of Americans overall who do so. Once again, belief in this conspiracy among Trump's supporters outpaces those of Cruz supporters (43 percent) and Kasich supporters (40 percent). While Republicans in general were more likely to endorse these conspiracy theories than Democrats, Trump supporters were much more likely to do so than other Republicans.\" Most notably, Trump was at the forefront of the \"birther\" movement, which propelled him to right-wing fame, questioning whether Obama was born in the United States. (He was.) That was an effort to de-legitimize a president who has faced unfounded suspicion about his youth and origins \u2014 not only his place of birth, but also whether he was perhaps an \"Arab\" or Muslim. All of that is false. (It was always ironic that Obama could be cast as a Muslim, while also facing criticism for having a radical Christian preacher.) The FDU poll found Trump supporters more likely to be suspicious of Obama's background \u2014 40 percent of Trump supporters said they \"definitely\" believed Obama was hiding something about his background and early life. That was higher than for supporters of other GOP candidates. Obama's birth is not something Trump has made a focus in this campaign. It's something he's been reluctant to talk about. But it's also something he has not disavowed in this campaign, even as he has tried to reach out to the black community. Rudy Giuliani claimed on MSNBC this week that Trump no longer believes it, but given multiple opportunities to say so in this campaign, Trump hasn't. Rather, Trump has fanned the flames of discontent with demographic change. Even as the country has become more diverse, especially more Latino, Trump has angered Latinos with his comments about immigrants in the U.S. illegally, likening them to \"rapists\" and criminals in his announcement speech. He said a judge presiding over a Trump University fraud case couldn't be fair to him because he was \"Mexican,\" even though the judge was born in Indiana. House Speaker Ryan called what Trump said the \"textbook definition of a racist comment.\" Trump has also called for a temporary ban on Muslims coming into the U.S., something he later re-framed to be about people coming from countries with a \"proven history\" of terrorism. He also took on the family of a Muslim-American soldier critical of his rhetoric. That landed him in perhaps his strongest backlash from Republican leaders in this campaign. He tried to \"soften\" his tone in the past month, calling for criminals to be the focus of deportation, and he said he had \"regret\" for some of his comments during this campaign \u2014 though he didn't say what specifically. Trump's attempts to shift his approach, however, have faced a backlash from influential supporters. Eventually, he backed off and went back to a hard-line stance. There's reason for this. Half of Trump's supporters say they \"strongly\" support him, according to an August poll from the Pew Research Center, and 59 percent of them believe falsely that immigrants in the U.S. illegally are more likely than U.S. citizens to commit a serious crime. (As an NPR fact check of Trump's immigration speech noted, \"Multiple analyses have found that immigrants commit violent crime at a lower rate than those born in the United States.\") For context, of the other half of Trump supporters, a lower percentage (42 percent) believe immigrants in the U.S. illegally are more likely to commit violent crime. Just 13 percent of Clinton supporters believe that. According to a Pew report from May, 69 percent of Trump supporters believe immigrants are a burden on the U.S., and 64 percent believe Muslims should be subject to more scrutiny. What's more, a PRRI/Atlantic poll this spring found that Trump supporters are more likely than others to say that: All of those were higher than supporters of other Republicans running for president. And for those who say economic concerns are a great motivator for Trump supporters, the poll found that they are no worse off than Americans overall. As Ron Brownstein wrote of the poll: \"With his signature proposals to build a border wall, deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, and to temporarily ban Muslim immigration, and with his spirited defense of police against 'black lives matter' protesters, Trump has aligned unreservedly with the priorities of the voters most anxious about demographic change.\" Trump's policies with regard to tightening immigration \u2014 and his rhetoric in calling out Latinos and Muslims specifically \u2014 has inspired the white nationalists and alt-right movement that Clinton has highlighted. It's true that several white nationalists and white supremacists have come forward to say they support Trump. David Duke, former Klansman whom Clinton noted in her statement about her remarks, is running for the Senate in Louisiana. He told NPR's Steve Inskeep that he believes there's a \"massive racist, racial discrimination against European-Americans\" and a \"very vicious anti-white narrative.\" He's supporting Trump, and he said that his campaign's polling shows 75 to 80 percent of Trump voters in Louisiana are supporting him. And he and his campaign have retweeted controversial people and images that have originated with the alt-right and white nationalists. Jared Taylor, described as an intellectual leader of the alt-right, told WAMU's Diane Rehm that he supports Trump because his policy proposals are \"congruent\" with the alt-right: \"Donald Trump, I think, has stumbled onto a number of policy proposals that are congruent with those that would be supported by the alt-right not because he has any sophisticated understanding of race, but simply because his instincts are that the country is changing in disagreeable ways,\" Taylor said. \"When he wants to stop all illegal immigration, when he wants to send home all illegal immigrants who are here now, when he wants to stop birthright citizenship, when he wants to take a hard look at Muslim immigration on the assumption that perhaps we don't need any more Muslims in the United States, these are policies that appeal in a powerful way to many ordinary Americans who see their country slipping through their fingers.\"",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump walks with Mexico President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto at the end of their joint statement at Los Pinos, the presidential residence, in Mexico City.\n                \n                    \n                    Dario Lopez-Mills/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump walks with Mexico President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto at the end of their joint statement at Los Pinos, the presidential residence, in Mexico City. Donald Trump has provided the political world with many moving moments over the past year, but none quite like the whiplash mood swing between his daytime and nighttime performances in Mexico City and Phoenix on Wednesday. In the daylight hours, Trump struck his most presidential pose to date with a solemn (if somewhat grumpy) reading of prepared remarks at a news conference alongside Mexico's President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. That somber event, inside the Mexican presidential residence, epitomized the more moderate image Trump has pursued on immigration issues over the past 10 days. But as night fell in Phoenix, back in the U.S.A., Trump mounted the stage in prime time and quickly caught fire. He poured forth an hourlong harangue against all things alien, highlighting the lurid crimes of a handful of illegal immigrants as if to define the character of millions. He also promised to build \"a beautiful wall\" across the entire U.S.-Mexico border and create a \"deportation task force\" that would eventually guarantee that \"the bad ones are gone.\" On the subject of the wall, Trump departed from his script to assure his listeners that Mexico would indeed pay for it \u2014 adding, \"They may not know it yet, but they will.\" In so doing, he as much as acknowledged that Pe\u00f1a Nieto had told him something different earlier in the day. That was not a minor point, but rather a sore one. The issue of the wall's cost had taken over the news and Twitter feeds earlier in the evening. Trump himself had insisted at the news conference in Mexico City that the two men did not discuss the financing of the wall. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who did not contradict Trump at the time (maintaining a striking deference to the American throughout their joint appearance), later tweeted that he had begun their meeting by saying Mexico would never pay for such a wall, a stance Mexican officials have taken consistently. None of the Trump surrogates appearing across the media landscape Wednesday night seemed to dispute this, saying rather that the Wednesday meeting had \"not been a negotiation\" and that more formal talks would ensue on the wall and its financing. Rest assured, they seemed to say, Mexico will come around. Throughout the Phoenix speech, Trump read from a teleprompter but supercharged the script with his own asides and add-ons, many of which riled the already raucous crowd to transports of delight. At one moment, promising to rid the land of criminal immigrants, he shouted that \"in the first hour they are gone,\" and the throng exulted. Trump in such moments would back away and himself applaud until the roar subsided. Listening to the speech, marveling at the about-face maneuver, one could almost hear the spirited debate within the councils of Trump's campaign. One imagined Kellyanne Conway, the pollster-cum-campaign manager, arguing for the quickie trip to Mexico and the confab with Pe\u00f1a Nieto. Since stepping up in mid-August, she has been seen as a moderating influence, seeking a new tone and tenor more appealing to white suburban voters (especially women and college graduates). With Conway seeming to be ascendant, one could easily imagine the day ending with a very different speech in Phoenix. Would Trump not hail his conquest of Mexico City, citing his domination of the news conference where he practically had the Mexican president poised on his knee? Would Trump not repeat his lines of praise for \"first, second and third-generation Mexican Americans\" he said were \"beyond reproach\" and even \"spectacular, hard-working people\"? The die seemed to be cast, and the timing seemed propitious. Because two weeks of adverse publicity about the Clinton Foundation and its donors and about newly discovered emails at the State Department have helped erode Hillary Clinton's already weak standing with voters. For the first time, her disapproval numbers were almost equal to Trump's. Conway seemed to have found just the right moment to raise her candidate's acceptability score in contrast with his opponent. But if this was the opportunity for a turnaround that changed the broad public perception of Trump, it was a moment not only missed but thrust away with both hands. For as soon as that moderating narrative got airborne, Trump's speech in Phoenix took off after it with the speed and fury of an anti-aircraft missile. The explosion as the two met in midair against the desert sky was spectacular indeed. That intercept was launched, in all likelihood, from the campaign's other new major domo, Steve Bannon, the former publisher of Breitbart.com, the self-styled voice of the alt-right movement. Bannon, now called the CEO of the Trump campaign, has been a fan of the hard-line approach on immigration as well as other issues. And whether he or another wordsmith in the Trump camp wrote the script, it was the fuel for one of the candidate's most incendiary performances. In the speech, Trump not only doubled down on the wall and the invoice to Mexico, but on a \"deportation task force\" that would either drive the undocumented out of the country of their own accord or arrest them and send them to their countries of origin. The \"softening\" often promised in recent days seemed to consist only in the delay of the deportation endeavor until the wall could be completed and all the criminal elements of the illegal population first removed. Trump made a point of including in his ban the \"dreamers,\" present in the U.S. now as adults because they were brought to the country as minor children by their parents. This has been an especially popular target group for immigration reformers, and President Obama protected them from deportation orders with one of his executive actions. At some point, Trump allowed, \"we will bring back the good ones.\" But moments after making this concession to what he has called \"being humane about it,\" Trump was filling the stage with the grieving parents of people killed by immigrants in the country illegally. After a day spent putting his weight down on one foot, the Republican nominee was standing firm on the other. And he left little doubt where he would remain through the rest of this campaign.",

            "article_content": "After more than a week of seeming to change direction on immigration policy, and then apparently turning back to his original plan, Donald Trump delivered a speech on the issue Wednesday night in Phoenix. Trump painted a grim picture of immigrants in the U.S. illegally. He brought up families of victims of crimes committed by immigrants in the U.S. illegally. But who is he appealing to with this message? It's more of a primary crowd than a general-election one. Gallup, which has tracked public opinion on this issue, found that 65 percent of Americans favor a path for \"immigrants who are living illegally in the U.S. to remain in the country and become citizens if they meet certain requirements over time.\" That's essentially reflected in the vote margin of the 2013 Senate bill \u2014 68 U.S. senators voted in favor of comprehensive immigration reform that included only a path to citizenship after immigrants pay fines and wait more than a decade without committing a crime. Who does agree with Trump? At least half of Republicans \u2014 31 percent of them want all immigrants in the U.S. illegally deported. An even higher percentage of Americans (72 percent) favor some path to legal status after a period of time, according to the Pew Research Center, including 56 percent of Republicans. During the 2013 immigration debate, House Republicans pushed legalization but not citizenship. After two weeks of flirting with possibly coming around to that House GOP position, Trump is now firmly to their right in a country that is growing decreasingly white and increasingly Latino. NPR's politics team annotated Trump's speech below. Portions we commented on are highlighted, followed by analysis, context and fact check in italics. What a crowd, what a beautiful crowd. Thank you, thank you. Wow. That's a lot of people, Phoenix, that's a lot of people. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Phoenix. I am so glad to be back in Arizona. A state that has a very, very special place in my heart. I love the people of Arizona, and together we are going to win the White House in November. Now, you know, this is where it all began for me. Remember that massive crowd also. So I said let's go have some fun tonight; we're going to Arizona. This will be a little bit different; this won't be a rally speech per se. Instead, I'm going to deliver a detailed policy address on one of the greatest challenges facing our country today, illegal immigration. I've just landed, having returned from a very important and special meeting with the president of Mexico. A man I like and respect very much and a man who truly loves his country, Mexico. And by the way, just like I am a man who loves my country, the United States. We agreed on the importance of ending the illegal flow of drugs, cash, guns and people across our border and to put the cartels out of business. We also discussed the great contributions of Mexican American citizens to our two countries, my love for the people of Mexico and the leadership and friendship that we have between Mexico and the United States. It was a thoughtful and substantive conversation, and it will go on for a while, and in the end we're all going to win. Both countries. We're all going to win. This is the first of what I expect will be many, many conversations, and in a Trump administration we're going to go about creating a new relationship between our two countries. But it's going to be a fair relationship; we want fairness. But to fix our immigration system, we must change our leadership in Washington and we must change it quickly. Sadly, sadly, there is no other way. The truth is our immigration system is worse than anybody ever realized. But the facts aren't known because the media won't report on them, the politicians won't talk about them, and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up because they are making an absolute fortune. That's the way it is. Today, on a very complicated and very difficult subject, you will get the truth. The fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful, powerful politicians. It's all you can do, thank you, thank you. Let me tell you who it does not serve. It does not serve you, the American people. Doesn't serve you. When politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following: amnesty, open borders, lower wages. [The bipartisan immigration reform bill (the \"Gang of Eight\" bill) the Senate passed in 2013 would not have meant \"open borders\" \u2014 it would have increased border security, for example, and included an employer verification system, as Politico reported at the time. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] Immigration reform should mean something else entirely. It should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens. But if we're going to make our immigration system work, then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and very sensitive issues. For instance, we have to listen to the concerns that working people \u2014 our forgotten working people \u2014 have over the record pace of immigration and its impact on their jobs, wages, housing, schools, tax bills and general living conditions. [Trump lamented the \"record pace\" of immigration, but between 2009 and 2014, the U.S. has actually seen more Mexican immigrants LEAVING the U.S. than coming in, a net loss of 140,000 immigrants. \u2014 Domenico Montanaro] These are valid concerns expressed by decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds all over. We also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate. Sometimes it's just not going to work out. It's our right as a sovereign nation to choose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish and love us. Then there's the issue of security. Countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws like they have to be enforced. I have met with many of the great parents who lost their children to sanctuary cities and open borders. So many people. So many, many people. So sad. They will be joining me on the stage in a little while, and I look forward to introducing \u2014 these are amazing, amazing people. Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration and the administration that causes this horrible, horrible thought process. It's called Hillary Clinton. This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody and then was released into the U.S. \u2014 think of it \u2014 into the U.S. community under the policies of the White House, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Weak, weak, weak policies. Weak and foolish policies. He was released again after the crime, and now he's out there at large. Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top student in her class, one day before her death. Also among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open border policy was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21-year-old convenience store clerk and a really good guy from Mesa, Ariz. A lot of you have known about Grant. He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from federal custody. And they knew it was going to happen again. Another victim is Kate Steinle, gunned down in the sanctuary of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times. And they knew he was no good. Then there's the case of 90-year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death. Ninety-years-old and defenseless. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long who did not meet Obama administration standards for removal. And they knew it was going to happen. In California, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, a great woman according to everybody that knew her, Marilyn Pharis was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never, ever deported despite the fact that everybody wanted him out. [Trump cited multiple cases of people who had crimes committed against them, sometimes violent crimes. He noted the case of Marilyn Pharis of California. CBS News reported she was killed in a violent assault. One suspect was in the U.S. illegally and had been arrested two weeks earlier for meth possession. The Santa Maria, Calif., police chief lambasted the system. \"You know what we had to do? We had to cite him out, that's the problem with this system, this is not just in Santa Maria, this is all over the state of California and all over the United States. ... I am not remiss to say that from Washington, D.C., to Sacramento there's a blood trail leading to the bedroom of Marilyn Pharis.\" \u2014 Domenico Montanaro] A 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens in our prisons and jails together had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names. 25,000. On top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year, and this is what we get. For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next 10 years, we could provide one million at-risk students with a school voucher, which so many people are wanting. While there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people, many, many, this doesn't change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower-skilled workers with less education who compete directly against vulnerable American workers and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they can ever possibly pay back. And they're hurting a lot of our people that cannot get jobs under any circumstances. But these facts are never reported. Instead the media, and my opponent, discuss one thing and only one thing: The needs of people living here illegally. In many cases, by the way, they're treated better than our vets. Not going to happen anymore, folks, Nov. 8. Not going to happen anymore. The truth is the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants or however many there may be \u2014 and honestly we've been hearing that number for years. It's always 11 million. Our government has no idea. It could be 3 million, it could be 30 million, they have no idea what the number is. [The count of immigrants in the country illegally is an estimate, but several estimates put it in the same ballpark \u2014 and it's the 11 million ballpark, nowhere near 30 million. The Pew Research Center puts it at 11.3 million (a number that has held relatively steady for years, by its estimate, and is down by nearly 1 million from a recent peak in 2007). As of January 2012, the Department of Homeland Security put the count at 11.4 million. Trump has in fact made the 30 million claim before, and PolitiFact shot him down, labeling it \"pants on fire,\" finding other independent estimates that were in the 11 to 12 million range. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] Frankly, our government has no idea what they're doing on many, many fronts, folks. But whatever the number, that's never really been the central issue. It will never be a central issue. It doesn't matter from that standpoint. Anyone who tells you the core issue is the needs of those living here illegally has simply spent too much time in Washington. Only the out-of-touch media elites think the biggest problem facing American \u2014 you know this, you know this, this is what they talk about \u2014 facing American society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who don't have legal status. And they also think the biggest thing \u2014 and you know this \u2014 is not nuclear, it's not ISIS, it's not Russia, it's not China, it's global warming. To all politicians, donors and special interests, hear these words from me and all of you today. There is only one core issue in the immigration debate, and that issue is the well-being of the American people. Nothing even comes a close second. Hillary Clinton, for instance, talks constantly about her fears that families will be separated. But she's not talking about the American families who have been permanently separated from their loved ones because of a preventable homicide, because of a preventable death, because of murder. No, she's only talking about families who come here in violation of the law. We will treat everyone living or residing in our country with great dignity, so important. We will be fair, just and compassionate to all. But our greatest compassion must be for our American citizens. [Trump has made crime committed by immigrants in the U.S. illegally a major theme of his campaign. While he has spotlighted several real cases of murders committed by people in the country illegally, the context here is important. Multiple analyses have found that immigrants commit violent crime at a lower rate than those born in the United States. \u2014 Sarah McCammon] Thank you, thank you. President Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders, and you know it better than anybody right here in Arizona, you know it. President Obama and Hillary Clinton support sanctuary cities. They support catch and release on the border. They support visa overstays. They support the release of dangerous, dangerous, dangerous criminals from detention. And they support unconstitutional, executive amnesty. Hillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare for illegal immigrants breaking the federal budget. On top of that, she promises uncontrolled, low-skilled immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for American workers and especially for African-American and Hispanic workers within our country, our citizens. Most incredibly, because to me this is unbelievable, we have no idea who these people are, where these people are. I always say Trojan horse \u2014 watch what's going to happen, folks, it's not going to be pretty. This includes her plan to bring in 620,000 new refugees from Syria and that region over a short period of time. And even yesterday when you were watching the news, you saw thousands and thousands of people coming in from Syria. What is wrong with our politicians, our leaders, if we can call them that. What the hell are we doing? Hard to believe, hard to believe. Now that you've heard about Hillary Clinton's plan, about which she has not answered a single question, let me tell you about my plan. [Agree with Clinton's immigration policies or not, it's impossible to argue she \"has not answered a single question\" about them. She recently answered questions about immigration at a conference of black and Hispanic journalists, for example, and she has addressed questions about it in other interviews as well. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] And you notice all the time for weeks and weeks, they're debating my plan, debating it, talking about it, what about this, what about that? They never even mention her plan on immigration because she doesn't want to get into the quagmire, it's a tough one. She doesn't know what she's doing except open borders and let everybody come in and destroy our country, by the way. While Hillary Clinton meets only with donors and lobbyists, my plan was crafted with the input from federal immigration officers, very great people, among the top immigration experts anywhere in this country, who represent workers, not corporations. Very important to us. I also worked with lawmakers who've led on this issue on behalf of American citizens for many years. And, most importantly, I've met with the people directly impacted by these policies. So important. Number one. Are you ready? Are you ready? We will build a great wall along the southern border. And Mexico will pay for the wall. 100 percent. They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for the wall. And they're great people, and great leaders, but they're going to pay for the wall. [The cost estimates for a wall along the border vary widely. Trump has put the cost at $8 billion to $12 billion, but other estimates have run as high as $25 billion, according to PolitiFact. \u2014 Sarah McCammon [After his meeting with Donald Trump today, Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto reiterated his insistence that Mexico would not pay for construction of a border wall. Pe\u00f1a Nieto said he made that clear to Trump during their meeting, although Trump told reporters that the issue of payment was not discussed. \u2014 Scott Horsley] On day one, we will begin working on an impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful southern border wall. We will use the best technology, including above- and below-ground sensors, that's the tunnels. Remember that, above and below. Above and below ground sensors. Towers, aerial surveillance and manpower to supplement the wall, find and dislocate tunnels, and keep out criminal cartels, and Mexico, you know that, will work with us. Mexico will work with us, I absolutely believe it. And especially after meeting with their wonderful, wonderful president today, I really believe they want to solve this problem along with us, and I'm sure they will. [Trump told reporters after meeting with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto in Mexico City that they had discussed the wall but not who would pay for it. Pe\u00f1a Nieto says he made it clear Mexico will not pay, and Mexico's foreign minister says this position is nonnegotiable. \u2014 Sarah McCammon] Number two, we are going to end catch and release. Under my administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country and back to the country from which they came. And they'll be brought great distances; we're not dropping them right across. They learned that, President Eisenhower, they dropped them across, right across, and they'd come back. Then when they flew them to a long distance, all of a sudden that was the end. We will take them great distances, but we will take them to the country where they came from. OK? [Trump cited President Eisenhower, referencing his \"Operation Wetback,\" the program undertaken by Eisenhower to deport immigrants in the U.S. illegally. FactCheck.org notes that he deported some 2.1 million, a figure that is \"criticized as inflated by guesswork.\" More have been deported during President Obama's time in office. No one has deported as many as 11 million who are currently within the U.S. \u2014 Domenico Montanaro] Number three, number three. This is the one I think this it's so great, it's hard to believe people don't even talk about it. Zero tolerance for criminal aliens. Zero. Zero. Zero. They don't come in here, they don't come in here. According to federal data, there are at least 2 million, 2 million, think of it, criminal aliens now inside of our country. Two million people, criminal aliens. We will begin moving them out, day one, as soon as I take office, day one, in joint operation with local, state and federal law enforcement. Now, just so you understand, the police, who we all respect. Say hello to the police. Boy, they don't get the credit they deserve, I can tell you. They're great people. But the police and law enforcement, they know who these people are. They live with these people. They get mocked by these people. They can't do anything about these people, and they want to. They know who these people are. Day one, my first hour in office, those people are gone. And you can call it deported if you want \u2014 the press doesn't like that term. You can call it whatever the hell you want, they're gone. Beyond the 2 million, and there are vast numbers of additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled. But their days have run out in this country. The crime will stop. They're going to be gone. It will be over. They're going out, they're going out fast. Moving forward, we will issue detainers for all illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings if we even have to do that. We will terminate the Obama administration's deadly non-enforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets, walk around, do whatever they want to do. Crime all over the place. That's over, that's over folks. That's over. Since 2013 alone, the Obama administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into United States communities \u2014 these are individuals encountered or identified by ICE but who are not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldn't have been politically correct. My plan also includes cooperating closely with local jurisdictions to remove criminal aliens immediately. We will restore the highly successful Secure Communities program, good program. We will expand and revitalize the popular 287(g) partnerships, which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails that we don't even know about. Both of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this administration. And those were programs that worked. This is yet one more area where we are headed in a totally opposite direction. There's no common sense, there's no brain power in our administration by our leader or our leaders. None, none, none. On my first day in office, I am also going to ask Congress to pass \"Kate's Law\" \u2014 named for Kate Steinle \u2014 to ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal re-entry receive strong mandatory minimum sentences. Strong, and then we get 'em out. Another reform I am proposing is the passage of legislation named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, two law enforcement officers recently killed by a previously deported illegal immigrant. The Davis-Oliver bill will enhance cooperation with state and local authorities to ensure that criminal immigrants and terrorists are swiftly, really swiftly, identified and removed. And they're going to go fast, believe me, they're going to go fast. We are going to triple the number of ICE deportation officers. Within ICE, I am going to create a new special Deportation Task Force, focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice. Just like Hillary Clinton has evaded justice, OK? Maybe they'll be able to deport her. The local police know who every one of these criminals and they know each and every one, by name, by crime, they will work so fast, and our local police will be so happy that they don't have to be abused by these thugs anymore. There's no great mystery to it; they've put up with it for years. And now, finally, we will turn the tables, and law enforcement and our police will be allowed to clear up this dangerous and threatening mess. We're also going to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents, who gave me their endorsement, 16,500 gave me their endorsement, and put more of them on the border, instead of behind desks, which is good. We will expand the number of Border Patrol stations significantly. [Trump makes no mention of the potential cost of hiring 5,000 more Border Patrol agents. According to Politico and USA Today, there are currently about 21,000 Border Patrol agents. Trump proposes an increase of about 25 percent. [Nowhere in Trump's speech does he acknowledge that apprehensions of Mexicans attempting to cross the Southern border are decreasing, according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Report for 2015. \u2014 Richard Gonzales] I've had a chance to spend time with these incredible law enforcement officers, and I want to take a moment to thank them. What they do is incredible. And getting their endorsement means so much to me, more to me really than I can really say. It means so much \u2014 first time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate. [Trump noted that the Border Patrol endorsed him. It's true that the National Border Patrol Council, the union of U.S. Border Patrol agents, endorsed him during the primary, calling Trump \"the only candidate who actually threatens the established powers that have betrayed this country.\" But it hasn't been without controversy. The Los Angeles Times noted that \"the rank-and-file seem as polarized about Trump as the rest of the nation, with some going so far as to challenge their union leaders' decision.\" \u2014 Domenico Montanaro] Number four: Block funding for sanctuary cities. We block the funding, no more funding. We will end the sanctuary cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths. Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities. Number five: Cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce all immigration laws. We will immediately terminate President Obama's two illegal executive amnesties, in which he defied federal law and the Constitution to give amnesty to approximately 5 million illegal immigrants. 5 million. And how about all of the millions who are waiting on line going through the process legally? So unfair. [In 2012, President Obama granted a temporary reprieve from deportation to certain immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children. Upwards of 600,000 young people took advantage of that offer, which also made them eligible for work permits. In 2014, Obama tried to expand his deportation reprieve to millions of additional immigrants, most of whom had children who are U.S. citizens or were Green Card holders. Texas and other states challenged that action, and a federal judge in Texas put the president's executive order on hold. That stay remains in place, after a shorthanded Supreme Court deadlocked 4-4 earlier this year. \u2014 Scott Horsley] Hillary Clinton has pledged to keep both of these illegal amnesty programs \u2014 including the 2014 amnesty, which has been blocked by the United States Supreme Court. Great. Clinton has also pledged to add a third executive amnesty. And by the way, folks, she will be a disaster for our country. A disaster. In so many other ways. And don't forget the Supreme Court of the United States, don't forget that. When you go to vote Nov. 8. And don't forget your Second Amendment and don't forget the repeal and replacement of Obamacare. And don't forget building up our depleted military. And don't forget taking care of our vets. Don't forget our vets, they've been forgotten. Clinton's plan would trigger a constitutional crisis unlike almost anything we have ever seen before. In effect, she would be abolishing the lawmaking powers of Congress in order to write her own laws from the Oval Office. And you see what bad judgment she has. She has seriously bad judgment. In a Trump administration, all immigration laws will be enforced. Will be enforced. As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities. But, unlike this administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement \u2014 and ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs the way their jobs are supposed to be done. Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation \u2014 that is what it means to have laws and to have a country. Otherwise we don't have a country. Our enforcement priorities will include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays, public charges \u2014 that is, those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net, along with millions of recent illegal arrivals and overstays who've come here under the current administration. [By prioritizing removal of immigrants who commit crimes, threaten security and who have arrived recently, Trump is essentially mirroring the enforcement priorities of the Obama administration. \u2014 Scott Horsley] Number six, we are going to suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur. [Trump's position on which potential immigrants to keep out of the country because of terrorism fears has shifted multiple times throughout his campaign. Late last year, following a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., Trump began with a call to ban all Muslims from entering the United States. In June, after a gunman who had pledged loyalty to ISIS shot and killed 50 people, including himself, at an Orlando nightclub, Trump called for banning refugees from countries with a \"terrorist presence,\" even though the shooter was born in the United States. In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, Trump repeated a similar position and also talked about countries where thorough vetting is difficult. He's also recently called for what he describes as \"extreme vetting\" based on ideology. \u2014 Sarah McCammon] According to data provided to the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, between 9/11 and the end of 2014, at least 380 foreign-born individuals were convicted in terror cases inside the United States. And even right now, the largest number of people are under investigation for exactly this, that we've ever had in the history of our country. Our country is a mess. We don't even know what to look for anymore, folks. Our country has to straighten out, and we have to straighten out fast. The number is likely higher, but the administration refuses to provide this information to Congress. As soon as I enter office, I am going to ask the Department of State, which has been brutalized by Hillary Clinton, brutalized, Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to begin a comprehensive review of these cases in order to develop a list of regions and countries from which immigration must be suspended until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put into place. I call it extreme vetting, right? I want extreme, it's going to be so tough, and if somebody comes in, that's fine, but they're going to be good. It's extreme. And if people don't like it, we gotta have a country, folks. Gotta have a country. [It's true that Obama administration officials have expressed concerns about how to screen refugees from war-torn regions with little documentation. But the White House also says refugees undergo the most rigorous vetting process of any category of immigrants entering the United States. \u2014 Sarah McCammon] Countries from which immigration will be suspended would include places like Syria and Libya. And we are going to stop the tens of thousands of people coming in from Syria. We have no idea who they are, where they come from, there's no documentation, there's no paperwork. It's going to end badly, folks, it's going to end very, very badly. [Trump claimed there's no \"paperwork.\" But that's not true. Lots is known about them, and they already undergo rigorous screening. NPR's Brian Naylor has reported that refugees are currently screened by several different agencies, and \"fingerprints are taken, biographical information is collected. They are then each individually interviewed by U.S. officials trained to verify that they are bona fide refugees. Refugees from Syria are then subject to additional screening that looks at where they came from and what caused them to flee their home.\" And all that takes an average of a year and a half to two years. \u2014 Domenico Montanaro] For the price of resettling one refugee in the United States, 12 could be resettled in a safe zone in their home region, which I agree with 100 percent. We have to build safe zones, and we'll get the money from the gulf states. We don't want to put up the money; we owe almost $20 trillion. Double since Obama took office. Our national debt. But we will get the money from gulf states and others. We'll supervise it, we'll build safe zones, which is something I think all of us want to see. Another reform involves new screening tests for all applicants that include \u2014 and this is so important, especially if you get the right people, and we will get the right people \u2014 an ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people. Thank you, we're very proud of our country aren't we? With all it's going through, we're very proud of our country. For instance, in the last five years, we've admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan \u2014 in these two countries, according to Pew research, a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified, that's what they say. That's what they say, they're justified. And we're admitting them through our country. Applicants will be asked for their views about honor killings, about respect for women and gays and minorities, attitudes on radical Islam, which our president refuses to say, and many other topics as part of the vetting procedure. And if we have the right people doing it, believe me, very few people will slip through the cracks. Hopefully none. Number seven: We will ensure that other countries take their people back when we order them deported. There are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they have been ordered to leave the United States, including large numbers of violent criminals. They won't take 'em back. So we say, OK, we'll keep 'em. [According to a recent New York Times article, 23 countries \"are considered largely uncooperative in taking back their citizens.\"  The U.S. has released 8,000 immigrants with criminal convictions (both with legal status and those who are in the country illegally) since 2013. The issue, the Times explained, is that some countries won't take these people back, but the Supreme Court has also ruled that the U.S. can't detain these people indefinitely. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] Not going to happen with me, folks, not going to happen. Due to a Supreme Court decision, if these violent offenders cannot be sent home, our law enforcement officers have to release them into your communities. And by the way, the results are horrific, horrific. There are often terrible consequences, such as Casey Chadwick's tragic death in Connecticut just last year. Yet, despite the existence of a law that commands the secretary of state to stop issuing visas to these countries, Secretary Hillary Clinton ignored this law and refused to use this powerful tool to bring nations into compliance. And they would comply if we would act properly. In other words, if we had leaders who knew what they were doing, which we don't. The result of her misconduct was the release of thousands and thousands of dangerous criminal aliens who should have been sent home to their countries. Instead, we have 'em all over the place. Probably a couple in this room, as a matter of fact. But I hope not. According to a report from the Boston Globe, from the year 2008 through 2014, nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not under any circumstances take them back. Hard to believe with the power that we have. We're like the big bully that keeps getting beat up, that keep getting beat up. These 13,000 releases occurred on Hillary Clinton's watch \u2014 she had the power and the duty to stop it cold, and she decided she would not do it. And Arizona knows better than most exactly what I'm talking about. [Trump appears to be referring to this Boston Globe article in which ICE told the Globe that 12,941 were released from 2008 to 2014. The numbers were actually higher, over 86,000, the Globe notes, between 2013 and 2015 alone. The 12,941 figure was a number that the Supreme Court forced ICE to release, according to the Globe. Not all were violent criminals, and some 140 countries would not cooperate with deportations. It's not clear, however, what specifically Donald Trump is suggesting Hillary Clinton could have done about that. \u2014 Domenico Montanaro] Those released include individuals convicted of killings, sexual assault and some of the most heinous crimes imaginable. The Boston Globe writes that a Globe review of 323 criminals released in New England from 2008 to 2012 found that as many as 30 percent committed new offenses, including rape, attempted murder and child molestation. We take 'em, we take 'em. Number eight, we will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system, which we need desperately. For years, Congress has required biometric entry-exit visa tracking systems, but it has never been completed. The politicians are all talk, no action. Never happens, never happens. Hillary Clinton, all talk \u2014 unfortunately, when there is action, it's always the wrong decision, do you ever notice? In my administration, we will ensure that this system is in place \u2014 and I will tell you, it will be on land, it will be on sea, it will be in air. We will have a proper tracking system. Approximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never, ever left. Why should they? Nobody's telling them to leave. Stay as long as you want, we'll take care of you. Beyond violating our laws, visa overstays \u2014 and they really are a big problem \u2014 pose a substantial threat to national security. The 9/11 Commission said that this tracking system should be a high priority and \"would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in August and September 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 hijackers that were in the U.S. on expired visas.\" And you know what that would have meant, what that could have meant. Wouldn't that have been wonderful? What that would have meant. Last year alone, nearly a half a million individuals overstayed their temporary visas. Removing visa overstays will be a top priority of my administration. [A substantial number of people in the U.S. illegally entered the country legally, but have overstayed visas. Last year, when Marco Rubio said 40 percent of people in the nation illegally have overstayed visas, PolitiFact rated it \"mostly true.\" Fresh estimates of the figure aren't available, the site wrote, but the 40 percent figure seemed to be a fairly good estimate. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] If people around the world believe they can just come on a temporary visa and never ever leave \u2014 the Obama-Clinton policy, that's what it is \u2014 then we have a completely open border and we no longer have a country. We must send the message that visa expiration dates will be strongly enforced. Number nine, we will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet. We will ensure that E-Verify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law, and will work with Congress to strengthen and expand its use across the country. [E-Verify is an online system that allows employers to check whether job applicants are authorized to work in this country. It's used by less than 10 percent of employers today, but expanding the system was an important component of the bipartisan immigration bill passed by the Senate in 2013. (It died in the House.) E-Verify faces lingering challenges, including \"false negatives\" when people who should be allowed to work are shown to be ineligible, and privacy concerns. \u2014 Scott Horsley] Immigration law doesn't exist just for the purpose of keeping out criminals. It exists to protect all aspects of American life \u2014 the worksite, the welfare office, the education system and everything else. That is why immigration limits are established in the first place. If we only enforce the laws against crime, then we have an open border to the entire world. We will enforce all of our immigration laws. The same goes for government benefits. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that 62 percent of households headed by illegal immigrants used some form of cash or non-cash welfare programs, like food stamps or housing assistance. Tremendous costs, by the way, to our country. Tremendous costs. This directly violates the federal public charge law designed to protect the U.S. Treasury. Those who abuse our welfare system will be priorities for immediate removal. Number 10, we will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers. The forgotten people, workers. We're going to take care of our workers. And by the way, we're going to make great trade deals. We're going to negotiate trade deals, we're going to be bring our jobs back home, we're going to bring our jobs back home. We have the most incompetently worked trade deals ever negotiated probably in the history of the world, and that starts with NAFTA. And now they want to go TPP, one of the great disasters. And if countries want to leave Arizona, and if they want to leave other states, there's going to be a lot of trouble for them, it's not going to be so easy. There will be consequence, remember that. There will be consequence. They're not going to be leaving, go to another country, make the product, sell it to the United States, and all we end up with is no taxes and total unemployment. It's not going to happen; there will be consequences. We've admitted 59 million immigrants to the United States between 1965 and 2015. Many of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country, so true. But we now have an obligation to them, and to their children, to control future immigration \u2014 as we have following, if you think, previous immigration waves, we've had some big waves, and tremendously positive things have happened, incredible things have happened \u2014 to ensure assimilation, we want to ensure that it works. Assimilation, an important word, integration and upward mobility. Within just a few years, immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records. The time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goals: We need a system that serves our needs, not the needs of others \u2014 remember, under a Trump administration it's called \"America First.\" We want people to come into our country, but they have to come into our country legally and properly vetted, and in a manner that serves the national interest. We've been living under outdated immigration rules from decades ago. They're decades and decades old. To avoid this happening in the future, I believe we should sunset our visa laws so that Congress is forced to periodically revise and revisit them. They're archaic, they're ancient. We wouldn't put our entire federal budget on autopilot for decades, so why should we do the same for the very, very complex subject of immigration? So let's now talk about the big picture. These 10 steps, if rigorously followed and enforced, will accomplish more in a matter of months than our politicians have accomplished on this issue in the last 50 years. It's what's going to happen, folks. Because I am proudly not a politician, because I am not beholden to any special interest, I've spent a lot of money on my campaign, I'll tell you, I write those checks. Nobody owns Trump. I will get this done for you and your family. You'll be proud of our country again. We'll do it right. We will accomplish all of the steps outlined above, and when we do, peace and law and justice and prosperity will prevail. Crime will go down, border crossings will plummet, gangs will disappear, and the gangs are all over the place, and welfare use will decrease. [Trump said \"welfare use will decrease\" when he's president. But it is a myth that immigrants in the U.S. illegally qualify for those subsidies. As CNN noted in 2014: \"Undocumented immigrants do not qualify for welfare, food stamps, Medicaid, and most other public benefits. Most of these programs require proof of legal immigration status and under the 1996 welfare law, even legal immigrants cannot receive these benefits until they have been in the United States for more than five years.\" Still, some households of immigrants in the U.S. illegally do receive some form of subsidies because of children born in the U.S. who qualify. A right-leaning immigration think tank did an analysis showing immigrant households receive more on average than nonimmigrant households that also receive benefits. But that study has been criticized as \"fatally flawed.\" \u2014 Domenico Montanaro] We will have a peace dividend to spend on rebuilding America, beginning with our American inner cities. We're going to rebuild them for once and for all. For those here illegally today who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and only one route: to return home and apply for re-entry like everybody else under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined above. Those who have left to seek entry under this new system, and it will be an efficient system, will not be awarded surplus visas, but will have to enter under the immigration caps or limits that will be established in the future. [Here Trump endorses the notion that people will be forced, or will choose to return home, and then \"get in line\" to come here legally. According to the State Department, there are currently 1.3 million Mexicans who are waiting in line for a visa. Only a small fraction have any realistic hope of seeing a visa anytime soon. Trump is talking about establishing new visa caps or limits under rules that haven't been determined. \u2014 Richard Gonzales] We will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration. There will be no amnesty. Our message to the world will be this: you cannot obtain legal status, or become a citizen of the United States, by illegally entering our country. This declaration alone will help stop the crisis of illegal crossings and illegal overstays, very importantly. People will know that you can't just smuggle in, hunker down, and wait to be legalized. It's not going to work that way. Those days are over. Importantly, in several years, when we have accomplished all of our enforcement goals \u2013 and truly ended illegal immigration for good, including the construction of a great wall, which we will have built in record time and at a reasonable cost, which you never hear from the government and the establishment of our new lawful immigration system \u2014 then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those who remain. That discussion can only take place in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past, no longer with us, allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time. [This was the big question mark coming into tonight's speech. Trump has sent mixed signals in recent days over how he would handle the millions of immigrants who are living in the country illegally but whose only crime was crossing the border without authorization. Trump made it clear tonight that there will be no path to legalization for these immigrants, short of returning to their home country and reapplying. But he left open the question of whether broader deportations would be necessary. \u2014 Scott Horsley] Right now, however, we are in the middle of a jobs crisis, a border crisis, and a terrorism crisis like never before. [It's hard to characterize the current job market as being in \"crisis,\" especially considering where it has been. Unemployment is at 4.9 percent, down from a post-recession high of 10 percent. There are still some signs of problems left over from the recession \u2014 the length of unemployment still hasn't quite recovered to prerecession levels, for example. However, the economy is looking solid enough that chatter is building about the Fed raising interest rates soon \u2014 Federal Reserve Vice Chair Stanley Fischer recently said that the U.S. is \"very close to full employment.\" \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] All energies of the federal government and the legislative process must now be focused on immigration security. That is the only conversation we should be having at this time. Immigration security, cut it off. Whether it's dangerous materials being smuggled across the border, terrorists entering on visas, or Americans losing their jobs to foreign workers, these are the problems we must now focus on fixing \u2014 and the media needs to begin demanding to hear Hillary Clinton's answer on how her policies will affect Americans and their security. These are matters of life-and-death for our country and its people, and we deserve answers from Hillary Clinton. And you notice? She doesn't answer. She didn't go to Louisiana, she didn't go to Mexico, she was invited, she doesn't have the strength or the stamina to make America great again, believe me. What we do know, despite the lack of media curiosity, is that Hillary Clinton promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement. Just ask the Border Patrol about Hillary Clinton. You won't like what you're hearing. The result will be millions more illegal immigrants, thousands more violent horrible crimes, and total chaos and lawlessness. That's what's going to happen, as sure as you're standing there. This election is our last chance \u2014 and I believe this \u2014 to secure the border, stop illegal immigration, and reform our laws to make your life better. I really believe this is it. This is our last time. Nov. 8, Nov. 8. You gotta get out and vote Nov. 8. It's our last chance, it's our last chance. And that includes Supreme Court justices and Second Amendment, remember that. So I want to remind everyone what we are fighting for \u2014 and who we are fighting for. So I am going to ask \u2014 these are really special people that I've gotten to know \u2014 all the Angel Moms to come join me on the stage right now. These are amazing women. [The family of Kate Steinle did not appear onstage with Trump. It has a federal lawsuit pending against the former sheriff of San Francisco and two federal agencies, blaming them for Kate Steinle's death. \u2014 Richard Gonzales] I've become friends with so many: {PAUSE FOR ANGEL MOMS \u2014 EACH SAYS THE NAME OF THEIR CHILD OR FAMILY MEMBER AND EXPRESSES SUPPORT FOR TRUMP INTO THE MICROPHONE} That is tough stuff, I will tell you. Incredible people. Now is the time for these voices to be heard. Now is the time for the media to begin asking questions on their behalf. Now is the time for all of us, as one country, Democrat and Republican, liberal and conservative, to band together to deliver justice and safety and security for all Americans. Let's fix this horrible, horrible problem. It can be fixed quickly. Let's secure our border. Let's stop the drugs and the crime. Let's protect our Social Security and Medicare. And let's get unemployed Americans off of welfare and back to work in their own country. This has been an incredible evening. We're going to remember this evening. Nov. 8, we have to get everybody \u2014 this is such an important state, we have to get everybody to go out and vote. We're going to bring, thank you, thank you. We're going to take our country back, folks. This is a movement. We're going to take our country back. Thank you, thank you. This is an incredible movement. The world is talking about it. The world is talking about it. And by the way, if you haven't been looking at what's been happening with the polls in the last 3-4 days, you should start looking. Together, we can save American lives, American jobs, and American futures. Together, we can save America itself. Join me in this mission, we're going to \"Make America Great Again.\" Thank you, I love you, thank you, God bless you, everybody!",

Donald Trump will give a speech Wednesday outlining his immigration stance. Given the last week of news coverage, he could have some serious explaining to do. An immigration policy centered around extreme positions \u2014 mass deportation of 11 million immigrants in the country illegally, plus building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 initially helped Trump stand out in the massive Republican primary field. So it was a surprise when, last week, the Trump campaign seemed to change direction, indicating that he was open to \"softening\" his immigration position, and even at one point that he might be open to a path to legalization for some of those immigrants. Here's a quick rundown of some of the things the campaign has said about immigration in the past week. Aug. 20 \u2014 Members of Donald Trump's Hispanic advisory council said Trump was open to relaxing his immigration stance, Buzzfeed reports. Trump said his solution for how to deal with 11 million people in the country illegally \"must be something that respects border security but deals with this in a humane and efficient manner,\" according to immigration attorney Jacob Monty, who attended the meeting. The Trump campaign later released a statement dismissing the Buzzfeed report, saying that Trump's position had not changed. Aug. 21 \u2014 CNN's Dana Bash asks Trump Campaign Manager Kellyanne Conway about Trump's November promise to create a deportation force. Conway first demurs, then says it's still \"to be determined.\" Meanwhile, members of Trump's Hispanic advisory council do not verify to NBC News that Trump would advocate a legalization plan. Immigration lawyer Monty says he is hoping for specific policies like a guest-worker program and a \"touchback\" system, in which immigrants in the U.S. illegally would go back to their home countries and then come back through the visa process. (Another version of \"touchbacks\" is for immigrants to not go back to a home country but to go to a consulate or embassy of that country to apply.) Aug. 22 \u2014 Trump postpones a planned immigration speech in Colorado. In an email explaining the postponement, the Trump campaign says the speech \"is still being modified,\" according to the Denver Post. Trump tells Fox & Friends that he's not reversing his position. \"No, I'm not flip-flopping,\" he said. \"We want to come up with a really fair, but firm, answer. That's \u2014 it has to be very firm. But we want to come up with something fair.\" Aug. 23 \u2014 In a town hall with Fox's Sean Hannity, Trump says \"there could certainly be a softening\" in his stance on immigration, adding that \"the bad ones\" need to be kicked out of the U.S. Meanwhile, he says there could be some leniency for law-abiding immigrants, intimating he would be open to legalization but not full citizenship. \"No citizenship,\" he said, adding, \"Let me go a step further \u2014 they'll pay back taxes; they have to pay taxes; there's no amnesty, as such, there's no amnesty, but we work with them.\" Conway tells CNN that Trump's \"softening\" response in the Hannity town hall is \"very consonant with what [Trump] said all along.\" She adds that Trump \"wants to find a fair and humane way and effective way to address the fact that roughly 11 million illegal immigrants live among us.\" Wednesday \u2014 When a West Palm Beach, Fla., CBS affiliate asks Trump about his shifting immigration policy, he insists that he still has a tough stance, but is vague on exactly what that stance is. \"Well, I'm going to announce something over the next two weeks,\" he said, \"but it's going to be a very firm policy.\" According to CBS, he later adds, \"We're going to build a wall, it's got to be a very powerful wall. But we want people to come into our country, but we want them to come in legally, but we're going to be very, very strong on immigration.\" Thursday \u2014 Trump tells CNN's Anderson Cooper that he is actually not open to a pathway to legalization. \"There's no path to legalization unless they leave the country,\" he said. \"When they come back in, then they can start paying taxes, but there is no path to legalization unless they leave the country and then come back.\" Campaign spokesperson Katrina Pierson tells CNN that it's only Trump's rhetoric \u2014 not policy \u2014 that has changed. \"He hasn't changed his position on immigration,\" she contended. \"He's changed the words that he is saying.\" Saturday \u2014 In a speech in Des Moines, Iowa, Trump calls immigration a \"civil rights issue\" and emphasizes his plans to remove some \u2014 but not all \u2014 people who are in the country illegally. \"On Day One,\" he said, \"I am going to begin swiftly removing criminal illegal immigrants from this country, including removing the hundreds of thousands of criminal illegal immigrants that have been released into U.S. communities under the Obama-Clinton administration.\" Sunday \u2014 Conway tells CBS' John Dickerson that Trump's position hasn't changed, this time saying that Trump \"is not talking about a deportation force.\" Trump's vice presidential pick Mike Pence tells CNN's Jake Tapper: \"There will be no path to legalization, no path to citizenship, unless people leave the country.\" Trump also tweets that he will give a major immigration speech in Arizona on Wednesday. I will be making a major speech on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION on Wednesday in the GREAT State of Arizona. Big crowds, looking for a larger venue. Monday \u2014 New reports of policy specifics bounce around the media. Though Trump's calls for a wall remained steady throughout this period, NBC's Hallie Jackson reported that Trump may now be calling for a \"virtual wall,\" as MSNBC's Ari Melber tweets: Trump may be shifting towards building more of a \"virtual wall\" on the border, reports @halliejackson CNN's Jim Acosta also tweets that a Trump adviser told him that Trump now wants to \"Secure border first. Then have conversation on what to do with undocumented 'years from now.' \" However, Trump spokesman Jason Miller tells NPR that the \"virtual wall\" report is false \u2014 \"There's going to be a physical wall\" \u2014 and that Acosta's report is also \"erroneous.\" One main message from the campaign: This isn't a change These interviews, speeches and tweets don't at all make it clear what Trump's Wednesday speech will say. For now, at least two uniform messages are clear: (1) that Trump wants to be \"fair\" and \"humane\" in however he eventually deals with the 11 million people in the country illegally, and (2) that his immigration policy has not changed. Should he eventually back away from a deportation force and push a path to legalization, as his campaign at times in the past two weeks has suggested he could do, it would be a seismic shift for a candidate who has made immigration a linchpin of his campaign. Trump has flip-flopped on a number of issues (abortion, H1-B visas, Syrian refugees), but this would be a particularly massive change. The label \"flip-flopper\" is a particularly sharp barb that can inflict irreparable damage on a campaign \u2014 just ask 2004 presidential candidate John Kerry. However, flip-flops aren't uniformly harmful, as NPR's Mara Liasson wrote in 2008. Occasionally, a flip-flop can even be a positive \u2014 if not, ever-calculating politicians wouldn't commit this political sin so often. Liasson pointed to William Safire's New Political Dictionary, which acknowledges the potential upside of a flip-flop: \"Although the term is always pejorative and brings an irate denial, a refusal to flip-flop in the light of changing circumstances can be a sign of rigidity; a willingness to flip-flop is expressed by supporters as evidence of flexibility.\" Should Trump overhaul his immigration policy, it would show he's willing to gamble that that flexibility will draw in some Hispanics (and perhaps moderate Republicans) without scaring off his most loyal supporters. Some Trump voters don't even expect firm policies Many Trump supporters would seem to be fans of at least some rigidity (see: ever-present chants of \"build the wall\"). However, others say they not only want Trump to be flexible on his policies, but believe he already is quite flexible. \"[N]ot everything Trump says is true \u2014 I mean, it's not true like it's in concrete,\" Nevada voter Judy Callahan told NPR's Sarah McCammon recently. \"He said he would stop the border flow, he would build some kind of wall, and he would work on the people that are here. That's all there is; the rest of it's kind of fluff.\" Others said they assume his policy positions are merely starting points for a negotiation. This has been a popular theme among his voters, reported by other outlets, as well. Trump seems to bank on some voters being OK with fuzzy positions; as he told Time, \"My voters don't care, and the public doesn't care\" about specific policy proposals. He may not want to be saddled with the flip-flopper label, but he has indicated that he's happy to shift his positions. And as he told ABC's George Stephanopoulos on his shifting economic policy proposals, \"Sure, it's a change. I'm allowed to change. You need flexibility, George, whether it's a tax plan, where you're going \u2014 where you know you're going to negotiate.\" Trump has many, many flip-flops to his name, but he isn't alone in shifting positions; Hillary Clinton has famously pulled a U-turn on the Asia trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. She moved from supporting it years ago to saying she doesn't support it in its current form. Many perceived that as a reaction to Bernie Sanders' successful populist campaign. Making matters worse for Clinton, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (a longtime Clinton associate) suggested that she might change her position again (though he later clarified that he doesn't expect her position to change). Should that happen, Clinton's supporters likewise might not punish her \u2014 55 percent of Clinton supporters say the deal would be a \"good thing\" for the U.S., according to the Pew Research Center, compared with only 24 percent who say it would be a \"bad thing.\" All of which is to say that Safire's \"changing circumstances\" certainly seem capable of changing even a candidate's most significant policy positions. And given the overhaul of Trump's campaign leadership amid a persistent polling deficit, the Trump campaign has had plenty of \"changing circumstances\" this summer.",

            "article_content": "After signaling that his position on immigration is \"to be determined\" and that it could \"soften,\" Donald Trump did an amazing thing \u2014 what amounts to almost a full about-face on the principal issue that has driven his campaign. Trump indicated in a town hall with Fox News' Sean Hannity, which aired Wednesday night, that he would be in favor of a path to legalization for immigrants in the U.S. illegally. \"No citizenship,\" he said. But he added, \"Let me go a step further \u2014 they'll pay back-taxes; they have to pay taxes; there's no amnesty, as such, there's no amnesty, but we work with them.\" He continued: \"Now, everybody agrees we get the bad ones out. But when I go through and I meet thousands and thousands of people on this subject, and I've had very strong people come up to me, really great, great people come up to me, and they've said, 'Mr. Trump, I love you, but to take a person who's been here for 15 or 20 years and throw them and their family out, it's so tough, Mr. Trump,' I have it all the time! It's a very, very hard thing.\" \"Look, we have to follow the laws of our country,\" Trump said, before conducting a call-and-response with the audience. \"Now, can we be, and I'll ask the audience. You have somebody who's terrific who's been here, right, long time \u2014 long court proceeding, long everything in other words to get them out. Can we go through a process or do you think they have to get out?\" Citing a hypothetical example of an immigrant who came into the country illegally but has been in the country 20 years and has \"done a great job, has a job and everything else,\" Trump asked: \"Do we take him and the family ... and send 'em out? Or when somebody really has shown \u2014 it's called like the merit system, other than they did break the law in the first place, OK? And that's a little unfair to people but we're going to let people come in anyway ... So do we tell these people to get out or do we work with them and let them stay in some form?\" Trump stood by his stance that immigrants in the country illegally who have committed crimes should be \"out on Day 1.\" \"That one is so simple,\" he said. \"There are some things where you sort of feel bad, this one, we have these killers in this country.\" Trump said earlier this year that his support was so strong, he could go out on Fifth Avenue and shoot someone, and he wouldn't lose his base. Well, that's about to be tested, because if there's one issue that has animated the Republican rank and file over the past decade, it's immigration. Trump courted hard-liners on immigration in the primary campaign. In his announcement speech, he infuriated Latinos with his comments that Mexican immigrants entering the U.S. illegally were \"rapists\" bringing in \"drugs\" and and that \"some,\" he assumed, \"were good people.\" His original immigration policy was written with the help of Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, an immigration hard-liner. Overall, Trump's supporters are split on how they view immigrants in the country illegally \u2014 according to a new survey from Pew Research Center, only 50 percent of Trump supporters agree that \"undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S. are more likely than U.S. citizens to commit serious crimes.\" However, most Republicans (79 percent) favor building a wall along the entire border with Mexico, the survey found \u2014 a policy Trump stood by on Wednesday night, and one that has been echoed at nearly every Trump rally. That may help satisfy some supporters who take a hard line on immigration, like Krista Kosier, 51, who told the Washington Post that the wall is \"the most important thing\" to her. \"He's still going to build the wall. He's still going to get rid of the murderers and rapists and those wreaking havoc in our country,\" she said. The reversal on deportations, though, comes after Trump called for a \"deportation force\" during the GOP primary, and went after fellow Republican candidates like Jeb Bush for their positions. \"The great majority of people that come to this country come because they have no other choice, they want to come to provide [for] their families. ... but the motivation \u2014 they're not all rapists, as you know who said ... these are people who are coming to provide for their families and we should show a little more respect for the fact that they're struggling,\" Bush said in a January debate. \"The weakest person on this stage by far on illegal immigration, is Jeb Bush,\" Trump hit back. \"They come out of an act of love. Whether you like it or not, he is so weak on illegal immigration, it's laughable and everybody knows it.\" And last year, Trump told NBC's Chuck Todd on Meet the Press that while he'd be open to keeping families together, \"they have to go.\" He was pressed on what would happen in cases where immigrants didn't have anywhere to return, and Trump responded: \"We will work with them. They have to go. Chuck, we either have a country, or we don't have a country.\" Trump's new position on legalization is essentially the House Republican position on the 2013 immigration bill. Legalization was the biggest flashpoint between Democrats and Republicans. A bill that included citizenship \u2014 but only after a wait for immigrants of more than a decade and needing to pay fines \u2014 passed with 68 votes in the Senate that year. Democrats argued that a bill that didn't include citizenship amounted to millions of people being ushered into a second class. By not being citizens, they wouldn't have the right to vote, for example. Arguably, no other issue has animated the GOP base more than immigration over the past decade since former Republican President George W. Bush, a former border governor, pushed for a similar bill in 2007. Arizona Sen. John McCain was a principal advocate of that bill \u2014 and nearly saw his presidential campaign derailed because of it. He had to go on what amounted to an apology tour because of his support of the legislation. McCain would repeatedly tell New Hampshire voters that he'd gotten the message. McCain eventually won the nomination, but lost to Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election. After Mitt Romney called for \"self-deportation,\" which sounded tame in comparison to the way Trump has talked about Latinos, Romney won only 27 percent of the Latino vote in 2012. The Republican Party recognized the problem and after the election, a Republican National Committee report recommended moderating on immigration \u2014 seen as a threshold issue for many Latinos.",

Is Donald Trump considering wavering on a key campaign promise? That's what several news reports published over the weekend suggest. And while the Trump campaign issued a statement denying any shift on immigration policy, top surrogates and campaign operatives hinted that a change just might be on its way. You're going to have a deportation force, and you're going to do it humanely. Donald Trump on MSNBC in November 2015 The issue: what to do with the estimated 11 million immigrants already living in the United States illegally. Since he entered the presidential race last year, Trump insisted they would have to be expelled from the country, despite the logistical and humanitarian questions a mass deportation would present. \"You're going to have a deportation force, and you're going to do it humanely,\" he told MSNBC in November 2015. But this weekend, Buzzfeed reported that during a meeting with a Hispanic advisory council, Trump hinted he wasn't totally attached to that proposal. People who attended the meeting told the website that Trump asked for suggestions on a \"humane and efficient\" way to address people already living in the country illegally. Other news outlets confirmed the conversations. Univision went one step further, reporting that Trump will roll out a new immigration plan Thursday in Colorado \"that will include finding a way to legalize millions of undocumented immigrants.\" That's something the campaign immediately pushed back on. \"Mr. Trump said nothing today that he hasn't said many times before, including in his convention speech,\" said Trump campaign staffer Steven Cheung in a statement provided to NPR. And yet, when asked on CNN the next day whether Trump's immigration policies would include that promised \"deportation force,\" Trump's new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, responded, \"To be determined.\" On CBS News' Face the Nation, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions said Trump is \"wrestling with how to do that,\" referring to removing people in the country illegally. \"He did not make a firm commitment yesterday or at the meeting the other day about what he will do with that,\" Sessions said. \"But he did listen, and he's talking about it.\" A major shift on immigration policy would be the clearest signal yet that, faced with widening deficits in most national and state-level polls, the Trump campaign is now making a concerted effort to appeal to moderate and independent voters. But a shift would carry major political risks, too. Immigration is a key issue \u2014 if not the key issue \u2014 for many of Trump's fiercest supporters. And it's been a hallmark of Trump's campaign since day one, when he warned that people entering the country from Mexico were \"bringing drugs; they're bringing crime; they're rapists.\" Trump has also framed himself as a no-apologies \"truth\" teller, who will push for what he thinks is best regardless of the political consequences. Walking back from a high-profile promise could undermine that image. Trump's campaign never provided details about what that deportation force would look like or how it would track down and expel people in the country illegally. But Trump stuck to the promise. \"We have no choice if we're going to run our country properly and if we're going to be a country,\" he said in a December debate. Ohio Gov. John Kasich questioned Trump's proposal during that forum, saying, \"Come on, folks. We all know you can't pick them up and ship them across \u2014 back across the border. It's a silly argument. It's not an adult argument. It makes no sense.\" Trump responded by citing a controversial Eisenhower administration initiative called \"Operation Wetback,\" which deported up to 1.5 million immigrants who were living in the United States illegally. Trump's response to terrorism has centered on immigration as well. After the mass shootings at Orlando's Pulse nightclub in June, Trump reiterated his call for a temporary ban on all Muslims immigrating to the United States. That's despite the fact that the shooter was born in New York City. \"The only reason the killer was in America in the first place is because we allowed his family to come here,\" Trump said in his first speech after the attacks. \"That is a fact \u2014 and a fact we need to talk about.\" At nearly every campaign rally, supporters chant \"Build that wall! Build that wall!\" referencing Trump's promise to erect a wall along the entirety of the United States-Mexico border. \"We will build a wall, don't you worry,\" Trump assured the crowd Friday evening at a Michigan rally.",

She believes the border is too wide open, evidenced by this unguarded metal walkway across the river in far West Texas. Polls show that the idea of building a wall across the southern border remains unpopular with the general public and especially in the U.S. borderlands. But not everyone living near the international divide opposes a barrier between the U.S. and Mexico. Donald Trump has a small, zealous following along the southern frontier. Hudspeth County, in far West Texas, has desert, mountains, cactus, coyotes and 250 Republicans. The GOP county chair is Maria Guadalupe Dempsey. She looks as sweet as a school crossing guard, but for 20 years she worked as a criminal investigator with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She says lots of folks in lower Hudspeth, where she lives, are concerned about border security. \"Border Patrol does a good job of patrolling this area, but it is kind of difficult to patrol it all the time,\" She says. \"So I would see a wall maybe as a deterrent.\" As proof of a porous border, she describes a footbridge across the Rio Grande, built years ago, that is completely unguarded. After a bumpy 20 minute drive from Interstate 10 down to the riverside, seeing is believing. Sure enough, it's a narrow metal walkway across the river that anyone could walk across from the Valle de Juarez, in Mexico, which is home to farmers and violent drug smugglers. \"[It's] the same that you would do in your house,\" Dempsey says, holding a Glock 9mm handgun for protection. \"You build a fence, you put a gate up and you open and close it as you wish. You invite people in. You don't want people who are not invited to come into the country.\" After the interview, we go to a cafe for iced tea and we meet a couple of Border Patrol agents Dempsey knows. One of them smiles and says, \"We knew y'all were down there.\" Drive six hours downriver and you come to the quiet border town of Del Rio \u2014 home to an air force base and Lake Amistad, with its big bass. Jon Anfinsen is a Border Patrol agent and local president of the National Border Patrol Council, which has publicly endorsed Trump. When asked about Trump's wall, he smiles tightly. \"Well, I don't know if Trump is holding to [a wall from the West] coast to the Gulf [of Mexico] anymore. I know the union has expressed it to him that there are places where it absolutely is necessary,\" he says. \"But there are other places where it's just not feasible. A lot of the area it's hilly or the terrain just would not support it. We have a lot of private land.\" Anfinsen is asked, in general, what he thinks about Trump's candidacy. \"I know he's kind of polarizing,\" he says. \"But what I do appreciate is now we have people talking about immigration like never before, and border security like never before.\" We're driving under a canopy of shade trees past small, hand-built houses that face the river and the rugged bluffs on the other side. Anfinsen pulls over and parks in front of a closed gate. A man hauls himself out of a wheelchair. He's drinking a beer and a small, excitable dog is racing around his feet. Andres Montemayor, retired policeman, says he supports Trump's border wall because he's tired of Mexicans burglarizing his house, which faces the Rio Grande.\n                \n                    \n                    John Burnett/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Andres Montemayor, retired policeman, says he supports Trump's border wall because he's tired of Mexicans burglarizing his house, which faces the Rio Grande. Andres Montemayor, a 66-year-old retired police officer, says he's all for Trump's wall: \"I think we need protection on the border. You know why? Because our law enforcement are too undermanned.\" Montemayor is understandably upset. A week before this interview, he says thieves waded across the river and stole his Skillsaw, a chainsaw and a grinder. He says build the wall, despite his lovely view of the unusually clear, sparkling waters of the Rio Grande that flow past his home. \"We keep getting hit [by thieves],\" he says, adding darkly that if it keeps happening, \"I'm gonna shoot to kill.\" As I'm walking away from his gate, the ex-cop has a parting message: \"If you can get hold of Donald Trump tell him we need him here.\" Another three hours down the border highway brings you to the international trade hub of Laredo. Elva Leyendecker lives in the old downtown neighborhood that backs up to the Rio Grande. She stands outside of her historic house built of river rocks before Texas won its independence. \"Mexico is my backyard, seriously,\" she says, glancing at a giant Corona beer sign in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. Leyendecker is a devout Christian, a Republican and she's Mexican-American. She plans to vote for Trump not because Laredo needs a border fence \u2014 it already has one \u2014 but for other reasons.

I understand that. But they're making more money than those of us who are working because they have five children. People have to realize that this is a problem here.\" The state of Texas did a study a decade ago on the impact of undocumented immigrants and concluded they generate more taxes and other revenue than the state spends on them. Last month, Cronkite School of Journalism at Arizona State University, Univision and the Dallas Morning News released a survey of U.S. border residents \u2014 7 in 10 respondents said they do not want Trump's wall. The borderlands are Hillary Clinton territory. It doesn't help that Trump insulted Mexico and a Latino federal judge and that he eats taco bowls. But as with the rest of the country, no matter what he says and does week after week, some people just love Donald Trump.",

The state holds its Republican primary next Tuesday, Aug. 9. Ryan has endorsed Trump, though it's hardly a cozy relationship \u2014 Ryan took a while to endorse, and during his Republican convention speech he barely mentioned the candidate.

Ryan said he \"rejects\" any religious test for entering the country \u2014 a clear jab at one of Trump's evolving immigration proposals \u2014 and that \"Captain Khan was one such brave example\" of Muslim-Americans who have \"served valiantly in our military and made the ultimate sacrifice.\" A religious test for entering our country is not reflective of America's fundamental values. I reject it. pic.twitter.com/DdsYj2XoLS Members of Congress were mostly silent or critical of Trump's response to Khan. Sen. John McCain said, \"I hope Americans understand that the remarks do not represent the views of our Republican Party, its officers, or candidates.\" But Nehlen, who has referred to Ryan as \"Lyin' Ryan\" (reminiscent of Trump's own attacks of his presidential primary opponents), defended Trump's response to Khan, saying it was Khan who had \"attacked, ridiculed and attempted to humiliate Mr. Trump and his positions on critical national security issues.\" In a statement, Nehlen wrote a point-by-point defense of Trump's response to the Khans and stance on terrorism. Establishment's concerted effort 2 protect @SpeakerRyan will backfire. Grassroots r ready to #DumpRyan & #HireNehlen https://t.co/2e8KqsA9KU Paul Ryan AGAIN Misrepresents Trump Position, This Time on \u201cReligious Test\u201d Brouhaha. https://t.co/i5rkVHDExG pic.twitter.com/3F9Tl6FWn1 \"Just because Capt. Khan was a patriotic Muslim-American who loved and fought for his adopted country, that doesn't mean other Muslim-Americans don't hate the United States and wish our people deadly harm,\" Nehlen wrote. In a tweet, Trump thanked Nehlen for his post: Thanks to @pnehlen for your kind words, very much appreciated. Nehlen has also attracted national attention beyond Trump. Conservative pundit Ann Coulter will join Nehlen at two rallies this Saturday in Janesville and Kenosha. And former vice presidential nominee and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has endorsed Nehlen, saying Ryan's \"political career is over but for a miracle because he has so disrespected the will of the people.\" Nehlen is tapping into that populist sentiment with his #DumpRyan campaign \u2014 hitting Ryan over immigration and for not proposing to build a border wall like Trump has. One TV ad features parents whose children were apparently killed by undocumented immigrants: \"Don't let one more American child die because Paul Ryan won't secure the border. Your vote on August 9th can save a life,\" Nehlen said at a recent campaign rally. On Tuesday, Trump told the Washington Post he's not yet ready to endorse Paul Ryan in the Wisconsin primary. \"I like Paul, but these are horrible times for our country,\" Trump said. \"We need very strong leadership. We need very, very strong leadership. And I'm just not quite there yet. I'm not quite there yet.\" Former Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders has also waded into a House race by supporting Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz's primary opponent Tim Canova. Sanders had repeatedly called for Wasserman Schultz to resign as chair over her handling of the election. She did so after the convention, and after an email leak showed DNC staffers trying to undercut the Sanders campaign. \"The political revolution is not just about electing a president, sisters and brothers. We need a Congress with members who believe, like Bernie, that we cannot change a corrupt system by taking its money,\" an email from the Sanders campaign in support of Canova read.",

            "article_content": "The GOP carried Arizona in nine of the last 10 presidential elections, but Hispanics in Maricopa County could swing the state to the Democrats this November.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: This week NPR and some members are going to political battlegrounds to ask people what they want from this presidential election. It's part of our project A Nation Engaged. Today we look at Maricopa County, Ariz. It's solidly Republican, but that could change because of the growing Latino vote. Jude Joffe-Block of KJZZ in Phoenix visited one of Maricopa's Mexican-American families. (CROSSTALK) JUDE JOFFE-BLOCK, BYLINE: It's a sunny Sunday morning in the Gonzalez family kitchen. We're in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa. Eldest son Aldo, who's 29, says the family didn't use to talk politics. ALDO GONZALEZ: We just didn't know why we should vote, why you should be either - vote for a Republican or Democrat or what even, like, the parties stood for. JOFFE-BLOCK: Most of the family now identify as independents. Aldo's the most political. He advocates for immigration reform and helps immigrants naturalize. He and his two siblings grew up in Mesa, but the whole family was born in Mexico. His father, Nemecio, came to the U.S. first in the late '80s. Nemecio works in landscaping now but started out as an undocumented farm worker. NEMECIO GONZALEZ: (Through interpreter) I spent several years like that until I had a chance to apply for papers through a farm worker program. In 1999, I became a citizen. JOFFE-BLOCK: The Gonzalez's are among the half million Latinos eligible to vote in Maricopa County, a number that grew 23 percent since the late-2000s according to census estimates. They live in a state known for hard line immigration policies, and for years political analysts have wondered if Arizona Latinos would punish Republicans in power with a backlash. So far, not so much - while Latinos here favor Democrats, they turn out at much lower rates than the general electorate. But some believe this year could be different. A. GONZALEZ: We've seen a record number of people who want to become citizens so they can vote in November. And that's because they want to vote against Trump and against Arpaio. JOFFE-BLOCK: Arpaio is Republican Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for immigration enforcement policies that landed him in court for racially profiling Latinos. For president, the parents will support Hillary Clinton. Nemecio fears more deportations under a Donald Trump administration could affect his extended family. N. GONZALEZ: (Through interpreter) We'll be waiting for bad news all the time if Trump wins. JOFFE-BLOCK: One undocumented relative they worry about is also seated at the table - Nemecio's sister-in-law Minerva. We aren't using her last name because of her status. Minerva says she has a lot to lose if Trump wins and a lot to gain under Clinton who supports a pathway to citizenship for immigrants like her. Minerva says this campaign season is a mix of fear and hope. MINERVA: (Through interpreter) Fear we will be separated from our kids and hope that we can get papers in the future. JOFFE-BLOCK: These high stakes on immigration could motivate more Latinos and put Arizona in reach for Democrats for the first time in 20 years. But some here are disillusioned with both parties, including Aldo. A. GONZALEZ: I don't think that I would be able to support Hillary because I see her as part of the problem. She is part of this system that is very corrupt. JOFFE-BLOCK: He plans to write in Bernie Sanders or support the Green Party's Jill Stein. He's angry the Obama administration deported millions and broke a promise to get immigration reform legislation passed. A. GONZALEZ: And we keep being used as a political football. We can't keep waiting. JOFFE-BLOCK: Which goes to show how Arizona could swing if the Latino electorate can be persuaded. For NPR News, I'm Jude Joffe-Block in Phoenix. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

            "article_content": "As President Obama's administration draws to a close, observers \u2014 and the president himself \u2014 are taking stock of his legacy on race in America. In a wide-ranging interview this week with NPR's Steve Inskeep, Obama responded to critics among people of color who say that, despite their overwhelming support at the ballot box, the president hasn't done enough to deliver results for their communities. \"I'm constantly reminding young people, who are full of passion, that I want them to keep their passion,\" Obama said. \"But they've got to gird for the fact that it takes a long time to get stuff done in this democracy.\" Over the past two months, Inskeep traveled across the country, speaking with Americans about how their lives have changed over the course of Obama's time in the White House. Many discussed their concerns about race relations, and whether the president was as responsive as he should have been to communities of color. Black Lives Matter activism \"making a difference\" One of those people was Kwame Rose, an African-American activist living in Baltimore. He joined street protests last year after the death of Freddie Gray, a young black man who suffered injuries in police custody after an arrest, and died days later. Some of the demonstrations turned violent, leaving businesses damaged, looted or even destroyed. Rose wasn't a part of that destruction, and he became a national voice of peaceful protesters when a video of him challenging what he considered unfair media coverage went viral. But it wasn't just the media whom Rose saw as stereotyping the demonstrators. He also took issue with President Obama, who joined many commentators in describing some of the protesters as thugs. Rose suggested that it proved Obama didn't understand the underlying forces \u2014 including systemic poverty and police brutality \u2014 that drove the demonstrators in Baltimore and other social justice protesters around the country. \"I think he never experienced what it was like to be in Baltimore before the uprising,\" Rose told Inskeep. \"I also think he was speaking from the power of privilege.\" Rose went on to defend not just the peaceful protesters, but also some of those who were implicated in looting, which Rose blamed in part on the desperation borne of generational poverty. In his conversation with Inskeep, Obama embraced the spirit of many young activists in Baltimore, Ferguson and elsewhere. \"I \u2014 what I would say is that the Black Lives Matter movement has been hugely important in getting all of America to \u2014 to see the challenges in the criminal justice system differently,\" Obama said. \"And I could not be prouder of the activism that has been involved. And it's making a difference.\" Still, the president held firm to the idea that outrage over injustice doesn't excuse crime. \"What I would also say, though, is that if somebody is looting, they're looting,\" he said. \"And the notion that they're making a political statement is not always the case, because these are businesses oftentimes owned by African-Americans.\" He continued: \"You have situations in which suddenly \u2014 friends of mine in Baltimore, their mothers who are elderly, have to now travel across town to get their medicines because the local drug store got torn up. And making excuses for them I think is a mistake. \"There are ways of bringing about social change that are powerful and that have the ability to pull the country together and maintain the moral high ground, and there are approaches where I may understand the frustrations, but they're counterproductive. And tearing up your own neighborhood and stealing is counterproductive.\" Immigration reform stalls, but Obama points to progress Latinos also are among those Americans of color whose votes helped fuel Obama's election victories. Now, some of them believe he has fallen short of his promises, especially his pledge to bring about comprehensive immigration reform. I'm constantly reminding young people, who are full of passion, that I want them to keep their passion, but they've got to gird for the fact that it takes a long time to get stuff done in this democracy. President Obama June 27, 2016 That's frustrating to Jose Luis Valdez. He's a restaurant owner in Kansas City, Kan., and a new citizen who is planning to vote for the first time this year. Valdez told Inskeep that he felt Obama could've done much more on immigration during his first term, when he had a Democrat-led Congress. Valdez said the president had used Latino voters. But President Obama defended his record, and the policy priorities of his first years in office. \"I would say to him... his restaurant might not be doing so well if I hadn't focused my first two years on saving the economy. So, it's not as if I didn't have anything else to do.\" The president went on to say he had used the tool available to him to grant legal status to millions of undocumented immigrants when he didn't get congressional support for reform. \"I think it would be pretty hard to argue that I haven't put everything I've had into getting this done. If you were interviewing one of the Dream Act kids, who over the last several years have been able to get a driver's license, a permit to work or going to school, have joined our military, they \u2014 they wouldn't say that they have been used,\" Obama asserted. \"They would say 'thank you.' \" Furthermore, the president believes he has set the stage for a resolution on some major immigration issues. He points to Deferred Actions for Parents of Americans, his executive order that would shield millions of undocumented parents of American citizen children. That policy is in limbo after the Supreme Court deadlocked in a 4-to-4 tie over the legality of the order. Obama's unique perspectives on race Questions about the conflicting ways Americans view race have dogged Obama from the beginning \u2014 and even before the beginning \u2014 of his administration. In their interview, Inskeep reminded the president of a speech he'd given in Philadelphia back in 2008. At the time, Obama's relationship with controversial pastor Jeremiah Wright was threatening his candidacy. In that speech, Obama addressed what many considered Wright's incendiary language about race by saying that it was an honest reflection of the anger many African-Americans felt from enduring years of bias. At the same time, Obama said he could understand why many white Americans \u2014 especially those who were struggling economically \u2014 bristled at the idea that they enjoy some kind of privilege because of their race. During his discussion with Inskeep, Obama allowed that this disconnect between black and white Americans hadn't disappeared over his years in office. But the president said it was so deeply rooted in the nation's history, that it could only be conquered with honest dialogue and a concerted effort to resist divisive rhetoric. \"You can go back, and during Jim Crow and segregation, and you've got black sharecroppers who have nothing and, alongside them, poor white farmers who don't have that much more except for the fact that their white,\" he said. \"And the degree to which a lot of politics in the South were specifically designed to make sure that that sharecropper and that white farmer didn't get together to question how the economy was structured and how they both could benefit, that's \u2014 that's one of the oldest stories in American politics.\" The president said his own family history gave him unique insight into both black and white perspectives about race, and a mission to \"try to get people to recognize themselves and each other\": \"I was raised by a white mom and white grandparents who, you know, never suffered the kinds of discrimination that their black cohorts might have experienced, but who had their own struggles, who went through a Great Depression, who \u2014 a grandmother who had to work her way up without ever a college education, starting in the steno pool or as a secretary and \u2014 and experienced her own discrimination because of being a woman. ... \"And so I've seen the degree to which their struggles are not that different from Michelle's parents' struggles, at least in terms of how they think about it, and \u2014 and \u2014 and the similar values of hoping that their kids are going to do better and that education is the key, and that, you know, everybody's gotta work hard and take responsibility, but that they'd like a government that was more responsive to clear out some of the barriers for their advancement.\" After eight years in office, President Obama allowed for the idea that many of his younger supporters had expected more concrete victories than he delivered, especially in policy areas that touched on race. But he expressed the hope that, instead of largely giving up on electoral politics as some young activists have, the new generation will persist in working on all levels to make the nation live up to its promise of equality for all.",

            "article_content": "California is seeing a surge of voter registrations among Latinos, including a number of voters who have become American citizens specifically to vote. Some have attributed this trend to Donald Trump's run for president.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Come election time, California has been firmly in the blue column for the last two decades. But it also has the largest statewide population of eligible Latino voters in the country. So if you want to know what's going on with those voters, you have to head West. And it's worth stopping by the Sacramento office of Mike Madrid. Hi. MIKE MADRID: Mike Madrid - look, I'm a Latino Republican in California. That's probably the least listened to political voice in America right now. CORNISH: OK, ignore that part. MADRID: But it's also the future. It's also the future. CORNISH: And you hear this a lot because the number of eligible Latino voters has grown at one of the fastest clips of any other group over the last eight years. But the turnout rates, not so hot. And Mike Madrid knows this. He's a GOP consultant in California. He grew up in a family of Catholic Democrats from Mexico and switched to the Republican Party in the Reagan '80s. These days, Madrid says it's been tough going for guys like him. And the party's apparent nominee Donald Trump isn't helping. MADRID: I co-direct the USC-LA Times poll. And I see cross tabs showing that Latinos have an 87 percent negative impression of Donald Trump. Those are extraordinary numbers - I mean, jaw-dropping. You could test Malaria or the Zika virus and it's probably not going to hit 86 percent. I mean, those are huge numbers. CORNISH: We'll come back to Madrid in a moment. But first, let's recall how Donald Trump reintroduced himself to Latino voters when he kicked off his presidential campaign last year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're sending people that have lots of problems. And they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. CORNISH: Trump has since run on a platform of fighting illegal immigration with mass deportations and a U.S.-Mexico border wall. His talk about winning over Latino voters has been met with skepticism. Witness the awkward picture of him eating a taco bowl that he tweeted out to mark Cinco de Mayo. Now, Democrats see the spike in the number of Latino voters in California and think Trump is doing them a favor. Look back to this period in 2012 and 157,000 Latinos had registered to vote in the state. This year, it's nearly 384,000, and the majority are Democrats. Now, we don't know for sure whether the uptick is because of Trump. Knock on enough doors and talk to enough Latino voters and eventually, you will hear his name, says Annie Dobbs Kramer. ANNIE DOBBS KRAMER: Yeah, we were just walking door-to-door... CORNISH: She's an activist with the North Bay Organizing Project. DOBBS KRAMER: You know, we're here to talk about the election and just talk about voting. And she immediately responded, like, girls, get out here. You're registering to vote. We can't let Trump win. (LAUGHTER) DOBBS KRAMER: So, they were like, OK, all right. We're registering folks to vote. I've also - yeah, I actually have heard a few people talk about the fear of Trump. CORNISH: We found Dobbs Kramer at a planning meeting of volunteers in Santa Rosa, a community about 60 miles north of San Francisco. DOBBS KRAMER: So this Saturday, we are having a walk from 2 to 4 p.m. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Who's going to come? One, two three... CORNISH: The thing is, they focus on local issues, rent control, for example. One of their newest volunteers, Maria Dominguez, runs a daycare center in nearby Roseland. This year, she's gone from passive voter to full-blown activist. MARIA DOMINGUEZ: One of my families who lives with me, they don't have any documents right here. But two of their families are already planning to move to Mexico because they're afraid of Trump. They said if Trump wins, we have to leave the country. And there's a kind of fear people is taking from that. CORNISH: Her 17-year-old daughter Rosa Rios jumps in. ROSA RIOS: However, I would like to thank Trump for making us realize how important our vote is because that actually woke up my senior class. And they're like, oh, OK, I'm ready to vote. CORNISH: Rosa Rios is what our political consultant Mike Madrid would consider a missed opportunity for Republicans. She's also among the newly registered Latino voters entering the electorate in an atmosphere that feels, to Madrid, as bad as the early '90s when California was embroiled in a fight over a ballot initiative known as Prop 187. It aimed to prevent undocumented immigrants from using public services. And while most of the measure was found unconstitutional and thrown out in court, Madrid says it marked a turning point. MADRID: Then Governor Pete Wilson, a Republican, campaigned largely on the fact that this was a symbolic message to Washington that the people of California had had enough with its inability to solve the border problem, the border crisis. So regardless of whether it was constitutional or not, the people of California were sending a message. CORNISH: And it became a message also to the people within California, specifically Latino voters, right? MADRID: It became a message to everybody but particularly to the Latino community. CORNISH: And what was that message? MADRID: Well, you're not welcome here, essentially. And that has lasted for a generation. And the great irony is there are voters in 2016 that were not alive during the 1994 campaign. So they have no historical experience with it. And just as those memories are fading back into the rearview mirror of, you know, our political history here in California, we have the emergence of a new candidacy in terms of Donald Trump. CORNISH: Now, the question is not whether California is in play come November. It's whether Latino voters in key battleground states, like Florida, Nevada and Colorado, will follow suit, registering and then voting at higher numbers. So it helps to look at multigenerational households like that of the DeJesus family in Oakland. Forty-nine-year-old Maria DeJesus is a mother of five, including toddler Zoe, giving her a little trouble here as we sit down to talk. ZOE DEJESUS: (Crying). CORNISH: DeJesus is another face behind a statistic, the 13 percent increase so far this fiscal year in the number of immigrants who've applied for naturalization over a year ago. Her household includes another new voter, her 19-year-old son Ever. EVER DEJESUS: I guess I'm going for Bernie Sanders 'cause I go to college. CORNISH: Ever DeJesus goes to San Francisco State University. And as it's gone for much of this election season, there is a generational divide in this house. Maria DeJesus is not going for Bernie Sanders. Originally, she'd had high hopes for a Republican. MARIA DEJESUS: (Speaking Spanish). CORNISH: She says she's always preferred a Spanish speaker. Originally, she had high hopes for a Republican who's no longer in the race. M. DEJESUS: (Speaking Spanish). CORNISH: She has to think for a moment. Then she remembers... M. DEJESUS: Marco Rubio. CORNISH: Marco Rubio. Now that Rubio's dropped out, she says she's voting for Hillary Clinton. M. DEJESUS: (Speaking Spanish). CORNISH: She says, \"the person I don't like is Mr. Trump.\" M. DEJESUS: (Speaking Spanish). CORNISH: She calls him the discriminator. But Maria DeJesus doesn't want to vote out of fear. And Mike Madrid, our Latino Republican consultant, doesn't want his party to further alienate this rapidly growing and diverse group of voters over immigration. He still sees a glimmer of hope in the 29 percent of newly registered Latino voters in California who are listed as nonpartisan. But... MADRID: When you have somebody attacking a community on these issues, none of the issues matter. None of our generational issues matter. None of our cultural or country-of-origin issues matter. All we are hearing is you're not wanted here. And that has a coalescing effect - a very rare convalescing effect in politics. CORNISH: And frankly, his gig, the one he jokingly called the least listened to political voice in America, it's a little lonely. MADRID: Yeah, it is lonely. But I think sometimes that's part of being - I think maybe we need more lonely actors in the American stage - fewer followers, maybe, and more leaders who are willing to stand up and say, look, the Republican Party is wrong. And, look, a lot of Latino politicians are wrong. You both need each other to be successful. CORNISH: And the first test of turn out for these Latino voters comes soon.

            "article_content": "Immigration is back on the front burner in the Republican primary. This past week, at a rally in Orange County, Calif., Donald Trump returned to talking about the wall he wants to build along the U.S. border with Mexico. Meanwhile, outside, there were protesters speaking out against his immigration proposals and carrying Mexican flags. Back in January, we reported about the dramatically changing demographics in Charlotte, which has seen a massive influx of Latino immigrants in the past decade. Charlotte, N.C. has one of the fastest growing Latino populations of any major city. Some are here illegally, but many are now U.S. citizens and the GOP has been saying for years they want their vote. After the 2012 election, Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said the party would spend significant resources to reach out to Hispanic voters. \"We're going to be announcing a $10 million initiative just this year, which will include hundreds of people paid across the country from coast to coast \u2014 Hispanic, African-American, Asian communities talking about our party, talking about our brand,\" he said. We went back to Charlotte this past week to see how Latinos are weighing their choices in the election, and whether that Republican outreach has worked. This week on For the Record: back to Mecklenburg County, N.C. Vanessa Faura The last time we were in Charlotte, we met Vanessa Faura, a working mother of three, originally from Peru. She's a Republican. Back in January, she was deciding between Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio. Now both candidates are out, and Faura is despondent. Vanessa Faura thinks the Republican Party as a whole hasn't done a good enough job of reaching out to Latinos for their vote.\n                \n                    \n                    Natalie Winston/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"I've never thought that I would ever feel this way about an upcoming election. Ever. Even when I was undecided,\" she says. \"I have never felt this anxiety or frustration and sadness and it's like what am I going to do? And it's painful.\" Before we dig deeper into that pain, we should first remind you about changes that Charlotte has seen. \"We're in a transition right now and this county is actually 55 percent nonwhite so we know that this is growing, no going backwards,\" says Astrid Chirinos, with the Latin American Economic Development Corporation of Charlotte. Astrid Chirinos Chirinos is what you'd call a mover and shaker. She's immensely proud of the contributions the Latinos here have made to the economy and the culture. \"I'm a Venezuelan by birth, but a Charlottean by choice,\" she says. We met Chirinos at the Levine Museum of the New South, where she walked us around. \"Carlos Machicao, he's an internationally known designer. Judge Albert Diaz, he's Puerto Rican, now in the circuit court.\" Chirinos is quick to acknowledge that even though the population is growing fast, Latinos aren't nearly as politically engaged. Only 4 percent of the voting population turned out in the last election. \"If the 17 candidates that ran for the Republican Party were an example of how they are planning to provide a platform or show how they engage with the immigrant communities, I would say definitely they have missed the mark,\" Astrid Chirinos says.\n                \n                    \n                    Natalie Winston /NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"We have 100,000 who can be registered to vote and are not ... and many times they don't even apply because they think they're not going to pass the test or that there are going to be barriers,\" Chirinos says. \"So we're working on creating that civic engagement so they understand that they belong.\" She says the presidential primary has made Latinos here feel even more disenfranchised. Yes, there are the obvious things \u2014 Donald Trump, the wall and the promise for mass deportations \u2014 but there are also the other candidates who Chirinos says just never connected with Latino voters. \"If the 17 candidates that ran for the Republican Party were an example of how they are planning to provide a platform or show how they engage with the immigrant communities I would say definitely they have missed the mark,\" she says. Manolo Betancur We met Manolo Betancur outside his bakery on Central Avenue on the East side of Charlotte. He's not happy with the GOP. Manolo Betancur, who thinks Donald Trump is increasing the racial division in the country, says he plans to vote for Hillary Clinton.\n                \n                    \n                    Natalie Winston /NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"Four years ago and the Republicans were saying the same thing: We want to be more friendly for the immigrants with the Hispanics and minorities,\" he says. \"They didn't pass immigration reform. They didn't come to help small businesses, they didn't come to help minorities. This country doesn't have enough people to pay social security. They need immigrants.\" Betancur and his wife Zhenia Martinez bought the bakery from her parents five years ago. In the early days, they'd sell their bread to immigrants working on farms outside of Charlotte. Now their baked goods are sold in Harris Teeter grocery stores around North Carolina. It's called Las Delicias, a fitting name for a bakery that sells churros, including some filled with caramel, churned out by hand. Betancur's family business is doing well and he and his wife are building a good life for his two kids. But he says this election has stirred up a kind of overt discrimination that he hasn't felt before. \"Right now with Trump, he's increasing the hate in this country. All the people that were quiet, now they're feeling: If this guy is talking we can talk again,\" he says, meaning anyone can say something racist or discriminatory or just unwelcoming. Betancur says he's voting for Hillary Clinton. But we heard from other Latino immigrants who are leaning towards Trump. Proud Republican, Conflicted Latino Voter Over at a phone bank run by The Libre Initiative, about a dozen or so volunteers are situated around a few tables on the back patio of an apartment complex. The group's website it says they work to \"inform the U.S. Hispanic community about the benefits of a constitutionally limited government.\" At a phone bank run by The Libre Initiative, volunteers are calling Latinos to find out how they plan to vote in November.\n                \n                    \n                    Natalie Winston/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Vaness Faura is one of the organizers of the phone bank. As we mentioned before, she feels incredibly conflicted about who to vote for this year because she just doesn't like her options. Faura voted for Marco Rubio in the primary, and now she doesn't know what to make of Donald Trump, especially his immigration proposals. She wonders if maybe it's just the kind of outrageous stuff politicians say in primaries and if elected maybe he wouldn't really deport the 11 million people who are here illegally. \"It would be a disaster I think, and it would give us a very bad reputation at the end of the day, because it will get ugly. I don't think it's a realistic thing to implement, period,\" she says. \"So I honestly believe that what he's saying now is just another political playing card.\" While Faura is a legal U.S. resident, she has sympathy for the people she knows who are undocumented. \"Their situation specifically, it's pretty sad, because the people that I know are very hardworking people, some of them own their own business, in North Carolina,\" she says. \"Several of them are women who worked hard and now are business owners, yet, undocumented, living the American dream, and still have to be scared when they are hopping into their car to go to work. On a daily basis, if I have a police car behind mine, I get a little bit nervous. I shouldn't. I have my driver's license. Can you imagine people like that who are undocumented cannot have a driver's license, because they're not allowed?\" But, she says, \"We also have people that take advantage of the system. As an American, that angers me. It angers a lot of people.\" She explains with a story. When she stopped working for a while to be a stay at home mom, she was pinching pennies, always looking for the best deal at the grocery store. \"But then I saw all the other women who just picked whatever, and then when they get in front of me to pay, they're paying with the food stamps, and then they're hopping into these nice cars and I know their husbands are working somewhere with the construction company making a lot of money cash, right? So I can see why people are angry, because I've seen it myself. And this is why a lot of Latinos who are for Trump are voting for him, because they are angry at that.\" So here's Vanessa Faura, a committed Republican from an immigrant background. And she too says she feels ignored by the GOP. \"If you believe in something and you really want it real bad, it's not just that you have to say it and get out there and have these great speeches about how we need to outreach to minority groups.\" She says. \"That really shows that you really, really care and that you really want this, is that you put money on it.\" We should point out here that conservatives are giving money to groups like hers. In fact, the Libre Initiative is funded by the Koch brothers who have put hundreds of millions of dollars into winning over various voter groups including Hispanics. Even so, Faura thinks the GOP as a whole hasn't done a good enough job of bringing Latino voters into the tent. And all of this has left this proud Republican with an unsettled feeling. \"Just to think what's going to happen in November, and just to think that I'm going to ... walk in there, show my ID, and then get in front of that screen, anything can happen.\" she says. \"I have never voted for a Democrat, and I don't think I ever will, but then again, when I am in front of that screen, anything can happen.\"",

Donald Trump's enduring appeal in the Republican presidential contest has the GOP in a quandary, as it's forced to contend with voters fed up with party politics. Some 50 years ago, another vociferous candidate put the scare in traditional power brokers. George Wallace fired up crowds with a similar anti-establishment message, and drew protests as passionate as are being seen at Trump's rallies today. Wallace also became a face of racial tension in America as the leading symbol for segregation in the 1960s. \"I want to tell these national parties this \u2014 they're going to find out there are a lot of rednecks come Nov. 5th in this country.\" Former Alabama Gov. George Wallace on the campaign trail in 1968 When Wallace entered presidential politics in 1964, the then-Alabama governor was famous for declaring, \"Segregation now. Segregation tomorrow. And segregation forever.\" Wallace allies and family see parallels today in Trump. \"It's just a replay,\" Charlie Snider, one of Wallace's most trusted political aides, told NPR. \"We're looking at a modern-day George Wallace.\" Snider is a Trump supporter. Wallace's daughter, a Democrat, hears it, too, but in a different way. \"Trump and my father say out loud what people are thinking but don't have the courage to say,\" Peggy Wallace Kennedy told NPR. Wallace Kennedy was 18 when she was on the campaign trail with her father in 1968. She believes Trump is exploiting voters' worst instincts, the way her late father once did. \"They both were able to adopt the notion that fear and hate are the two greatest motivators of voters that feel alienated from government,\" she said.

We want Wallace!\" supporters would chant, as he took the stage at elaborate rallies that typically featured live country music acts. Tens of thousands turned out in major Northeastern cities like Boston and New York. Wallace's racial rhetoric on this national stage was more coded. He berated both the federal government and the national political parties for being out of touch with average Americans. \"I want to tell these national parties this \u2014 they're going to find out there are a lot of rednecks come Nov. 5th in this country,\" Wallace said to a shouting crowd in 1968. \"They've been used as a doormat long enough.\" It was \"doormats\" in the '60s. Today, a \"dumping ground.\" \"The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems,\" Trump declared when he announced he was running for president. Snider, now 84, was chairman of two of Wallace's four presidential campaigns. Snider has been watching this year's race with great interest. \"George didn't have the party for him,\" he said. \"He didn't have the hierarchy for him.

He carried five states, sweeping most of the Deep South \u2014 Georgia, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and his home state of Alabama. As the American Independent Party candidate, he won 46 electoral votes, the last third-party presidential candidate to win any electoral votes. Wallace ran as a Democrat in 1972 and again in 1976. (During the '72 campaign, he was shot and wounded in an assassination attempt that left him paralyzed and in a wheelchair.) Snider said watching the protesters at Trump rallies today reminds him of being on the campaign trail with Wallace. In an era of anti-war and civil-rights activism, there were always protesters in the audience. \"George kinda liked that 'cause he would badger with them,\" Snider said. He said Wallace would make fun of men with long hair \u2014 or joke about them wearing sandals in the cold weather. \"He kindly enjoyed it,\" Snider said.

Wallace drew voters alarmed at eroding white privilege. Trump draws voters worried about the erosion of blue-collar jobs and competition from immigrant labor. But Trump has also become embroiled in controversy over race. In his announcement speech, he said undocumented Mexican immigration was bringing drugs and \"rapists.\" And he has called for a temporary ban on noncitizen Muslims entering the U.S. Those have become lightning rods in much the way Wallace's positions did in the 1960s. \"Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on,\" he said in South Carolina after the terrorist attacks in Paris late last year. The Alabama governor's daughter, Wallace Kennedy, is a retired schoolteacher who now advocates for the very voting rights her father once fought. She's critical of the Trump campaign and says she even hears an echo of her father's campaign slogans in Trump's. They appeal to voters who think the country, as they know it, is slipping away, she said. \"My father would say, 'The federal government is not going to tell me what to do, so we're going to stand up for ourselves,' \" Wallace Kennedy said. \"His theme was 'Stand up for America.'

It's about a vague taking charge.\" Now professor emeritus at the University of South Carolina, Carter said both Trump and Wallace come across as fighters to voters who believe the country is on the wrong track. \"There are a lot of people who essentially want the world to stop and want it to stop changing,\" Carter said. \"And when that happens, you look for a strong individual. And to me that's the big appeal and the big similarity between George Wallace and Donald Trump.\" Tension on the campaign trail \u2014 with protesters and the media Incidents of violence at rallies are another common theme. Just as Trump supporters have turned on protesters in the crowd, Wallace rallies were known to get physical. On CBS Evening News in October of 1968, correspondent David Dick reported from a Detroit rally, where a fight broke out between hecklers and Wallace supporters. \"The tension was so great, emotions so high, there was an inevitable melee,\" Dick reported. \"Fistfights, chairs for weapons, and sticks \u2014 both improvised and official.\" Former Alabama Secretary of State Jim Bennett was a reporter with the Birmingham Post-Herald at the time and covered the Wallace presidential rallies. \"They were wild,\" he said. He recalled one particular confrontation in Portland, Ore. \"Protesters were going around one way and Wallace supporters were going around the other,\" he said. \"And when they'd clash, they'd hit each other with signs, one of which said, 'God is love.' \" Bennett wrote a column on the similarities he sees between Trump's approach and Wallace's campaign style \u2014 for instance, the way they target the media. \"Wallace used to point out the press that was there,\" Bennett said. \"And sometimes that didn't go over so well with some of these crowds, either.\" Wallace said at a Florida rally in 1968: \"The average citizen in this county has more intelligence and sense in his little finger than the editor of The New York Times has in his whole head.\" Trump is no fan, either: \"The press is really bad,\" he has said. And he's taken to calling the newspaper \"the failing New York Times.\" At a rally in Indianapolis on Wednesday, Trump revved up the crowd against the press, calling the media \"the most dishonest people in the world.\" \"Do we like the media?\" he asked the crowd. \"No!\" rose up from the audience. \"Do we hate the media?\" he asked, raising his hands up to cue the crowd. \"Yes!\" There's another similarity between Wallace and Trump, too. Like Wallace, Trump may spar with the press, but he also tends to be the candidate who gets the most media attention.",

The fate of one of President Obama's controversial executive actions on immigration goes before the Supreme Court on Monday. The action would grant temporary, quasi-legal status and work permits to as many as 4 million parents who entered the U.S. illegally prior to 2010. The president's order applies only to parents of children who are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents. Perla is one of the millions of parents who would benefit from the president's action. She and her husband, both college graduates, came to the U.S. to study. She says they routinely returned to Mexico to renew their visas, but became afraid to return home to an area torn apart by drug cartels. So they stayed here illegally. She and Fight for Families, the advocacy organization she works with, asked that NPR not use her full name. Now they have two children, ages 3 and 5, both American citizens. Perla and her husband do not apply for jobs they are trained to do \u2014 she in industrial engineering, he in business management. They support their children by working, illegally, in restaurants. Perla | #FightForFamilies from Fight For Families on Vimeo. \"They are why we're here,\" Perla said of her children, \"why we are who we are, why we try to do things right, and we'll keep doing it as long as God permits.\" More than a year and a half ago, President Obama, frustrated by the refusal of Republican House leaders to act on a Senate-passed immigration reform bill, conceded in a speech to the nation that \"the best way\" to solve this problem is with \"a common-sense\" immigration reform bill like the one passed by the Senate. \"But until that happens,\" he said, \"there are actions I have the legal authority to take as president.\" He maintained that these are \"the same kinds of actions taken by Democratic and Republican presidents before me \u2014 that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just.\" Obama said that his administration had focused its deportation efforts on criminals, gang members, security threats, or as he put it, \"felons, not families.\" It is \"simply unrealistic,\" he said, to suggest that any administration could track down, round up and deport all of the 11 million people who live in this country illegally. Republicans blasted the president's action as \"lawless,\" and a coalition of 26 states, led by Texas, challenged the executive action in court, contending that the president had exceeded his authority. Last year a federal judge blocked implementation of the program on narrow technical grounds, and a federal appeals court panel, by a 2-1 vote, subsequently blocked it on broader grounds. The case is now before the Supreme Court \u2014 a court that has repeatedly given the executive branch of government \"broad discretion\" over immigration policy, including how the law is to be enforced as well as who should be arrested and deported. Three years ago in a case from Arizona, the court, by a 5-3 vote, dealt a major defeat to conservative states that tried to crack down on immigrants in the country illegally by enacting state laws that allowed police to stop and arrest people who could not show that they were citizens or legal permanent residents. In Monday's case, the question is not whether the states have any immigration enforcement power; it is whether the president has the power to temporarily shield the undocumented parents of American citizen children, and give them temporary work permits so that they can support their families for the time being. It is not the first time a president has done something like this. For a half-century, presidents of both parties have issued similar actions. But no executive action has had the potential to give temporary legal status to as many people. President George H.W. Bush's order had the potential for shielding 1.5 million immigrants in the country illegally, though fewer actually sought protection. President Obama's order has the potential to shield some 4 million. Before the Supreme Court on Monday, Texas Solicitor General Scott Keller will tell the justices that this challenge is not about the administration's decision to forego deportation for whole classes of people. Instead, he said, the administration \"is granting lawful presence. It is saying, even though Congress says you are here unlawfully, the executive is going to say, 'No, you're actually here lawfully.' And why that matters is because Congress has said when you go from being here unlawfully to being here lawfully, you are eligible for benefits.\" Those benefits \u2014 social security and Medicare \u2014 are afforded to everyone who works legally in the U.S. Therefore, if you have a legal work permit, which the Obama action would provide to those who are eligible, and if you pay your taxes, then you are entitled to those benefits. Lawyer Andrew Pincus, who filed a brief on the administration's side in this case, maintains that \"Congress delegated this authority in the Immigration and Nationality Act.\" The purpose, he said, was \"both to prioritize people for removal, and to confer work authorization.\" Congress has never withdrawn the president's power to grant temporary legal status or work permits, Pincus said. \"That's a system of laws and regulations that's been in place, and that the president is following as previous presidents did.\" But Texas's Keller contends that the president went too far when he \"changed the law\" on his own. \"We don't have a carte blanche delegation to the president to unilaterally say, 'you're now lawfully in the country,'\" Keller said. Lawyer Pincus replies that the president's executive action does not grant citizenship or permanent legal status; it is just a three-year temporary grant of legal status that allows those eligible to work and support themselves and their American citizen children. Whatever the merits of these arguments, it is possible that the court will never get to them. The administration maintains that Texas has no legal right to be in court at all because it has not suffered the concrete injury that is required to bring a lawsuit. Chief Justice John Roberts is known to be a stickler on this question. Texas argues that it would indeed sustain a concrete injury under the president's executive action because the state has a policy of subsidizing driver's licenses, and a large number of people previously considered in the country illegally would be eligible for those licenses if they were granted temporary lawful status by the president's order. The Obama administration counters that this is a self-inflicted problem for the state, and that Texas is free to charge more for these new driver's licenses if it wishes to.",

Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton had another tense debate Wednesday night in Miami, less than a week before crucial primary contests on March 15. The latest face-off between the two came as the Vermont senator was riding high from an unexpected victory Tuesday in Michigan. The two clashed over immigration reform, U.S.-Cuba relations and Wall Street policy, and debated their electoral strategy going forward. Next Tuesday, voters from Florida, Ohio, Missouri, North Carolina and Illinois will cast their ballots. Here were some of the top moments from the Univision/Washington Post debate broadcast on CNN: Michigan momentum It wasn't lost on the moderators that Sanders had pulled off a huge upset over the former secretary of state in Michigan on Tuesday night. But Clinton downplayed the loss and pointed out the positives from the day, including her big win in Mississippi. \"This is a marathon and a marathon that can only be carried out by the type of inclusive campaign I'm running,\" Clinton said. \"I was pleased I got 100,000 more votes last night than my opponent and more delegates.\" Sanders argued that he's the one with the momentum, calling his win in Michigan \"one of the major political upsets in modern presidential history.\" \"And I believe that our message of the need for people to stand up and tell corporate America and Wall Street that they cannot have it all is resonating across this country,\" Sanders said. \"And I think in the coming weeks and months, we are going to continue to do extremely well, win a number of these primaries and convince superdelegates that Bernie Sanders is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump.\" Immigration flashpoint One of the most revealing moments came on immigration, an issue of utmost importance to the Latino community at which this debate was aimed. Both Clinton and Sanders broke with the White House policy of mass deportation by promising not to deport children or other undocumented immigrants who don't have criminal records. \"Of the people, the undocumented people living in our country, I do not want to see them deported. I want to see them on a path to citizenship. That is exactly what I will do,\" Clinton said. But Sanders criticized Clinton, claiming she did not make the same pledge regarding Honduran children fleeing violence in Central America. \"Secretary Clinton did not support those children coming into this country. I did,\" Sanders said. \"Now, I happen to agree with President Obama on many, many issues. I think he has done a great job as president of the United States. He is wrong on this issue of deportation. I disagree with him on that.\" But while the two found common ground on the issue of deportation, they still needled each other over past immigration votes. Clinton hit Sanders for opposing a 2007 immigration reform bill, which Sanders said he voted against because it had guest worker provisions that were \"akin to slavery.\" \"I have been consistent and committed to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship,\" Clinton said. \"I think our best chance was in 2007 when [the late Massachusetts Sen.] Ted Kennedy led the charge on comprehensive immigration reform. We had Republican support, we had a president willing to sign it. I voted for that bill. Sen. Sanders voted against it. Just think \u2014 imagine where we would be today if we had achieved comprehensive immigration reform nine years ago.\" In an email to reporters, Sanders' campaign pointed out that many Latino groups and unions also opposed the bill; Sanders supported the 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed the Senate but stalled in the House. Clinton went even harder against Sanders, referencing his support for a 2006 bill that she said allowed indefinite detention of people facing deportation. She linked his position to the Minuteman Project, vigilantes who patrol the southern border. \"There was a piece of legislation supported by dozens and dozens of members of the House which codified existing legislation,\" Sanders pushed back. \"What the secretary is doing tonight and has done very often is take large pieces of legislation and take pieces out of it. No, I do not support vigilantes, and that is a horrific statement, an unfair statement to make.\" Meanwhile, Sanders dredged up a point of conflict between Obama and Clinton in their 2008 race \u2014 her opposition to providing undocumented immigrants with driver's licenses in New York. Big differences between the candidates on Cuba One of the most consequential exchanges came near the end of the two-hour-long debate, on U.S.-Cuba relations. Both supported President Obama's efforts to normalize relations with the country and ease travel restrictions. Sanders was presented with a 1985 clip in which he praised the leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua and said that what people forgot about Fidel Castro was that \"he educated their kids, gave them health care, totally transformed their society.\" Sanders tried to explain that he was simply opposing U.S.-led regime change in the Latin American countries and wouldn't say whether he still believed in those characterizations. He turned instead to lifting the trade embargo on Cuba, but noted that while he now hoped it would become a democratic country, progress already made by the Castro government shouldn't be overlooked. \"It would be wrong not to state that in Cuba they have made some good advances in health care,\" said Sanders. \"They are sending doctors all over the world. They have made some progress in education. I think by restoring full diplomatic relations with Cuba, it will result in significant improvements to the lives of Cubans and it will help the United States and our business community invest.\" Clinton emphatically disagreed with his argument \u2014 an important tone to strike in Florida, home to many Cuban emigres and their families who remain very anti-Castro. And those statements from Sanders could hurt him with those voters in next Tuesday's Florida primary. \"You know, if the values are that you oppress people, you disappear people, you imprison people or even kill people for expressing their opinions, for expressing freedom of speech, that is not the kind of revolution or values that I ever want to see anywhere,\" Clinton said to loud cheers in the room. Clinton pressed on Benghazi The former secretary of state's handling of the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador, is a frequent GOP talking point, but this was the first time she had been pressed on the issue in a Democratic debate \u2014 and the audience didn't like it, booing loudly as the issue was raised. Univision showed a video of a family member of one of the victims questioning why Clinton had told her daughter, Chelsea, in an email the night of the attacks that al-Qaida was responsible. Clinton said she had been wrong and that all involved parties at the time \"were scrambling to get information that was changing, literally, by the hour. And when we had information, we made it public. But then sometimes we had to go back and say we have new information that contradicts it.\" Clinton defends her email server Clinton was also pressed on her controversial decision to use a private email server while at the State Department, asked bluntly by moderator Jorge Ramos, \"Who specifically gave you permission to operate your email system as you did? Was it President Barack Obama? And would you drop out of the race if you get indicted?\" \"It wasn't the best choice. I made a mistake. It was not prohibited. It was not in any way disallowed,\" Clinton argued, maintaining that no emails she sent at the time were marked classified and had instead been retroactively classified in a rash of \"over-classification.\" Pressed again about what would happen if she were indicted by the FBI, Clinton was exasperated. \"Oh, for goodness \u2014 that is not going to happen,\" she said. \"I'm not even answering that question.\" Sanders, who famously in the first debate said he's heard enough about her \"damn emails,\" didn't bite this time either. \"There is a process under way, and that process will take its course,\" he reiterated, saying he'd rather focus on income inequality, climate change and other issues. The trust factor Clinton was also asked by the Washington Post's Karen Tumulty about perhaps her biggest Achilles' heel: why so few people view her as trustworthy. \"Is there anything in your own actions and the decisions that you yourself have made that would foster this kind of mistrust?\" Tumulty posited. Clinton admitted, in perhaps one of the frankest moments of the campaign, that it's \"painful\" for her to hear such criticisms but that she does \"take responsibility. When you're in public life, even if you believe that it's not an opinion that you think is fair or founded, you do have to take responsibility.\" \"I am not a natural politician, in case you haven't noticed, like my husband or President Obama,\" Clinton said, somewhat wistfully. \"So I have a view that I just have to do the best I can, get the results I can, make a difference in people's lives and hope that people see that I'm fighting for them and that I can improve conditions economically and other ways that will benefit them and their families.\" But that segued into one of Sanders' most salient attacks on Clinton \u2014 why she hasn't released transcripts of her paid speeches to Wall Street groups. \"I would think that a speech so great that you got paid so much money for, you would like to share it with the American people,\" Sanders argued. \"So I think she should release the transcript.\" And Clinton still struggled to find a strong response to his push. \"I have been on the record, and now I do have the toughest, most comprehensive plan to go after Wall Street,\" she argued, even as Sanders pointed out her campaign donations from major financial institutions. \"And not just the big banks, all the other financial interests that pose a threat to our economy.\" Is Trump a racist? Another blunt question from the moderator that each candidate ended up not answering directly: Is Donald Trump, the GOP front-runner, a racist because of his controversial comments about Hispanics, women, African-Americans and other groups? \"Others are also joining in making clear that his rhetoric, his demagoguery, his trafficking in prejudice and paranoia has no place in our political system,\" Clinton said. \"Especially from somebody running for president who couldn't decide whether or not to disavow the Ku Klux Klan and David Duke. So people can draw their own conclusions about him. I will just end by saying this: You don't make America great by getting rid of everything that made America great.\" Pressed again as to whether Trump's call to ban Muslims and other proposals were outright racist, Clinton again demurred. \"I think it's un-American. I think what he has promoted is not at all in keeping with American values,\" she continued. \"And I am going to take every opportunity to criticize him, to raise those issues.\" Sanders, too, decried Trump's rhetoric and assailed his tactics, but said he believes logic will win out with voters \u2014 and pointed out that he performs better against Trump in some general-election hypothetical matchups than Clinton. \"I think that the American people are never going to elect a president who insults Mexicans, who insults Muslims, who insults women, who insults African-Americans,\" he said. Reminding people of Trump's role in the so-called \"birther\" movement questioning whether President Obama was born in the U.S., Sanders implied it was driven by racism. \"My dad was born in Poland,\" Sanders continued. \"I know a little bit about the immigrant experience. Nobody has ever asked me for my birth certificate. Maybe it has something to do with the color of my skin.\"",

Seriously, that happened. Afterward, amid shouts and taunts, Rubio and Cruz raised questions about Trump's business record: about hiring undocumented workers, his company manufacturing overseas and the lawsuit against Trump University. Trump even admitted twice to flip-flops. Both candidates dared Trump to release a recording from an off-the-record talk with The New York Times on immigration. Kasich tried to remain above the fray.

In 10 months, Americans will go to the polls to pick the next U.S. president. When they cast their ballots, those votes will likely hinge on how they feel about the issues most important to them. But what are those issues? As a way of finding out, NPR's Rachel Martin centered her focus on one community going through a lot of change: Mecklenburg County, N.C. The whole county \u2014 including its biggest city, Charlotte \u2014 has been enjoying an economic boom. It's a major center for banking, there's a growing tech sector, and immigrants have been coming to the county in growing numbers: In the 1990s, the number of Hispanics in Mecklenberg County increased by 400 percent. At the same time, a recent study out of the University of California, Berkeley and Harvard ranked Charlotte dead last when it comes to economic mobility compared with other major cities. Such changes in the county have led to debates over government overreach, income inequality and immigration \u2014 some of the same issues that are front and center in the presidential race. And that makes Mecklenburg County an interesting place to spend some time this election year. But to understand the voting population in Mecklenburg County, you have to understand how Charlotte and the surrounding suburbs have changed in the past several years. This week on For the Record: Mecklenburg County, N.C. Uptown/Downtown \"This whole area of town has really started development in the last four years,\" says Dan Roselli, the founder of Packard Place in the center of Charlotte. His office is an old Packard Motor Cars showroom that's now part startup incubator, part community center. When asked whom he likes in the presidential race, Roselli mentions Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2014 then Hillary Clinton, Gov. John Kasich and Sen. Ted Cruz. As indicated by his diverse list of preferences, Roselli is a registered independent. When it comes to politics, the businessman says his priority is economic growth, not social issues. \"Whenever I talk to political officials,\" he says, \"the first thing I tell them is that there should be a political Hippocratic oath, which is: Your first job as a politician, when it comes to business, is do no harm.\" Roselli is one of the entrepreneurs who are redefining Charlotte's downtown area \u2014 but other parts of the city are changing, too. West End Entrepreneurs Damian Johnson, owner of No Grease Barber Shop in Charlotte, N.C., finishes up a haircut on Sam Chaney. Sam has been a client for over 10 years.\n                \n                    \n                    Logan Cyrus for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Damian Johnson, owner of No Grease Barber Shop in Charlotte, N.C., finishes up a haircut on Sam Chaney. Sam has been a client for over 10 years. Damian Johnson and his brother opened their first barbershop in Charlotte in 1997. Now, they've got a number of them, all going by the name No Grease, including a location on the city's west side. All the barbers wear bow ties, and the place is decked out in midcentury modern furniture. It's throwback and cutting edge at the same time. \"From my experience, the West End is the new frontier of Charlotte,\" Johnson says. \"And so, when we say the West End, it's like we're rooting for the West End to take its rightful place in the development of Charlotte.\" Barbershops have long been a place for political talk \u2014 especially in the black community \u2014 and it's important to Johnson to keep that tradition alive. Asked whom he likes best in the presidential race, he says he hasn't committed to any one candidate yet. \"I've taken none of them really seriously,\" Johnson says. \"I'm going to listen closely to what Hillary is saying, but all the other candidates, it's like courting and dating: I have to listen to you more.\" Blue Island In A Red Sea Customers get haircuts on a busy Saturday morning at No Grease Mosaic Village in Charlotte, N.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Logan Cyrus for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Customers get haircuts on a busy Saturday morning at No Grease Mosaic Village in Charlotte, N.C. That was the case with most of the Democrats NPR spoke with in Charlotte. They're just not animated by the primary race \u2014 which isn't surprising, considering there are just three candidates compared with the 12 on the Republican side. Take for example the former Democratic mayor of Charlotte, Dan Clodfelter, who just left office recently. He says he hasn't paid much attention to the primaries. \"I already have my candidate. I don't really need to be sold,\" Clodfelter says. His candidate is Hillary Clinton \u2014 \"always has been,\" he says. Mecklenburg County is solidly Democrat. More than 60 percent of voters cast their ballots for Barack Obama in 2012 in the county, compared with 38 percent for Mitt Romney. But statewide, Romney won with 50.6 percent, compared with Obama's 48.4 percent. Republicans have more than two-thirds of the seats in the state Senate and close to that in the state House of Representatives. North Carolina's governor, Pat McCrory, is a Republican. And on the GOP side of Charlotte's political spectrum, there is an impassioned debate happening over the very soul of the Republican Party. Immigration Dominates Republican Debates One issue in particular is driving Republican discussions here. \"The word of God says, 'Be angry, but do not sin.' I am angry, very angry, with the debate on immigration,\" says Maudia Melendez, a local minister who's lived in Charlotte since 1987. Her family is originally from Nicaragua. Recently, she's been fighting the Republican-controlled state government to give undocumented immigrants special driving permits. It's personal, because it's her own party. \"Yes, I am a Republican, but I'm very sad how the Republicans are treating my people,\" she says. Maudia Melendez, minister at Jesus Ministry Inc., sits at her desk inside Statesville Road Baptist Church in Charlotte, N.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Logan Cyrus for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Maudia Melendez, minister at Jesus Ministry Inc., sits at her desk inside Statesville Road Baptist Church in Charlotte, N.C. She doesn't like to brandish her party affiliation, because she works with a bipartisan nonprofit that tries to increase the low voter turnout rates among Hispanics in Charlotte. In the past 15 years, Mecklenburg County's Hispanic population has grown from 6.5 percent in 2000 to 12.7 percent in 2014. And not surprisingly, immigration was a big issue for many of the people we spoke to. At a local Salvadoran restaurant, on the east side of town, Melendez gathers a small group of community leaders and friends, two of whom \u2014 Astrid Chirinos and Rafael Prieto \u2014 say that immigration reform is their foremost focus when it comes to thinking about presidential candidates. \"That's part of the economic opportunity,\" Chirinos says. \"You don't have that, you're not going to have progress. I mean, we're going to go backwards.\" Ron Cox, who is also at the table, is the only non-Hispanic in the group. Born and raised in Charlotte, Cox opened a landscaping business and has employed Hispanic immigrants for many years. \"I began to see so many of the injustices, and got to see a lot of them taken advantage of,\" he says. \"It reached my core and my angst.\" He says immigration reform is also a top issue for him, but he doesn't see any of the candidates from either party proposing a real solution, because, he says, their motivations are different. Also at the table is Amelia Kennedy, who's part of the Republican Party leadership in the neighboring county. She and Maudia Melendez have been reaching out directly to some Republican candidates to talk about immigration reform \u2014 including Ted Cruz, whom they say they had a conversation with several months ago. \"He wants to be president so bad that he has the same speech: 'We have to secure the border.' And we ask, 'How is it that you're going to secure the border? You have to have a plan,' \" Melendez recalls. \"We spent like 40 minutes with him, and we didn't get anything.\" Stand On Principles, Even If You Lose The next morning, another group of conservative voters is having a very different conversation at Skyland Family Restaurant. Don Reid, a former Charlotte City Council member, has been hosting a weekly Republican breakfast here for close to two decades. There are about 50 people in the back area of the restaurant, overwhelmingly white and male. They're finishing up plates of bacon and eggs while Reid introduces some big-picture questions about the future of their party. For him, it's very clear. \"Republicans have been so concerned in the past about appealing to minorities, to Latinos and others, that they've forgotten their own principles,\" Reid says. \"And now, they are out here saying again, 'We must have the big tent.' No, that will not work. For the most part, minorities are not going to vote for Republicans. You can count on that.\" Some people nod their heads in agreement, but John Powell, who ran for city council as a Republican last November, puts a different opinion to the room. \"I think if we go out and actually offer our hand and welcome them, and be able to supply with them a message of who we are, then that's going to educate and have a better understanding of what the Republican Party's all about,\" Powell says. \"And what we can do to encourage everybody to be a part of the process.\" But it's clear the majority in the room are sick and tired of establishment Republicans and any thought of compromising on core conservative principles. Don Reid says he likes Donald Trump's plan to build a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, and in general he's a Trump supporter. \"Would I or this crowd be happy with Cruz? Yep, I think so. Would we be happy with Jeb Bush? Nope. For the first time in my life, if it's Jeb Bush or Hillary I don't vote,\" Reid says. \"I'm not supporting establishment Republicans anymore. I'm supporting almost a destruction of the current Republican Party. ... Let them run on principle and either win or lose.\" The differences between Maudia Melendez and Don Reid are sharp examples of this internal Republican rift, especially on the issue of immigration. The result of this struggle could determine the future of the GOP for several elections to come. Forcing A Conversation \"This is extremely productive. Change only comes through pain,\" says Republican strategist Larry Shaheen. \"And I have to admit, I think Donald Trump's great for our party. Because he is forcing us to have this conversation.\" Shaheen, a Charlotte native, says the Republican Party needs to broaden its base to attract minority voters \u2014 which means changing the way it talks about immigration reform. \"At some point we have to get over this 'we were here first' idea. Because we weren't. And we're better as a society when we are able to find a way for rising tides to lift all boats, not just the boats that look like us,\" he says. \"And we have to move from the party of opportunity for just a few to opportunity for all.\" Opportunity for all is what Charlotte is all about. We heard that from Democrats, Republicans and independents. People here want to ride this economic wave as far as it will take them. For many here, that means welcoming anyone who wants to come and help make that happen. But neither party has won over the people we spoke to when it comes to immigration policy. We'll be returning to Charlotte later in the year to check back in with some of the people you heard from today to see how their views on the election are evolving. Click the audio link above to hear the full piece. The following are some additional voices of other Mecklenburg County residents and their thoughts on the upcoming election. Education Wes Lawson is the 34-year-old campus director for The Iron Yard, a technology education business based at Packard Place. \"I'm not hearing enough about how we are actually going to improve access to quality education and funding,\" Lawson says. \"I'm not a single-issue voter, but I would put [education] as one of the top issues. For me, education is a workforce development necessity, it's a national security necessity, it's a quality-of-life issue.\" And like Dan Roselli, Lawson is not as concerned with social issues. \"[We] need a government that's going to improve transportation, clean air, clean water. ... I don't need a moral voice of reason coming from an elected official,\" he says. A strip mall sits just a block away from Central Avenue in East Charlotte, N.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Logan Cyrus for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Children Colette Forrest is the primary principal at People's Voice Management Group, doing marketing and publicity for businesses. She's a single mother and says she wants to hear some optimism for the future from candidates. She wants her 8-year-old son to be able to \"further his education in an affordable school system for college and graduate school and doctorate. That he can find gainful employment after he's finished. If he wants to be an entrepreneur, he can have opportunities that are boundless,\" Forrest says. She says recent police shootings of unarmed black men have her thinking about her son's safety. \"We've had those conversations.\" She tells her son, \"Don't do anything threatening, don't be perceived as a threat, and most importantly keep quiet and tell them you need to call your mommy.\" Forrest says no candidates are talking about that issue. The Right Message For The Right Audience Vanessa Faura ran for Charlotte City Council at-large but lost. She now works as a consultant. When it comes to the issue of immigration and whether Republican candidates are offering solutions, Faura says they're breaking down a complex issue for their varying audiences. \"Part of campaigning, I believe, is you've got to make yourself believable and likeable, and unfortunately in this world you're not going to be likeable to everyone,\" Faura says. She says candidates say what crowds want to hear, when the reality is more complicated. \"That's why Donald Trump is saying what he's saying. This is why Jeb Bush is saying the total opposite. At the end of the day, I know every single one of them on the Republican and Democratic side, they know it's a lot more complex issue.\"",

President-elect Donald Trump says he will double the nation's growth rate during his time in office. That promise will be difficult to keep. Trump isn't talking about a temporary boost in growth. He says he can make the economy grow in the long term at a rate of about 4 percent a year. Most economists think America's potential growth is only about 2 percent, and most agree the best way to make it higher is to get more people working and make those workers more productive. Stimulating the economy with government spending or tax cuts will only boost short-term growth and cause inflation. But right now, getting more people into the labor force is a challenge. For one, it means fighting a demographic tide. \"We have a huge wave of baby-boom era people retiring,\" says Robert J. Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University and author of The Rise and Fall of American Growth. \"Right now, we've got a shortage of construction workers. We've got a shortage of long-distance truck drivers. We've got a shortage of many kinds of skilled workers needed to work in manufacturing.\" Gordon says bringing immigrants into the workforce is the best way to deal with this mass retirement of baby boomers. In the past couple of decades, half the growth in the labor force has come from immigration. But, Gordon points out, Trump has said he will deport millions of immigrants. \"They're called illegal immigrants, and they're here illegally,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN. \"They're going to have to go, and they're going to have to come back in legally, and otherwise, we don't have a country.\" Those were chilling words for Jose Aguiluz, a 27-year-old operating room nurse at Adventist Hospital in suburban Washington, D.C. \"His rhetoric was very negative during the election, but now he has to contemplate and analyze reality,\" Aguiluz says. Aguiluz came to the U.S. at age 15 for a lifesaving surgery after a car accident in his native Honduras. After the surgery, he and most of his family stayed illegally. Then, in 2014, President Obama issued an executive order that provided two-year deportation deferments for young immigrants like Aguiluz. Trump says he will rescind that order. If he could talk to Trump, Aguiluz says, here's what he would say. \"I am a very contributing individual in the American society,\" he says. \"I save American lives in the OR. They don't care about my immigration status. They don't care if I'm a Latino. What they care is that I'm a very capable nurse that will carry them through the surgery.\" In fact, about one-quarter of all the doctors and nurses in the U.S. are immigrants. Stephen Moore, who has advised Trump on his economic growth policy, says Trump isn't against immigration, just illegal immigration. Personally, Moore says he believes even some of those workers who are in the country illegally shouldn't be deported. \"People who are in this country, are working, and productive Americans who are contributing, I personally would not like to see those people deported,\" says Moore, who is also an economic consultant with FreedomWorks, the grass-roots organization that helped launch the Tea Party. He also argues that a faster growing economy will not only provide jobs for the unemployed but will attract others back into the labor force, including some retirees. Most economists are skeptical that could provide enough workers to get to a 4 percent growth rate. In terms of making workers more productive, Moore says big tax cuts for businesses will boost investment in new equipment and technologies, such as autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence. \"We could see very rapid rises in the productivity that ... is a key part to making growth possible,\" Moore says. But Gordon, who has studied innovation, believes it will be several decades before those two technologies have much impact on U.S. productivity. And he notes that neither the big Reagan tax cuts nor the big Bush tax cuts boosted U.S. productivity.",

With Donald Trump's choices for secretaries of transportation and of housing and urban development \u2014 Elaine Chao and Dr. Ben Carson, respectively \u2014 there may be hints about the urban agenda Trump's administration may be shaping. Some big-city mayors say they're worried about potential cuts in federal funding that candidate Trump warned about on the stump, and they are reaching out to the president-elect. They say they have plenty of ideas they want to share about the country's cities. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a former chief of staff to President Obama, met Wednesday with Trump, at Trump's invitation. It gave Emanuel a chance to hand-deliver a letter from mayors of some of the country's largest cities. The letter asks Trump to continue the Obama administration policy that prevents the deportation of so-called DREAMers \u2014 young immigrants who came to the United States before they were 16 years old and so named for meeting the requirements under the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act proposal that would have created a pathway to citizenship for them. \"We are clear as mayors that these are DREAMers who are seeking the American dream, and we should embrace them rather than do a bait-and-switch,\" Emanuel says. During his campaign, Trump said he would reverse protections, but recently he said he would work to find a solution for DREAMers. He made another related promise, though, in a campaign speech on immigration last August that has many mayors concerned. \"Block funding for sanctuary cities,\" Trump told a cheering crowd in Phoenix. \"We block the funding, no more funding.\" Hundreds of so-called sanctuary cities across the country limit their cooperation with federal authorities when it comes to people who are in the country illegally. Trump warned during his speech that cities that refused to cooperate would not receive taxpayer dollars, and his administration would work with Congress to pass legislation to protect jurisdictions that do assist the federal government's deportation efforts. Authorities in San Francisco say their policy will stay intact. City Attorney Dennis Herrera says San Francisco receives about $1 billion a year from the federal government \u2014 though he is quick to note that plenty of tax dollars flow from his city and state to Washington. \"There may be possible avenues that the federal government will take under President-elect Trump, but we're going to wait and see what happens,\" Herrera says. \"And I have every confidence that when you look at what we contribute and what we're legally entitled to, that we're going to be able to keep the vast majority of the dollars that we have been receiving.\" During the presidential campaign, Trump painted a dark picture of many of the country's cities. He called Chicago a gang-infested war zone, he blasted Democratic mayors \u2014 the leaders of a majority of the country's largest cities \u2014 and had harsh words about inner cities, calling them \"a disaster, educationwise, jobwise, safetywise in every way possible.\" Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett, a Republican who heads the U.S. Conference of Mayors, says he thinks these comments about some urban areas were part of Trump's campaign and his effort to woo rural voters. Cornett says his 1,400 members consider cities the key to economic growth and innovation. Nearly two-thirds of Americans live in cities, and Cornett says he doesn't have any reason to believe that Trump won't stand up for cities. \"He grew up in New York City; he's generally always lived in cities; he's invested in cities,\" Cornett says. When it comes to an urban agenda under a Trump administration, Cornett says, the U.S. Conference of Mayors thinks priorities should include rebuilding crumbling roads and water systems, affordable housing, and public transit and safety. The president-elect has promised $1 trillion to rebuild the country's infrastructure, but he has provided few details. Critics call it a potential boondoggle that would benefit investors and could lead to higher fees and more toll roads. Meanwhile, some cities are making sure they have federal funds in hand before President Obama leaves office. Rolf Pendall, co-director of the Metropolitan Housing and Communities Policy Center at the Urban Institute, says cities are under constant pressure to do more with less and have had to be creative as federal funds shrink. He says that could soon be a reality again. \"But I think it is too early to say that everyone should be panicking,\" Pendall says. \"Instead, the undefined nature of the urban agenda of the next administration leaves an opportunity to develop a clear picture.\" Leaders with the U.S. Conference of Mayors invited Trump to meet with them \u2014 without success \u2014 during the campaign. They're now hoping to make the case that investments in their cities benefit the entire country.",

The new president-elect says he'll follow through on building a wall \u2014 and deporting millions of people. Updated at 7:30 p.m. ET He'll build a border wall and he'll deport millions of people who are in the U.S. illegally, President-elect Donald Trump says, promising to keep his campaign pledges on immigration in his first prolonged interview since winning the White House. Saying that his administration will deport \"probably 2 million\" \u2014 and possibly 3 million \u2014 people who are in the country illegally, Trump told 60 Minutes' Lesley Stahl that he wants to secure the border. Trump also seemed willing to consider the plan some of his fellow Republicans have aired, of securing some parts of the border with a fence. The interview with Trump aired on CBS Sunday night; it also includes members of his family. The interview was taped Friday at Trump's Fifth Avenue residence in New York City. It comes after days of anti-Trump protests in more than a dozen American cities, where demonstrators have criticized the incoming president's immigration stance. On another campaign promise, Trump affirmed his plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. But Trump also wants to keep some parts of the plan. For instance, he told Stahl that he'll maintain coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, \"because it happens to be one of the strongest assets\" of the plan. Trump also said he wants to keep a portion of the law that covers children living with their parents for an extended period. As for how the change from one sphere of coverage to another might work, Trump promised it would be smooth, saying, \"We're going to do it simultaneously. It'll be just fine. That's what I do. I do a good job. You know, I mean, I know how to do this stuff.\" He continued: \"We're going to repeal it and replace it. And we're not going to have, like, a two-day period and we're not going to have a two-year period where there's nothing. It will be repealed and replaced. I mean, you'll know. And it'll be great health care for much less money.\" Here's what Trump told 60 Minutes when he was asked about undocumented immigrants in the U.S.: \"What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records \u2014 gang members, drug dealers \u2014 we have a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million. We're getting them out of our country or we're going to incarcerate. But we're getting them out of our country, they're here illegally. \"After the border is secured, and after everything gets normalized, we're going to make a determination on the people that you're talking about \u2014 who are terrific people, they're terrific people. But we're going to make a determination ... but before we make that determination, Leslie, it's very important, we're going to secure our border.\" For comparison purposes, we'll note that in President Obama's first term, his administration carried out a record 1.5 million deportations \u2014 including more than 400,000 in fiscal year 2012. The figure declined to 235,413 in fiscal year 2015, and as NPR's Scott Horsley reported this summer, the Obama administration has shifted its focus to deporting criminals, people caught near the border, and those who recently came to the country without securing documents. As Scott Horsley noted in a review of recent U.S. immigration policy, the rate of deportations went up under Obama, just as it had under the previous two presidents. And Trump took notice, back in August. \"What people don't know is that Obama got tremendous numbers of people out of the country,\" Trump told Fox News' Bill O'Reilly. \"Bush, the same thing. Lots of people were brought out of the country with the existing laws. Well, I'm going to do the same thing.\" The plan for a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico is Trump's new facet in immigration policy. Here's his exchange with Stahl, discussing the idea: \"Are you really going to build a wall?\" Stahl asks. \"Yes,\" Trump says. \"They're talking about a fence in the Republican Congress. Would you accept a fence?\" \"For certain areas I would \u2014 but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. I'm very good at this, it's called construction.\" \"So, part wall, part fence? \"Yeah, it could be some fencing.\" In the course of the interview, Trump remained noncommittal on several topics that informed his campaign. Asked about his personal views on same-sex marriage, Trump said, \"It's irrelevant, because it was already settled. It's law. It was settled in the Supreme Court. I mean, it's done.\" And when pressed on the fears felt by African-Americans, American Muslims and other minorities since the election, Trump dismissed the anxieties as products of the media. \"I think it's built up by the press because, frankly, they'll take every single little incident that they can find in this country, which could've been there before. If I weren't even around doing this, and they'll make into an event because that's the way the press is.\" As for the dozens of acts of harassment and intimidation against minorities that have been reported this week, many of which were allegedly performed in his name, Trump said he's surprised to hear of them. \"I'm so saddened to hear that,\" he said. \"And I say, stop it. If it \u2014 if it helps, I will say this and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it.\"",

Harris, who's African-American and South Asian-American, is the first biracial woman elected to the Senate. Kamala Harris, Catherine Cortez Masto and Rep. Tammy Duckworth made historic inroads on Election Day, becoming, respectively, the first biracial woman in the Senate, the first Latina senator, and the first Thailand-born senator. And in the House of Representatives, Pramila Jayapal of Washington state was one of several candidates of Indian origin to claim office, in a group that includes Harris (whose mother is an Indian-American) and new House members Ro Khanna of California and Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois. All are Democrats. In Minnesota, Ilhan Omar also wrote her name in the history books, winning a state race to become the first Somali-American legislator in the U.S. With their historic overtones, the three U.S. Senate wins by Harris, Masto and Duckworth \u2014 in California, Nevada, and Illinois \u2014 highlighted the good news for Democrats on a day when they'd been hoping to put the first woman in the White House. After last night's surprising loss to Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton \u2014 who claimed a lead in the popular vote Wednesday morning \u2014 spoke about her hope of breaking \"that highest and hardest glass ceiling\" in the White House, adding, \"But someday, someone will.\" Clinton also said: \"To all the little girls who are watching this: Never doubt that you are valuable, and powerful, and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams.\" In Illinois last night, Duckworth \"defeated Republican incumbent Mark Kirk for the U.S. Senate seat once held by President Barack Obama,\" as member station WBEZ reports. \"Duckworth, a veteran who lost both legs when the helicopter she was co-piloting was shot down in Iraq, ran campaign ads about Kirk's exaggerations of his military experience,\" the station adds. Retaliating during a late-October debate, Kirk sought to deflate the impression of Duckworth's heritage and service by saying, \"I'd forgotten that your parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George Washington.\" It was quickly pointed out to Kirk that while Duckworth's mother is a Thai immigrant of Chinese heritage, her father is a World War II veteran who \"traces his heritage back to the American Revolution,\" as NPR's Jessica Taylor reported. Kirk later apologized, but the damage was done. For Harris, 52, her Senate victory is the latest round of \"firsts\" \u2014 she was already California's first woman, African-American, and South Asian-American to be attorney general. On Tuesday night, she beat out Rep. Loretta Sanchez in the fight to succeed the retiring Sen. Barbara Boxer. \"I intend to fight for a state that has the largest number of immigrants documented and undocumented of any state in this country and do everything we can to bring them justice and dignity and fairness under the law and pass comprehensive immigration reform,\" Harris said, according to member station KPCC. Harris and Sanchez, both Democrats, faced each other on Election Day because of California's new law that puts the top two vote-getters from the primary season on the ballot, regardless of party affiliation. Harris will become the second African-American woman to serve in the Senate, following Sen. Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, who served in the 1990s. When she reaches the Senate, Harris will be joined by another former state attorney general \u2014 Nevada's Cortez Masto, who \"won a nail biter Senate race and will keep the seat of retiring Sen. Harry Reid in Democratic hands,\" as member station KUNR in Reno reports. Masto defeated Rep. Joe Heck, a Republican who's a three-term veteran of Congress \u2014 and who dropped his support for the now-President-elect Donald Trump one month ago, after an audio recording emerged in which Trump talking about groping women. Masto's campaign \"framed her as a 'bipartisan problem solver' independent of the polarizing Reid who has held the seat since the 1980's,\" KUNR reports. In Minneapolis, Omar, 34, won the District 60B seat in the Minnesota House of Representatives. Last night, she began her victory speech by recalling how she used to attend caucuses with her grandfather, serving as his interpreter. Wearing a white headscarf, she promised to speak for marginalized citizens during her tenure. \"I think I bring the voice of young people,\" she said, according to member station Minnesota Public Radio. \"I think I bring the voice of women in the East African community. I bring the voice of Muslims. I bring the voice of young mothers looking for opportunities.\" As she spoke, Omar's husband and children looked on. Of Omar, MPR reports: \"While her election wasn't a surprise in a reliably Democratic district \u2014 she was elected by almost 80 percent of the vote there \u2014 it carried huge symbolic importance in Minnesota, home to the nation's largest Somali immigrant population. It came just days after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump ripped Somali immigration as a threat to Minnesota.\"",

On the final night of the Republican National Convention last month, as Donald Trump formally accepted his party's nomination for president, my Code Switch co-host Shereen Marisol Meraji fired off a tweet about how unnerved she was watching Trump's address, with its angry denunciations of Muslims and Mexican immigrants. \"This speech is difficult to listen to as a Latina and an Iranian,\" she wrote. \"So much fear-mongering.\" Another NPR colleague \u2014 a person of color, and a friend \u2014 quickly texted her and told her the tweet might be inappropriate, work-wise. Shereen considered it, and took her tweet down. But then she took to Twitter to pose a question that a lot of journalists have been wondering about during this heady, racially charged summer \u2014 and particularly those of us of who are reporters of color: How do we address this critically without being labeled partisan? Is there precedent to understand how to do this as journalists of color? A lot of Twitter folks responded that journalists should simply strive to share the facts and be objective, and that the truth will out. But others, including several journalists, hopped in the conversation to point out that that advice, however well-intentioned, oversimplifies some very complex reader-audience dynamics. How someone hears a story is inextricable from who they are, but also from the notions they have about who the storyteller is. Black reporters and Latino reporters are often especially sensitive to the idea that the work they do on their beats \u2014 especially if race is heavily implicated in what they cover, like policing or immigration policy \u2014 is less than fair or rigorous. This episode we spoke with: That's what we're getting into on this week's episode of the podcast, which happens to coincide with a huge joint convention of black and Latino journalists in Washington D.C. Shereen and I talk to Pilar Marrero and Wesley Lowery, who are both on news beats where race is central \u2014 but they've come to some very different conclusions about what fairness and truth look like in how they cover those beats. Lowery, a reporter at the Washington Post who covers race and justice issues, told us that he's uncomfortable describing an individual as \"racist,\" in large part because the response to the story then tends to get bogged down in arguments about whether the use of that term was fair or not. He tends to describe specific policies or actions as racist instead. \"I do think it's our job to say true things,\" he said. \"But I also think...that people might be more amenable to a conversation \u2014 especially the type of people you're trying to convince that this is true \u2014 might be more amenable to [the idea that a specific policy has disparate racial effects].\" But Pilar Marrero, a veteran political reporter who now writes for the Spanish language news site La Opinion, has no problem using that kind of pointed language when referring to Donald Trump. \"To be clear, we don't call [Trump] a racist just because he looks racist,\" she said. \"We call him a racist because he says racist things, he promotes racist policies and he retweets white supremacist Twitter accounts.\" And as she pointed out, since her readership is primarily Latino \u2014 a group among whom Trump is enormously unpopular \u2014 they are far less likely to be bothered by that characterization of Trump than the Post's mostly white readership might. You can check out our lively conversation with Pilar and Wesley at NPR's podcast directory, and on iTunes and other places podcasts are found.",

And share your comments with us on Twitter at @NPRCodeSwitch or via email at codeswitch@npr.org. It's the Fourth of July... err, was (#CPT) and it has us over at Code Switch thinking a lot about flags. More specifically, on this week's episode of the podcast, we've been thinking about people of color and their relationship to the United States flag \u2014 a relationship that can be really complicated for a lot of reasons. Who is the American flag for? And what does it mean when people of color choose to wave it \u2014 or not wave it? In thinking about what the flag has represented symbolically, and whose freedoms it did \u2014 and didn't \u2014 fly for, those questions seem to be messy ones. Gene and Adrian talked to some folks of color who both choose to and choose not to wave the American flag. That includes American Indians, who proportionately have more people in the U.S. military than any other racial group \u2014 there were over 22,000 on active duty in 2012, with over 150,000 veterans \u2014 but who also, of course, have a long complicated history in the United States. American Indian tribes sing to the American flag, and these aren't just throw away songs. Flag songs open tribal ceremonies, and are directed at both tribal flags and the stars and stripes. But they commemorate not so much the nation, but their people. This episode, we spoke with: Adrian also takes us to a rally for Donald Trump where Gil Sanchez was protesting the candidate while waving a Mexican flag. Sanchez participated in the historic immigrant rights rallies in 2006. \"It doesn't matter what happens. If they hate Mexicans, they're going to hate Mexicans, whether you're carrying an American flag or a Mexican flag,\" says Sanchez. \"That's my feeling. They already hate us, the ones that hate us.\" For the people who historically have not been part of the promise the flag represents, pledging allegiance or waving the flag becomes a complicated act. So join us for this episode as we unpack what the American flag means \u2014 and doesn't mean \u2014 for people of color.",

As the Supreme Court's term comes to an end, here are some takeaways: The signal event in the 2015-2016 term was not a decision but a death. The court lost its longest-serving current member, Antonin Scalia, who died in February at age 79. Scalia had been appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986 and had long been the court's intellectual anchor on the right. Scalia strove to read the Constitution as written and resisted efforts to expand its meaning or intent. His absence from a closely divided court led to a number of 4-4 ties, which allowed the last decision by lower courts to stand. Harder to quantify was the difference Scalia's absence made to the other justices' thinking and decision making. The loss of a clear-cut conservative majority turned some of the biggest cases of the year into dogs that didn't bark. Some conservative legal activists had anticipated several high-impact victories in this term. They hoped to affirm restrictions on clinics providing abortions, knock out affirmative action in college admissions and permit states to count only eligible voters when apportioning their legislatures. They also saw a chance to free public employees such as teachers who oppose unionizing from the costs of collective bargaining. But with Scalia gone, the court could not muster the votes to accomplish any of these ends. Some of the cases may return to the court once all its seats are filled, but the missed opportunity and loss of Scalia were both keenly felt. Justice Anthony Kennedy continued to frustrate conservatives with his votes and opinions in high profile cases. Kennedy joined the court in 1988 as another Reagan appointee. But he has often been a swing vote, and in June he voted to strike down parts of an anti-abortion law and also wrote the decision allowing the use of race as a factor in college admissions. Kennedy had also been a focal point at the end of the last court term, when he wrote the decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide. Kennedy will soon be 80, but has given no evidence he is considering retirement. His pivotal positioning between left and right has made him the deciding vote so often that some call this \"the Kennedy Court.\" President Obama lost what may have been his last big Supreme Court battle in office. The Democratic president has fared better in cases before the high court than might have been expected, largely because Chief Justice John Roberts has sided with the White House twice on major challenges to Obamacare. But Obama's executive action deferring deportations for up to five million people in the country illegally was shelved when the Court deadlocked 4-4 on a challenge brought by Texas and other states. Obama had previously deferred deportation for millions of residents brought to the country illegally when they were children. That \"dreamers\" program is still in effect, but Obama's attempt to broaden the protected category of family members was struck down in a federal district court in Texas in 2014. That judge's ruling, since affirmed by a federal appeals court, froze the president's action and remains in effect. But the Court is expected to revisit the issue when it has a full complement of justices. It is not clear when the Scalia vacancy will be filled. To date, Senate Republicans have refused to consider Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to succeed Scalia. They say the next president should name Scalia's successor, and the voters should have a chance to weigh in first. Unless the Senate relents \u2014 which it might after the election \u2014 the seat will remain vacant into the new year. A new president would be able to nominate someone after Inauguration Day (Jan. 20) but it would be weeks or months before the Senate held hearings or debated or voted. So the next court term could well be short-handed throughout. That has led the justices to accept fewer cases and avoid putting major issues on the docket for 2016-2017. The Court's liberal bloc held, with the four Democratic appointees generally together on major issues. This was especially empowering on a short-handed court, as four votes guaranteed no worse than a tie. In some cases, this protected lower court rulings or older precedents the liberal bloc supported (as in the case of public union dues). But even where the 4-4 tie left in place rulings the liberals would have preferred to overturn, it was not a 5-4 decision setting a new and long-lasting national precedent. There were liberal defections on some criminal cases, as when Justice Stephen Breyer sided with the majority to allow evidence from an unconstitutional arrest to be used against the arrestee, who was found to have an outstanding warrant. (Strieff). Several major cases were decided unanimously or with a single dissenting vote. Chief Justice John Roberts dislikes the image of a divided court, which tends to dilute the court's authority. In this term, the justices were unanimous in vacating the conviction of former Virginia governor Robert McDonnell and in upholding the \"one person one vote\" principle and existing precedent in political apportionment (Evenwel). The court also agreed without dissent to kick the issue of contraception coverage under Obamacare back to lower courts (Zubik). Two other cases on the list below were decided with just one dissenting vote, cast by Justice Clarence Thomas in a jury-bias case and Justice Samuel Alito in a death penalty case. Here is a rundown on the 14 cases NPR paid the most attention to this year: 1. Abortion: Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt Vote: 5-3 Dissenters: Justices John Roberts (Chief), Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas In the most sweeping abortion decision in nearly 25 years, the Court struck down two provisions of a Texas abortion law, declaring them unconstitutional. The Texas law HB2 \u2014 which State Sen. Wendy Davis famously filibustered in her pink tennis shoes \u2014 required abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, and it required the clinics to comply with several hospital-level standards. While the law was purportedly enacted to protect the health and safety of women, the Court majority, led by Justice Stephen Breyer, found to the contrary, arguing that the law \"provides few, if any, health benefits for women, poses a substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions, and constitutes an 'undue burden' on their constitutional right to do so.\" When the Texas law came into effect, it cut the number of abortion facilities in half, from about 40 to about 20, requiring women to travel further distances to get an abortion. Reproductive rights advocates rejoiced in the result, whole pro-choice activists lamented and scratched their heads at Justice Kennedy's vote, cast with the Court's liberal stalwarts. As for laws similar to HB2 in other states, if they include the same provisions nixed here, \"they're dead.\" 2. Affirmative Action: Fisher v. University of Texas Vote: 4-3 Dissenters: Justices Samuel Alito, John Roberts (Chief), and Clarence Thomas, Recused: Justice Elena Kagan The high court upheld affirmative action in college admissions in a landmark decision affirming that that race can be used as a factor to promote campus diversity. Writing for the Court, Justice Kennedy said that, \"Considerable deference is owed to a university in defining those intangible characteristics, like student body diversity, that are central to its identity and educational mission.\" However, he noted, race is \"but a factor of a factor of a factor,\" or just a piece of the admissions pie. Confounding court observers, this is the first time Justice Kennedy has voted to uphold a race-conscious program. This was Fisher's second trip to the Supreme Court. The litigation stretches back to 2008, when Abigail Fisher, a white prospective student, sued UT, claiming that the school's university program disadvantaged her. Her case was brought by Edward Blum, an activist and litigant known for challenging race-based policies. While they were disappointed by the Court's decision, Blum and other opponents of race-conscious programs find a silver lining in cases pending in federal district courts. One accuses Harvard of using an illegal racial quota against Asian-American applicants, and a similar suit challenges the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill for using racial preferences in the consideration of candidates. Both lawsuits are brought by Students for Fair Admissions, Inc., a nonprofit advocacy group representing students who are rejected from major colleges, headed by Blum. 3. Immigration: United States v. Texas Vote: 4-4 The justices deadlocked on President Obama's program to give temporary work permits to as many as five million undocumented immigrants whose children are American citizens, or are otherwise in the country legally. The 4-to-4 tie is effectively a \"non-decision,\" meaning that the lower court ruling that invalidated the program remains, at least for now. While this vote killed the Obama program, a future president may decide to revive it. The nine-word, one-page decision comes as a big blow to immigrant rights advocates, as work authorizations will be revoked for millions, effective immediately. Opponents of the executive action applauded the opinion, believing that Obama overstepped the bounds of presidential power into lawmaking. Regardless, the issue will be front-and-center in the heated race for the White House. 4. Unions: Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association Vote: 4-4 In a victory for organized labor, a split Supreme Court effectively ruled that public employees who are not union members may be required to pay \"fair-share\" fees for the union's collective bargaining activities. This upheld an earlier high court ruling of a generation ago allowing such fees. Anti-union activists brought the case in California \u2014 where 325,000 teachers statewide are unionized across 1,000 school districts \u2014 arguing that the fees impose an unconstitutional subsidy that violates their First Amendment rights of free speech and association. As NPR reported when the case was decided, only nine percent of the teachers in the 1,000 districts have not joined the union, but because the law requires the union contract to cover them, they must pay to cover the cost of negotiating the basic contractual benefits they reap, such as wages and leave policies. Non-members do not have to pay for union lobbying or political activities. Although Friedrichs in effect upheld an older precedent, the issue remains a political lightning rod, galvanizing both union proponents and opponents. And the 4-4 tie leaves the door open to a future challenge before a full nine-justice Court. 5. Contraception: Zubik v. Burwell Vote: 8-0 In a unanimous ruling, the Supreme Court announced that it would not rule on a challenge to contraception coverage under Obamacare, kicking the case back to the lower courts to strike a compromise. Sidestepping the constitutional question of whether Obamacare's contraceptive mandate substantially interfered with some the religious rights of some groups, the Court sent the government and faith-based organizations back to hash out a plan that accommodated \"religious exercise while at the same time ensuring that women covered by their health plans received full and equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage.\" As NPR reported in May, the case concerned an accommodation offered to religious organizations, such as schools and hospitals, which object to providing their workers with insurance coverage for contraception. While the Affordable Care Act does not require religiously affiliated employers to provide contraceptives to their employees, it does mandate that they inform the government of their objection to the contraceptive coverage. That provider would then pay for the coverage. The faith-based organizations challenging the government argued that providing the compulsory notice violated their religious beliefs, making them complicit in sinful conduct. In a rare move for the Court, the justice's \"decision not to decide\" sought to mediate \u2014 rather than adjudicate \u2014 the dispute, proposing that the government may arrange to provide coverage to employees without requiring notice or action from the organizations. A resolution of this nature would likely require new federal regulations. 6. Voting Rights: Evenwel v. Abbott Vote: 8-0 Concurrence: Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, voting with the majority, but for different reasoning In a unanimous opinion, the Supreme Court held that states may draw their legislative districts based on total population, instead of the number of eligible voters. Writing for the Court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg upheld the \"one person, one vote\" bedrock principle of the American political system, citing constitutional history, the Court's decisions and longstanding practice. The Court had long said that electoral districts must have roughly equal populations, but this is the first time that it affirmatively stated that this meant the same number of people, as opposed to eligible voters only. The ruling largely affirmed earlier precedent and the status quo. Counting all people in an electoral district boosts the political power of areas with large numbers of inhabitants who cannot legally vote, including non-citizen immigrants, undocumented immigrants and children. The decision came as a setback to conservative activists, who brought the challenge in Texas, and the Project on Fair Representation, the right-wing group led by Edward Blum that successfully challenged a key provision of the Voting Rights Act in 2013. 7. Juvenile Justice: Montgomery v. Louisiana Vote: 6-3 Dissenters: Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito The Supreme Court offered reprieve to as many as 2,000 people serving mandatory prison terms of life without parole for homicides they committed as minors. This decision expands an earlier 2012 ruling, in which the justices banned lifelong sentences for juvenile murderers. In an uncommon move, the Court held that the 2012 ban must be applied retroactively, meaning that hundreds of inmates sentenced to automatic life terms for crimes they committed in their youth may have a chance for early release. The ruling encourages states not to find a new sentence to replace the ones struck down, but rather to consider granting parole, or release from behind bars, conditional on future behavior. 8. Capital Punishment:Hurst v. Florida Vote: 8-1 Dissenter: Justice Samuel Alito In an 8 to 1 vote, the U.S. Supreme Court in January struck down part of Florida's capital punishment system, casting doubt on the status of the state's nearly 400 people on death row. The Florida law allowed non-unanimous juries in capital cases to recommend death sentences or life in prison without parole, but it left final sentencing to a judge, who is charged with finding facts and independently weighing both aggravating and mitigating factors before entering a sentence of life or death. Judges can and do disregard the jury's recommendation, called an \"advisory sentence.\" As NPR reported in January, since Florida's death penalty law was enacted in 1972, judges have ignored the jury's advisories some 300 times, imposing either the harsher penalty of death or the lesser penalty of life. Writing for the Court majority, Justice Sotomayor declared the state's procedure unconstitutional, saying said that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial \"requires a jury and not a judge to find each fact necessary to impose a sentence of death.\" \"A jury's mere recommendation is not enough,\" she wrote. 9. Jury Selection: Foster v. Chatman Vote: 7-1 Dissenter: Justice Clarence Thomas The Court declared that Georgia prosecutors unconstitutionally and deliberately expelled blacks from the jury in a capital case, leaving an all-white panel to determine the destiny of a black defendant accused of killing a white woman. Evidence of racial discrimination came in the form of incriminating prosecutor's documents, including a jury list with each black prospective juror highlighted in green with \"B\" printed next to it, alongside a legend showing that highlighting \"represents Blacks.\" While this case was widely seen as an opportunity for the justices to call out blatant prosecutorial misconduct, the Court announced no clear rules, and proponents of criminal justice reform are not holding their breath. For now, former Justice Potter Stewart's famous definition of obscenity will be taken to apply to racial discrimination in jury selection: \"I know it when I see it.\" 10. Police Stops: Utah v. Strieiff Vote: 5-3 Dissenters: Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan The Supreme Court ruled in June that police who illegally stop a person on the street for no stated reason can check for an outstanding warrant, and if they find one, they can conduct a search and use evidence they find to prosecute. As NPR reported in June, the high court has long held that when law enforcement officials illegally stop or search someone without at least minimum reasonable suspicion, any incriminating evidence they find cannot be used in court. But there are exceptions to this rule, and in this case the Court carved out a new and big one, giving police far greater power to search people who were stopped without cause. The decision came in the case of Edward Strieff who was stopped after exiting a house that was under police watch, based on an anonymous tip that it was a site of drug activity. Though narcotics detective Douglas Fackrell later admitted he had no reason to believe Strieff had done anything wrong, he demanded Streiff's identification, and detained him while calling a police dispatcher to see if there were any outstanding warrants against Strieff. When the dispatcher told Fackrell about his traffic violation, the officer arrested and searched Streiff, finding methamphetamines. The Court reasoned that evidence seized from an unconstitutional stop was admissible, because there was a valid, pre-existing warrant for arrest, and because the discovery of the warrant weakened the connection between the stop and the evidence. In a barn-burning dissent, Justice Sotomayor said that the decision will allow police \u2014 as in this case \u2014 to stop someone on a mere \"whim or hunch\" and then leverage that stop to conduct a search, if the officer gets lucky and the person they stop has an outstanding warrant. She scoffed at the majority's statement that there was nothing systematic about this stop. \"We must not pretend that the countless people who are routinely targeted by police are 'isolated,'\" she said, citing to state and federal databases, showing that there are more than 7.8 million outstanding warrants, the vast majority of which are for minor violations. 11. Public Corruption: McDonnell v. United States Vote: 8-0 In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court threw out the bribery convictions of Bob McDonnell, a former Republican governor of Virginia, contending that the government used an excessively overbroad definition of an \"official act\" of government in the corruption case it brought against him. McDonnell was convicted of leveraging the power of his political office to help Jonnie Williams, a businessman who showered the governor with loans, vacations and luxury products in excess of $175,000. The gifts themselves were legal, and the question before the court was whether they were part of an unethical bargain in which McDonnell used his public position to help Williams. Despite calling McDonnell's acceptance of the gifts \"distasteful,\" Chief Justice Roberts argued that arranging meetings, talking with other officials, or hosting events about Antabloc, Williams' tobacco-related nutritional supplement, does not \u2014 without more \u2014 rise to the level of an \"official act,\" because McDonnell took no action or decision in exchange for the gifts. \"Our concern is not with tawdry tales of Ferraris, Rolexes, and ball gowns,\" he wrote for the Court. \"It is instead with the broader legal implications of the Government's boundless interpretation of the federal bribery statute. A more limited interpretation of the term 'official act' leaves ample room for prosecuting corruption.\" This decision is widely viewed as making it harder to convict politicians on corruption charges, and the verdict comes as good news for public officials, like New Jersey Sen. Robert Menenedez, a Democrat, who is awaiting an appeals court ruling in a corruption case. 12.Political Speech: Heffernan v. City of Paterson Vote: 6-2 Dissent: Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito In April, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that if an employer demotes an employee for his or her political activity, that employee can challenge the demotion on First Amendment grounds, even if the employer's actions are based on a factual mistake about the employee's behavior. As NPR reported, the case was brought by Jeffrey Heffernan, a 20-year-old veteran of the Paterson, N.J. police force, who was promoted to detective in 2005. Later, during the 2006 mayoral campaign, someone stole a yard sign from his mother's front lawn, and she asked Heffernan for a replacement. She supported the mayor's opponent. When he was off-duty, Heffernan went to pick up the sign for her at the challenger's campaign office, where he was spotted holding the sign and speaking with campaign staff. The police chief's office caught wind of the incident, and assumed \u2014 incorrectly \u2014 that Heffernan was supporting the mayor's opponent. Upon returning home, he got a call that he was downgraded from his plum assignment in the police chief's office to the walking squad. Writing for the six-justice majority, Justice Breyer sided with Heffernan, holding that the central issue is the government's motive in demoting an employee for expressing political views that it may disagree with, so it doesn't matter whether the motive is based on facts or a mistake. \"The constitutional harm,\" he concluded, \"is the same.\" 13. Judicial Ethics: Williams v. Pennsylvania Vote: 5-3 Dissenters: Chief Justice John Roberts, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas For the first time, the Supreme Court ruled that judges must recuse themselves from reviewing cases in which they had a prior significant role. By a vote of 5 to 3, the high court in June decided that a Pennsylvania judge's personal involvement as a prosecutor in an earlier case presented an impermissible risk of actual bias, depriving the defendant of a fair hearing and denying the due process of law guaranteed by the constitution. The decision came in the case of Terrance Williams \u2014 a victim of beatings in his youth and sexual abuse from neighbors and older men \u2014 who was convicted in the brutal killing of a church deacon. The district attorney of Philadelphia at the time was Ronald Castille, who personally authorized seeking the death penalty in prosecuting Williams. Later, while campaigning for a seat on the state Supreme Court, Castille declared that he had secured 45 death sentences as DA, including that of Williams. As NPR reported in June, a state judge held an evidentiary hearing of the case and set aside the death sentence on grounds of prosecutorial misconduct, concluding that the DA's office hid mitigating evidence that the deacon had sexually molested Williams. The state appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, where Castille was serving as chief justice. Despite a motion from the defense to disqualify himself, Castille refused to step off the case. The court reinstated Williams's death penalty by a unanimous vote. In June, the Supreme Court threw out that decision, giving Williams a shot at a new trial. Justice Kennedy, writing for the majority, announced that \"an unconstitutional potential for bias exists when the same person serves as both accuser and adjudicator.\" Castille, he concluded, could not be a neutral arbiter as both Williams's prosecutor and his judge. 14. Guns: Voisine v. United States Vote: 6-2 Dissenters: Justices Clarence Thomas and Sonia Sotomayor The Court ruled that reckless domestic assaults constitute a \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" that trigger restrictions on gun ownership. Per examples provided by Justice Elena Kagan, if someone engages in risky behavior \u2014 such as throwing a plate at a wall near a spouse, or slamming a door in the face of girlfriend or boyfriend close behind \u2014 that person is subject to the federal ban on firearms possession. Women's rights, domestic violence, and gun control advocacy groups hailed the verdict as a victory, while opponents regarded the ruling as an unjustified, even unconstitutional, limitation on the Second Amendment right to bear arms.",

Since moving to San Francisco for college, Pablo has become less tolerant when he notices racial slights directed against his family.\n                \n                    \n                    Adrian Florido/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Pablo Ramirez, left, with his family in Los Angeles. Since moving to San Francisco for college, Pablo has become less tolerant when he notices racial slights directed against his family. This story is part of an occasional Code Switch series we're calling \"The Obama Effect.\" The series explores how conversations about race and identity have evolved over the course of the Obama presidency. You can read more about the series here. Earlier this spring I met Pablo Ramirez, a Mexican-American, first-generation college student at San Francisco State University. I had gone to the campus on a day when hundreds of students, including Ramirez, were rallying to increase funding for the school's College of Ethnic Studies. That college focuses on the histories and contributions of people of color in the U.S., and it was among several that administrators had said would have to get by with less money. But students were having none of it. At a time that anti-minority sentiment seems to be pervading so much of the nation's political discourse, they argued that having a robust ethnic studies department was more important than ever. A racial awakening Pablo told me that for him, ethnic studies is about rejecting the notion that to be truly American, you have to be white. It's an idea that he believes too many Americans still embrace. Ramirez, center, at a protest at San Francisco State University. Students were demanding more funding for Ethnic Studies, a field Ramirez says helped him better understand his Latino identity.\n                \n                    \n                    Adrian Florido/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ramirez, center, at a protest at San Francisco State University. Students were demanding more funding for Ethnic Studies, a field Ramirez says helped him better understand his Latino identity. One of the first classes Pablo took at San Francisco State was an ethnic studies course, in which he learned about Mexican-American protest movements and other civil rights struggles. \"And it really was the spark that lit the flame to just understand my history as a Latino male,\" Pablo says. \"It wasn't until really college that I was able to identify my race.\" Before college, Pablo mostly thought of race in terms of blackness and whiteness. But after he began his studies, he was suddenly noticing race in his own life, particularly when he would go home to Los Angeles to visit his parents. They're both Mexican immigrants who are now U.S. citizens. \"I started noticing that my mother would be called wetback,\" he says, \"that people would say, 'Oh, she's an idiot because she doesn't know English.'\" But when he'd try to point these slights out to his parents, he says they'd brush him off because they're uncomfortable talking about race and racism. But Pablo says he won't be silent: \"I'm not here to play nice to these ignorant people; I'm here to defend myself and my family and my heritage.\" Scared in his own country That he even has to defend his family's heritage makes Pablo angry. He was born in Los Angeles, and his parents are U.S. citizens. They came to the U.S. from the border town of Mexicali in the early 1980s. After living in the country illegally for a few years, they gained amnesty through a bill signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986. Through it all, Ramirez says, his parents worked hard to provide for the family, instilling in him the ethic that drove him to pursue a college education. \"My father calls it the American Dream,\" Ramirez says, \"though I wonder how much of a dream it really is, when they still live in poverty and have racist slurs used against them.\" When I ask Ramirez if I can meet his family, he invites me to come along when he goes home for spring break a few days after the campus protest. I meet him at the Greyhound bus station in downtown San Francisco as he waits for his overnight bus to Los Angeles. In his bag, he has three forms of identification: his school I.D., his driver's license, and his U.S. passport. Ramirez says his parents urge him to carry all three anytime he travels, \"because if you just look at me, I'm just a Latino male. I may or may not be undocumented. And my parents and I are afraid that they'll just profile me and whisk me off. Because of the political climate, I'm scared.\" Becoming American The Ramirez family owns a small stucco house in South Los Angeles. A few chickens cluck in the backyard, though the city recently asked Ramirez's father, Daniel, to get rid of them. He plans to comply, though it's another small reminder that he doesn't fully belong. A portrait hangs in the Ramirez family living room in Los Angeles. Pablo Ramirez, center, with his parents Maria and Daniel, and his siblings, Ramon and Daniela.\n                \n                    \n                    Adrian Florido/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption A portrait hangs in the Ramirez family living room in Los Angeles. Pablo Ramirez, center, with his parents Maria and Daniel, and his siblings, Ramon and Daniela. \"I only planned to come for a year or two, maybe buy a truck, and then go back to Mexico,\" Daniel tells me. That was more than 30 years ago. \"And here I am.\" As so often happens to immigrants who come to the United States with similar expectations, life changed the plan for Daniel and Maria Ramirez. They had children. The kids started going to school, learning English and growing up American. \"And even though you think of them as Mexican,\" Mr. Ramirez says, \"they think of themselves as American, they learn American customs. They're from here.\" At some point, the Mr. and Mrs. Ramirez realized their life was here, that they wouldn't be returning home. And so in the late 1990s, they decided to become citizens. But as much as they appreciate living in the U.S., the two of them have never felt truly American. \"For us, being American is more about respecting U.S. laws, and knowing those laws also protect us,\" Mrs. Ramirez says. This feeling \u2014 that even though they're U.S. citizens, it isn't really their country \u2014 seems to get to the heart of the tension Pablo has felt with his parents. He wants them to be more assertive, to stand up for themselves and demand their rights as Americans. But they don't really feel American, and so they're more willing to put their heads down, work to get ahead, and endure the little indignities their son can no longer tolerate. A glimpse of hope For Mrs. Ramirez, this feeling of not really belonging began to change when Barack Obama was elected president. She says she'd never seen so many young brown and black people go to the polls in her neighborhood. She felt like Obama was a president for her family and her community. She hoped he would deliver on immigration reform, because even though by 2008 she and her husband were already U.S. citizens, an immigration bill would send the message that immigrants like her and her husband play an important role in this country. But that reform never came, something that Mr. and Mrs. Ramirez blame more on an intransigent Congress than on President Obama. In the meantime, his administration has deported 2.5 million people. In the current election cycle, anti-immigrant rhetoric has reached a fever pitch. \"It feels like we're going backwards,\" says Pablo's sister, Daniela. Tensions at home Coming home can be a challenge for Pablo. While he loves seeing his siblings and gossiping with his mother, he also has to remind himself that he's not at school anymore. The jargon and buzzwords of academia that have become his currency don't fly here. His big pronouncements about structural racism don't always land. Pablo's older sister Daniela puts it like this: \"He likes to rant.\" And she says she checks him constantly. \"I tell him all the time, 'You need to tone it down with your big words,'\" she says. Everyone laughs when Daniela says this, including Pablo. They all know it's true. Even so, their father says this educational rift developing in the family is not a bad thing.

He and his wife have been thinking a lot about Donald Trump, his anti-immigrant rhetoric, and his supporters \u2014 the ones who believe in that message. \"They want to go back to a time when this was a whiter country,\" Mrs. Ramirez says. But her husband says that's not possible, \"because back then, people of color didn't have a voice or a vote. And now they do.\" Mr. Ramirez says he's proud of his son's willingness to speak out in defense of his family and immigrants generally. Pablo recently traveled to Florida to compete at a national speech and debate competition. His speech was about how hard it can be for immigrants and their families to embrace their heritage when they face so much pressure to assimilate. Pablo Ramirez says one thing he's learned since he's gone to college is that he should embrace all of his heritage proudly and unapologetically. \"I identify as Mexican-American, and I wouldn't give up either of my identities,\" he says.",

            "article_content": "Youth Radio's Nila Venkat examines what could be a key voting bloc in this year's presidential election: young Latinos. Venkat and Amber Ly explain why some young voters identify more with issues.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: You know we often report on issues affecting young people. Well, here at Youth Radio, we get to listen to young people doing the reporting themselves. And one thing on their minds is the presidential election. Arizona is one state that votes today. And a term we hear over and over again is the Latino vote. Youth Radio's Nila Venkat is 15 years old. She has to wait a little while before she can vote herself. But she got interested in what exactly it means when young voters are labeled as part of the Latino vote. NILA VENKAT, BYLINE: The typical Latino youth voter sounds like this. WENDY PACHECO: Name is Wendy Pacheco. I am 22 years old, and I identify as a Democrat. VENKAT: And this. LUIS REYES: My name is Luis Reyes, and I vote with the Republican Party. VENKAT: And this. DIANA VELA-MARTINEZ: My name is Diana Vela-Martinez. I am 20 years old, and I do not identify as either Republican nor Democratic. VENKAT: There is no typical Latino youth voter. According to the Pew Research Center, almost half of the 27 million Latinos expected to vote this year are millennials between the ages of 18 and 33. That's why candidates need to appeal to young Latino voters, which isn't always easy. PACHECO: You know, I tend to be disillusioned with electoral politics 'cause a lot of the issues that affect the communities that I come from cannot simply be solved through an electoral process. VENKAT: That's Wendy Pacheco. She was born and raised in East Los Angeles and calls herself a poor woman of color. Her interest in politics comes from her family's experience with the criminal justice system. PACHECO: My mother has suffered from a drug addiction. You know, she was gone for a big portion of my life and was in and out of jail. And my father is currently incarcerated. It's a strain on the family. It's very difficult. VENKAT: For Pacheco, who says she'll vote for a Democrat this November, voting is about representing where she comes from - her family, neighborhood and community. Twenty-one-year-old Luis Reyes is a student at UC Irvine and a registered Republican. He's also influenced by his family. His parents came to the U.S. from Guatemala and El Salvador, so immigration is his top issue. REYES: I am very disappointed in most of the Republican candidates. I guess you can tie that into the idea of a Latino Republican ideology - that most of them don't really fit the Latino part of it. VENKAT: Reyes cares a lot about a path to citizenship. But it's a priority he says that his party just doesn't share. REYES: The problem is that the Republican Party itself is very - it's very white. VENKAT: In many ways, Reyes doesn't totally fit in as a Republican. He's pro-choice and supports same-sex marriage. But in other ways, Reyes feels really at home in the party. He wants lower taxes and less government intervention in business. He's also big on security and strengthening the military to challenge ISIS. One poll from Univision found that 55 percent of most Latino voters don't identify as either strong Democrat or strong Republican - meaning that many are persuadable voters. MARIA URBINA: Latinos don't so much respond to a particular party. VENKAT: That's Maria Urbina - from Voto Latino - talking to me from Washington, D.C. URBINA: Where we really see ourselves is through our families and through our communities. So if we hear messages that demonstrate stewardship for our families, that's where we go. VENKAT: Voto Latino encourages Latinos to register and get out to vote, regardless of party. On the day I talked to Urbina, volunteers like Jose Israel were working the phones. JOSE ISRAEL: Hello, this is a message for Joe Martinez. We just wanted to let you know that the presidential caucuses are coming up. VENKAT: In Gainesville, Ga., 20-year-old Diana Vela-Martinez volunteers to register Latino voters near her home - even though Vela-Martinez isn't able to vote herself because she's not a citizen. VELA-MARTINEZ: If our voices are silenced, our way to being heard is encouraging those who are eligible to vote to pick people who support DACA and undocumented students. VENKAT: Vela-Martinez got a work permit through President Obama's DACA program. It's for young people brought into the U.S. as children. But the program could be reversed by the next president, meaning Vela-Martinez could face deportation. With record numbers of Latinos voting in 2008 - and again in 2012 - wherever they are on the political spectrum, young Latinos could be the ones to watch this year. GREENE: That story came from Youth Radio's Nila Venkat, who is in the studio with me here at Youth Radio. Hey, Nila. VENKAT: Hey. GREENE: So we should say, you are 15 years old. So you are a few years from voting yourself. VENKAT: Yeah, just a few years short. GREENE: Just a few years short. But we're joined by one of your colleagues at Youth Radio, Amber Ly, who is 18 years old. And you're getting ready to vote for the first time, right? AMBER LY, BYLINE: Yeah, that's right. GREENE: OK, I'm excited to hear about that. Nila, I want to ask you first, what got you interested in this topic - the Latino vote? Did have a personal connection to this story? VENKAT: For me - I'm actually not Latino myself - I'm Indian-American. That's not exactly the most sought-after voting block. So it was very interesting to get into this other voting block that's a little bit more sought-after, and how they feel that politicians are accurately representing them or not representing them. GREENE: Well, Amber, let me ask you. This has been a year when so many voters have been - at least in the early stages of this campaign - supporting outsiders, in a way. It's been almost an indictment of the political system and of the two parties, in some ways, and how they've operated. And I guess I just wonder, you - this new generation of voters coming in - do you see the Republican and Democratic parties as still important parts of our political system? LY: If you take a step back from Washington, D.C. itself - as a new generation of voters, we don't really care. We don't identify ourselves with either party. We just identify ourselves with - oh, this is the issues that I care about. I guess this is kind of like the young, idealistic mind for some people. And it's just more about problem-solving instead. GREENE: Take away the labels, you're saying. The party labels. LY: Yeah. VENKAT: I think the young people of this generation are little bit more of rule-breakers, in that - yeah - we're not exactly happy with the existing confines of the political system. LY: We're not happy with how we grew up. VENKAT: Yeah (laughter). GREENE: What do you mean by that? LY: I don't know. I grew up with the '08 crash, where - my family - I experienced a lot of, like, economic troubles after that. Or even the whole 9/11 attack - after that it was just never the same. And I will get that a lot from my parents - like, wow, it's changed so much in such a small amount of time. And that just has made me, like - what was it like before? I wanted to know what it was like 'cause I never experienced it. GREENE: And that's frustrating. LY: Yeah, I'm very frustrated. VENKAT: We're not happy with the existing system. So I personally would not mind at all if - in the 2020 elections when I'll be voting - if things were different. GREENE: Amber, Nila, thank you so much. VENKAT: Thank you. LY: Yeah, thank you. GREENE: That was Amber Ly and Nila Venkat, two reporters here at Youth Radio in Oakland, Calif. We should say, they don't just produce radio stories at Youth Radio. They produce digital content, apps and also music. And we're hearing their music throughout the program this week. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "11-year-old Sebastien De La Cruz sings the national anthem to open Wednesday's Democratic presidential debate, sponsored by Univision and The Washington Post.\n\n                    \n                    Wilfredo Lee/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption 11-year-old Sebastien De La Cruz sings the national anthem to open Wednesday's Democratic presidential debate, sponsored by Univision and The Washington Post. Once upon a time, the Democratic National Committee had a plan for just four debates among the party's candidates for president. The general feeling among activists was that too many debates risked overexposing the candidates, their differences and the divisions within the party. There had been too many debates, they felt, in 2008. It was just bad politics. Now, some months later, the DNC has allowed eight debates, the latest in Miami on Wednesday night, sponsored by Univision and The Washington Post and broadcast on CNN. The first few debates were tucked into difficult time slots involving holidays or major sports events, but the latest have been relatively easy for the country as a whole to see. The cast of contenders, originally five, has for more than a month now been down to two, one of whom will almost surely be the nominee. And judging by this latest clash, and the previous edition last Sunday night, it is easy to see why the DNC originally wanted the series to be shorter. Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had at each other for two hours in each of these events, trading accusations and answering journalists' questions laden with accusations. Their various vulnerabilities and shortcomings have been clearly on display. And while these last two debates were not nearly as raw and rivalrous as the most recent Republican debates, neither were they as collegial as the first two Democratic debates last fall. Sanders ripped into Clinton for taking money from Wall Street in contributions and speaking fees. Clinton pounded Sanders for his vote against the 2007 comprehensive immigration reform bill negotiated by the late Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy. Again on Wednesday night, both candidates had plenty of partisans in the audience to provide cheers and applause, as well as occasional hoots and other expressions of disapproval for the media moderators. Both candidates also had plenty of prepared material, much of which was already familiar. Sanders talked about the \"rigged economy\" and the \"corrupt campaign finance system,\" the inequality of income (most of the income growth since the 2009 recession going to the top 1 percent) and the failure of capitalism to care about its workers. Clinton talked about the need to extend President Obama's policies in virtually every area of governance, from the Affordable Care Act to the Dodd-Frank regulation of the financial sector. She defended her many contributions from the Wall Street world of finance in part by saying President Obama had taken Wall Street money, too. But Clinton, like Sanders, did not defend the current administration's policies on deportation of recent immigrants without legal status. Both said they would end the deportation of children and the breaking up of families. It was a major area of agreement during the evening. Asked for a specific commitment regarding the deportation of children, Clinton said: \"I will not deport children, I will not deport children.\" She then proceeded to detail her priorities for other categories of people that might be subject to deportation, including violent criminals and those who plot terrorist attacks. Sanders also disavowed child deportation, as well as the Obama administration's deportation policies, which have repatriated many thousands. He decried the very idea of mass deportations of the 11 million undocumented people now estimated to be in the U.S. While not contemplated by most of the policy community, just such a deportation is a cornerstone of the campaign of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Clinton called Trump's \"very tall\" wall on the Mexican border \"a fantasy.\" Given the setting, the sponsors and the audience, questions about immigration were a natural centerpiece for the debate. But the questioners also touched on the vacancy on the Supreme Court, the minimum wage and a separate set of vulnerabilities unique to each. Sanders was asked about a 1985 video in which he criticized the U.S. for its interventionist policies in Latin America, particularly regarding Cuba. He had some praise, in the video, for the Castro regime on that island. Sanders did not repudiate the views in the video and said the U.S. had overstepped the enforcement of the Monroe Doctrine regarding its security in the hemisphere. Clinton was challenged regarding her handling of her private email server and also her allegedly misleading remarks to the families of U.S. personnel after the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012. Both issues are fraught with political peril as both have been focal points for Republicans. At one point, moderator Jorge Ramos of Univision asked her point-blank if she would withdraw from the race if indicted for the email arrangement. \"Oh for goodness ... \" Clinton began. \"That's not going to happen. I'm not even going to answer that question.\" Clinton was also put on the spot to explain her loss this week in the Michigan primary, which polls had predicted she would win easily. She smiled and said she had still received more votes and more delegates than Sanders that day because Michigan was such a close vote and her victory in Mississippi had been overwhelming. Next week, the two candidates again face off in voting in varied parts of the country: Florida, Illinois, Ohio, North Carolina and Missouri. While not as numerous as the states on \"Super Tuesday,\" these five are among the most populous states in the country and therefore supply a comparable payoff in terms of delegates. Their cumulative impact could be even greater. Clinton has already passed the halfway point in pursuit of the 2,383 delegates needed to be nominated in Philadelphia in July. But Sanders' narrow win in Michigan changed the narrative again and raised questions about the reliability of polls in other states where Clinton has had a lead. The failure of the pollsters and media to foresee Sanders' win in Michigan, where he had been behind by as much as 20 points and more, has cast doubt on all the tools used by observers to foresee results in any election. That has been good news for Sanders' enthusiasts, who had a field day mocking their antagonists.",

            "article_content": "Marco Rubio (left) and Donald Trump on stage at Thursday's GOP debate.\n                \n                    \n                    David J. Phillip/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Marco Rubio (left) and Donald Trump on stage at Thursday's GOP debate. Ahead of Thursday's Republican debate, pundits agreed that someone \u2014 and Marco Rubio in particular \u2014 needed to attack Trump. And in that sense, the debate didn't disappoint. Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz took aim at the real estate mogul who is leading the GOP field heading into Super Tuesday. Trump is looking strong heading into a big day of nominating contests. Now, the question is whether his opponents' attacks mattered, and if they could at all still chip away at his support. Here are six big takeaways from the final GOP debate before Super Tuesday. 1. Marco Rubio takes aim at Trump One of the big questions since Trump has taken the GOP lead has been when Rubio would go on the attack. As it turns out, he did Thursday. The debate started with a question about candidates' positions on undocumented immigrants. Rubio took the opportunity to take a swing at Trump for the fact that undocumented Polish workers helped build Trump Tower. Trump responded by touting his business experience. \"I'm the only one on the stage who's hired people,\" Trump countered, to loud applause. He later added, \"I've hired tens of thousands of people over at my job. You've hired nobody.\" Rubio also referenced a recent New York Times investigation that found that Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida largely hired foreign guest workers, despite receiving many applicants from U.S. residents. The fighting wasn't just about employment practices; the Florida senator dug in against Trump in a few other areas: the fact that four of Trump's companies have declared bankruptcy, as well as Trump's inheritance. If Trump hadn't inherited millions of dollars from his father, Rubio said, he'd be \"selling watches in Manhattan.\" And when Rubio was later able to claim that Trump was repeating himself (the source of Rubio's woes in a past debate), he was rewarded with wild applause. 2. Can the GOP win Latinos? The Republican party knows that appealing to the Latino community is key to winning in 2016. And so moderator Maria Celeste Arraras asked Texas Sen. Ted Cruz if he and Rubio, both of whom are of Latino heritage, should be doing more to reaching out to Latino voters. Both of them focused on the economy as the best way to do that. Cruz said he would make sure that \"everyone who is struggling in the Hispanic community and beyond will have a fair and even shake at the American dream.\" Rubio said that it's all about the free market. \"I'm going to tell you that the most powerful sentiment in the Hispanic community, as it is in every immigrant community, is the burning desire to leave your children better off than yourself, and you can only do that through free enterprise,\" Rubio said. Arraras then asked Trump about recent polls \u2014 including one from Telemundo \u2014 showing that the majority of Hispanics view him negatively. Trump responded, \"I don't believe anything Telemundo says,\" but then, minutes later, \"I love them. I love them\" (seemingly in reference to Telemundo). But more importantly, it gave more context to the fact that, according to entrance polls, Trump won Hispanics in the Nevada caucuses this week. Those polls, as the Washington Post's Janell Ross points out, come from a small sample (and therefore have a wide margin of error), and only represent a small fraction of Nevada's Latino population, which has tended to vote heavily Democratic. Trump insisted that he would bring some of those voters across party lines in a general election. \"I'm just telling you that I will do really well with Hispanics. I will do better than anybody on this stage,\" he said. He added, \"But I'm telling you also, I'm bringing people, Democrats over and I'm bringing independents over, and we're building a much bigger, much stronger Republican Party.\" 3. Kasich claims the moderate lane The debate kicked off with Trump and Cruz taking hard lines on immigration \u2014 Trump said he'd deport undocumented immigrants but let the \"good ones\" back in. Cruz praised Arizona's tough immigration laws. Rubio, meanwhile, added that he'd \"secure the border\" first. When Ohio Gov. John Kasich got his chance to talk, he took a softer tone. \"I don't think we're going to tear families apart. I don't think we're going to ride around in people's neighborhoods and grab people out of their homes. I don't think \u2014 first of all, I don't think it's practical and I don't think it reflects America.\" With the race largely being cast as a three-man competition these days, this is one way the Ohio governor is differentiating himself: a more moderate stance on some issues. When the topic of religious liberty came up again later, Kasich said that the Supreme Court has ruled on same-sex marriage and that he has \"moved on.\" \"If you're in the business of commerce, conduct commerce. That's my view,\" he said. \"And if you don't agree with their lifestyle, say a prayer for them when they leave and hope that they change their behavior.\" 4. Wolf Blitzer fact-checks Trump on his tax plan Wolf Blitzer asked Trump to explain how his tax plan would work. That plan is an expensive one, with the potential to slash federal revenues by a stunning $9.5 trillion over 10 years (not counting economic effects), according to the Tax Policy Center, a left-leaning tax policy think tank. Trump said a \"dynamic economy\" would help pay for his tax plan. However, the right-leaning Tax Foundation found that even with dynamic scoring (that is, taking into account potential economic effects), Trump's plan would cost $10.1 trillion over 10 years (with static scoring, they found it would be around $12 trillion). Trump responded that he would \"get rid of so many different things,\" like the Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency. Beyond that, he wasn't specific, saying he'd \"cut many of the agencies\" and \"balance our budget.\" But Blitzer was ready with numbers, pointing out that cutting those two offices would barely begin to pay for Trump's tax plan. Trump responded that he'd cut \"waste, fraud, and abuse.\" This isn't important just because of Trump, though; the question of what to cut is also key for his competitors, as many of the candidates' tax plans have the potential to cut revenues by trillions of dollars. 5. This. Yes, Rubio went after Trump. But that's not the half of it. It was a night for fighting, with the leading candidates throwing constant punches to see what would land. Here's a minute from what may have been the most chaotic exchange of the evening. 6. It was the Trump show By NPR's count, Trump got by far the most talking time, with more than half an hour. The next-closest candidate, Cruz, was more than 10 minutes behind him. Ben Carson, meanwhile, got 20 minutes less airtime than Trump did. And he made his irritation known. At one point, a fed-up Carson asked, \"Can somebody attack me, please?\"",

            "article_content": "Immigration was a big issue in the presidential race. Now that Donald Trump has been elected, will he carry through with promises? And, financial markets began the day lower on news Trump would win.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: Last night, as the election results poured in, NPR's Sarah McCammon was at Donald Trump's victory party, talking to the supporters about the impact of the Republican nominee's victory. Trump supporter Robin Hall (ph) said she expected Trump would work for the many voters who opposed him. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) ROBIN HALL: I do think that all the minorities have been disenfranchised in the past. I think that they really have been. Every four years, they come around, they tell them - but nothing ever gets done for them. So I really feel like he - he will listen, and he will turn this country around and really look at their best interests. MONTAGNE: Trump's stand on immigration is one of the areas that was a point of concern for many minority voters. And for a closer look at what a Trump immigration policy could look like, we're joined now by NPR's John Burnett in San Antonio. And, John, Trump's two signature issues are the wall and deporting 11 million undocumented aliens, as he would call them. What can you expect? JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: Well, that is the question. I mean, this was one of the big, emotional issues that Trump hit with his crowd again and again. Could we expect an earthquake in immigration policy? Certainly - changing from eight years under Barack Obama and even under the prior eight years under George W. Bush. I'm sure the immigration hawks are delirious this morning. Trump had some of the harshest immigration proposals, really, in modern politics. Speaking of the wall, you know, he had actually started to step back in the last two months on this, saying - you know, not talking as much about, you know, seriously continuously building a wall above ground, but saying, you know, where it was appropriate. You know, does he really think he can get Mexico to pay for this after the country has explicitly said, you know, we're not going to do it? MONTAGNE: Right. BURNETT: Deporting 11 million - I'm sure that there - unauthorized immigrants all over the country are just terrified this morning. He had - Trump has bragged about his deportation force, that he wants to to round up all of the unauthorized immigrants. And, of course, that would even require more reliance on private prisons, which the federal government thinks it might be stepping away from. MONTAGNE: Well, we just have another second or two, but do you think a Congress that's Republican will help with all of this with Donald Trump? BURNETT: Well, of course they will because now he has a unified government. And so they have said there cannot be comprehensive immigration reform without more border security. So now the issue is, what is that going to look like? Is he going to double the border - border patrol force? I mean, the implications are just profound in this area. MONTAGNE: John, thanks very much. That's NPR's John Burnett in San Antonio. And with us in our studio this morning is NPR's economics correspondent John Ydstie, keeping an eye on the markets and how they've been reacting. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Well, there's a dramatic reaction in Japan, a little less reaction in China and a little less in Europe. Now, it looks like the U.S. markets will open down about 2.5 percent. The markets are just concerned about what Donald Trump's economic policies might be. You can imagine managed healthcare companies could be hurt if they repeal Obamacare. Clean energy companies could be hurt if he backs out of the Paris climate deal. On the other hand, he's talked a lot about infrastructure building, and that could be good for the economy and growth. MONTAGNE: That's NPR's John Ydstie. Thanks very much. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "An effort led by Green Party candidate Jill Stein to recount votes is moving ahead in Wisconsin, as Donald Trump's deliberations over who to pick as secretary of state has turned into a public feud.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Here are some facts about the presidential election. Donald Trump won thanks to electoral votes. He has a majority. Recounts in a handful of states are considered very, very unlikely to change that. Another fact is that Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report vote tracker puts Trump behind by about 2.2 million votes as of the latest count. In response to that fact, the president-elect last night made a claim, without evidence, that millions of illegal votes were cast against him. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is on the line now to talk about that and more. Hi, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: Why would the president-elect say that with no evidence? LIASSON: Well, we don't know why. He doesn't like losing. He lost the popular vote, and it seems that's really bothering him. But, you know, the saga of the rigged election by Donald Trump has taken a lot of twists and turns. In the summer, he said he could only lose if the election was stolen. He predicted massive voter fraud before any votes were cast. Then, when Jill Stein, this - one of the third-party candidates - started a recount in several states, he issued a statement saying the results of the election should be respected instead of challenged. Now, in a series of tweets, he seems to have reversed himself completely and is claiming without any evidence that he would have won the popular vote except for these millions of undocumented immigrants casting illegal votes. There is no evidence for this. It's being pushed by a right-wing website called Infowars, run by Alex Jones, who's a big supporter of Trump. This website promotes a lot of conspiracy theories, including one that the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre was faked in order to promote gun control legislation. So it is remarkable to have a president-elect make unfair, unfounded claims that don't even matter. As you said, Donald Trump won the election. INSKEEP: And the few cases of fraud that were caught during the election season included a person who tried to vote twice for Donald Trump. There's just no evidence here whatsoever. LIASSON: Not at all. You know, he did say in some of his tweets that there was massive fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - three states he lost. If that's the case, wouldn't he want a recount in those three states, or even a national recount? You know, there are a lot of theories about why he's doing this. One, maybe he's not secure in his victory. Two, maybe he's trying to distract from stories about his business dealings with foreign governments abroad, which might prove unconstitutional, or that he's falsely sowing this voter fraud story to lay the groundwork for more restrictive voting laws. INSKEEP: Well, now, there is this recount going on. It's been requested by Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate - Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania. Hillary Clinton's campaign is beginning to get involved. Where does all that stand? LIASSON: Well, it's been requested by Jill Stein, as you said. Hillary Clinton's lawyers are participating in Wisconsin and any other states that might grant one. The Clinton campaign said they would never have started this recount. They don't have any evidence of hacking or irregularities, but this is due diligence on their part, as long as this recount has been started. No one expects the recount to change the result. Hillary Clinton has conceded, and that is not changing. INSKEEP: Let me ask about one other thing, Mara Liasson, you mentioned Trump's business dealings abroad. It's become clear that he's discussed business and public policy. He acknowledges he might have done that on the same phone call already as president-elect. How is the White House intending to handle this? LIASSON: We don't know yet. They say that the White House counsel will resolve this issue. They've said in the past that he's going to turn his business over to his children. I don't really know how that separates him from it, but he does have business dealings all over the world. And in some cases - the Philippines - his business partner is a special envoy to the United States. INSKEEP: And federal ethics laws do not apply to the president, as Trump has pointed out. LIASSON: Well, conflicts of interest laws don't, but there is the Emoluments Clause, which said that the president cannot take anything from any foreign government that would be considered a benefit. And, of course, if he's getting revenue from foreign governments or foreign government-owned businesses, that could be a problem. INSKEEP: And that is a clause of the United States Constitution. Mara, thanks very much. LIASSON: Thank you. INSKEEP: That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

They and their children are refugees from Syria and have been resettled with help from the Nassau Presbyterian Church.\n                \n                    \n                    Jake Naughton for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Osama and Ghada sit on the deck of their home in Princeton, N.J. They and their children are refugees from Syria and have been resettled with help from the Nassau Presbyterian Church. Osama, a Syrian refugee who resettled five months ago in Princeton, N.J., did not sleep on election night after listening to the results. \"The whole world is affected by American elections,\" he said during an English lesson with his wife, Ghada, the next morning at their dining room table. The family, which still has relatives in Syria, has asked that it be identified by first names only. Osama knows about American voters' divided response to Syrian refugees and President-elect Donald Trump's campaign promises to block Syrian refugees and send back those taken in by the U.S. But he isn't sure what to expect. His confusion over what's ahead mirrors the concerns of many other refugee families amid post-election reports of hate crimes against minorities. Osama walks outside after his and his wife's English class. He was blinded in a military attack on his uncle's home in a Damascus suburb in 2012.\n                \n                    \n                    Jake Naughton for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Osama walks outside after his and his wife's English class. He was blinded in a military attack on his uncle's home in a Damascus suburb in 2012. \"If they bring us back, it's not a problem for us,\" Osama said, weighing the post-election possibility of a reversal of his U.S. resettlement and a return to a refugee camp in Jordan or even to Syria. His words seemed a bit of bravado amid the uncertainty. Osama and his family have benefited so far from the generosity of Americans. His family's resettlement was made possible by the support of Princeton's Nassau Presbyterian Church, as well as community volunteers. \"Your situation is safe; you can stay here, no problem,\" Beverly Leach assures them. Leach heads a group of volunteer English-language instructors for this refugee couple. Ghada works through directional phrases with her English instructor, Beverly Leach in their home.\n                \n                    \n                    Jake Naughton for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ghada works through directional phrases with her English instructor, Beverly Leach in their home. But the Nassau church support group she is part of is anxious about implications for refugees after the election. The fearful calls and emails began coming in the day after the election, says senior pastor Dave Davis. On the same day, Princeton's mayor, Liz Lempart, invited him and other faith leaders and community leaders to meet \"to allay fears she was already hearing from immigrant communities,\" Davis says. Davis' pastoral duties now include reassuring Osama's family members that their future is secure. But the future of the U.S. refugee resettlement program is now in doubt. \"That's more complicated, and probably that's where the fears really lie,\" he says. Tom Charles, one of the lead volunteers helping Osama and Ghada settle into their new home, sits in their sunroom.\n                \n                    \n                    Jake Naughton for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Tom Charles, one of the lead volunteers helping Osama and Ghada settle into their new home, sits in their sunroom. The Obama administration, after admitting around 2,000 Syrian refugees during the first few years of the war, brought in around 12,000 this year. The Nassau Presbyterian Church has a long history of supporting refugees, including Cubans, Vietnamese, Bosnians and Iraqis, says Davis. In the current political climate, when Americans are divided on Syrian resettlement, it has been a high-pressure good deed. It's been almost six months since Osama's family was introduced to the congregation. At the end of October, he and Ghada were introduced again at an adult education class before the Sunday service. The visual change in the couple since they first arrived in Princeton was striking. Osama, in a gray puffer jacket and jeans, had become more confident. Ghada wore a stylish knit dress; a colorful headscarf framed her soft, round face. She baked Syrian sweets to go with the coffee at the gathering. \"They are doing very well. Ghada wrote her first check yesterday, the date, the name and the amount,\" Tom Charles told the congregation. Charles, who heads the church's resettlement committee, meets with the family each week to go over finances. Refugees admitted to the U.S. under the federal resettlement program are expected to start working within months after arrival and become self-sufficient as government benefits taper off. Most refugees are already working at the five-month mark. But Osama was blinded and his face scarred in an artillery attack on his uncle's home in a Damascus suburb in 2012. His disability is a hurdle.

The October church meeting was Osama's way to connect with the wider congregation through an interpreter. \"We had a normal life\" in Syria, he told them. \"I had a small factory.\" He provided for his family. His ravaged face tells the story of war and loss. But his most powerful message was unexpected, delivered in the form of a joke. \"Osama, can you tell us about Tarzan's last words?\" Charles deadpanned to an audience unsure of what to expect. \"Tarzan's last famous words were, 'Who put grease on the vines?' \" Osama replied in Arabic. Ghada greets her children at the bus stop.\n                \n                    \n                    Jake Naughton for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ghada greets her children at the bus stop. The audience politely waited for the translation before exploding with laughter and applause. With a simple joke, Osama made a larger point: I am not so different from you. But American culture is very different from family expectations learned from movies and social media. Excitement was mixed with nerves around some Halloween traditions, as the holiday approached in late October. \"We just said, it's fun, it's about collecting candy and dressing up. I think it was pretty strange for them,\" says Sue Jennings, part of the Nassau church team. She delivered donated costumes, a dozen pumpkins and guidance on the unfamiliar holiday. \"A jack-o-lantern is a pumpkin with a face,\" she explained to the Syrian children at the kitchen table, elbow-deep in orange pumpkin goop. The family carves jack-o-lanterns for the first time.\n                \n                    \n                    Deb Amos/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The family carves jack-o-lanterns for the first time. They knew about pumpkins, an ingredient in a savory Syrian stew. Their father, following as best he could from his perch on the couch, asked, \"Why is there an American holiday that wastes so much food?\" He had been particularly anxious about Halloween, concerned that it conflicted with his Muslim faith. But he got caught up in his children's excitement over the parade at school. He couldn't see the costumes but insisted on approving the choices, banning anything scary, involving black magic or Harry Potter. \"Superman, good,\" he declared, and the Disney costumes also got his OK. On Oct. 31, his four children walked the parade route with their elementary school classmates \u2014 now part of the community that welcomed their arrival, the new start made possible by generous church support. Ghada stood with the other elementary school parents and waved as the children walked by with their friends. She marveled at the school principal wearing battery-operated cat ears and a tail. \"A hundred percent different than Syria,\" she said. Then she walked into the school for the Halloween party.",

She's a former refugee, a Muslim, a mom of three, and now the first Somali-American lawmaker in the United States. \"This really was a victory for that 8-year-old in that refugee camp,\" Ilhan Omar, 34, said. \"This was a victory for the young woman being forced into child marriage. This was a victory for every person that's been told they have limits on their dreams.\" Omar is the youngest of seven children. She and her family fled from the Somali civil war and spent four years in a refugee camp in Kenya. When she came to the United States in 1995, she spoke only Somali. As her English improved, she began translating for her grandfather at political events in the Twin Cities. Today, the Minneapolis organizer is well-versed in business administration and politics. \"I think I bring the voice of young people,\" Omar said. \"I think I bring the voice of women in the East African community. I bring the voice of Muslims. I bring the voice of young mothers looking for opportunities.\" She won House District 60B in southeast Minneapolis with 80 percent of the vote. It wasn't a surprise that Omar would win a Minnesota House seat in the reliably Democratic district: In the primary contest earlier, she beat a 22-term incumbent, and her Republican challenger suspended his campaign for family reasons. Allegations were raised during the campaign that she had illegally married her brother to commit immigration fraud; she denied the charge. On Tuesday, as Ilhan Omar walked into a room filled with supporters, she was crushed with hugs and kisses from anyone who could touch her. For nearly 20 minutes, photographers tried desperately to capture Omar as she moved around the room in her white headscarf. When the music stopped and speakers gathered on stage, Omar sat down in the front row, beaming, next to her husband, Ahmed Hirsi. One of her children sat on her lap, and her two other kids stood by her. \"Minneapolis said no tonight, said no to hatred,\" Habon Abdulle said. She's the executive director of the Minneapolis group Women Organizing Women Network. \"Minneapolis said no to the narrative of making America hate again. Minneapolis tonight said yes to diversity. Minneapolis, and [the] 60B district particularly, you said Muslim women have space in the governing body of our state. Thank you.\" When Omar's husband took the microphone, he got the crowd laughing when he started to describe strong, black, Muslim women. \"For those men \u2014 wooo! \u2014 let me tell you something,\" Hirsi said. \"When you see a strong, African, Muslim woman, don't be afraid, no, you know what, appreciate that. That's the model, that's the new 2016, going into 2017.\" Omar and her children joined him on stage as the crowd started to chant, \"Ilhan, Ilhan, Ilhan.\" She honored her grandfather first, thanking him for his many lessons, then her dad and finally her supporters. \"Our campaign has been about more than just uniting a district, more than winning back the House, more than making history,\" Omar said. \"Our campaign has been about shifting narratives, restoring hope and re-establishing access in our democracy.\" She told the crowd she would work on an agenda focused on justice and the common good, zero waste and renewable energy. \"And we will never stop fighting for a democracy that works for all of us, for a prosperous and equitable Minnesota that we will all be proud of,\" she said. \"I will never give up fighting for you, and I hope you will never give up fighting for me.\" Omar's mentor and friend, Minneapolis City Council member Andrew Johnson, said he knew long ago that she would make history. \"I had no doubt that Ilhan would get here. The big question is: What's the path an individual takes?\" Johnson said. \"And I just think she's just naturally a great leader.\" Mohamed Omar Giama couldn't agree more. The 90-year-old former Somali ambassador to the European Commission said he was overjoyed witnessing history. \"I never thought a Somali lady, a refugee, can get through all this hardship and difficulties to get elected to Minnesota parliament,\" said Giama, who attended her victory party. \"It's wonderful,\" he said, \"just wonderful.\"",

For the first Somali-American lawmaker in the U.S., it was meant to be a day to remember: a visit to the White House for policy meetings before she takes office in Minnesota. But as she left the seat of U.S. power, Ilhan Omar says, she was subjected to a hateful and threatening verbal attack in a cab. \"I pray for his humanity and for all those who harbor hate in their hearts,\" Omar, a Muslim who wears a head scarf, wrote of the cab driver who she says assailed her. In a Facebook post, she says the encounter took place on Tuesday. Saying that she was \"subjected to the most hateful, derogatory, Islamophobic, sexist taunts and threats I have ever experienced,\" Omar says the cab driver \"called me ISIS and threatened to remove my hijab.\" Omar, 34, recounted the abusive encounter in the nation's capital just one month after she made both history and headlines with her inspiring personal story of a former refugee who won a state House seat in southeast Minneapolis, years after her family fled Somalia's civil war. \"This really was a victory for that 8-year-old in that refugee camp,\" Omar said of her Election Day win. \"This was a victory for the young woman being forced into child marriage. This was a victory for every person that's been told they have limits on their dreams.\" This week, Omar has been in Washington, D.C., to attend the State Innovation Exchange conference along with hundreds of other state legislators. She also spoke at the U.S. Institute of Peace on Monday \u2014 Arab American Day. One day later, she was at the White House for a discussion about economic issues facing the middle class. Such an honor to get to kick off the #SiXconference and join Pres of @emilyslist @wendydavis and @rweingarten as the WomenLead speakers. pic.twitter.com/83eeV7bBUp After the White House session, Omar said, she was verbally abused during the cab ride to her hotel, adding that she \"wasn't really sure how this encounter would end as I attempted to rush out of his cab and retrieve my belongs.\" Omar added, \"I am still shaken by this incident and can't wrap my head around\" the increasing boldness of people \"displaying their hate towards Muslims.\" Her Facebook post about the incident has drawn thousands of reactions and hundreds of comments from people who expressed their sympathy and solidarity with the mother of three who will be sworn into her new office in January. One of the most popular responses to Omar's post came from another Minnesotan who had recently visited the nation's capital. \"I just got back from Washington too,\" Christopher L. Wendt wrote. \"I had a cab driver originally from Somalia. When I told him I am from Minnesota and that we have a 'first' Somali woman legislator, he got very excited. 'Ilhan!' he said - very proud. Keep it up. We've got your back.\" After a request for comment about the incoming legislator's report, Washington's Department of For-Hire Vehicles responded: \"Washington, D.C. is an inclusive city. As the agency charged with protecting consumers in the vehicle-for-hire industry DFHV takes any allegations of discrimination very seriously.

Donald Trump's hard-line campaign rhetoric singled out Syrian refugees. \"If I win,\" he told a New Hampshire rally, \"they are going back.\" Donald Trump's election has sent tremors through America's refugee advocate community, and caused fear and uncertainty among the most recently resettled refugees, the Syrians. They listened with alarm as candidate Trump called them \"terrorists\" and blamed them, incorrectly, for violent attacks in America. \"That rhetoric has had an impact,\" says Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, a legal aid program. \"Trump has been successful in politicizing refugee admissions in a way that they have not been politicized before.\" The United States is the world's leading resettlement country for refugees; historically, the program has had bipartisan support and has been a mainstay of U.S. foreign policy. Syrian resettlement was extremely limited during the first years of a war that began as a peaceful protest against a repressive regime in 2011. The number of Syrians resettled in the U.S. was 105 in 2014 and rose to 1,682 in 2015. In his last year in office, Obama has boosted that number substantially, and set a goal of admitting 10,000 Syrian refugees in fiscal year 2016. In September, his administration led a global summit to address an unprecedented migrant crisis. The president increased the U.S. resettlement target for 2017 by more than 30 percent, to 110,000 refugees from the world's most vulnerable populations. NPR's Deborah Amos explains how the U.S. vets refugees. All this could change under a Trump administration. \"When it comes to resettlement, the president has all the authority,\" explains Jennifer Quigley, a refugee advocate with Human Rights First. \"Our big concern is that it could be none at all or it could be that there is a discrimination against Arabs or Muslims or Somalis,\" she says, pointing out targets in Trump's anti-refugee campaign speeches. During the campaign, Trump said he planned to suspend the Syrian refugee program, and threatened to deport those already here. At a rally in New Hampshire last year, he told a cheering crowd, \"I'm putting the people on notice that are coming here from Syria as part of a mass migration, that if I win, they are going back.\" \"Everyone is terrified, they are scared, they are shocked, \" says a refugee named Mohammed, describing the Syrian refugee community's reaction to the U.S. election. He asked to withhold his last name because of fears for family back home. He also fears that Trump will carry out the hard line threat; rounding up Syrian refugees and kicking them out. \"You brought them here because they are refugees, they don't have homes anymore,\" he says. \"Send them back where? To hell?\" Mohammed and his 17-year-old daughter, Lulu, are resettled in central New Jersey, in a small apartment where cable news channels are the constant background ambience. They arrived in the U.S. in 2014 and were granted asylum in 2015. A successful Damascus businessman, Mohammed fled his homeland, fearing arrest and torture for his support of an uprising that began as a peaceful protest against an oppressive Syrian regime. \"Half of my family are back in Syria,\" he says.

The president has increased the target number for U.S. settlement to 110,000 refugees from the world's most vulnerable populations. Mohammed hoped his appeal for family reunion would be granted after he obtained asylum status for himself and Lulu. Now, the election throws official approval and a family reunion in doubt. After a campaign of furious soundbites and often contradictory policy directions, Trump has yet to fill in the details of his comprehensive refugee resettlement program. \"Admission of refuges from war-torn areas of the world has been a key component of our foreign policy for decades and decades,\" says IRAP's Heller. \"To give that up now will seriously damage our credibility with our allies abroad.\" Advocates argue that backtracking on American commitments could encourage other countries to follow the U.S. example, deepening a humanitarian crisis for allies and giving talking points to Muslim militants who claim that the West is hostile to Islam. But bipartisan support for refugee resettlement unraveled after last November's Paris terrorist attacks, when early reporting erroneously identified one of the attackers as a Syrian refugee. Support further declined following last December's terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif., and a mass shooting in June at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. Refugees had no role in these attacks, but GOP lawmakers began to call for a pause in resettlement and so did a majority of U.S. governors. Trump's hard-line campaign rhetoric, specifically against Syrians, resonated with a fearful GOP's voting base. Now that Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House, refugee advocates fear there will be severe funding cuts for their work. The first outlines of President-elect Trump's policy have come in a document from his transition team called \"The First Day Project\" with a to-do list for January 2017. Refugees come near the top of the list, \"a top-five priority of the transition team,\" says Quigley. The policy includes the intention to \"suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur.\" \"Terror-prone\" would certainly describe Syria, Afghanistan and Somalia, the three countries that produce half of the world's refugees. After Trump's win, refugee communities across the country have turned to teachers, immigration lawyers and other advocates for guidance on managing deep anxieties. Many have been in the country a short time, a few months to a few years, and have never been through a U.S. election, much less one that's unparalleled even for Americans. \"President-elect Trump said in his acceptance speech that he wants to treat everyone fairly. And I hope that for the sake of everyone, he will hew to that promise \u2014 as it pertains to both U.S. citizens and to immigrants,\" says Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration law professor at Cornell University. His advice for refugees: Don't panic. \"Nothing is going to happen immediately,\" he says about deportation fears. Refugees are legal residents, he explains, with constitutional rights. Even a U.S. president does not have the power and authority to \"round them up and deport them,\" says Yale-Loehr. \"If he thinks they are a terrorist threat, he would have to say a specific refugee poses a threat and have some evidence to back it up.\" Yale-Loehr also scoffs at Trump's often repeated campaign charge that when refugees are admitted to the United States, \"We don't know who these people are.\" He says the vetting process for refugees is designed to identify security threats. There is an enhanced layer of security vetting for Syrians. \"Syrian refuges have to go through a 21-step vetting process before they are allowed to come to the U.S. It goes to three different agencies,\" says Yale-Loehr. \"I am not sure what any president could do to make it even more stringent than it already is.\" The U.S. takes in about a million immigrants each year, admitted legally to work and study. This is separate from refugee arrivals, who are fleeing war, persecution or political chaos. The annual number of refugee admissions is set by the president. Refugee advocate Chris George says the campaign rhetoric could undermine a program that has resettled 750,00 refugees since Sept. 11, 2001 \u2014 with not one arrest for a domestic terrorism charge. \"This all goes back to a fundamental lack of information about the refugee program and lack of contact,\" he says. George is the executive director of Integrated Refugee and Immigrant Services, a nonprofit agency in New Haven, Conn. His organization has resettled more than 250 refugees this year in a distinctive program that partners with private groups to place refugee families in communities, \"so people can meet them and have them live down the street and walk to school with their children.\" Most Americans have never met a refugee, says George, and that is part of the problem. He places some of the blame on the State Department, which encourages resettlement programs to operate at a low profile. \"If people throw up their arms, politicians included, and say, 'We don't know anything about this refugee program, we don't know who these people are, we don't know if they've been vetted,' well, the information is out there. It's out of ignorance that people say those things.\"",

            "article_content": "This election has been particularly noisy. But when all the Twitter storms and heated exchanges (maybe) fade away after Nov. 8, the issues that affect real voters will remain. With that in mind, we set out to create a cheat sheet on where each candidate stands on the issues voters care about most. The issues we chose to highlight come from the top 10 issues voters said were \"very important\" to their vote, according to a 2016 poll from the Pew Research Center. Those issues are, in order: The economy, terrorism, foreign policy, health care, gun policy, immigration, social security, education, Supreme Court appointments and the treatment of racial and ethnic minorities. We've tracked where the major candidates \u2014 Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, Gary Johnson and Jill Stein \u2014 fall on each issue. We chose these four candidates because they are on the ballot in most states. We've categorized each candidate's stance in various subcateories with a yes or a no, if it truly was that simple. Some were given an \"it's complicated\" rating, meaning that the candidate hasn't put forth a plan, commented publicly or has changed positions. We will continue to update their stances as they evolve. Is there a subcategory you'd like to see but don't? E-mail us at nprpolitics@npr.org. Economy / Terrorism / Foreign Policy / Health / Gun Policy / Immigration / Social Security / Education / Supreme Court Appointments / The Treatment of Racial and Ethnic Minorities Though the country as a whole has recovered in the eight years since the 2008 recession, many parts of the country are still struggling. Partly for that reason, economic policy continues to be a major theme on the campaign trail. Candidates have sparred over the role that the tax code should play in economic growth, how to solve the social security problem and more. With several high-profile terror attacks happening within the last year \u2014 including the December shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. \u2014 thwarting terrorism has been a common topic this election cycle. Donald Trump's extreme proposals in particular \u2014 from condoning waterboarding to what he calls \"extreme vetting\" of refugees \u2014 have largely fueled the discussion, causing other candidates to respond. Foreign policy as a topic is a bit of a catch-all, as it deals with the United States' relationship with other countries. It covers everything from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, one of Trump's most commonly evoked foes, to the Iran nuclear deal, to U.S. participation in NATO. When it comes to what America's role in the world should be, Trump, Johnson and Stein all take more isolationist approaches than Clinton. The health of the candidates themselves came up this fall \u2014 with Clinton's bout of pneumonia in September and Trump saying Clinton lacks the stamina to be president \u2014 but health care as a policy issue itself hasn't been a frequent talking point during the election. The Affordable Care Act and abortion have remained top of mind and paid family leave has recently received some attention, but other issues, like the opioid addiction crisis, have come up less often. Gun policy has been a big issue this year, amplified after the June shooting at a nightclub in Orlando, Fla., that killed 49 people. Clinton has been a strong advocate for tighter gun laws, which Trump has said, falsely, means she wants to \"take your guns away.\" Immigration has been one of the most visible campaign issues this election cycle, partly because of the Syrian refugee crisis. Also, because Trump entered the race in June 2015 declaring that Mexico was sending drug dealers, criminals and rapists to the United States and proposed building a wall between the two countries. Trump has stood by that proposal, advocating throughout his campaign for a tight border. Other candidates vary in their stances on refugees and on illegal immigration. As the baby boomers age, social security will continue to be top of mind as voters choose the next president. Candidates have proposed several scenarios to solve the problem of social security \u2014 that soon there will be too many people using it and not enough people paying in. Those proposals include raising the retirement age and increasing taxes. Education affects just about everyone \u2014 if you don't know a child in school, you certainly used to be one. But other than occasional talk of teachers, school choice or college debt, this issue has been nearly nonexistent during the 2016 election cycle, in comparison to more high profile topics like immigration and gun control. Antonin Scalia's death last February vacated the Supreme Court justice's seat on the bench and ignited a fight between Republicans and Democrats over whether or not the seat should be filled during an election year. Both sides of the aisle hope to fill the void with a judge whose views align with their own party. President Obama has nominated Merrick Garland, a moderate, but it's unlikely the open seat will be filled before the inauguration of the next president in January. The relationship between police and communities of color has been a huge theme on the campaign trail, but in very partisan ways. Trump has focused on supporting law enforcement and earned the support of the country's largest police union. Clinton, on the other hand, supports Black Lives Matter and has called for increased scrutiny and training for police. Ashley Young and Alexander Tin contributed to this story.

She says being a part of Growing Colorado Kids has led her to eat more healthful foods, although she still prefers the garden's strawberries to its vegetables.\n                \n                    \n                    Megan Verlee/Colorado Public Radio\n                    \n                \nhide caption Second-grader Kadija Noor's family came to the U.S. from Somalia. She says being a part of Growing Colorado Kids has led her to eat more healthful foods, although she still prefers the garden's strawberries to its vegetables. Two years ago, PawHser Moo's mother started pushing her and her sisters to join a group called Growing Colorado Kids. As Moo recalls, at first, she was far from thrilled by the idea. \"I was like, 'Oh my gosh, no! I have to wake up early!' \" says Moo \u2014 a pretty typical reaction for a 14 year old. Wake up early on Saturdays just to catch a van up to rural Adams County, about a half-hour drive from Denver, only to spend hours outside gardening? It was hardly her first choice for her weekends. \"I wanted to use my phone on Saturday and relax,\" says Moo. \"But it's more worth it, spending time here.\" For refugee families arriving in Colorado, like Moo's, the transition to life in America can be overwhelming. And most have to do it on a shoestring budget. Growing Colorado Kids is there to ease the transition. The nonprofit group helps refugee kids feed their families while also nourishing the kids' development. Two years after Moo first set foot on the small farm near Brighton, the native of Myanmar is one of the group's paid youth leaders. She's now teaching other kids how to manage the massive vegetable beds and take care of the farm's chickens, bees, donkeys and the other livestock. In return for their labor, the program's dozen kids get to take home most of the food the farm produces to their families' apartments in Denver and Aurora. Moo says she enjoys the fresh, tasty meals that result. \"It's also helped my parents because they're always busy and they don't have time to go to the grocery store,\" she says. The food the kids produce saves their families time. It saves them money, too. All of the program's kids are refugees from countries like Myanmar, Somalia and Ethiopia. And all of them qualify for free or reduced-price lunches at their schools. In the summer, when families have to supply all three meals a day, money can get really tight. Kids in the program construct a compost bin under the supervision of Chris Lines, whose wife, Denise, founded Growing Colorado Kids.\n                \n                    \n                    Megan Verlee/Colorado Public Radio\n                    \n                \nhide caption Kids in the program construct a compost bin under the supervision of Chris Lines, whose wife, Denise, founded Growing Colorado Kids. \"We hear that all the time, how grateful they are to have that little extra bit of help,\" says Denise Lines, the group's founder and director. Lines was working for a Denver-area refugee housing agency about a decade ago when she saw how hard it was for some families there to put healthful food on the table. At the same time, Lines wanted to do something to break through the isolation refugees often face in their new country. Gardening could meet both needs. \"Most of these families get moved into one square block, and so you're only seeing other people like you. You're not truly being \u2014 and I don't like the word 'integrated' \u2014 but you're not getting to know your neighbors,\" Lines says. When Growing Colorado Kids started, the group cultivated gardens in the yards of Lines' neighbors in northeast Denver, sharing their produce with the homeowners. A few years in, Lines and her husband realized their dream of moving to a small-acreage farm outside of the city, near Brighton. And they brought the program with them. On a recent day at the farm, the kids work alongside adult volunteers to harvest the garden's late-summer bounty. A second-grader named Kadija Noor makes a beeline to the strawberry patch. She says working here is way more fun than helping out at home. \"These chores are better, like harvesting strawberries, harvesting other stuff,\" she says. Much of that \"stuff\" goes straight into a lunch prepared by some of the kids. Another group has the enviable assignment of messing around with power tools and building things \u2014 on this day, a compost bin. When everyone sits down to eat, each group takes a turn explaining what they accomplished, practicing addressing their peers in English \u2014 a language with which they're all trying to grow more comfortable. All of these activities add up to much more than just learning farm skills. The program's real goal is to build community, while teaching things like communication skills and leadership, all to help the kids put on armor for a world where \"refugee\" is often treated as a bad word. Lines says the kids are news savvy, and very aware of the debate going on in this election over whether refugees pose a risk and how many the U.S. should take in. She says working together gives the kids another perspective on their experience. \"There is a pride to say that 'I'm a refugee,' \" Lines says. \"Not just 'I can survive,' but 'I can thrive, and I can take those situations and build upon them.' It's beautiful.\" The program also gives the kids a chance to appreciate their parents' experience. Most were farmers before war or oppression forced them off the land. Paw Hser Moo was born in a refugee camp in Thailand, but her father worked on a farm as a boy in Myanmar. He said his daughters are developing the patience that only comes from watching crops grow. And he hopes they'll make gardening a lifelong pursuit. After the day's work is over, the kids pile into an open-topped trailer for a dusty ride up and down the gravel road outside the farm. \"'Bye, farmers!\" Lines shouts as they turn out of the yard. The scene makes her nostalgic. \"We used to do that as kids, right? That's awesome.\" For these kids, the Growing Colorado Kids farm is a bridge between two worlds: a place to connect with the traditions their parents had to leave behind while also putting down new roots of their own.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump held the first of several postelection rallies, returning to the tone of his campaign and repeating many of the claims he made on the trail. But now he's the president-elect.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: It's often said that there's a big difference between campaigning for president and actually being president. Donald Trump may be learning that now. The president-elect has spent the last few weeks assembling the team he wants to run the country, but he's not ready to give up campaigning just yet. Trump kicked off a series of thank you rallies in Cincinnati last night. NPR's Scott Horsley has more on Trump's message to supporters. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: Thank you, everybody. Wow, thank you. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Donald Trump says his mission in these rallies is to thank the voters who elected him and invite their participation in what he calls the next chapter. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Now the real work begins. HORSLEY: First though, Trump seemed perfectly happy to spend a little time reliving the campaign, basking in the adoration of his most fervent supporters. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: You are the movement. I'm the messenger. I'm just really the messenger. Although I've been a very good messenger, let's face it, right? I've been a pretty good messenger. HORSLEY: And even as he appealed for Americans to come together now that the election's over, Trump couldn't resist settling some old scores with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, Republican opponents like Ohio Governor John Kasich and most of all, the news media. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: They kept saying there's no path and all this nonsense. So - and I go out and I see the people like this and I'd say, how are we going to lose? HORSLEY: Trump and his team celebrated a good news story this week when the Carrier air conditioning company announced that hundreds of jobs it was planning to move to Mexico would instead stay in Indiana. Trump had pressed the company not to move the jobs over the border. Indiana Governor and Vice President-elect Mike Pence says it paid off. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MIKE PENCE: Make no mistake about it, Carrier chose to stay in Indiana because America chose to make Donald Trump the next president of the United States. HORSLEY: Trump told supporters that's just the beginning of his efforts to rebuild the Rust Belt. But each time he started to discuss plans to cut corporate taxes or roll back regulation, he seemed to get distracted, then started ad libbing about the election. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: If a company wants to still leave the state of Ohio or Pennsylvania - or how about North Carolina? How well did we do in North Carolina, right? HORSLEY: Trump insists the U.S. economy is a mess, but he'll actually take over an economy that's seen considerable improvement in the last eight years. White House economist Jason Furman notes as of this morning, unemployment has fallen to just 4.6 percent. And wages have finally begun climbing after a long period of stagnation. JASON FURMAN: I think the economy's in very good shape. You know, I just wish we were able to inherit an economic situation like this, you know, eight years ago when we were sitting in the transition offices, you know, worried about what was coming next. HORSLEY: In rally settings like this, Trump has often been shown to stretch the truth, and last night was no exception. He exaggerated Midwestern manufacturing woes, the threat posed by Middle East refugees, even the scale of his election victory. But as former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told an audience at Harvard this week, Trump supporters are not bothered by that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) COREY LEWANDOWSKI: They understood that sometimes when you have a conversation with people, whether it's around the dinner table or it's at the bar or it's wherever it is, you're going to say something. And maybe you don't have all the facts to back that up, but that's how the American people live. HORSLEY: And one major fact Trump harped on last night is not in dispute. The bottom line, he says, is we won. Scott Horsley, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "German authorities have offered a reward of more than $100,000 as part of efforts to find a suspect in Monday's attack in Berlin. Twelve people were killed when a truck barreled into the market.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: In Germany, more details are emerging about a Tunisian man who's the subject of an international manhunt. German authorities are looking for him because he's been connected to the terrorist attack on a Christmas market in Berlin this week. The 24-year-old asylum-seeker was supposed to have been deported from Germany last summer. Authorities had previously considered him a terror threat. We go now to NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson. She's been covering the attack in the aftermath for us. There have been police raids, I understand, in Berlin and in the northwestern part of Germany. What can you tell us about them? SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: They were happening early this morning Germany time. Apparently, a hundred police commandos forced their way into two Berlin apartments. And there were raids reported in Dortmund in North Rhine-Westphalia, where the suspect, Anis Amri, was known to have hung out, as well as a refugee home in another northwestern town, where he was supposed to be living. Police haven't commented about the raids. MARTIN: So this is this man's name - Anis Amri. We know he's originally from Tunisia. What else can you tell us about him at this point? NELSON: He first landed in Italy in 2011 and is reported to have spent four years in Italian prisons for setting fire to a migrant shelter during a riot. Then, he came to Germany in mid-2015. Here in Germany, he had six different aliases with three different nationalities. In fact, the temporary German residency card that police found in the cab of the tractor trailer used in the attacks had one of those aliases, but he was ultimately identified through DNA that he left behind in the tractor trailer. Authorities had been on to him because they suspected him of planning a break in to finance a terror attack. And then he was under surveillance from March to September, but authorities couldn't really find him doing anything wrong other than dealing in low-level drugs, and so the monitoring stopped. And now he's being sought, as you mentioned. There's an international manhunt with a reward of roughly $104,000 being offered for information leading to his arrest. MARTIN: So he had requested asylum in Germany. As we mentioned, that request was denied. And then he just kind of slipped through the cracks, right? How did that happen? NELSON: Yeah, I mean, he was only held in a deportation center for two days because he didn't have any documents, and Tunisia refused to issue him a new passport. In fact, the Tunisian government was claiming he wasn't even one of their citizens. So German officials tell us that the Tunisians finally sent papers for Amri yesterday. But what happened in the meantime is, once he was released, he went into hiding. He disappeared. MARTIN: So what does this mean for security around Germany? I mean, a suspected ISIS attacker on the loose - are you seeing a security presence that's bigger than usual? NELSON: Well, that's certainly something that the authorities or that the government has promised, is a bigger police presence. I haven't really noticed it in the parts of Berlin that I've gone around, although I have seen these big concrete blocks that have been put up around Christmas markets. The German cabinet also passed measures for allowing increased video surveillance, which is a big deal here because there's a lot of sensitivity about that sort of thing because of the Nazi and East German Communist past here. You know, Germans do not like surveillance and that sort of thing the way we might accept it in the States. MARTIN: And lastly, Soraya, Angela Merkel has staked a lot of her chancellorship on her positions on open immigration, open borders, allowing refugees in. She's standing for re-election. I imagine this is complicating those efforts for her. NELSON: Yes, this is a real threat to her chances for re-election next fall. And even her allies are demanding that she quickly change Germany's asylum policy. They want asylum-seekers without documents not to be allowed to enter Germany unless they're properly vetted. And they do want those with deportation orders, of which there are, like, hundreds of thousands, to be rounded up and held at detention centers before they can be sent back to their countries. MARTIN: NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson in Berlin. Thanks so much. NELSON: You're welcome, Rachel. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

To glance at some of the political news this week, you'd think it was October. Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta did Meet the Press over the weekend to talk about Russia hacking the DNC's emails. Hillary Clinton aide Brian Fallon took to Twitter on Tuesday to question the FBI's investigation into Clinton's emails. Donald Trump and Bill Clinton sniped at each other. But it's mid-December. The voters and electors alike have cast their votes. And while millions of Americans are doubtless more than happy to have Election Day well behind them, they can still plan on hearing still more about the election in the coming days or even weeks. There's good reason for some of the continuing concern over the election. The FBI and CIA alike say they are now confident Russia hacked the DNC's emails, that Putin was involved, and it was all in an attempt to influence the election in Trump's favor. That could have very real repercussions. President Obama told NPR's Steve Inskeep that Russia's interference would spark U.S. retaliation. Bill Clinton stated that I called him after the election. Wrong, he called me (with a very nice congratulations). He \"doesn't know much\" ... especially how to get people, even with an unlimited budget, out to vote in the vital swing states ( and more). They focused on wrong states However, there will never be any way of knowing how much influence those hacked emails may have had on the election. (As Slate's Theodore Johnson put it, \"Russia didn't hack the U.S. election. It hacked the voters.\") Likewise, on Tuesday, Fallon took to Twitter to once again address the issue of Clinton's emails and the FBI's investigation: \"[FBI Director James] Comey's intrusion on the election was as utterly unjustified,\" referring to Comey's late-October announcement that the agency would be looking into thousands of emails that had just come to light. Meanwhile, some of the election relitigation has been in the form of petty taunts. Former President Bill Clinton this week said of Trump: \"He doesn't know much. One thing he does know is how to get angry white men to vote for him.\" That clearly irked Trump. The president-elect flung the insult back, tweeting that Clinton \"doesn't know much.\" In a subsequent tweet, Trump added that Clinton doesn't know \"how to get people, even with an unlimited budget, out to vote in the vital swing states (and more). They focused on wrong states.\" Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult & sophisticated than the popular vote. Hillary focused on the wrong states! I would have done even better in the election, if that is possible, if the winner was based on popular vote - but would campaign differently I have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that I spent FAR LESS MONEY on the win than Hillary on the loss! While Bill Clinton prompted these particular Trump tweets, they are an extension of something Trump has done before, pumping up his political prowess and taunting Hillary Clinton, who has maintained a low profile since Election Day. On Wednesday morning, Trump bragged about winning the election despite raising far less money than Clinton, and he again slammed her for having \"focused on the wrong states.\" Trump has repeatedly responded to the fact that despite winning the electoral vote comfortably, he lost the popular vote to Clinton by 2.8 million votes. At one point, he made the baseless claim that millions of fraudulent votes helped Clinton to that margin. Some of the lingering concerns about Election Day (for example, about a foreign power meddling in U.S. elections) are real. But it also means a deluge of Monday-morning quarterbacking after a long, nasty campaign. For their part, some Democrats are pushing the party to look forward instead of backward. The field of candidates for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee is growing. In addition, former Clinton campaign spokesman Jesse Ferguson wrote a strident op-ed at Time this week urging Democrats to move on. \"The time for mourning is over, Democrats. We've had over a month,\" he wrote, adding later that the party needs both introspection but also to consider the scope of its loss: \"Just because you epically lost an expectations game doesn't mean you epically lost an election.\" Meanwhile, Trump will have a country to run. He has been going through the requisite transition steps, even kicking off his Cabinet appointments more quickly than many other presidents, as the Washington Post's Philip Bump pointed out. But then, even amid the roar of news from around the world in the past couple of weeks \u2014 an assassination in Turkey, a refugee crisis in Syria, an attack on a market in Germany \u2014 Trump's Twitter feed suggests that his Electoral College win and popular-vote loss remain in the front of his mind (the juxtaposition still kind of annoying him). In a way, all of the backward-looking may be fitting for a candidate whose campaign was all about nostalgia (making America great again). But in one month, he will have a whole four years ahead of him (and maybe eight), not to mention some very big decisions to concern himself with.",

Austrian far-right candidate Norbert Hofer on Sunday congratulated his opponent in presidential elections after projections indicated that he had lost. Austria's far-right presidential candidate conceded defeat Sunday shortly after polls closed and preliminary results from the election showed Alexander Van der Bellen to win 53.6 percent of the vote. Van der Bellen's opponent, Norbert Hofer of the conservative Freedom Party brought in just over 46 percent of the vote. Final results will not be certified until absentee votes are counted on Monday, according to the Associated Press. The AP also reports that election officials said the remaining ballots will not alter the outcome, but the percentages each of the candidates received may vary. Polls going into the vote indicated the outcome would be tighter than what appears to have taken place. Hofer campaigned on an anti-immigrant platform that cast a spotlight on Austria's inflow of refugees, while the former leader of the Green Party and now President-elect Van der Bellen stumped on a message of tolerance and inclusion. As the BBC reports, political watchers took a keen interest in this campaign and were using it as a litmus test of how other populist candidates may fare in upcoming elections across Europe. \"The result is sure to be welcomed by establishment parties and officials in the EU. \"France, the Netherlands and Germany all face elections next year in which anti-mainstream and anti-immigration parties are gaining ground. \"A referendum underway in Italy is being closely followed for further signs of anti-establishment populism, with polls suggesting a setback for centre-left Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.\" Austria's president is a largely ceremonial role. Sunday's election was a do-over from May when Van der Bellen won by less than 1 percent of the vote. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reports from Vienna that Hofer called on his supporters to respect the outcome of the vote. And adds: \"Hofer had been poised to become the first far-right president in Western Europe since World War II and says he will run again in six years.\"",

Donald Trump kicked off his postelection \"thank you tour\" with a Thursday-night rally that sounded a lot like any of his campaign rallies. He said trade was dangerous, he warned about refugees, and his mention of his former opponent, Hillary Clinton, prompted supporters to chant \"lock her up.\" As was the case at many times on the campaign trail, Trump's presentation of facts requires some fact-checking and context. Here's a look at the president-elect's Thursday-night speech. \"We'll compete in the world. We want to compete in the world. But we're going to compete in the world where it's a two-way road not a one-way road. The advantages are going to come back to our country, and they haven't for many many years.\" It's hard to call trade a \"one-way road\" for the U.S. The U.S. has received lots of advantages from trade, although many of those benefits are hard to see. It's a point economists generally agree on: In a 2012 survey, 85 percent of top economists agreed that \"freer trade improves productive efficiency and offers consumers better choices, and in the long run these gains are much larger than any effects on employment.\" Likewise, 85 percent also agreed that \"on average, citizens of the U.S. have been better off with the North American Free Trade Agreement\" than they would have been without it \u2014 and as he did often during the campaign, Trump continued to slam NAFTA Thursday night. But what's important is that those economists were speaking in the aggregate \u2014 they were talking about Americans altogether getting their goods more cheaply and having a better standard of living, for example. Particular Americans are still worse off because of trade deals. When a U.S. factory moves overseas, it leaves the Americans who worked there jobless. It doesn't mean trade is bad, but it does mean that it doesn't benefit everyone equally and does indeed hurt some people. \"A shrinking workforce and flat wages are not the new normal. And we're not even talking about flat. ... Some of you in this audience [of] hardworking incredible Americans were making more money 20 years ago than you're making today.\" This one we can take piece by piece. For starters, the workforce is growing (in raw numbers). Presumably, Trump is referring to the \"labor force participation rate,\" which he also referenced sometimes on the campaign trail. That is smaller than it used to be, though it has leveled off recently ... and either way, the falling rate is not entirely a bad thing. The labor force participation rate measures the share of people 16 and older who either have work or are looking for work. After years of decline, the figure has stabilized in the past year or so. Some of that decline wasn't good \u2014 that is, it reflected people getting discouraged and giving up on the job search. However, some of the decline reflects demographic realities \u2014 in this case, the fact that baby boomers have started edging into retirement. That's not a bad thing. As for the wages part, it's true that many Americans aren't earning as much as they used to. The median household income as of 2015 was $56,516, still below a peak of $57,909 reached in 1999 (in 2015 dollars). To take Trump literally, that median is still above where it was exactly 20 years ago, but it's plausible that some Americans are earning less than they did back then. (That said, last year's median income figure was strong reading, considering that it was up by nearly $3,000 over 2014.) Of course, that's overall household income. As far as hourly wages themselves, it is true that wage growth has been slower than it used to be. Since the recession, wages have struggled to creep much above inflation. But just in the past year, wages have risen 2.5 percent. \"We are going to reduce taxes ... for the middle class in particular but for our companies.\" In its latest form, Trump's tax plan does reduce taxes for the middle class, but not \"in particular.\" In fact, it's much kinder to the highest-income Americans than to anyone else, according to an October analysis from the Tax Policy Center. It found that the middle 20 percent of earners would see their after-tax incomes go up by 1.8 percent under Trump's plan. The next 20 percent upward would see an increase of 2.2 percent, and the top 20 percent would see their incomes jump by 6.6 percent. At the very highest levels, among the top 0.1 percent, after-tax incomes would rise by 14.2 percent. Long story short: The higher the income group, the bigger the tax break in general. Trump has proposed a major corporate tax cut, as he indicates here. His plan would bring the top federal corporate income tax rate down to 15 percent from 35 percent. (Many businesses actually pay a much lower effective tax rate than 35 percent, thanks to deductions and other loopholes.) All of that said, his tax plan has already changed once, and it seems that it could again. Trump's nominee for Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, told CNBC this week that there won't be an \"absolute\" tax cut for the rich: \"Any reductions we have in upper-income taxes will be offset by less deductions. ... There will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class. There will be a big tax cut for the middle class, but any tax cuts we have for the upper class will be offset by less deductions that pay for it.\" \"The African-American community was so great to me in this election. They were so great to me. ... And I got it up to a number that's higher than all of the Republican candidates for years. And the Hispanic community, I did great with the Hispanic community. Great. Higher than people that were supposed to have done well. I felt it. And is this really a big surprise? We did great with women. Can you believe it? Great with women.\" Donald Trump got 8 percent of the African-American vote, according to exit polls. That's better than Mitt Romney's exit poll result in 2012 (6 percent) and John McCain's (4 percent) in 2008 (that said, these are differences of only a few points, so it may not be meaningful). But prior to McCain, 8 percent is no better than any Republican stretching back to 1972, at least, performed among African-American Republicans, according to exit poll data compiled by the New York Times. The exit polls do show that Trump did far better with Hispanics than many had expected, especially in light of some of his inflammatory statements about immigration. Twenty-eight percent of Latino voters voted for Trump, according to those polls. That's about how Romney performed among that group \u2014 he got 27 percent. And it's far better than Trump was polling with Latinos before Election Day. Polling firm Latino Decisions had him with 18 percent of Latinos' support in the week ahead of the election. That's one reason why groups like Latino Decisions have called the exit poll results into question, saying that exit polls are poor measures of smaller demographic subgroups, as well as that exit polls don't reach areas where high concentrations of Hispanics live. As far as women are concerned, Trump got 41 percent of their vote. That's not remarkable for a Republican candidate; exit polls showed Romney with 44 percent of women's votes in 2012, and 41 percent is also right in the ballpark of how women have voted for Republican presidential candidates since 1992. \"People are pouring in from regions of the Middle East \u2014 we have no idea who they are, where they come from what they are thinking and we are going to stop that dead cold. ... These are stupid refugee programs created by stupid politicians.\" Much of the criticism surrounding the U.S. refugee program these days surrounds the resettlement of Syrian refugees. As NPR's Brian Naylor reported in November 2015, it takes around 18 to 24 months for a refugee to go through the U.S. screening process. At that time, the U.S. had admitted 1,800 Syrian refugees over two years, half of whom were children. So \"pouring in\" is not correct here, as is the assertion that \"we have no idea who they are.\" However, some experts have voiced concerns that the lack of American intelligence resources in Syria means, as Naylor reported, \"there's no way to compile a thorough watch list of possible terrorists from Syria against which refugees can be checked.\"",

If any image haunts TV news, and perhaps our conscience, it's the seemingly ceaseless river of migrants seeking refuge from war, dictatorship and poverty. These desperate souls inspire pity, fear and election-year arguments about whether to offer them welcome or keep them out. Not surprisingly, many artists feel compelled to confront this refugee crisis. But the big question is: How do you engage a humanitarian tragedy without haranguing the audience or laying on a guilt trip? You get different but complementary answers in two prize-winning new works from Europe. One is an observational documentary, the other a quasi-mythic novel. Gianfranco Rosi's ravishingly shot Fire at Sea takes place on the tiny, unglamorous Sicilian island of Lampedusa, 70 miles from the coast of Africa. Year after year, tens of thousands of migrants turn up on disastrously overcrowded boats. So many come that the UN has an entire hazmat-suited system for handling them \u2014 they're rescued at sea, cleaned up, photographed, handed gold-foil survival blankets and put in holding camps before being shipped to the mainland. Rosi cuts between these newly arrived refugees and an impressionistic look at the islanders. For the locals, another boatload of refugees is basically something they hear about on the radio between golden oldies, like the one that gives this film its title. The newcomers don't affect the locals' daily round of cooking, scuba-diving or working as fishermen. Yes, there is one heroic doctor who helps the migrants and is outraged at the world's apathy \u2014 I salute you, Pietro Bartolo \u2014 but he's exceptional in every sense. The island's true exemplar is Samuele, a smart, naughty, but decent pre-teen who practices the slingshot and pulls words out of his tight-lipped relatives as if he were their therapist. While Samuele enjoys a happy, stable life, he is not without problems that feel a bit, well, metaphorical. He has a lazy eye that limits his vision and a gnawing anxiety he can't explain, although maybe we can, because we know what's happening in the background of his life. by Tommy Wieringa and Sam Garrett Hardcover, 231 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? Without ever saying it, Rosi suggests that Samuele is, like most of the West, cut off from the refugees' pain. Indeed, even as Fire at Sea moves us with the refugees' vulnerability, it shows how their tragedy has become normalized. It's been so folded into the routine of life in Lampedusa that folks scarcely notice it. You get a very different approach to the refugee situation in These Are the Names, a taut novel by the acclaimed Dutch writer Tommy Wieringa, which possesses a symbolic sweep that recalls J.M. Coetzee's Waiting for the Barbarians. Set in the former Soviet empire, the book also weaves two storylines, yet Wieringa's point differs from that of Fire at Sea. One of the stories centers on a boy who joins a small group of migrants traveling to the West from the republics of Central Asia. Abandoned in the middle of nowhere by crooked human traffickers, this rag-tag group \u2014 which includes a poacher, a small-time crook and a defenseless woman \u2014 begins a grueling, dog-eat-dog trek across a no man's land that's every bit as harsh as Cormac McCarthy's The Road. Wieringa juxtaposes their story to that of Pontus Beg, a lonely, 53-year-old cop in the imaginary city of Michailopol who feels that his life and his society have become unmoored. This starts to change when Beg investigates the death of a local rabbi and uncovers truths about his own origins he never dreamed of. As the refugees make their journey across the landscape, Beg journeys into the past \u2014 and into his own identity. Unlike Fire at Sea, the two different realities in the novel intersect. I won't give away what happens, but I will say that, unlike Samuele and his fellow islanders, Beg is pushed out of his comfort zone in a way that opens him to life. Reading the biblical Book of Exodus \u2014 the novel's title comes from its opening line \u2014 he realizes that these straggling migrants are living out a universal story about the search for the promised land. Taken together, Fire at Sea and These Are the Names offer us a two-step course in feeling empathy. Where Rosi suggests we must stop cloistering off the refugees' reality and acknowledge their presence as part of our lives, Wieringa reminds us that the refugees' desire to find a safe, nurturing place to call home doesn't make them unspeakably alien. It makes them just like us.",

            "article_content": "Utica has been shaped for decades by its policy of welcoming refugees. People there say the fear many Americans feel over new Muslim immigrants doesn't match their community.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: This country is really just beginning a debate over refugees. President-elect Donald Trump described them as a security threat. And he was tapping into real anxiety, which we found interviewing some voters around the country. But a community that welcomes refugees tells a more complicated story, to say the least. Utica in upstate New York has made refugee resettlement a part of its culture and economy for decades. North Country Public Radio's Brian Mann begins this report in a carload of refugees. BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: I'm riding through this Rust Belt city along the old Erie Canal, crammed in a tiny car with a bunch of high school girls, refugees from the civil war in Somalia. They wear long dresses and hijabs covering their hair. But they've lived in America most of their lives, so they're also texting and laughing about boys. Can I tell you guys something? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Yeah. MANN: You sound really American right now. (LAUGHTER) MANN: We stop at the community center where they hang out after school with other refugee kids. On this night, there are teenagers here from Nepal, Burma and Somalia. Hamida and Sharifa - we're using only their first names because the girls are just 16 - say they feel really welcome in Utica. Have you ever had, I don't know, prejudice or people disrespecting you? HAMIDA: Just in school, like, when I was younger, yeah. 'Cause people didn't understand a lot of stuff. So we had to tell people who we really are. SHARIFA: Yup. MANN: Utica is kind of a big, messy experiment in refugee resettlement. It started more than 40 years ago with Vietnamese and Cambodians and they've been coming ever since. Mayor Robert Palmieri says refugees help stabilize the city's shrinking population. ROBERT PALMIERI: We've had a rebirth into some of our older neighborhoods that were starting to decay. Refugees have come in here and revitalized them and made them a proud neighborhood once again. MANN: Utica is still struggling, but Palmieri says refugees have helped. They take low wage, low-skilled jobs in factories and hotels. Or they work at the big yogurt plant, Chobani, that was founded in central New York by Hamdi Ulukaya, an immigrant from Turkey. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HAMDI ULUKAYA: In the early days, I went to Utica to the refugee center and I said I'd like to hire these people. You know, we became a community, we became a family. And every single one of them has sweat and hard work into the success. MANN: Ulukaya spoke there at a meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative earlier this year in New York City. But the last few years, Chobani and the Utica experiment have sparked growing anger from right-wing websites. They've echoed claims that Muslim refugees bring disease to America and crime and terrorism. President-elect Trump took those fears mainstream during the campaign, warning about Somalis and Syrians. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: And we now have them in our country. And wait till you see - this is going to be the great Trojan horse - and wait till you see what happens in the coming years. MANN: Trump won this part of upstate New York. And the Republican who won Utica's his seat in Congress, Claudia Tenney, agreed with him, arguing during one of the debates that Syrian refugees are just too risky and should go somewhere else. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLAUDIA TENNEY: Provide safe and humanitarian areas for these people to be... LIZ BENJAMIN: So safe areas that are not here is what you're saying? TENNEY: Not here, right. BENJAMIN: OK. MANN: But there are thousands of Muslim refugees already living here - Afghans, Bosnians, Iraqis, Somalis and Syrians. So during my trip to the city, I tried to find people frightened or angry. I talked to local officials, business owners and people on the street. I couldn't find any backlash. KATHRYN STAM: I think that's made up. I think most of it is [expletive], actually (laughter). I don't see anything to be afraid of. MANN: Kathryn Stam is an anthropologist at the State University of New York who volunteers helping immigrant families. She says people who live near refugees have a much more grounded sense of how humanitarian resettlement works. STAM: They just see that they're just trying to get by, you know, they're raising their children. MANN: Since the 9/11 terror attack, the U.S. has taken in more than 750,000 refugees, many from Muslim countries. The program has proved remarkably safe. Refugees receive far more scrutiny than other immigrants. I asked Hamida and Sharif, the two high school girls from Somalia, what they think of Donald Trump and his warnings about people like them. HAMIDA: I'll just let him be him. If one person does something and he thinks everybody else does the same thing, that's actually a bad thing, a stereotype. MANN: Stereotype... HAMIDA: Yeah. MANN: ...He stereotypes? And what do you think of him? SHARIFA: I think that he likes to insult people. And I don't think he's going to make America greater. MANN: Whatever happens now with America's refugee program, they think their place here is safe. They say Utica is home. The week of the election, Hamida became an American citizen. And Sharifa says she plans to do the same soon. For NPR News, I'm Brian Mann. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Rachael Garrity posted a farewell message on Facebook. She told her \"friends\" \u2014 that's how she puts it in an email to NPR, in quotes \u2014 that she would delete her account. An email from her son followed: Are you OK? \"I am finding Facebook to have a negative impact on my continuing to keep a positive feeling regarding some of the people I have known longest and cherish most,\" writes Garrity, who has worked in not-for-profit marketing and publishing since the 1970s. I unfriended nearly everyone. ... I am building my own wall now. Susan Brubaker Knapp, Mooresville, N.C. Garrity was one of more than 150 people who have shared their stories with NPR, recapping how they are recalibrating their attitude toward social media after this year's election. Donald Trump's surprise victory ended an emotional roller-coaster of a presidential race, which has left Facebook, Google and Twitter scrambling to rein in a proliferation of fake news and harassing behavior. \"What was really shocking to me was how many people who I consider to be smart were sharing things that were not so smart, definitely obviously fake but matched whatever viewpoint that they pushed or agreed with,\" says Michael Lowder. He's Garrity's grandson \u2014 and he shared her story with NPR because, true to her word, she has quit Facebook, where NPR posted the call-out. As for himself, Lowder has no plans to abandon social media, and a few people wrote in to say they are actually doubling down, regretting not speaking out more before the election, or feeling freed to speak their minds now that Trump is president-elect, or finding support in like-minded communities. But the vast majority of emails \u2014 some of them nearing 1,000 words in length \u2014 read like testimonials to a therapist: I'm having a hard time focusing. I have questioned my friendships. I can't stop scrolling. I'm exhausted. One email to NPR ended with: \"It was good to get that off my chest.\" People are turning off TVs (one even canceled her cable \u2014 mass media are not off the hook, either), deleting social apps from their phones, rationing time spent on Facebook and Twitter, and shrinking their digital friend lists. Facebook felt like a summit on a frustrating, drawn-out illness, all of my friends doctors of their own dogma. Emily Prymula, Wadsworth, Ill. Facebook is a source of news for a majority of American adults, but in the vitriol and propaganda of the 2016 election, its proverbial public square for many users has devolved into a never-ending Thanksgiving-dinner debate \u2014 or an omnipresent Speakers' Corner. As Lowder says his father put it, opining on social media is the equivalent of shouting off a soapbox in the street: a declaration, rather than discussion. This view, of course, cuts against the way Facebook views itself. \"Friends and family come first\" was said to be its guiding value in a shakeup of the news feed algorithm revealed in June. Susan Brubaker Knapp from Mooresville, N.C., writes: \"The day after the election, the hate and darkness got to be too much. I unfriended nearly everyone. Now I have three friends: my husband and children. ... I do hold (Facebook) responsible for helping to spread disinformation that contributed to both the election results and the level of vitriol and hate in this country. I am building my own wall now.\" A similar sentiment from Todd Neigum: \"(The election) simply turned me off of Facebook. I started by unfollowing people I've known for 40 years. Neighbors, friends, family doesn't mean I have to wade through untold numbers of gloating, trashtalking, flamethrowing posts.\" Much of the consternation does come from supporters of Hillary Clinton, who find themselves inundated and overwhelmed by news about a candidate they oppose. But then there are people like Tin Samuel, a tech consultant from Kansas City, Mo., who did vote for Trump. Back in 2015, Samuel set up a second profile, splitting his closest connections from more professional ones, theoretically carving out a space to comfortably express his opinion. It hasn't worked out that way, he writes, as people who disagree with him \"lob insults\" and he has found he's censoring himself on both profiles: \"It's not just strangers that are engaging in this kind of behavior. It's people I've known for 20 years. ... It's one thing when you're insulted by a stranger on an NPR or CNN newsfeed. It's quite another when you're being threatened by someone who knows where you live. ... \"For the rest of the year at least, I'm going to stop talking about politics altogether online, and focus on the topics and things that I find more interesting. Technology, silly cat memes, Brazilian dance music, and food videos. You know, all that stuff the internet was always supposed to be about to begin with.\" And actually, a few people have reported creating a dual presence on the platform, turning to a new profile void of political pages and opinionated friends or family. Writes health care worker Jackie Prack from Greenville, S.C.: \"The election was the last straw for me. In the days after, all I saw was hate. From both sides. ... I decided that day to get rid of my original Facebook and create my 'new' Facebook ... full of running, bikes, breweries, cat videos, satire, art, music, hiking, food, and good people. ... If the world is falling apart, my head is solidly in the sand right now ... and it's nice down here.\" Rationing of social media time has been a common response, too. Clicking on Facebook in the morning is like blunt trauma to the brain https://t.co/Q5hzgum1jx Greg Jeffers, a teacher from Rowlett, Texas, describes himself as a \"deeply religious\" person and a social conservative \u2014 he voted for Evan McMullin, a former CIA officer who is a Mormon. Jeffers says before the election, he obsessively shared \"every article I was reading on Facebook\" and getting into arguments with friends and friends of friends, who as conservatives supported Trump. Unlike many users struggling to burst or embrace ideological bubbles formed on Facebook, Jeffers faced a different challenge: \"Since (Trump) won, I realized I would have at least four more years of being ideologically separated from my tribe. I also realized that I had become a meaner, more cynical person. ... \"I decided not to totally delete Facebook. It really is a good way to stay in touch with people. But, I did decide to have my wife change my password. And I decided that I would allow myself an hour a week (30 minutes on Saturday and 30 minutes on Tuesday or Wednesday) to peruse Facebook and stay caught up.\" Jeffers writes that he's thinking of shifting his time from Facebook arguments to something practical, spending time with his wife and daughters, his students, his church family. \"Maybe I can, through my church, teach ESL to refugees,\" he writes. And then there's Emily Prymula from Wadsworth, Ill., who says, in her rebound from social media overdose, she began researching how to run for local elected office: \"I can't make a difference or change someone's opinion through a Facebook discussion, but I can do so through being present in my community.\" She describes herself as an independent, which she says turned her news feed into an \"ideological battleground\": \"Facebook felt like a summit on a frustrating, drawn-out illness, all of my friends doctors of their own dogma, trying to convince one another that their preferred course of treatment had less severe side effects and a better long-term outcome for the patient. ... I turned off my notifications, and vowed to only post positive news about my life for my family and friends.\" Monica Eskin makes an interesting observation: \"There is a reason that voting is anonymous: so it doesn't destroy your ability to live with your neighbors. As their neighbor I know less about them than I do as their (Facebook) friend, and maybe that's the way it is supposed to be with your neighbors and coworkers, etc.\" But of course, many emails make the counter-point: \"Let's be honest, most political conversation happens on social media these days ... for better or for worse,\" writes Carmen Jenkins, who describes herself as a moderate, pro-life, anti-Trump Republican. \"If I want to have a voice in this conversation, I better engage,\" she says. \"I better engage in a way that promotes dialogue rather than shutting it down with judgments and generalizations.\" How effective Jenkins and others like her will be just might determine how social media shapes up (is it too soon to say this?) for the next election.",

Jeff Sessions pledges his support for then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump before speaking to supporters on Oct. 10 at a rally in Ambridge, Pa.\n                \n                    \n                    Jeff Swensen/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions pledges his support for then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump before speaking to supporters on Oct. 10 at a rally in Ambridge, Pa. Updated at 11:45 a.m. ET President-elect Donald Trump announced his selections today for three key posts: Michael Flynn for national security adviser, Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general and Rep. Mike Pompeo for CIA director. Trump's selections signal that he is prioritizing loyalty as he chooses nominees for top posts \u2014 turning to people who were early and outspoken supporters of his campaign. Sessions is a former U.S. attorney and current senator with lengthy experience with the Justice Department, but whose nomination for a federal judgeship was tanked by reports of racist comments. Flynn, a former lieutenant general, was pushed out of his role as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014 after clashing with top staffers. Pompeo is a representative who served both on the House Intelligence Committee and on the Benghazi committee. The attorney general and CIA director nominees will need to be confirmed by the Senate. The national security adviser does not need Senate confirmation. Sen. Jeff Sessions The 69-year-old Republican senator, who has been offered the position of attorney general, was one of the first lawmakers to ally himself with the Trump campaign. He embraces a forceful anti-immigration platform and a tough approach to fighting crime. Sessions \"is a world-class legal mind and considered a truly great Attorney General and U.S. Attorney in the state of Alabama,\" Trump said in a statement from his transition team. \"I am humbled to have been asked by President-elect Trump to serve as Attorney General of the United States,\" Sessions said. \"My previous 15 years working in the Department of Justice were extraordinarily fulfilling. I love the Department, its people and its mission. I can think of no greater honor than to lead them.\" Sessions is a former longtime U.S. attorney in Alabama who went on to serve as the top Republican member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which oversees Justice Department and FBI operations. But earlier in his career, that same committee denied him a position as a lifetime-tenured federal judge after lawyers testified he had used racially insensitive language. Sessions apologized for saying he thought the KKK was OK \"until I found out they smoked pot,\" describing the episode as a joke. His positions on social issues including same-sex marriage, marijuana legalization and funding for stem-cell research are conservative. As NPR's Ailsa Chang reported earlier this year, Sessions had a controversial career as a prosecutor and allegations of racism have followed him for decades. He first rose to national attention when he prosecuted three black civil rights workers for voter fraud; a defense lawyer called it \"voter persecution,\" and the jury returned no convictions. The president of the NAACP called Sessions' appointment \"troubling,\" while a legislative counsel at the ACLU called him \"the senator with probably the most anti-immigrant, anti-refugee, anti-child record in the Senate.\" Former Alabama Rep. Jo Bonner, a Republican from Sessions' hometown of Mobile, said President-elect Trump \"has supreme confidence in Sen. Sessions' judgment, his wisdom, his character and his loyalty.\" California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the committee that will review Sessions' nomination, said in a statement: \"Senator Sessions has served on the Senate Judiciary Committee for many years so he's well aware of the thorough vetting he's about to receive. And while many of us have worked with Senator Sessions closely and know him to be a staunch advocate for his beliefs, the process will remain the same: a fair and complete review of the nominee. While Senator Sessions and I differ on a great many issues, I am committed to a full and fair process.\" The current attorney general is Loretta Lynch, the first black woman in that position (as a child, she attended civil rights rallies in the South with her parents) and the former U.S. attorney for the eastern district of New York. Michael Flynn Then-Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn testifies before the House Select Intelligence Committee in February 2014. He was forced out of that role later that year.\n                \n                    \n                    Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Then-Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn testifies before the House Select Intelligence Committee in February 2014. He was forced out of that role later that year. The brazen retired Army lieutenant general, who was also an early supporter of Trump, has been offered the position of national security adviser. \"General Flynn is one of the country's foremost experts on military and intelligence matters and he will be an invaluable asset to me and my administration,\" Trump said in the transition team statement. Flynn said he was \"deeply humbled and honored to accept the position as National Security Advisor to serve both our country and our nation's next President, Donald J. Trump.\" Flynn has a track record of sharp elbows inside the U.S. intelligence community, as NPR's Tom Bowman wrote Friday. He was fired as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's military-focused spy service, after pushing to send more operatives overseas and clashing with top staffers and his ultimate bosses in the White House: \"Within military circles, Flynn was a highly respected \u2014 though at times controversial \u2014 career intelligence officer. He worked his way up the ranks, including stints as the top intelligence officer for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and as Gen. Stanley McChrystal's top aide in Afghanistan. ... \"Flynn, by then a three-star general, went on to run the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's military-centered spy service. But the workforce there complained he was trying to push through too many changes, including sending more employees overseas. \"Flynn argued that he was trying to get the bureaucracy to be more efficient, to do more. Critics said he couldn't run a large bureaucracy. He was forced out in 2014 after less than two years in the job.\" Flynn's return to government in a top administration post could enable him to settle any outstanding scores within the intelligence world, depending on the support he receives from the president and the way Trump structures decision-making inside his national security apparatus. During the Republican National Convention this summer, he joined in the chants of \"Lock her up,\" in reference to Hillary Clinton. \"It was a strange position for someone who was a career military officer and a registered Democrat from Rhode Island,\" Tom says. Flynn, who recently wrote a book called The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies, has called President Obama \"a liar\" and has troubled some former colleagues with his partisan political work, Tom reports. The current national security adviser is Susan Rice, the former U.N. ambassador who was sharply criticized by congressional Republicans for making what she later acknowledged were \"incorrect\" statements after the Benghazi attack. Trump's national security picks, including the choice of Flynn, illustrate the choices his administration will face as it translate the promises and rhetoric of the campaign into governance. For example, Flynn told NPR in August that he thought it would be impractical to impose a blanket ban on travel by Muslims from around the world to the United States. A full stop on such arrivals \u2014 which Trump later revised to a call for \"extreme vetting\" for those entering the U.S. \u2014 was one of Trump's signature campaign promises. As president and national security adviser, however, Trump and Flynn must decide how much of either idea they take into the new administration and try to make into reality. Another critical issue is the U.S. relationship with Russia. Candidate Trump repeated that he wanted better ties with Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin, and for the two countries to work together in Syria to fight the Islamic State. (President Obama pursued such a deal but could not conclude one with Moscow.) Flynn's situation is even more nuanced. He's called Russia \"an enemy\" of the U.S. in his public comments and suggested in a book this year that it's part of a global axis arrayed against the United States. But Flynn also traveled to Moscow last year as a guest of Putin for a banquet celebrating the Russian state news agency RT, part of the Kremlin's propaganda operation targeting the West. RT quoted a description of Flynn as a 'Russia-loving' appointment in its headline on Friday. Rep. Mike Pompeo House Committee on Benghazi member Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., questions then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, during a hearing in October 2015.\n                \n                    \n                    Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption House Committee on Benghazi member Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., questions then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, during a hearing in October 2015. Pompeo, a third-term Republican congressman from Kansas, has been offered the post of CIA director. \"I am honored to have been given this opportunity to serve and to work alongside President-elect Donald J. Trump to keep America safe. I also look forward to working with America's intelligence warriors, who do so much to protect Americans each and every day,\" Pompeo said. According to his congressional biography, he graduated from West Point and served as a cavalry officer. He attended Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of the Harvard Law Review, before entering business as an executive in aerospace manufacturing and the oil industry. He served on the Energy and Commerce committee as well as the House Intelligence Committee, and was a member of the House Select Committee on Benghazi. The current CIA director is John Brennan, who joined the CIA in 1980 and was a station chief in Saudi Arabia and the chief of the national counterterrorism center. Like Flynn, Pompeo \u2014 if confirmed as CIA director \u2014 would face decisions about how much of Trump's campaign rhetoric to attempt to implement as policy. Pompeo has been as critical as Trump of the Iran nuclear deal, for example \u2014 would the two work together to dismantle it, or focus on other ways to try to punish Tehran?",

In the decades since, he's helped others arriving at the airport.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Refugees - the demand to take them in and the fear of what they may do were at the heart of this year's election debate. Most people never actually meet them. But for the man we're going to hear from next, they're an everyday part of the job. Omar Nur works for the International Organization for Migration, which arranges travel for refugees approved for resettlement. Nur is a former refugee himself from Ethiopia. Reporter Will Coley met him at New York's JFK Airport. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Good morning. OMAR NUR: Good morning. Well, my name is Omar Nur. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Good morning. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Good morning. NUR: So today we have about 367 people arriving. WILL COLEY, BYLINE: Nur has met thousands of refugees at his job with IOM. NUR: Some of them are coming from Addis Ababa, from Kathmandu, Dar Es Salaam... COLEY: Nur remembers everything about the day in 1980 that he came to the U.S., even the flight number. NUR: On TWA Airlines 881, somewhere around 5:20. From the minute I arrived, what I said is this is a place where I want to work. COLEY: Nur welcomes refugees just like he was welcomed decades ago. Nur was raised in a Muslim family. He says he grew up in a village where everyone helped each other. NUR: What I teach my staff is every employee in the airport has impact. They will remember your actions. So please treat these people humanly. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: (Over loudspeaker) Delta Airlines connecting passengers... COLEY: Inside terminal seven, the new arrivals file into a corner of passport control. I wasn't given clearance to interview them, so I watched. Everyone looks dazed and jet-lagged. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: Please tell ladies and children to go over there and sit down. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: OK. (Speaking foreign language). COLEY: Each family carries a large IOM plastic bag with important documents inside. Arife Bek double checks names and destinations. ARIFE BEK: You're going to Providence? UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Providence. BEK: Sign here. These all belong to you. COLEY: This Syrian family has gone through years of screenings and interviews, waiting for this moment. Nur says this is nearly the last step - signing their names. NUR: Until now, they are foreigners. But once they get out of this building, they are like anybody else. COLEY: In the arrivals area, IOM helps refugees with connecting flights or van shuttles. Now that they're in the U.S., refugees must eventually pay back IOM for their plane tickets. Nur started a charity in his free time, rescuing unclaimed strollers some Lost and Found and giving them to arriving families. NUR: When I give them the baby strollers, they think now here is America (laughter). Really, America is a land of opportunities, that it starts there, you know. COLEY: Nur knows refugee arrivals will never forget when they arrived. NUR: I see every day myself in their shoes. COLEY: Next year, Nur and his team plan to meet 35,000 refugees traveling through JFK. For NPR News, I'm Will Coley in Queens, N.Y. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "A Syrian refugee father came to the U.S. with his daughter to escape the war. Now they're telling their story to groups of Americans with the help of a U.S. Marine veteran.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Syrian refugees when he was running for president. During his second debate with Hillary Clinton, he said they were definitely in many cases ISIS-aligned, and he called them a great Trojan horse. Well, NPR's Deborah Amos now introduces us to a Marine veteran who has taken up the cause of those refugees and a father and daughter who fled Syria for the U.S. a couple of years ago not knowing that they'd be part of this intense political debate. DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE: Mohammed and Lulu - no last names because of family back home - now when Mohammed and his 17-year-old daughter give public talks, Mohammed has a killer opening line. He's been telling American audiences, I'm Syrian; you're supposed to be afraid of me. MOHAMMED: (Laughter) They laugh mostly because they knew that I'm, like, a usual guy like them. I have children. I love my children. So this is why they laugh when I tell them that I am the one that you should be afraid of. AMOS: He was a software manager in Damascus, a consultant for Yahoo who often visited the U.S. In 2011, Mohammed sided with what started as a peaceful revolt against a repressive regime, a high crime, he says, often punished by torture and death. MOHAMMED: And when I knew that the regime there knew about what I'm doing, I know that I should flee out of Syria. AMOS: Lulu, were you worried for your father? You must have known he was doing that. LULU: I did not know, actually. He kept it very secret. AMOS: Detention came not in Syria but when they landed in America in 2014. Immigration officials sent them to a detention center in rural Pennsylvania where they would stay for more than five months. They got caught up in a controversial Obama administration program meant to discourage asylum seekers from Central America, mostly mothers and children, in a facility called a family detention center. MOHAMMED: Which is, like, something very horrible, actually, to know that there's something called family detention center. AMOS: Lulu, what was it like to be in jail with your dad? LULU: It was surreal. From one side, it was good that I was with my dad, you know, that I wasn't put in some juvie, you know, detention center. But still it was horrible. AMOS: A week after their release May 2015, Mohammed and Lulu returned to the Pennsylvania center part of a demonstration led by immigration lawyers and advocates to protest against the policy and the place. They were featured in a video produced by Human Rights First, an advocacy group in Washington. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: What do you think the hardest thing was? MOHAMMED: The hardest thing is that we did not know when we are going to go out. LULU: Yeah, the feeling that you were trapped... AMOS: Since then, they've jumped headlong into American culture - high School for Lulu - for Mohammed, a high-tech job in New York. And they've become refugee stars. SCOTT COOPER: I think Mohammed is an exceptional spokesman because he immediately is someone that we can all relate to. It was him trying to take care of his family - is the reason that he left Syria. AMOS: Scott Cooper is the Marine veteran in the partnership. At Human Rights First, he launched Veterans for American Ideals last year to advocate for military interpreters and Syrian refugees. His conviction comes from tours in Iraq, Afghanistan and Bosnia where he saw what happens to civilians caught in the crossfire. He says his mission is more urgent now that the next president threatens to halt the Syrian refugee program. Cooper and 30 vets plan to visit Washington and lobby lawmakers. Do you think this is a hard argument in a time of terrorism? COOPER: There's two points I'd make. Those that wear the uniform care a great deal about our national security. AMOS: His second point - most Americans have never met a refugee. COOPER: Putting a face to that helps people understand a bit more who these people are and that they are not in fact a threat and that they are thoroughly vetted and screened. AMOS: Cooper promotes Mohammed and Lulu's public talks. MOHAMMED: It's, like, very refreshing to know that there is some veterans who are thinking in a very - the right way (laughter) about immigration. AMOS: The news is always on in this tidy New Jersey apartment. Mohammed says he thought he knew America on his business trips here. He was shocked by the election threatening America's traditional open door, he says. MOHAMMED: One of the greatest thing that United States has offered the world is her immigration policy. And now there's some people who are trying to kill what makes America great in the first place. AMOS: He's made it to safety with Lulu, but his wife and younger daughter are still in Syria. LULU: I don't think he can be fully happy with half of our family still back home, you know? AMOS: Approval to get them to America, he believes, is now stalled by the campaign of fear.

The former Defense Intelligence Agency boss is a Trump national security insider.\n                \n                    \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn appeared with Donald Trump during a town hall on Sept. 6 in Virginia Beach, Va. The former Defense Intelligence Agency boss is a Trump national security insider. What is Donald Trump's national security plan? Some things are clear: Trump supports billions of dollars in new Pentagon spending for military hardware. He'd permit more veterans to seek care outside the federal system of the Department of Veterans Affairs. He'd keep open the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Much else, however, is not. During Trump's campaign against Hillary Clinton, the candidates rarely talked about terrorism, Iraq, Syria or other issues, aside from using it as a way to condemn one another. Trump blasted Clinton for what he called the failure of President Obama's administration to safeguard the stability of Iraq after the U.S. withdrawal in 2011. He complained the U.S. hadn't gotten anything for its efforts and should have \"taken the oil.\" Does that mean President-elect Trump supports preserving an American military force in Iraq? Would he order American troops to seize Iraqi or Syrian oil infrastructure and bring the subsequent revenues into the U.S. Treasury? Potential advisers No one is sure. Trump, who has no military experience and has never held elective office, may rely heavily on his advisers and Cabinet officials to set the direction. Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions, a Senate Armed Services Committee member and early endorser of Trump, has been discussed as a potential secretary of defense. Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, could be a potential secretary of state. Other Republican names in early discussion for national security appointments include Reps. Randy Forbes of Virginia and Duncan Hunter of California. Retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, a former Defense Intelligence Agency boss, is another Trump insider on national security, as is former CIA director James Woolsey, who worked for the administration of President Bill Clinton. They could return to government to lead in Trump's intelligence community. Sessions and Forbes gave an interview to Defense News before Election Day to describe Trump's support for increased Pentagon spending, including on more troops for the Army and Marine Corps, more warships for the Navy and more combat aircraft for the Air Force. Forbes told the newspaper that Trump's intention was for the Pentagon to be in the driver's seat in terms of its own management, following what he and other critics have called \"micromanagement\" by the Obama White House. \"I think that with a President Trump, you'll see him coming out literally within the first few days saying that we are going to have an international defense strategy that is driven by the Pentagon and not by the political National Security Council,\" Forbes said. \"That's a clear game changer, because if you look around the globe, over the last eight years, the National Security Council has been writing that. And find one country anywhere that we are better off than we were eight years [ago] \u2014 you cannot find it,\" he added. All of the potential advisers discussed so far are longtime Washington hands who embody Republican orthodoxy on national security thinking. The more Trump delegates to them or officials like them, the more familiar his administration could look. What no one knows today is the degree to which Trump himself will be involved. Controversial statements Nations around the world are watching that involvement closely based on Trump's past statements, which raised doubts about his commitment to NATO and other longstanding U.S. allies, including Japan and South Korea. Those two Asian nations host tens of thousands of American troops and take shelter underneath an American nuclear umbrella designed to deter an attack by North Korea or China. Both South Korea and Japan host sites for American missile defense equipment. A reduction in U.S. commitments could have huge ripple effects for the region. Then there is Afghanistan. \"Interestingly, the United States' longest-running war, to which massive resources continue to be funneled, was almost completely ignored during the election by both candidates,\" said Dan Wasserbly, Americas editor for IHS Jane's Defence Weekly, in an analysis posted this week. More than 8,000 American troops remain posted in Afghanistan, as its security situation deteriorates. Obama said those troops, like those deployed to Iraq and Syria, aren't in a \"combat role,\" but Americans serve very close to danger and continue to be wounded and killed as violence endures. Obama decided years ago to settle on \"Afghan good enough\" and slowly reduce troop levels there as American forces trained Afghanistan's own military and police. But even he had to pause that draw-down in the face of gains by a still-dangerous Taliban insurgency. What to do next will be one of the top issues for the new president. Tensions with Russia One area in which Trump has suggested he'd increase American commitments is with Russia. During the campaign, he suggested he wanted the two powers to work together to fight the Islamic State in Syria, something they'd failed to agree on after months of negotiation under Obama. This week, Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a telegram to Trump congratulating him on his victory. Trump and Putin's relationship was the subject of intense discussion during the campaign. The U.S. intelligence community said top Russian leaders had directed the campaign of cyber-mischief that embarrassed Clinton, Democratic leaders and others, mostly through the release of hacked emails. Trump rejected that story out of hand. Now, as president, he'll be able to see the forensic evidence the intelligence community assembled that connects the Kremlin with the Clinton hacks. He and his advisers will have to decide how to respond to what amounted to the helping hand from Putin that put them in office. At the same time, the new administration will be deciding whether to follow through with planned troop deployments to Eastern Europe that Obama hoped would deter Russia, and whether to try again to join forces with Russia in Syria. Syria's president, Bashar Assad, was pleased that Clinton lost and the anti-government forces that had been supported by the U.S. are now worried Trump could cut them off. Syrian refugees driven away by the war are also wondering whether they'll be able to resettle in the United States following Trump's onetime proposal to ban all Muslims from entering, one he later changed to a call for \"extreme vetting.\" That policy provides an example of the transition involved from Campaign Trail Trump to President Trump. The page on his official website with the transcript of his call for the Muslim ban disappeared from the web for a few days. Then, per reports this week, it was back online.",

Canalija called Donald Trump's win \"tragic\" and said she is feeling depressed over it. On Tuesday, more than 128 million people voted for our next president. Nearly half were elated with the results: a Donald Trump victory. Though he failed to win the popular vote, Trump won 29 states (as of this writing; still waiting on Arizona and New Hampshire) and prevailed in key battleground states, including Ohio, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Exit polls show that a majority of white people \u2014 spanning all age ranges \u2014 voted for Trump. Non-college-educated white people especially loved him. And though it's true that his support was overwhelmingly white \u2014 the majority of people of color voted for Clinton, according to CNN's survey \u2014 there's a striking caveat: Twenty-nine percent of Asians and Latinos and 8 percent of black people voted for Trump. But 69 million people chose someone else. Many were turned off by the business mogul, who once described Mexican immigrants as rapists, called for the deportation of Syrian refugees, advocated banning all Muslim immigrants, touted the benefits of the unconstitutional stop-and-frisk program and had once been sued by the Justice Department and accused of housing discrimination. It made for a contentious and fraught campaign. Early on Election Day, we asked our readers and listeners to tell us what they thought about the future of race relations in the U.S. \"I'm scared for myself, my children, and my family,\" wrote Fallon Banks, a black woman whose father is an immigrant from Cape Verde. \"I'm scared that folks are going to pretend that this election is about social stratification, when it is clearly about protecting white supremacy.\" Many of the responses we got \u2014 nearly all of them, in fact \u2014 looked like that. They centered on the fear, dread and resignation that some Americans are feeling. The vote totals present two very different outlooks inspired by the president-elect. Here are some perspectives, most from the America that had hoped for something else.",

            "article_content": "North Carolina's most prosperous area is experiencing a housing boom, and population is on the rise. But voters here say it's more than just economic issues that will determine their vote next week.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: This election looks very different from the top and the bottom of the economy. We saw that when visiting the richest county and the poorest county in North Carolina, which is a presidential swing state. The poorest is a rural zone. We visit elsewhere on today's program. The richest is Wake County, where the median household income is $66,000, far above that of the nation as a whole. TODD MASINTER: And we're going to make our way out of here and go explore some of Raleigh... INSKEEP: Todd Masinter was our tour guide through the state capitol, which is Wake County's largest city. We joined a tour group riding two-wheeled Segway scooters downtown. MASINTER: Watch your wheels. There's a small pothole here to your right. INSKEEP: We're rolling past a restaurant. We're actually going through the outdoor tables on these Segway scooters. MASINTER: We are in the middle of a massive housing boom right now. Behind you, if you're feeling comfortable, pivot around - it's a 22-story sky house apartment building. That's brand new. INSKEEP: This old city, with its buildings from before the Civil War, is also part of a region filled with new tech firms and universities. Businesses all over Wake County share in that prosperity, like the rock climbing gyms co-owned by Joel Graybeal. Wow. How high is the ceiling in here? JOEL GRAYBEAL: So the tall walls go to 55 feet. INSKEEP: And there is someone very near the top, climbing up a vertical... GRAYBEAL: There is someone quite near the top. INSKEEP: Graybeal is one of many people who've moved from elsewhere to the Research Triangle region. He was a banker and then changed careers. If you're looking across the country, what would make Raleigh the smart place to open a business? GRAYBEAL: Lots of smart people. INSKEEP: He says his customers include engineers and software designers. GRAYBEAL: This sport appeals to them because it's not just the physical aspects of the sport. It's the mental and the problem solving aspects. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: All right, you got it. Let's go for it. Oh, [expletive]. INSKEEP: When asked to name the area's problems, Graybeal mentions traffic. That's a symptom of Wake County's rapid population growth. Yet for all the positive signs, Graybeal is not entirely satisfied. He's bracing for higher insurance costs. His small business offers health benefits to employees. And if he continues that, he says, Obamacare will soon require him to change to a more expensive plan. GRAYBEAL: Our insurance carrier today told me that our rate, if we were on an ACA-compliant plan today, Steve, 70 percent increase in premium. INSKEEP: Seventy, seven-zero? GRAYBEAL: Seven-zero percent increase. INSKEEP: Graybeal told us he'd rather not reveal how he's voting this fall. He has business associates and relatives on both sides. That is one way that North Carolina's richest county resembles the poorest. In both places we found people who grew anxious when discussing politics. When you come from the poorest county in North Carolina to this county, the wealthiest, you just notice the signs of prosperity everywhere. We're on the campus of North Carolina State University, lovely tree-lined campus. The parking lots are jammed. And early voting is underway just up the way here in this building. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: You have ID? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: OK. INSKEEP: This is a line. I mean, this is going to be a little while. During the half-hour wait, we talked with three NC State seniors. What do you guys want to do when you graduate? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: We're figuring that out (laughter). UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: Yeah. We're seniors. INSKEEP: The voters wore Hillary Clinton stickers. They were Taylor Jones, Anna Arroyo and Kelly Hillsgrove, who's voted one time before. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: This time I feel like I've really made this decision myself. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: We've watched all the debates together. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: We've been really informed and really made this decision for ourselves without letting each other influence us or our friends or family. INSKEEP: What difference does it make if there's a woman president? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: It opens a lot of doors for us. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: And honestly, I mean, I'm not voting for Hillary because she's a woman. I mean, she's the most experienced candidate. And, yeah, I agree with everything she wants to do. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: She's moving forward instead of back. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: Yeah. It's just moving forward, like, it's... UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: I think you got to move forward and you got to stay progressive. And there's only one that really does that. INSKEEP: You mean Trump seems backward-looking to you? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: Absolutely. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: I think we would be going back in time. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: He wants a wall. You don't do that anymore (laughter). UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: I was born in Mexico so that, to me, is just absolutely absurd. There's just no - there's just no way I could ever vote for somebody so backwards. INSKEEP: So many younger people have moved to Wake County that it's median age is now 35, below that of the nation as a whole. Younger voters helped to explain why the county has voted Democratic for president in recent years. It is an open question though how big the county margin could be in 2016. Near the university, we met people who embrace their changing home but are also conservative and must now decide. UNIDENTIFIED TRAIN CONDUCTOR: All right. Everybody ready to go on a train ride? UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: Yeah. UNIDENTIFIED TRAIN CONDUCTOR: All aboard. INSKEEP: Step across the tracks of the kids-size train in Raleigh's Pullen Park... (SOUNDBITE OF TRAIN WHISTLE) INSKEEP: ...And you arrive at a playground, which is where we met Justin and Sarah Leonard. They had a 3-year-old son and a newborn in a stroller under a blanket. How old's the baby in there? SARAH LEONARD: He is just over a week old. INSKEEP: Oh, my goodness. Wow. LAUREN MIGAKI, BYLINE: Oh, my gosh. Congratulations. INSKEEP: That's our producer Lauren Migaki. Justin pushed the older child on a swing as we talked. The Leonards are young and religious. S LEONARD: We struggled with infertility for several years, and I just think that life begins at conception. INSKEEP: They're also part of Wake County's high-tech economy. Justin is a patent lawyer whose clients are often from Europe. You're part of the global economy. JUSTIN LEONARD: Oh, that's very, very true. INSKEEP: Which is part of his struggle with the presidential election. He's not sure he can rely on Donald Trump in foreign relations... J LEONARD: To be respectful of the other nations involved and, frankly, any other people involved. S LEONARD: He brings Trump up specifically because we've always voted Republican for president in the past. And this is our first year that we're really still not quite sure how we're going to vote on Tuesday (laughter). INSKEEP: They might cast a third party vote as a protest. Or they might just vote for Trump after all. Hillary's not coming up as a choice for you, it doesn't sound like? S LEONARD: She would not be a choice for us. INSKEEP: They don't agree with her support for abortion rights. They don't agree with her support for same-sex marriage. They fear their conservative views are becoming less socially acceptable. Yet their views on life, which have made them Republican, also make it harder to vote for Trump. S LEONARD: That is one of our struggles with Trump, that he is pro-life but his view of refugees and immigration doesn't really feel like it's valuing life to me because those are people, too. And to not care for people that are trying to escape war is just - it's falling flat on valuing life. INSKEEP: North Carolina's most prosperous county has taken in hundreds of refugees, including some from Syria. The Leonards don't view them as much of a threat. Once their newborn is older, they say they plan to volunteer to help refugees. Before that, they must make the agonizing decision of how to reconcile their values with their votes. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: So that's the richest and the poorest county in a swing state.

As a home to one of the nation's largest populations of Middle Eastern immigrants, the Detroit area is a natural destination for refugees fleeing violence in places like Syria. But the leader of the largely suburban county that neighbors the city has called for a stop to these refugee resettlements. That has become a hot issue in the race for that county's executive. Longtime Oakland County Executive L. Brooks Patterson typically wins re-election by big margins. He's one of Michigan's best-known Republican officeholders. More than a million people live in the county, which is made up largely of sprawling suburbs and exburbs that surround Detroit. It's also the No. 1 destination in the state for Syrian refugees, but Patterson says it's time for that to stop. \"They have no intention of inculcating themselves into the American way,\" Patterson told Detroit TV station WDIV. Patterson says he doesn't trust the government's vetting process. His office did not respond to an interview request, but this is what he said to WJBK, a Detroit TV station: \"You've got to vet 'em,\" Patterson said. \"What do you know about them? Do they have any criminal records? What about public health? Do they have [tuberculosis]? Do they have any other kind of communicable disease?\" Vicki Barnett is the Democrat running against Patterson in the executive race, and she doesn't agree with her opponent's view of those who have sought refuge and are still seeking it in her county. \"It was women and children fleeing for their lives. That's what we're talking about here,\" Barnett says. \"And the fact that Syrian refugees have been settled in Oakland County for the last few years and crime has not escalated should be proof enough that this is not an issue when they are vetted \u2014 and they are being vetted.\" Nadal Al Hayek spent three years in a refugee camp in Jordan before coming to an apartment in Michigan's Oakland County.\n                \n                    \n                    Rick Pluta/Michigan Radio\n                    \n                \nhide caption Nadal Al Hayek spent three years in a refugee camp in Jordan before coming to an apartment in Michigan's Oakland County.

He spent three years in a refugee camp in Jordan before coming to an apartment in Oakland County. A friend, Mohammed Aboushaar, who is also a Syrian refugee, interprets. \"It took me around a year of having appointments, medical reports, government check, going to the embassy, come back and having a bunch of appointments to confirm that I can come to the United States,\" Al Hayek says. Al Hayek says his family fled Syria because it was no longer a safe place for his daughter and son, now five and two. In Michigan, Al Hayek works in a sign shop, and he's taking English classes at a community college. He says his ambition is to get an agricultural degree from Michigan State University. Before they left Syria, Al Hayek and his family worked as fruit farmers. \"I would like a big farm here in Michigan,\" Al Hayek says. \"I work in bees, honey, vegetables, fruit.\" Mihaela Mitrofan heads the refugee resettlement services for Samaritas. She says the local controversy has been a distraction. \"Oftentimes, we find ourselves pulled from the core of our mission, which is helping refugees integrate in our community, and addressing all the misinformation circling around,\" Mitrofan says. But Mitrofan says the controversy has also resulted in a surprising windfall \u2014 an increase in donations as well as families and churches willing to sponsor refugees.",

Playwright Qui Nguyen usually describes his show, Vietgone, as a \"sex comedy\" about his parents. He also acknowledges that that's a strange thing to do. The play does have a lot of sex in it. There are raunchy jokes, and the characters frequently and unabashedly lust after one another and act on those desires. Nguyen said he wanted to make his characters \u2014 fictional Vietnamese refugees based on his parents \u2014 three-dimensional. \"It's something that you don't see very often in American media, where Asian characters are sexy; and when they're sexy, they're a fetish of sort,\" said Nguyen, whose play opens at the Manhattan Theater Club at the end of October and runs until late November. The play is not exactly about sex. Neither is it just a love story about his parents. It's about being displaced from home and family. It's about the struggle to start a new life in a new place, and it arrives in the theater at a time when refugees and immigrants are at the center of a contentious presidential race. When Nguyen began to write Vietgone three years ago, he sat down with his parents and tried to extract their stories, some of them painful; stories that they'd glossed over when he was younger. \"Anybody coming from a tumultuous situation like the Holocaust, Vietnam or Syria \u2014 they often don't want to talk about it,\" Nguyen said. \"So the first thing I did was get my dad drunk a whole lot, and that kinda freed up the chops a little bit. But what really got them talking ... is that Asian parents really hate the idea of their kids being dumb. So I pretended to be dumb and say things like, 'Oh the Vietnam War was a war between Vietnam and France, right?' And they're like, 'No, that's wrong! Why you so stupid?' Kinda getting them atrociously mad was the thing that got them to open up to me. Qui Nguyen \"Kinda getting them atrociously mad was the thing that got them to open up to me.\" Nguyen discovered that his parents' meeting wasn't love at first sight, like they'd told him. It was purely a hook up. He found out that his mom left a younger brother and boyfriend behind when she fled Vietnam, and he learned more about the pain his parents felt over what they'd lost. Nguyen's father, Quang Nguyen, was a helicopter pilot for the South Vietnam Air Force. He had a wife and two children in Vietnam. After the fall of Saigon in April 1975, Quang helped Vietnamese allies flee by helicopter, but had to leave his own family behind when he was evacuated. When he arrived at the Ft. Chaffee refugee camp in Arkansas, he was riddled with guilt and tried desperately to find a way back to Saigon. He never returned to that family. Tong Nguyen was working for the U.S. Embassy when Saigon fell and could take only her mother with her when she fled to America. She met Quang at Ft. Chaffee. They married and had three children. Nguyen wrote it all into the play. \"The whole time they didn't think I was writing about them, because what I told them was I was going to write a play generally about Vietnamese people \u2014 and it was not about them,\" Nguyen said. \"And they told me not to put it in, but I did, because I'm an asshole.\" Jennifer Ikeda stars as Nguyen's mother, Tong. Raymond Lee plays Nguyen's father, Quang.\n                \n                    \n                    Carol Rosegg/Courtesy of the Manhattan Theater Club\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jennifer Ikeda stars as Nguyen's mother, Tong. Raymond Lee plays Nguyen's father, Quang. The South Coast Repertory gave him free rein to produce the project in 2013. By that time, Nguyen, who writes for Marvel Studios, had received props for previous plays like She Kills Monsters and Alice In Slasherland. He started the award-winning theater company Vampire Cowboys, known for its live-action comic book plays. \"I think, as a kid, you just want to show how awesome your parents are,\" Nguyen said. \"And when I became a playwright, I wrote these comedies; these weird comic book geek theater things. I didn't think I [was] a writer who could reflect Vietnamese refugees. At some point, I realized, my parents are getting older... and I was like, you know what, I need to get over that. Qui Nguyen \"I didn't think I [was] a writer who could reflect Vietnamese refugees. At some point, I realized, my parents are getting older, my kids are getting older, and I was like, you know what, I need to get over that.\" So Nguyen put together a fast-paced, rap-filled story. For its run with the Manhattan Theater Club, Vietgone would feature Raymond Lee as Quang Nguyen and Jennifer Ikeda as Tong. Paco Tolson would play Qui. The play is rich with winks to popular culture from the '70s and modern day: a ridiculous ninja fight, a hippie stoner sex scene, and a musical interlude capturing the moment when Tong and Quang, who had yet to meet, arrived in the U.S. The duo raps: TONG: Greeted by hate signs, not high fives QUANG: They dislike us TONG: This is where we'll build a new life QUANG: They despise us TONG: A new home grown from an army base QUANG: In a country not known for loving peeps with a yellow face Nguyen wrote Vietgone to push a medium that hasn't shown much love for anyone with a \"yellow face.\" Going to movies and theaters as a teenager, he said, \"always made me feel like the other. It always made me feel embarrassed, because it was taken from this perspective that made me feel so not part of the American fabric.\" Now his parents' stories are part of that fabric. And though his family's full immigrant story is being told, and actors are re-enacting some of their most intimate moments, Nguyen said his parents haven't seen the play \u2014 and won't. \"They're very proud that I wrote something about them,\" said Nguyen who created Vietgone as the first of a five-part series about his family. \"They understand why it's important to be out there .... It's hard for them to revisit their past. Those losses are still very painful.\"",

            "article_content": "Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush once described Asian-Americans as the \"canary in the coal mine\" of the Republican Party, saying that if Republicans didn't make more of an effort to court the fastest-growing racial group in the United States, the party would pay a price at the polls. Now a new report from the National Asian American Survey finds not only that Asian-Americans continue a steady drift away from the GOP, but that the party may be losing one of its most reliable ethnic groups. Among registered Asian-American voters, the survey found Democrat Hillary Clinton had a 4-to-1 lead over Republican Donald Trump. Alton Wang, a communications associate with the nonpartisan group APIAVote, said many Asian-Americans are increasingly turned off by anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric. More than 1 in 5 respondents were undecided. This is especially key because swing states, including Nevada, Virginia and North Carolina, have sizable Asian-American populations with undecided voters. One group stood out. Vietnamese-Americans were once considered a reliable Republican voting bloc. But since 2008, more voters identified as something other than Republican. Here's what the survey found: \"In the past, Vietnamese Americans were the only Asian American group more likely to identify as Republican than Democrat. In 2008, 42% of Vietnamese American registered voters identified as Republican, compared to 23% in 2016. Among this group, non-partisan identifiers are growing. In 2008, 40% of Vietnamese registered voters identified as independent or claimed they did 'not think in terms of political parties,' but this number rose to 47% in 2016.\" Vietnamese-Americans, many of whom came to the U.S. as refugees after the Vietnam War, stood out in one other way: They were among the least likely to say they support accepting Syrian refugees into the United States. Trump has made opposition to Syrian resettlement in the U.S. a key part of his campaign. \"It's so ironic and contradictory to their history as refugees,\" said Linda Vo, a professor at the University of California, Irvine who has been trying to make sense of this inconsistency. \"I've asked these individuals, 'Why would you be supportive of a candidate [Trump] who is anti-refugee, anti-immigrant, when you yourself came as one?' \" I've asked these individuals, 'Why would you be supportive of a candidate [Trump] who is anti-refugee, anti-immigrant, when you yourself came as one?' Linda Vo, University of California, Irvine Janelle Wong, one of the NAAS researchers, who also heads the Asian-American studies department at the University of Maryland, broke the data down for me even further. She said Vietnamese-American respondents who are younger, U.S.-born and with a college degree were more likely to say they'd welcome Syrian refugees. Of all the groups surveyed, Vietnamese-Americans were the most divided: 34 percent said they opposed accepting refugees; 27 percent refused to answer the question or said they didn't know; and 38 percent said they favored accepting refugees. This is in stark contrast to Hmong-American respondents, 74 percent of whom supported accepting refugees. Vo said many of the Vietnamese-Americans she spoke with who aren't welcoming of refugees tend to agree with the view that Syrian refugees are dangerous, and they think of themselves as different. That is, they consider themselves to be \"good\" refugees. Postwar refugees from Vietnam, she said, considered the Republican Party to be more anti-Communist and \u2014 for the largely Catholic immigrants \u2014 more socially conservative, with values that aligned with their own. Second-generation Vietnamese-Americans, Vo said, tend to vote for Democratic candidates \u2014 as they voted for Barack Obama in 2012. \"They're shifting away from the Republican Party, but not yet ready to commit to Democrats,\" Wong said. Many Vietnamese-Americans tend to be \"big government people\" \u2014 supporting social services including Obamacare \u2014 but aren't necessarily comfortable with the label of \"Democrat,\" she said. I talked with Steven Mai, a 42-year-old Vietnamese-American engineer and community activist who lives in Garden Grove, Calif. Mai immigrated to the U.S. in 1985. He's a Republican but says he doesn't always vote for GOP candidates. He said he had supported Trump until the Republican candidate criticized the family of Humayun Khan, an American Muslim Army captain who died in Iraq. \"Trump, when he was attacking that family ... I said, 'That's it, that's my final call,' \" said Mai, who serves in the California State Military Reserve. \"And now I confirmed my belief that yes ... he's just proven over time that he was never a leader.\" But Mai's parents feel differently. \"My parents are going to vote for Donald Trump,\" he said. \"Even though I told them their votes can be very dangerous, they said, 'Well, I'm not particularly liking Trump, I just don't like Hillary.' \"I did mention that, 'Hey, after all, this person [Trump] is not supporting us \u2014 particularly minorities, or refugees. But my mom, she said, 'Well, the better of the two is still going to be Trump,' because [my parents are] Republican, and they vote by party line.\"",

A federal appeals court panel Monday blocked Indiana Gov. and Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence's attempt to keep Syrian refugees out of Indiana. The court upheld a lower court judge in barring Pence from interfering with the distribution of federal funds to resettle Syrian refugees in his state. The appeals court panel said that federal law bars discrimination based on nationality. The three-judge panel that issued the ruling is an all-star group of conservative judges, including one of the judges on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's list of potential Supreme Court nominees. In a unanimous opinion, the appeals court said Gov. Pence acted illegally in accepting federal money for refugee resettlement and then refusing to use that money to aid Syrian refugees. The panel rejected Pence's argument that terrorists are posing as Syrian refugees to gain entry into the U.S., calling it a \"nightmare speculation\" based on no evidence. Indeed, the court said, the state presented no evidence that any Syrian refugee had been involved in a terrorist act in the U.S. The court added that resettlement of persecuted refugees is a federal responsibility under the 1980 Refugee Act, which authorizes the president to determine, on the basis of \"humanitarian concerns or ... the national interest,\" how many refugees to admit each year. In 2016, President Obama set the number at 85,000, including 10,000 Syrians. The refugees undergo multiple layers of screening by the federal government before entering the country in a process that can take up to two years. But with Syrian refugees, the state of Indiana refused to use any of the refugee resettlement money it had received from the federal government. Exodus, a private resettlement group that contracted with the state, went to court, represented by the ACLU. It argued that the state's refusal was illegal discrimination. Ken Falk, legal director of the ACLU of Indiana, said the court's decision on Monday underscores that \"Gov. Pence may not constitutionally or legally discriminate against a particular nationality of refugees that are extensively vetted by the federal government.\" Pence argued that the state's position was not based on discrimination but on the threat that Syrian refugees pose to the safety of residents of Indiana. Writing for the court, Judge Richard Posner called Pence's argument \"the equivalent of his saying (not that he does say) that he wants to forbid black people to settle in Indiana not because they're black but because he's afraid of them, and since race is therefore not his motive, he isn't discriminating.\" Posner went on to add that \"that of course would be racial discrimination, just as [Pence's] targeting Syrian refugees is discrimination on the basis of nationality.\" Joining the decision were Judges Frank Easterbrook and Diane Sykes. All three are well-known conservatives. Easterbrook and Posner were appointed by President Reagan, and Sykes was appointed by President George W. Bush. Indeed, Sykes is on Trump's list of potential Supreme Court nominees. The panel's ruling is the latest in a series of federal court decisions that have rejected similar attempts by other states to avoid Syrian refugee resettlements.",

One of the most fiercely debated issues in the European Union \u2014 the question of refugee resettlement \u2014 was put to a referendum vote in Hungary on Sunday. The result: a landslide with no legal weight. More than 90 percent of voters sided with the Hungarian government against the prospect of European Union-dictated refugee resettlement. The Associated Press reports that with nearly all the valid ballots counted, the tally stood at more than 98 percent of voters opposed to resettlement. But fewer than half the country's voters cast a ballot at all \u2014 turnout low enough to make the entire referendum invalid. On top of that, a small but noteworthy percentage of voters intentionally cast a botched ballot to protest the referendum. The referendum was described as a \"Brussels or Budapest\" question, the AP reports, with the ballot asking: \"Do you want the European Union to be able to prescribe the mandatory settlement of non-Hungarian citizens in Hungary even without the consent of Parliament?\" NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Sarhaddi Nelson explained on Morning Edition that \"mandatory settlement\" isn't part of the European Union's currently stated plans. \"That is definitely not what Brussels was proposing,\" she says. \"What they wanted to do was relocate \u2014 maybe relocate, and only temporarily so \u2014 1,300 refugees just to help give some relief to other countries that were having issues with large numbers coming in.\" Whether it's relocation or resettlement, there is resistance in Hungary \u2014 and across Europe \u2014 to the idea of allowing refugees across borders. \"What voters were telling me is that this is a Christian country here and they want it undiluted by immigrants, and that they want to preserve the Hungarian culture,\" Soraya says. But that sentiment wasn't enough to bring more than 50 percent of the country's voters to the polls. One Hungarian who stayed home, Central European University professor Szabolcs Pogonyi, told Soraya he didn't think the EU's quota system, even if it were ever mandatory, would result in refugees staying in Hungary. They'd go to Sweden or Germany, where they could have a better life, he predicted. And of those who did head to the polls, an estimated 6 percent of voters cast a defaced ballot, Soraya says. Many of them were inspired by a satirical political party called \"The Two-Tailed Dog Party,\" which crowdsourced a $150,000 billboard and poster campaign to mock \u2014 and counter \u2014 the referendum. The party, which includes free beer among its campaign promises, is headed by Monty Python enthusiast Gergely Kov\u00e1cs, Soraya reports: \"The 36-year-old graphic designer offered helpful tips to disgruntled voters on YouTube: He says a \"quick and efficient way\" to invalidate a ballot, is to spray lighter fluid onto it and set it on fire. Kovacs suggests: Burn it nice and easy, and make sure you don't set the voting booth on fire. \"Twenty-nine-year-old voter Alexandra says she watched the video. Fearing repercussions, she won't give her last name.  Alexandra cast her ballot at a busy polling station in Budapest's business district, where chatty poll workers stamped her ballot and pointed her to a makeshift voting booth. \"Alexandra says she checked both the 'Yes' and 'No' boxes to invalidate her ballot: 'I wanted to show that I do agree with the democratic views and I do want to be part of a referendum but the question is stupid.' \" The AP reports that, according to Hungary's National Election Office, turnout for the referendum was less than 44 percent \u2014 and with invalid ballots discarded, just over 40 percent. Even if Sunday's referendum was invalidated by low turnout, the overwhelming number of voters essentially voting against refugees has still raised concerns among asylum-seekers, Soraya says. \"Especially here in Hungary, where you now have fences that make it hard for asylum-seekers to come in and there's increasingly overt verbal abuse and just sort of xenophobia that's being stirred by this referendum, they're concerned that this is going to get worse,\" she says. \"That you're going to have worsening border conditions, more fences going up and eventually refugee camps closing, which is going to leave them with no place to go.\"",

            "article_content": "Hungarians who voted Sunday overwhelmingly rejected a European Union plan to accept a small number of refugees in their country. But the measure was declared invalid because of low voter turnout.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: In Hungary today, voters went to the polls to consider a measure to stop the European Union from relocating a small number of refugees to that central European country. Some 93 percent of the Hungarians who cast votes today rejected the measure, but the measure was declared invalid today because of poor voter turnout. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reports from Budapest. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: A small but steady trickle of Hungarians came to this polling station in the business district where smiling election workers stamp their ballots and pointed them to makeshift voting booths. Their task was simple - answer this question posed by the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Do you want the European Union to mandate the obligatory resettlement of non-Hungarian citizens into Hungary? Yes or no. An overwhelming number checked no and dropped their ballot into a waste-bin-shaped box. Orban's allies declared victory, but the referendum was rendered invalid because only 2 in 5 eligible voters showed up, a minimum 50 percent plus one vote was needed for it to pass. Zoltan Kovacs is the Hungarian government spokesman. He says even though it's invalid, the referendum wasn't a waste of time or money. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ZOLTAN KOVACS: We believe it's going to be a clear message, a message that cannot be disregarded, neither by the Hungarian government nor by any European institution. NELSON: Never mind that the year-old EU plan to temporarily relocate some 1,300 refugees to Hungary has been off the table for some time. Many voters agreed with their prime minister that Hungarians had to send Brussels a message. YULIA UHAS: I voted no. NELSON: That's Yulia Uhas (ph). The reason the 64 year old gave me is one I heard from a lot of older voters today. Hungary must stay Christian and undiluted by immigration. UHAS: (Speaking Hungarian). NELSON: Uhas adds in Hungarian, let the EU take steps to care for the mostly young and single males pouring into Europe back in their homelands. Social worker Ilona Kovacs (ph), who also voted no, agrees. ILONA KOVACS: (Speaking Hungarian). NELSON: She tells me she wants her children and grandchildren to grow up in their own culture. But younger Hungarians I interviewed were embarrassed by the xenophobia. Thousands heeded the call of an opposition party called Two-tailed Dog to cast invalid votes by marking both yes and no on the ballots. The party on its Facebook site said it received more than 3,000 photos of defaced ballots their supporters cast. One who heeded the satire-loving party's call was 29-year-old Alexandra (ph). She was afraid to give me her last name for fear of repercussions. ALEXANDRA: This referendum is perfectly unnecessary, so that's why I voted this way. NELSON: For refugees, the government's push to demonize them is no laughing matter. Very few asylum-seekers are being allowed in Hungary these days, and human rights activists report hundreds of would-be refugees are languishing in deplorable conditions behind razor-wire fences on the southern border. One advocate who's known locally by his first name, Beruse (ph), and who is a refugee from Iran says he worries the invalidated referendum will hasten the government's plan to close all refugee reception centers in Hungary. That would mean the 2,000 or so asylum-seekers who remain here awaiting the outcome of their cases could face worse living conditions than they do now. BERUSE: It is going to be more scarier especially for those refugees that are going to be in countrysides. NELSON: He says xenophobia is more pronounced in small Hungarian towns and villages where many people have never met a refugee before. The prime minister got the highest level of support from those areas. Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson, NPR News, Budapest. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Note: The transcript on this page was updated live as the debate proceeded. We are working to correct the transcript as it comes in, but due to the live nature of the event, there may be some discrepancies. SPEAKER:Good evening from Hofstra University in Hempstead New York. LESTER HOLT:I'm Lester Holt anchor of NBC nightly news I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate. The participants tonight are Donald Trump \u2014 and Hillary Clinton. This debate is sponsored by the commission on presidential debates, a nonpartisan nonprofit organization. The commission drafted tonight format and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns. The ninety minute debate is divided into six segments each fifteen minutes long. Will explore two three topic areas tonight achieving prosperity in their construction and securing America. And the start of each segment I will ask the same leadoff question to both candidates and do what you type up to two minutes to respond. From that point until the end of the segment we will have an open discussion. Questions our mind and not been shared with the commission or the campaigns. The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the oocandidates are saying. I will invite you to applaud however at this moment as we welcome the candidates. Democratic nominee for President of the United States Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee for president of the United States Donald J Trump. :[(APPLAUSE)] HILLARY CLINTON:How are you Donald? :[(APPLAUSE)] LESTER HOLT:While I don't expect this to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight but I remind everyone there are two more presidential debates scheduled. We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important and we're going to press for specifics. I am honored to have this rolled but this evening belongs to the candidates and just as important to the American people. Candidates we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions as well as your visions and your values. So let's begin. We're calling this opening segment achieving prosperity and central to that is jobs. There are two economic realities in America today. There's been a record six straight years of job growth and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation. However, income inequality remains significant. And nearly half of Americans living paycheck to paycheck. Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton - why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American workers? HILLARY CLINTON:Well thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us. The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we will build together. Today is my granddaughter's second birthday so I think about this a lot. First we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means we need new jobs, good jobs with rising incomes. I want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean renewable energy and small business because most of the new jobs will come from small business. We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for woman's work. The federal minimum wage has not been increased by Congress since 2009. \u2014 Marilyn Geewax According to the latest Census income report, full-time, year-round working women earned 80 percent of what men earned in 2015. Lots of factors go into that wage gap, including hours and jobs worked, as well as interruptions in women's careers due to maternity. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben I also want to see more companies to profit sharing. If you help create the profits you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top. And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work. I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under. So let's have paid family leave, earned sick, days let's be sure we have affordable childcare and debt-free college. Clinton's primary campaign promise; at the end of the primary season, she announced a plan for tuition-free public college for working families. \u2014 Anya Kamenetz How are we going to do it? We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes. Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you. We are going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country. You have to judge us. Who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency? Who can put into action the plans that will make your life better? I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November eighth. LESTER HOLT:Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump the same question to you. It's about putting money, more money into the pockets of American workers. You have up to two minutes. DONALD TRUMP:Thank you, Lester. Our jobs are fleeing the country. They're going to Mexico they're going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing for country in terms of making our product, they're devaluing their currency and there's nobody in our government to fight them. Obama has brokered an agreement with Chinese President Xi to reduce hacking, and IP theft \u2014 and cybersecurity experts who monitor intrusions from China say that attacks are in fact down. \u2014 Aarti Shahani And we have a very good fight and we have a winning fight. Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China and many other countries are doing the same thing. So we are losing our good jobs, so many of them. When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants, said it's the eighth wonder of the world. They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much. So Ford is leaving, you see that their small car division, leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio, they're all leaving. Unemployment in Michigan is 4.5 percent; Ohio rate is 4.7 percent. Both are better than the national average of 4.9 percent. \u2014 Marilyn Geewax Ford CEO Mark Fields says zero jobs will be lost in Michigan because Ford will build two new vehicles at that plant. \u2014 Aarti Shahani And we can't allow to happen anymore. As far as child care is concerned and so many of the things I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do but perhaps will be talking about that later. Trump and Clinton disagree more than a little bit on child care. Trump's plan would allow parents to deduct their state's average cost of child care, and he would also introduce rebates for lower-income parents. There would also be new savings accounts for parents to set aside money for child care. As for Clinton, she has said that families should not pay more than 10 percent of their income for child care, though it's not clear how that would be implemented. She also has called for more Head Start funding, as well as universal pre-K programs. In addition, she has proposed 12 weeks of parental leave, to be paid for (as with many of her other programs) by higher taxes on high-income Americans. He has proposed six weeks of maternity leave, which would fall under the unemployment program. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben But we have to stop our jobs are being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and with it, firing all of their people. All the have to do is take a look at carrier air-conditioning in Indianapolis. They left fourteen hundred people. They are going to Mexico. So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this. We cannot let it happen. Under my plan I will be reducing taxes tremendously from thirty five percent to fifteen percent for companies, small and big businesses. Trump wants to cut income tax rates while capping deductions for the wealthy. He would also reduce the business tax rate to 15 percent and eliminate the estate tax. The conservative Tax Foundation estimates that his plan would reduce federal revenue by $4.4 trillion to $5.9 trillion over the next decade, which is a lot, but down from $10 trillion in his original plan. Some of that could be offset by economic growth, but even using \"dynamic scoring,\" the foundation says the plan cuts tax revenue by $2.6 trillion to $3.9 trillion over 10 years. (The higher figure is if the 15 percent business tax rate is applied to \"pass-through\" entities.) The biggest beneficiaries of Trump's tax cuts are the wealthy. The top 1 percent of earners see their after-tax income rise by between 10.2 percent and 16 percent. Overall savings would be less than 1 percent. \u2014 Scott Horsley That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan. It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch. Companies will come, they will build, they will expand, new companies will start and I look very very much forward to doing it. We had to renegotiate our trade deals and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs. LESTER HOLT:Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond? HILLARY CLINTON:Well, I think that trade is an important issue, of course. We are five percent of the world's population - we have to trade with the other ninety five percent. And we need to have smart fair trade deals. We also though you have a tax system that rewards work and not just a financial transactions. And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again. In fact it would be the most extreme version the biggest tax cuts for the top percents of the people in this country than we've ever had. I call it trumped up trickle-down because that's exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy. We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy. How we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes. I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives. I understand that. You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with fourteen million dollars borrowed from his father and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we will be and that everything will work out from there. I don't buy that. I have a different experience. My father was a small businessman. He worked really hard, he printed drapery fabrics on long tables where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with the silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going. And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills for future, the better we will be off in the better we will grow. That's the kind of economy I wanted to see again. LESTER HOLT: Let me follow up message up if I can. You talk about creating five million jobs and he promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans. How are you going to bring back the industries that have led to this country for cheaper labor overseas? How specifically are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back? DONALD TRUMP: Well, for one thing and before we start on that my father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and I built into a company that's worth many many billions of dollars with some of the greatest assets in the world and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs. According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump's father came to his rescue repeatedly with multiple loans. Our country is in deep trouble. We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China. They're the best the best ever at it. What they're doing to us is a very very sad thing. So we have to do that. We had to renegotiate our trade deals and Lester, they're taking our jobs. They're giving incentives, they're doing things that frankly we don't do. Let me give you the example of Mexico. They have a vat tax, we're on a different system. When we sell into Mexico there is a tax when they sell an automatic sixteen percent approximately. When they sell into us there's no tax. It's a defective agreement. It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it. Now in all fairness to Secretary Clinton...yes? Is that okay? Good, I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me. But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this it was really very recently, she's been doing this for thirty years and why hasn't she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective. Just because of the tax and many other reasons but just because of the tax. LESTER HOLT: Let me interrupt for just a moment. DONALD TRUMP: Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years. Now right now because of the fact that we created a movement. They should've been doing this for years. What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is look \u2014 we owe twenty trillion dollars. We cannot do it any longer, Lester. LESTER HOLT: Back to the question, though, how do you bring back, specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers how do you make them bring the jobs back? DONALD TRUMP: Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving. I could name, I mean there are thousands of them, they're leaving and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever. And what you do is you say fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck, we wish you a lot of luck. But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars, or your cookies or whatever you make, and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong. And once you say you're going to tax them coming in and our politicians never do this because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave because in many cases they own the companies. So what I'm saying is we can stop them from leaving, we have to stop them from leaving, and that's a big big factor. LESTER HOLT: Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here. HILLARY CLINTON: Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago, we had the worst financial crisis - the great recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was, in large part, because of tax policies that slash taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street and created a perfect storm. In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. He said, back in 2006, gee, I hope it does collapse because then I can go in and buy some and make some money. Well, it did collapse. DONALD TRUMP:That called business, by the way. HILLARY CLINTON: Nine million people, nine million people lost their jobs. Five million people lost their homes. And thirteen trillion dollars in family wealth was wiped out. Now, we have come back from that abyss. And it has not been easy. So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy. But the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place. Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald has proposed. And basically they have said this \u2014 that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over five trillion dollars This is from the Tax Foundation, which just put out a report saying Trump's plan would balloon the deficit; Hillary's plan, not so much. \u2014 Jim Zarroli and would, in some instances, disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose three and a half million jobs. And maybe have another recession. They've looked at my plans, and they've said okay, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have ten million more new jobs. Because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy. Take clean energy. Some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the twenty first century. Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it's real. DONALD TRUMP:I did not \u2014 I do not say that Actually, Trump has called climate change a \"hoax\" on several occasions. He said on Meet the Press that he was joking about China's role. As PolitiFact noted: \"On Dec. 30, 2015, Trump told the crowd at a rally in Hilton Head, S.C., 'Obama's talking about all of this with the global warming and ... a lot of it's a hoax. It's a hoax. I mean, it's a moneymaking industry, OK? It's a hoax, a lot of it.'\" \u2014 Domenico Montanaro NPR: CJ-climate-two The original source for the \"hoax\" quote was a tweet Trump sent in 2012. He said the concept of global warming was created by the Chinese to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive. HILLARY CLINTON: The science is real. And I think is important that we grip this and deal with it both at home and abroad. And here's what we can do - we can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. We can have enough clean energy to power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. That's a lot of jobs. That's a lot of new economic activity. So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do. And I am determined that we are going to get the economy really moving again. Building on the progress we've made over the last eight years but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place. LESTER HOLT: Mr. Trump. DONALD TRUMP: She talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company, our country. That was a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that one. Now look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy. But were putting a lot of people out of work. Our energy policies are disaster. Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt. Domestic oil and gas production have increased steadily during President Obama's time in office. The U.S. has been the world's leading producer of natural gas since 2011 and the top producer of oil since 2013. The Energy Information Administration says gasoline prices averaged $2.17 a gallon last week \u2014 about a nickel cheaper than a year ago, and about 30 cents a gallon less than Obama's first year in office, and about a buck and a half less than during George W. Bush's last year in office. \u2014 Scott Horsley You can't do what you're looking to do with twenty trillion in debt. The Obama administration from the time they've come in is over two hundred thirty years worth of debt. And he's topped it. He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years \u2014 seven and a half years to be semi- exact. So I will tell you this, we have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs and we have to do a much better job at getting companies incentive to build new companies or to expand. Because they're not doing it. All you have to do is look at Michigan and all you have to do is look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving. They're gone. And Hillary, I'll just ask you this \u2014 you've been doing this for thirty years. Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now? For thirty years, you've been doing it. And now you're just starting to think of solutions. HILLARY CLINTON:Well actually -- DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me. I will bring my job. You can't bring back jobs. HILLARY CLINTON: Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit. DONALD TRUMP: Yeah for thirty years. HILLARY CLINTON: Well, not quite that long. I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again. DONALD TRUMP: Well, he approved NAFTA. He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country. HILLARY CLINTON:...a balanced budget, and incomes went up for everybody. Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s if we're actually going to look at the facts. For comparison: jobs per year was strongest under Bill Clinton (2.8 million), followed by Carter (2.6 million), Reagan (2 million), Obama (1.3 million as of January), H.W. Bush (659,000), and W. Bush (160,000). \u2014 Scott Horsley When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deal that came before me. And I held them all the same test. Will they create jobs in America? Will they raise incomes in America? And are they good for our national security? Some of them I voted for. The biggest one, is a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against. And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals. But let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy. I think it is a part of it. And I've said what I'm going to do. I'm going to have a special prosecutor. Kind of awkward for Hillary Clinton to raise the term \"special prosecutor\" even though this would be a very different kind of one. \u2014 Carrie Johnson We're going to enforce the trade deals we have and we're going to hold people accountable. When I was Secretary of State, we actually increased American exports globally thirty percent. We increased them to China fifty percent. So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that help to create more new jobs. LESTER HOLT: Very quickly... DONALD TRUMP: But you haven't done it in thirty years or 26 years. HILLARY CLINTON: Well, I've been a senator, Donald.. DONALD TRUMP: You haven't done it. HILLARY CLINTON: And I have been a Secretary of State and I have -- DONALD TRUMP: Your husband signed NAFTA, one of the worst thing that ever happened in the manufacturing industry. HILLARY CLINTON:That is your opinion - DONALD TRUMP: You go to New England. You go to Ohio, Pennsylvania. You go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacturing is down thirty, forty, sometimes fifty percent \u2014 NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere but certainly ever signed in this country. Most studies show NAFTA had a relatively small impact on the economy. \"NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters. The net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest,\" according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. \u2014 Marilyn Geewax And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it, then you heard what I was saying - how bad it is - and you said, I can't win that debate. But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA. Nothing will ever top NAFTA. HILLARY CLINTON: That is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out. I wrote about in \u2014 Hillary Clinton did write in her book, Hard Choices, that the TPP was the \"gold standard\" of trade deals and appeared very much in favor of it as President Obama's secretary of state. She said it \"would link markets throughout Asia and the Americas, lowering trade barriers while raising standards on labor, the environment, and intellectual property.\" She called it \"important for American workers, who would benefit from competing on a more level playing field.\" She also called it \"a strategic initiative that would strengthen the position of the United States in Asia.\" Facing a serious populist primary challenge from Bernie Sanders, however, Clinton shifted her position left. Clinton has had a long time line of positions on trade, especially since her husband, Bill Clinton, signed NAFTA. Here's a history. \u2014 Domenico Montanaro DONALD TRUMP:You called it the gold standard. You call it the gold standard of trade deals. HILLARY CLINTON:You know what -- DONALD TRUMP: You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen. HILLARY CLINTON: No. DONALD TRUMP: And then you heard what I said about it and all of a sudden you were against it. HILLARY CLINTON: Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts. The facts are, I did say, I hoped it would be a good deal. But when it was negotiated, which I was not possible for, I concluded it wasn't. I wrote about that \u2014 in my.... DONALD TRUMP: So is it President Obama's fault? HILLARY CLINTON: ...before you even announced. DONALD TRUMP: Secretary, is it President Obama's fault? HILLARY CLINTON:There are -- DONALD TRUMP: Because he's pushing it. HILLARY CLINTON:There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy and our leadership in the world. And I think it is important to look at what we need to do to get our economy going again. That's why I said new jobs, with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add five trillion dollars to the debt. DONALD TRUMP: But you have no plan. HILLARY CLINTON: Oh, I do. DONALD TRUMP:Secretary, you have no plan. HILLARY CLINTON: In fact, I've written a book about it. It's called, \"Stronger Together.\" You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore or an airport near you. LESTER HOLT: Folks, were going to -- HILLARY CLINTON: It's because I see this. We need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth. We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business. So we have a very robust set of plans. And people who have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create ten million jobs and yours would lose us three and a half million jobs and explode the -- DONALD TRUMP:You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history - you are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. You are going to drive business out. Clinton would raise taxes on the wealthy \u2014 especially those making more than $5 million per year (2/10,000 people), limit the value of certain deductions and increase the estate tax rate, while extending that tax to more families (with thresholds set at $3.5 million/$7 million for couples). The Tax Policy Center estimated that an earlier version of her plan would raise an extra $1.1 trillion over a decade, with three-quarters of that coming from the top 1 percent. Last week, Clinton modified her estate tax proposal, raising the top rate to 65 percent on estates of more than $500 million. \u2014 Scott Horsley Your regulations are disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place. And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan. I'm very proud of it. Donald Trump's tax plan is indeed a large tax cut, but those cuts would largely benefit the highest earners. According to a recent analysis from the right-leaning Tax Foundation, the top 1 percent could see their after-tax incomes increase by up to 16 percent. Meanwhile, the bottom four quintiles would see their incomes grow by 1.9 percent or less. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs. But regulations \u2014 you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence. When I go around, Lester, I tell you this \u2014 I've been all over. And when I go around, despite the tax cut \u2014 the things that businesses and people like the most, is the fact that I'm cutting regulation. You have regulations on top of regulations and new companies cannot form. And old habits are going out of business, and you want to increase the regulation and make them even worse. I'm going to cut regulations. But I'm going to cut taxes big league and you're going to raise taxes big league. End of story. LESTER HOLT: Let me get you to pause right there, because we're going to move into the... HILLARY CLINTON:That can't be left to stand. You know, LESTER HOLT: Please take thirty seconds. HILLARY CLINTON: I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims. DONALD TRUMP: Facts. HILLARY CLINTON: And so we have taken the home page of my website, hillaryclinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact checker. So if you want to see in real time what the facts are, please go and take a look. DONALD TRUMP: And take a look at mine also and you'll see.. The Clinton campaign did have a live \"fact checker\" during the debate it called \"Literally Trump.\" We took a look at Trump's site, and there is no live fact checker. \u2014 Domenico Montanaro HILLARY CLINTON: Because what I have proposed would not add a penny to the debt and your plans with add five trillion dollars to the debt. What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses. What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy because they have made all the gains in the economy. And I think it's time that the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share to support this country. LESTER HOLT: Well, you just opened the next segment. DONALD TRUMP: Could I just finish? I think I should - you go to her website, she's going to raise taxes 1.3 trillion dollars and look at her website. It's no different than this. She's telling us how to fight ISIS. Just go to her website. She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website. I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much. LESTER HOLT: The next segment, we're continuing the subject.... HILLARY CLINTON: Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS. DONALD TRUMP: No, no. You're telling the enemy everything you want to do. HILLARY CLINTON:No, we're not. DONALD TRUMP: No wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life. Clinton has not been fighting ISIS her entire adult life as it has existed in its present form only since 2013-2014. \u2014 Phil Ewing Hillary Clinton was born in 1947. The roots of ISIS arguably go back to the late 1990s, but the rise of ISIS in its present form followed the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011. Either way, the terrorist group was long after Clinton became an adult. \u2014 Sarah McCammon LESTER HOLT:But, HILLARY CLINTON: Well, that's \u2014 go to the please, go to the fact checkers. LESTER HOLT: You are unpacking a lot here. And we're still on the issue of achieving prosperity. And I want to talk about taxes. The fundamental difference between you two as the concerns the wealthy. Secretary Clinton, you're calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans. I'd like you to further defend that. And Mr. Trump, you're calling for tax cuts for the wealthy and I'd like you to defend that. DONALD TRUMP:Well, I'm really calling for major jobs because the wealthy are going to create tremendous jobs. They're going to expand their companies. They're going to do a tremendous job. I'm getting rid of the carried interest provision. And if you really look, it's not a great thing for the wealthy. It's a great thing for a middle-class. It's a great thing for companies to expand. And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies and when they're going to bring to have two and a half trillion dollars back from overseas, where they can't bring the money back because politicians like Secretary Clinton... because the taxes are so onerous and the bureaucratic red tape. So bad. So what they're doing is they're leaving our country and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country. Much of this is money they make overseas in selling products there, not money they take outside the country. \u2014 Jim Zarroli And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work because they can't work out a deal to \u2014 and everybody agrees it should be brought back. Instead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money because they can't bring their money back into our country because of bureaucratic red tape because they can't get together. Because we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something. And here's the thing \u2014 Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done. Two and a half trillion - I happen to think it's double that - it's probably five trillion dollars that we can't bring into our country, Lester. Macroeconomic research firm Capital Economics estimated this month that American firms hold $2.5 trillion overseas. And that figure is echoed in other reports \u2014 earlier this year, Citizens for Tax Justice (talking only about the top Fortune 500 companies) put it at $2.4 trillion. However, it's not immediately apparent where the $5 trillion figure comes from. NPR is asking the Trump campaign and will update with any new information. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben With a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly. To be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful. But we have no leadership. And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton. LESTER HOLT: All right, you have two minutes of the same question to defend tax increases on the wealthiest Americans, Secretary Clinton. HILLARY CLINTON: I have a feeling that by the end of this evening, I'll be blamed for everything that's ever happened. DONALD TRUMP: Why not? :[(LAUGHTER)] DONALD TRUMP: HILLARY CLINTON:Why not, yeah why not? Just join the debate by saying more crazy things. DONALD TRUMP:There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into -- LESTER HOLT: This is Secretary Clinton's two minutes please. HILLARY CLINTON: Let's start the clock again, Lester. We've looked at your tax proposals. I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you are referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that is stranded overseas. DONALD TRUMP: Then you didn't read it. HILLARY CLINTON: I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit. But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole because it would so advantage you and the business you do. You've proposed DONALD TRUMP: Who gave it that name? LESTER HOLT: Sir, this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes. HILLARY CLINTON: ...tax benefit for your bit family. And when you look at what you are proposing it is, as I said, Trumped up, trickle-down. Trickle down it did not work. It got us into the mess we were in 2009. Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked and a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that. And they are saying, hey we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class. I don't think what top-down works in America. I think building the middle-class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their debt from college at a lower rate, those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy, broad-based, inclusive growth. Moody's Analytics says that in a Clinton presidency, the economy would add 10.4 million jobs, based on her proposals. That would be 3.2 million more than under current law. \u2014 Marilyn Geewax is what we need in America not more advantages for people at the very top. LESTER HOLT: Mr. Trump -- DONALD TRUMP: Typical politician. All talk no action. Sounds good. Doesn't work. Never going to happen. Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what is going on. Now look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression. Private sector employers have added 15.1 million jobs since the trough of the recession in 2010. Unemployment, which peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, has fallen to 4.9 percent. Unemployment among African-Americans, which peaked at 16.8 percent in March 2010, has fallen to 8.1 percent. And unemployment among African-American young people is not 58 percent as Trump claimed, but 26.1 percent. For comparison: Jobs per year was strongest under Bill Clinton (2.8 million), followed by Carter (2.6 million), Reagan (2 million), Obama (1.3 million as of January), H.W. Bush (659,000), and W. Bush (160,000). \u2014 Scott Horsley And believe me, we are in a bubble right now. And the other leaving that looks good is the stock market. But if you raise interest rates even a little bit that is going to come crashing down. Trump seems unhappy that rates may go up and also criticizes Fed Chair Janet Yellen for keeping them low, asserting that she is doing it to benefit Obama. \u2014 Jim Zarroli We are in a big fat ugly bubble. And we better be awfully careful. And we had a Fed that is doing political things. This Janet Yellen of the Fed, the Fed is doing political by keeping interest rates at this level. Trump has accused Yellen of this before \u2014 he did on CNBC recently \u2014 though he provided no evidence of it, as the AP noted. Responding to these attacks, Yellen said last week that in five years, when transcripts are released, \"I will assure you that you will not find any signs of political motivation,\" per the Wall Street Journal. Additionally, as Bloomberg reported recently, \"people who have been in the room at FOMC meetings say that elections are just not a topic during the policy debate.\" The Fed's governors are appointed to 14-year terms, meaning that they overlap with multiple administrations, and chairs often also serve presidents of both parties. Ben Bernanke served George W. Bush and Obama, and if Trump were elected, Yellen's term would extend into his administration as well. Additionally, earlier this year, Trump was not so opposed to either Yellen or higher interest rates. Though he said he wants a Republican chair, he also said, \"I'm not a person that thinks Janet Yellen is doing a bad job. I happen to be a low-interest-rate person unless inflation rears its ugly head, which can happen at some point,\" according to Reuters. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben And believe me the day Obama goes off and he leaves and he goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you are going to see some very bad things happen because the Fed is not doing their job. The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton. LESTER HOLT: Mr. Trump, we're talking about the burden that Americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns. And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is that voters will know if their potential president owes money to \u2014 who you know owes it to, and any business conflicts. Don't have Americans have a right to know there are any conflicts of interest? DONALD TRUMP:I don't mind releasing. I'm under a audit. Routine and it will be released. And as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released. But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections where I filed a one hundred and four page, essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have. It shows income, in fact the income \u2014 I just looked today, the income is filed at six hundred ninety four million dollars for this past year. Six hundred ninety four million. If you would have told me I would make that fifteen or twenty years ago I would have been very surprised. But that's the kind of thinking that our country needs. When we have a country that is doing so badly that is being ripped off by every single country in the world, it is the kind of thinking that our country needs because everybody \u2014 Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with of almost eight hundred billion dollars a year. In 2015, the U.S. had a trade deficit with the rest of the world of $746 billion. In the first seven months of 2016, the trade deficit was $424 billion. In 2015, the U.S. had a trade deficit with China of $367 billion. In the first seven months of 2016, the trade deficit with China was $191 billion. (So in both cases, it's on pace to shrink slightly this year.) The Trump campaign has argued that a more muscular trade policy would boost federal revenue by $1.7 trillion over the next decade, partially offsetting the revenue loss from Trump's proposed tax cuts. Outside economists are not convinced. The pro-trade Peterson Institute for International Economics warns that Trump's threat of steep tariffs on imports from China and Mexico could unleash a trade war, costing 4 million jobs and driving the economy into recession. Clinton is not calling for new import tariffs, but like Trump she opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Peterson says each year's delay in TPP reduces GDP by tens of billions of dollars. \u2014 Scott Horsley You know that is? That means who is negotiating these trade deals? We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals. LESTER HOLT: The IRS has an audit DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me LESTER HOLT: of your taxes. You're perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit. And so the question does the public's right to know outweigh your personal... NPR: ak-irs As described by Slate, \"The IRS commissioner himself has said that an audit doesn't prevent anyone from releasing his or her taxes. In fact, President Richard Nixon once released his returns while being audited.\" DONALD TRUMP: Well, I told you I will release them as soon as the audit. Look, I have been under audit almost for fifteen years. I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited. I said do you get audited? I get audited almost every year. And in a way I should be complaining. I'm not even complaining. I don't mind them. It's almost become a way of life. I get audited by the IRS. But other people don't. I will say this we have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of. I will release my tax returns against my lawyer's wishes when she releases her thirty three thousand e-mails that have been deleted. As soon as she releases them, I will release I will release my tax returns. And that is against, my lawyers, they say don't do it. I will tell you this \u2014 in fact watching shows, reading the papers. Almost every lawyer says you don't release your return until the audit is complete. When the audit is complete I will do it. But I would go against them if she releases her emails. LESTER HOLT:So it's negotiable? DONALD TRUMP: It's not negotiable. No, let her release her emails. Why did she delete 33,000 emails? LESTER HOLT: I will let her answer that. But let me just admonish the audience one more time. There was an agreement. We did ask you to be silent so it would be helpful for us. Secretary Clinton? HILLARY CLINTON: Well, I think you have just seen another example of bait and switch here. For 40 years everyone running for president has released their tax returns. That's true. Richard Nixon released his taxes in 1973. He was audited by the IRS \"when questions bubbled up about a fishy charitable donation and speculation that Nixon had tried to game the tax system,\" PolitiFact has noted. Here's more on the history of candidates releasing tax returns, including three reasons why we care about what's in those returns. \u2014 Domenico Montanaro You can go and see nearly I think thirty nine forty years of our tax returns. But everyone has done it. We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you are under audit. So you gotta ask yourself \u2014 why won't he release his tax returns? And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First maybe he is not as rich as he says he has. Second maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be. Third we don't know all of his business dealings but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about six hundred and fifty million dollars to Wall Street and foreign banks. Or maybe he does not want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he has paid nothing in federal taxes because the only years that anybody has ever seen for a couple of years where he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license. And they showed he did not pay any federal income tax. DONALD TRUMP: That makes me smart. HILLARY CLINTON: If you have paid zero, that means zero for troops, here for vets, zero for vets, zero for schools or health. And I think probably he is not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are because it must be something really important even terrible that he is trying to hide. In the financial disclosure statements they don't give you tax rate. They don't give you all the details the tax returns would. And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see. And I have no reason to believe that he has ever going to release his tax returns because there is something he is hiding. And we will guess \u2014 we'll keep guessing at what it might be that he is hiding. But I think the question is were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts? Who does he owe money to? Well, he owes you the answers to that. And he should provide them. LESTER HOLT: He also raised the issue of your e-mails. Do you want to respond to that? HILLARY CLINTON: I do. You know, I made my mistake using a private e-mail. DONALD TRUMP: That's for sure. HILLARY CLINTON: And if I had to do it over again I would obviously do it differently. But I'm not going to make any excuses. It was a mistake and I take responsibility for that. LESTER HOLT: Mr. Trump? DONALD TRUMP: That was more than a mistake. That was done purposely. That was not a mistake. That was done purposely. When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the fifth so they are not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the fifth, I think it is disgraceful. And believe me, this country thinks it is this \u2014 really thinks it is disgraceful also. The FBI director testified to Congress that Clinton told investigators she used the private server as a matter of convenience. An IT aide did invoke his Fifth Amendment rights and won immunity from the Justice Department. Two other people who worked on the server for Platte River Networks, a private company, also took the Fifth. And a pair of Clinton aides got a limited form of immunity for turning over their computers to the FBI. No one was charged with any wrongdoing. \u2014 Carrie Johnson As far as my tax returns, you do not earn that much from tax returns. That I can tell you. You learn a lot from financial disclosure. And you should go down and take a look at that. The other thing - I am incredibly the under leveraged. The report that six hundred feet fifty \u2014 which by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say boy that's really not a lot of money. That's not a lot of money relative to what I had. The big buildings that were in question they said in the same report, which actually wasn't even a bad story to be honest with you \u2014 but the buildings are worth 3.9 billion dollars. And the six hundred fifty is not even on that. But it is not six hundred fifty. It is much less than that. But I could give you a list of banks. If that would help you I would give you list the banks. These are very fine institutions, very fine banks. I could do that very quickly. I am very under leveraged. I have a great company. I have it tremendous income. And the reason I say it is not a braggadocio's way. It's because it is about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money. Because Donald Trump has refused to release his tax returns \u2014 in defiance of tradition dating back four decades \u2014 we don't know as much as we'd like about his business empire or his personal wealth. Much of his business is conducted through the privately held Trump Organization. But investors in his first public company \u2014 Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts \u2014 lost a lot of money, even as Trump himself was handsomely rewarded. The public company lost money every year Trump ran it, loaded up his Atlantic City casinos with costly debt, and ultimately filed for bankruptcy. Trump has blamed the downfall on broader forces affecting Atlantic City. But he also drained cash out of the business to pay personal debts and support his lavish lifestyle. Contractors, including small businesses, lost money along with Trump's investors. Trump also forced an investment firm to fire an analyst, Marvin Roffman, who had warned that the business was unsustainable. Trump has been sued by the New York attorney general for allegedly defrauding students at Trump University, by investors who bought into failed condominium projects bearing the Trump name, and by contractors who say he refused to pay them. Trump boasts that he never settles lawsuits, but in fact he has settled at least 100 lawsuits, as USA Today reports. \u2014 Scott Horsley When we had twenty twelve trillion dollars in debt in our country is a mess \u2014 you know is one thing to have twenty trillion debt and our roads are good and are bridges are good everything is in great shape. Our airports are like from a Third World country. You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible \u2014 you come in from China \u2014 you see these incredible airports and you land... we become a Third World country. So the worst of all things has happened. We owe twenty trillion dollars and we are a mess. We haven't even started. And we have spent $6 trillion dollars in the Middle East according to a report that I just saw. Whether it is six or five but it looks like it is six \u2014 six trillion dollars in the Middle East. The total cost of the U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan is notoriously difficult to calculate because of the intricacies involved with what to include and what to exclude, the role played by debt service and other factors. According to one report by Linda Bilmes of Harvard, Iraq alone could wind up costing U.S. taxpayers some $3 trillion. \u2014 Phil Ewing We could've rebuilt our country twice. And it's really a shame. And it's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem. Our country has tremendous problems. We are a debtor nation. We're a serious debtor nation. And we have a country that needs new roads and tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals and we don't have the money because it has been squandered on so many of your ideas. HILLARY CLINTON: And maybe because you have not paid any federal income tax for a lot of years. And the other thing I think is important -- DONALD TRUMP: It would be squandered too, believe me. HILLARY CLINTON: If your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that. You know your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys. Here's USA Today on Trump's unpaid bills. \u2014 Scott Horsley And indeed I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses Donald. I've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do. We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses. It's a beautiful facility. It immediately was put to use. And you would not pay what the man needed to be paid when he was charging you. DONALD TRUMP: Maybe you can do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work. Which our country should do too. HILLARY CLINTON: Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of the business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them? I can only say that I am certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you. He provided a good middle-class life for us but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides. And when we talk about your business, you have taken business bankruptcy six times. There a lot of great business people that have never taken bankruptcy once. You call yourself your king of debt. You talk about leverage. You even went and suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States. DONALD TRUMP: Wrong. Clinton is correct; Trump did suggest this on CNBC in May. \u2014 Sarah McCammon HILLARY CLINTON: Well, sometimes there is not a direct transfer of skills from business to government. But sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government. And we need to be very clear about that. DONALD TRUMP: Look it's all words. It's all soundbites. I built an unbelievable company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world real estate assets anywhere in the world beyond the United States. In Europe, lots of different places. It's an unbelievable company. But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there. And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that did not get paid, first of all they did get paid a lot but taken advantage of the laws of the nation. Now, if you want to change the laws, you've been a long time, change the laws. That take advantage of the laws of the nation because I am running the company. My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. And that is what I do. What she does not say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me \u2014 I'll give you an example. We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get Pennsylvania Avenue another. But we are opening the old post office. Under budget, ahead of schedule, save tremendous money, I'm a year ahead of schedule. And that is what this country should be doing. We build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they're supposed to cost. We buy products for our military and they come at a cost that are so far above what they are supposed to be because we don't have people that know what they are doing. When we look at the budget, the budget is back to large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy. The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule. And we should be able to do that for our country. LESTER HOLT: Well, we're well behind schedule so I want to move to our next segment. We move our next segment talking about America's direction. Let's start by talking about race. The share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it's been in decades. Much of it amplified it by shootings of African-Americans by police, as we have seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa. Race has been a big issue in this campaign and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap. So how do you heal the divide? Secretary Clinton - you get two minutes on this. HILLARY CLINTON: Well, you're right. Race remains a significant challenge in our country. Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get... From this year's Office of Civil Rights Data Collection: Black students are 2.3 times more likely than white students to be referred to law enforcement or arrested as a result of a school incident. Black preschoolers are 3.6 times more likely to be suspended than white preschoolers. In schools with high black and Latino enrollment, 10 percent of teachers were in their first year, compared with 5 percent in largely white schools. \u2014 Anya Kamenetz And yes it determines, how they are treated in the criminal justice system. We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte. And we've got to do several things at the same time. We have to restore trust between communities and the police. We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary. Everyone should be respected by the law and everyone should respect the law. Right now that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods. So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform. I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system. But we also have to recognize in addition to the challenges that we face with policing there are so many good brave police officers who equally want reform. So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal. And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them. The gun epidemic is a leading cause of death of young African-American men, more than the next nine causes put together. So we have to do two things as I said \u2014 we have to restore trust, we have to work with the police, we have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them and we have to tackle the plague of gun violence which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we are seeing today. LESTER HOLT: Ok Mr. Trump, you have two minutes, how to heal the divide? DONALD TRUMP: Well, first of all Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words and that's law and order. And we need law and order. If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country. And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, the city I love, the city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's. I can keep naming them all day long \u2014 we need law and order in our country. And I just got today the as you know the endorsement of the fraternal order of police which just came in. Trump did win the endorsement of the FOP but that happened earlier in the month, not Monday. \u2014 Carrie Johnson We have endorsements from I think almost every police group, I mean a large percentage of them in United States. We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African-American, Hispanics living in hell because it's so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot. In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings thousands since January first. Thousands of shootings. And I'm saying where is this? Is this war-torn country? What are we doing? And we had to stop the violence. We have to bring back law in order. FBI crime data published Monday said violent crime rose slightly in 2015 but remains near record lows. Chicago remains plagued by violent crime, but it's targeted to a small number of neighborhoods. \u2014 Carrie Johnson In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact almost four thousand having killed since Barack Obama became president. Over four, almost four thousand people in Chicago have been killed. We have to bring back law and order. Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago, you do stop and frisk which worked very well Mayor Giuliani is here worked very well in New York. Not so much \u2014 Anya Kamenetz It brought the crime rate way down but you take the gun away from criminals that should be having it. We have gangs roaming the street and in many cases they're illegally here, illegal immigrants. And they have guns and they shoot people. And we have to be very strong and we have to be very vigilant. We have to be we had to know what we're doing. Right now our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything. We have to protect our inner cities because African-American communities are being decimated by crime. Homicides rose in 2015 by about 11 percent, the FBI said, but largely because of increases in a small number of cities such as Chicago. \u2014 Carrie Johnson LESTER HOLT: Your two minutes have expired but I do want to follow up. Stop and Frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men. DONALD TRUMP: No, you're wrong. It went before a judge who was a very against police judge. Lester Holt is correct. Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional by a federal district judge. The city appealed, and after a change of mayor the case was settled before the appeal. \u2014 Scott Horsley It was taken away from her and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. If you look at it throughout the country, there are many places where... Stop-and-frisk remains a controversial practice in law enforcement. Just last week, the attorney general said it was practiced indiscriminately in New York and worsened police-community relations. \u2014 Carrie Johnson LESTER HOLT: The argument is that it's a form of racial profiling. DONALD TRUMP: No, the argument is that we had to take the guns away from these people that have them and that are bad people that shouldn't have them. These are felons and these are people that are bad people that shouldn't be...when you have three thousand shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have four thousand people killed in Chicago by guns from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama his hometown, you have to have stop and frisk. You need more police. You need a better community, you know relation, you don't have a good community relations in Chicago. It's terrible. I have property there. It's terrible what's going on in Chicago. But when you look \u2014 and Chicago's not the only one. You go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places. You need better relationships, I agree with Secretary Clinton on this, you need better relationships between communities in the police because in some cases it's not good but you look at Dallas where the relationships were really studied the relationships were really a beautiful thing. And then five police officers were killed. One night very violently. So there's some bad things going on, some really bad things. LESTER HOLT: Secretary Clinton. DONALD TRUMP: But Lester we need law and order and we need law and order in the inner cities because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people and it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen. LESTER HOLT:Secretary Clinton. HILLARY CLINTON: Well, I've heard, I've heard Donald Titus at his rallies and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country... DONALD TRUMP: Ugh. HILLARY CLINTON: you know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids, there is a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up. But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe. There the right ways of doing it and then there are ways that are ineffective. Stop and risk was found to be unconstitutional. And in part because it was ineffective. It did not do what it needed to do. Now I believe in community policing and in fact violent crime is one half of what it was in 1991; property crime is down 40 percent. We just don't want to see it creep back up. Newly released FBI data report that violent crime increased by nearly 4 percent between 2014 and 2015, with murders rising by nearly 11 percent, but crime researchers said homicides and other violence still remain at low rates compared with a crime wave from 20 years ago. About seven cities are largely responsible for the increase in murders last year, but that pattern has not held steady into 2016, when homicides in some places, including Baltimore and Washington, have dropped. The Fair Punishment Project, a center based at the Harvard Law School, pointed out that the country is \"safer under President Obama than under any other president in over a half-century.\" \"No year during George W. Bush's, Bill Clinton's, George H.W. Bush's or Ronald Reagan's presidency was as safe as 2015,\" according to a summary prepared by the project leaders. \"Violent crime in the U.S. is near historic lows and the country is dramatically safer than it was 45 years ago, 25 years ago, and 10 years ago.\" \u2014 Scott Horsley We've had twenty five years of very good cooperation but there were some problems some unintended consequences. Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses and it's just a fact that if you are young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted and incarcerated. So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system. We cannot just say law and order. We have to say, we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little. We need to have more second chance programs. I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system. I want to see them ended in the state system. Private prisons are not being phased out throughout the federal government. The Justice Department's Bureau of Prisons is phasing out its reliance on private prisons, but the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 which has more than 70 percent of its noncitizen detainees in private prisons \u2014 is studying the issue but has made no commitment to sever its ties to the for-profit prison industry. \u2014 John Burnett You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans. So there are some positive ways we can work on this. And I believe, strongly, that common sense gun safety measures would assist us. Right now, and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby. Right now, we've got too many military-style weapons on the streets in a lot of places, our police are outgunned. We need comprehensive background checks and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm and we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who is on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country. If you are too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun. So there are things we can do and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way. LESTER HOLT: Secretary Clinton last week you said we've got to do everything possible to improve policing to go right at implicit bias. Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people? HILLARY CLINTON: Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police. I think unfortunately too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other. And therefore I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way? But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said in my first budget we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by re- training a lot of our police officers. I've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago. They admit it's an issue. They've got a lot of concerns. Mental health is one of the biggest concerns because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street. They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance. And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that. Clinton has said she will devote $1 billion in her first budget to training and safety for law enforcement. \u2014 Carrie Johnson DONALD TRUMP: I'd like to respond. LESTER HOLT: Please. DONALD TRUMP: First of all, I agree and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no-fly lists. I agree with you when a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA which I'm very proud of, these are very, very good people and they're protecting the Second Amendment, but I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watchlists and when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we will help them get off. But I tend to agree with that. Quite strongly. I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the word super predator about young black youth. And that's a term that I think was that's been horribly met as you know. I think you've apologized for it. But I think it was a terrible thing to say. And when it comes to stop and frisk, you know, you're talking about taking the guns away. Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them. Clinton has told the International Association of Chiefs of Police and several audiences that she supports Second Amendment rights and simply wants to take guns out of the hands of criminals and others who should not have them. \u2014 Carrie Johnson And I don't think, I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth. I think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe. In New York City, stop and risk, we had 2,200 murders and stop and frisk brought it down to 500 murders. Five hundred murders is a lot of murders. Hard to believe 500 is like supposed to be good? But we went from 2,200 to 500 and it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg. And it was terminated by our current mayor. But stop and frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City, tremendous beyond belief, so when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very big impact. Studies by scholars at Columbia University and elsewhere say the widespread use of stop-and-frisk resulted in relatively few arrests or illegal gun recoveries. New York's homicide numbers remain very low, at 352 in 2015 and a projected 359 this year, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. New York Police Department spokesman Peter Donald said stop-and-frisk has declined nearly 97 percent since 2011 and crime, murders and shootings have \"decreased significantly during the same period.\" \u2014 Carrie Johnson HILLARY CLINTON: Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors that under the current mayor crime has continued to drop, including murders. So there is- DONALD TRUMP:You're wrong. HILLARY CLINTON: No, I'm not. DONALD TRUMP: Murders murders are up. Homicides in New York remain low relative to the 1980s and 1990s, according to FBI data and the Brennan Center for Justice. \u2014 Carrie Johnson HILLARY CLINTON: New York has done an excellent job. And I give credit, I give credit across the board going back to mayors to police chiefs because it has worked. And other communities need to come together to do what will work as well. Look one murder is too many. DONALD TRUMP: True. HILLARY CLINTON: But it is important that we learn about what has been effective and not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want. Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe? But let's also add no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods. And so we need to do a better job of working again with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem. LESTER HOLT: This conversation is about race and so Mr. Trump, I have to ask you.... DONALD TRUMP: But I'd like to just respond if I might? LESTER HOLT: Please, please respond. DONALD TRUMP: The African American community has been let down by our politicians. They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election they said see you later, I'll see you in four years. The African-American- look the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated, they been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians because that's what it is. They've controlled these communities for up to a hundred years. LESTER HOLT: Mr. Trump. DONALD TRUMP: And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities, and I just left Detroit and I just left Philadelphia and I just you know you've see me I been all over the place, you decided to stay home, and that's OK. But I will tell you I've been all over, and I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities. And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done. LESTER HOLT: Mr. Trump. HILLARY CLINTON:I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And yes I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president, and I think that's a good thing. :[(APPLAUSE)] HILLARY CLINTON: LESTER HOLT: Mr. Trump for five years you perpetuated a false claim of the nation's first black president was not a natural-born citizen. You questioned his legitimacy. In last couple weeks you acknowledge what most Americans have accepted for years, the president was born in the United States. Can you tell us what took you so long? DONALD TRUMP: I'll tell you- it's very simple to say. Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and a very close friend of Secretary Clinton. And her campaign manager Patti Doyle went to, during her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard, and you can go look it up, and you can check it out, and if you look at CNN this past week Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened. Blumenthal sent McClatchy, a highly-respected reporter at McClatchy to Kenya to find out about it. There is no truth to the charge that the Clinton campaign or Hillary Clinton started the birther movement, as we've written. Donald Trump, however, for several years was the chief spokesman for it and the principal person pushing the falsehood. And Trump still has not apologized to the president of the United States for an effort that many African-Americans saw as an effort to delegitimize the first black president. Undoubtedly, Clinton and Obama fought a bitter 2008 primary campaign. Fringe supporters and advisers did go after Obama's \"otherness.\" One of Clinton's informal advisers, Sidney Blumenthal, told a McClatchy bureau chief based in Africa to look into Obama's birthplace, according to that McClatchy bureau chief. But Clinton certainly did not take the show on the road. The false equivalence Trump is trying to draw isn't even remotely close to the same thing as what Trump did. For the record, once again, Barack Obama was born in Hawaii, something proved over and over again. Here's his birth certificate, the legitimacy of which Trump called into question explicitly as late as 2014. \u2014 Domenico Montanaro They were pressing it very hard, she failed to get the birth certificate. When I got involved, I didn't fail. I got him to give the birth certificate. So I'm satisfied with it, and I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it. LESTER HOLT: That was in 2011. DONALD TRUMP: Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS. Because I want to get on to creating jobs. Because I want to get on to having a strong border. Because I want to get on the things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country. LESTER HOLT: I will let you respond, that's important. But I just want to get the answer here. The birth certificate was produced in 2011, you continued to tell the story and question the president's legitimacy in 2012, 13, 14, 15, as recently as January. So the question is, what changed your mind? DONALD TRUMP: Well, nobody was pressing it. Nobody was caring much about it. I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate. And I think I did a good job. Secretary Clinton also fought it. I mean, you know, now everybody in the mainstream's gonna say, that's not true. Look, it's true. Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter. You just have to take a look at CNN last week, the interview with your former campaign manager. And she was involved. But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce. LESTER HOLT: I'm sorry. I'm just going to follow up. I will let you respond because there is a lot there. We're talking about racial healing in the segment. What do you say to Americans -- DONALD TRUMP: I say nothing because I was able to get him to produce it. He should have produced a long time before. I say nothing, but let me just tell you. When you talk about healing, I think that I developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community. I think you can see that. And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion. And I think I did a great job and a great service, not only for the country but even for the president in getting him to produce his birth certificate. LESTER HOLT: Secretary Clinton. HILLARY CLINTON:Well, just listen to what you heard. :[(LAUGHTER)] HILLARY CLINTON: And, clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was gonna stand on this debate stage and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions. So he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed. But it can't be dismissed that easily. He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen. There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted. He persisted year after year because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold apparently believed it or wanted to believe it. But remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination. Because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans. And he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy. He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department. So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. And the birther lie was a very hurtful one. You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity, and I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him. But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention. When they go low, we go high. And Barack Obama went high despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down. LESTER HOLT: Mr. Trump, you can respond then we're going to move on in a second. DONALD TRUMP:I would love to respond. First of all, I got to watch, in preparing for this, some of your debates against Barack Obama. You treated him with terrible disrespect. And I watch the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are. Doesn't work that way. You are after him. You were trying to \u2014 you even sent out, or your campaign sent out, pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures. I don't think you can deny that. But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true. So when you try to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work. It really doesn't. Now as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went to my father's company. Had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens. And we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country, a federal lawsuit, were sued. We settled the suit with zero \u2014 with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do. But they sued many people. I notice you bring that up a lot, and, you know, I also noticed the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you. Maybe I'm trying to save the money. But frankly, I look at that, and I say \u2014 isn't that amazing? Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt. But that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms. And it's just one of those things. I'll go on one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida \u2014 tough community \u2014 a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club. And really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African-Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. And it's a tremendously successful club. And I'm so glad I did it. And I have been given great credit for what I did. And I'm very, very proud of it. And that's the way I feel. That is the true way I feel. LESTER HOLT:Our next segment is called securing America. And we want to start with a twenty first century war happening every day in this country. Our institutions are under cyber attack, and our secrets are being stolen. So my question is, who's behind it? And how do we fight it? Secretary Clinton, this answer goes to you. HILLARY CLINTON:Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare, will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president because clearly, we're facing, at this point, two different kinds of adversaries. There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they then can use to make money. But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states. The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia. There is no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country. And I am deeply concerned about this. I know Donald's very praise-worthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really tough, long game here. And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee. And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information. We need to make it very clear, whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else, the United States has much greater capacity. Espionage is broadly tolerated under international law. Cyber-espionage is having a clear impact on private and public organizations. The U.S. has filed indictments and issued sanctions to deter cyber-espionage activities. But the federal government has not filled key positions to protect data. While the government announced a federal chief security officer position, it's vacant. Some say the position lacks seniority and resources. Also, White House cybersecurity czar Michael Daniel boasted about his lack of technical expertise. After the DNC hack, the advisers who were appointed lacked information security backgrounds. \u2014 Aarti Shahani And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information. Our private-sector information or our public-sector information. And were going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have. We don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare, but we will defend the citizens of this country And the Russians need to understand that. I think they've been treating it as almost a probing. How far would we go? How much would we do? And that's why I was so \u2014 I was so shocked Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans. That is just unacceptable. It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information \u2014 administrations -- LESTER HOLT: Your two minutes have expired. HILLARY CLINTON:. have said that Donald had is unfit to be the commander in chief. It's comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face. LESTER HOLT: Mr. Trump you have two minutes of the same question \u2014 who's behind it and how do we fight it? DONALD TRUMP: I do want to say that I was just endorsed and more are coming next week, it'll be over two hundred admirals, many of them are here, admirals and generals endorsed me to leave this country. That just happened and many more are coming. And I'm very proud of it. In addition, I was is endorsed by ICE. They've never endorsed anybody before \u2014 on immigration. I was just endorsed by ICE. Trump was endorsed by a group of former customs enforcement officers, not by the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. \u2014 Phil Ewing NPR: sh-border-patrol The Border Patrol has doubled in size since Sept. 11 to more than 21,000. Trump has proposed adding about 5,000 more. The bipartisan Senate bill in 2013 would have gone further, to 38,000. CONT: Meanwhile, apprehensions at the Southwest border \u2014 a proxy for attempted crossings \u2014 have dropped by 79 percent from the peak in 2000. The Pew Research Center reports more Mexicans left the U.S. than entered between 2009 and 2014. NPR: jb-border-patrol-council Both the National Border Patrol Council and the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council have endorsed Donald Trump \u2014 the first time these federal law enforcement unions have made presidential endorsements. \"I know he's kind of polarizing, but what I do appreciate is now we have people talking about immigration like never before, and border security like never before,\" John Anfinsen, Border Patrol union local official in Del Rio, Texas, told NPR. I was just recently endorsed...16,500 border patrol agencies. So when Secretary Clinton talked about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see who have led our country so brilliantly over the last ten years with their knowledge because look at the mess that were in. Look at the mess that were in. As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said. We should be better than anybody else and perhaps we're not. I don't think anybody knows that it was Russia that broke into the DNC. She saying Russia, Russia, Russia. I don't \u2014 maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China, it could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed who weighs 400 pounds, ok? You don't know how broke into DNC? But what did we learn with DNC? We learn that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Look what happened to her. But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of. That's what it was. Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know because the truth is under President Obama, we've lost control of things that we used to have control of. We came in with the Internet. We came up with the Internet. And I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game. ISIS. So we had to get very very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is a huge problem. I have a son \u2014 he's ten years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers. It's unbelievable. Clinton has echoed Obama's call to teach computer science to all American students; Trump has not. \u2014 Anya Kamenetz The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe, it's hardly doable. But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. But that's true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester. And certainly cyber is one of them. Neither candidate has articulated a policy position on cyberwar versus cyberpeace. It's not clear whether either would sanction \"hacking back\" after an attack \u2014 a key power the president has. \u2014 Aarti Shahani LESTER HOLT: Secretary Clinton? HILLARY CLINTON: Well, I think there are number of issues that we should be addressing. I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS. It does involve going after them online. I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct, people in our country, in Europe, and elsewhere. But we also have to intensify our airstrikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take able to actually take out ISIS in Rocca and in their claim of being a caliphate. We're making progress. Our military is assisting in Iraq, and we're hoping that within the year, will be able to push ISIS out of Iraq, and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria. But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons. So we have to make this a top priority, and I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership. I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaeda leadership when I was secretary of state, including of course, taking out bin Laden. And I think we need to go after Baghdadi as well, make that one of our organizing principles because we've got to defeat ISIS. And we have got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online. LESTER HOLT: You mention ISIS and we think of ISIS as over there. But there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil. The latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota in the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando. I'll ask this to both of you. Tell us specifically how you prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens. Mr. Trump. DONALD TRUMP: Well, first I have to say one thing \u2014 very important. Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS. We will take out ISIS. Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq because they got out \u2014 they shouldn't have been in but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster. And ISIS was formed. So she talks about taking them out. She's been doing it a long time. She's been trying to take them out for a long time. But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like ten thousand or maybe something more than that. And then you wouldn't have had them. Or, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree because I said it to you once-- had we taken the oil \u2014 and we should have taken the oil, ISIS would not have been able to form either because the oil was their primary source of income. And now to have the oil all over the place including the oil, a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters. Trump's support for \"taking the oil\" appears to indicate support for deploying U.S. troops to seize the energy production infrastructure of Iraq, Syria and other places. U.S. forces might need to fight a home country's military for control of wells and refineries, then capture and hold pipelines and generally become a long-term occupying force to preserve American control of such resources. \u2014 Phil Ewing LESTER HOLT:Secretary Clinton. HILLARY CLINTON: Well, I hope the fact checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard. Donald supported the invasion of Iraq. DONALD TRUMP:Wrong. HILLARY CLINTON:That is absolutely proved over and over again. DONALD TRUMP:Wrong. HILLARY CLINTON: He actually advocated for their actions we took in Libya and urged that Gaddafi be taken out after actually doing some business with him one time. But the larger point, he says this constantly, is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama. And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then Iraqi government that would have protected our troops That is true, but Republicans have argued that the Obama administration could have done a better job negotiating a memorandum of understanding to keep a residual force in Iraq. \u2014 Michele Kelemen And the Iraqi government would not give that. But let's talk about the question you asked, Lester. The question you asked is what do we do here in the United States? That's the most important part of this. How do we prevent attacks? How do we protect our people? And I think we have got to have an intelligence surge where we are looking for every scrap of information. I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey. They responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami. And they brought him down. And we may find out more information because he is still alive which may prove to be an intelligence benefit. So we have got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East. That means we've got to work more closely with our allies. And that is something that Donald has been very dismissive of. Working with NATO the longest military alliance in the history of the world to really turn our attention to terrorism. We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations. Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community. They're on the frontlines. They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else. They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away at some of Donald's rhetoric unfortunately has led to. LESTER HOLT: Mr. -- DONALD TRUMP: Well, I have to respond. LESTER HOLT: Please respond. DONALD TRUMP: The secretary said very strongly about working with \u2014 we've working with them for many years and we have the greatest mess anyone has ever seen. Look at the Middle East. It's a total mess. Under your direction to a large extent. But you look at the Middle East. You started the Iran deal, that's another beauty, where you have a country that was ready to fall, they were doing so badly, they were choking on the sanctions. And now they're going to be actually probably be a major power at some point pretty soon the way they are going. But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO? Now you have to understand, I'm a businessperson. I did really well. But I have common sense. And I said, well, I'll tell you. I haven't given lots of thought to NATO. But two things \u2014 but number one the 28 countries of NATO many of them aren't paying their fair share. Number two...and that bothers me, because we should be asked where defending them -- should be at least be paying us what they are supposed to be paying by treaty and contract. Only a handful of NATO's 28 members spend the 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense as required by their membership. American secretaries of defense since Donald Rumsfeld have criticized the alliance and its members for not meeting their commitments. As of 2016, the nations committing the 2 percent were the U.S., Greece, the United Kingdom, Estonia and Poland. \u2014 Phil Ewing Number two, I said the very strongly, NATO can be obsolete because, and I was very strong about this and was actually covered very accurately New York Times which is unusual for the New York Times to be honest \u2014 but I said they do not focus on terror. And I was very strong. And I said it numerous times. And about four months ago I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening of major terror division. I think that's great. And I think we should get, because we pay approximately seventy three percent of the cost of NATO-- a lot of money \u2014 to protect other people \u2014 but I'm am all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror also. And they are going to do that. And I was \u2014 really I'm not going to get credit for it because largely because of it I was saying in my criticism of NATO. I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us in addition to surrounding nations we have to knock the hell out of ISIS. And we have to do it fast. When ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton and believe me you were the ones that took out the troops, not only that, you named the day. They couldn't believe it. They sat back probably said...When they formed this is something that never should have happened. It shouldn't have never happened. Now you're talking about taking out ISIS. But you were there and you were Secretary of State when it was a little infant. Now it is in over thirty countries and you are going to stop them? I don't think so. LESTER HOLT: Mr. Trump a lot of these are judgment questions. You had supported thew ar in iraq before the invasion. DONALD TRUMP: I did not support the war in Iraq. He did express support, in an interview with Howard Stern. The transcript of the Stern interview shows Stern asking Trump if he favored invading Iraq. Trump replied, \"Yeah, I guess so. You know, I wish the first time it was done correctly.\" \u2014 Mary Louise Kelly That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her because she frankly \u2014 I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media. LESTER HOLT: My question is, since you supported it, why is your judgment.... DONALD TRUMP: I was against the war \u2014 wait a minute, I was against the war in Iraq. LESTER HOLT:The record shows otherwise. DONALD TRUMP: The record shows that I am right. When I did an interview with Howard Stern very likely first time anyone has asked me that I said very lightly I don't know maybe who knows. Essentially. I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto. We talked about the economy as more important. I then spoke to Sean Hannity which everyone refuses to call Sean Hannity. I had numerous conversation with Sean Hannity at Fox. And Sean Hannity said, and he called me the other day. And I spoke to him about it. He said you were totally against the war because he was for the war. LESTER HOLT: Why is your judgment better than... DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me \u2014 that was before the war started. Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people \u2014 he's willing to say it but nobody wants to call him. I was against the war. He said you used to have fights with me cause Sean was in favor of the war. And I understand that side also-- not very much because we should never have been there \u2014 but nobody called Sean Hannity. And then they did an article in a major magazine shortly after the war started. I think in '04. But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq. And one of your compatriots said you know whether it was before or right after Trump was definitely \u2014 because if you read this article there is no doubt. But if somebody and I'll ask the press, if somebody would call up Sean Hannity this was before the war started. He and I used to have arguments about the war. I said it's a terrible and a stupid thing. It's going to destabilize the Middle East. And that is exactly what it has done. LESTER HOLT: My reference was to what you said in 2002. My question was why is your judgment any different than Mrs.Clinton's? DONALD TRUMP: Well, I have much better question judgment than she does. There's no question about that. I also have a much better temperament that she has, you know? You know, I have a much better \u2014 she spent \u2014 let me tell you. She spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising, you know they get Madison Avenue into a room, oh temperament, let's go after that.... I think my strongest asset maybe by far is my temperament. I have a winning temperament. Per this recent Fox News poll, 59 percent of likely voters say Clinton has the temperament to be president, compared with 38 percent who say the same for Trump. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben I know how to win. She does not know how to win. The AFL-CIO - the other day behind the blue screen I don't know who you're talking to Secretary Clinton but you were totally out of control. I said, there is a person with a temperament that's got a problem. LESTER HOLT: Secretary Clinton? HILLARY CLINTON:Okay. :[(LAUGHTER)] HILLARY CLINTON: Let's talk about to important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald. First NATO. You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called article five and basically says this \u2014 an attack on one is an attack on all. And do you know, the only time it's ever been invoked - after 9/11 when the twenty eight nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism. Something that they still are doing by our side. With respect to Iran, when I became Secretary of State, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb. They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration. They had built covert facilities. They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away And we had sanctioned them. I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate. But it wasn't enough. So I spent a year and a half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran. And we did drive them to negotiation table. And my successor John Kerry and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program. Without firing a single shot. That's diplomacy. That's coalition-building. Trump often says Clinton started the Iran negotiations. While she did pave the way for a back channel, the negotiations took place after she left office and John Kerry became secretary of state. \u2014 Michele Kelemen That's working with other nations. The other day I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on his ship in the waters off of Iran and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship. He said, you know if they taunted our sailors I would blow them out of the water and start another war. The actual quote from Trump, from a campaign event in Florida earlier in September, was, \"When they circle our beautiful destroyers with their little boats and they make gestures at our people that they shouldn't be allowed to make, they will be shot out of the water, OK?\" \u2014 Mary Louise Kelly DONALD TRUMP: That would not start a war. HILLARY CLINTON: That is not the right temperament to be commander-in-chief to be taunted and the worst part DONALD TRUMP: They were taunting us. HILLARY CLINTON: ...has been about nuclear weapons. He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons - Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons. He even said, you know if there were nuclear war in East Asia well, you know, that's fine, have a good time folks. DONALD TRUMP: Wrong. HILLARY CLINTON: That in fact his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling, that is the number one threat we face in the world and it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material. So a man who could be provoked by a tweet shouldn't have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned. DONALD TRUMP: That line's getting a little bit old, I must say. HILLARY CLINTON: It's a good one though. It well describes the problems. DONALD TRUMP: It's not inaccurate one at all. So I just want to get a lot of things and just to respond. I agree with her on one thing. The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons. Not global warming like you think and your president thinks. Nuclear is the single greatest threat. Just to go down the list we defend Japan. We defend Germany. We defend South Korea. We defend Saudi Arabia. We defend countries. They do not pay us what they should be paying us because we are providing tremendous service and were losing a fortune. South Korean government figures show it paid around $866.6 million in 2014 for the U.S. military presence in the country. That's about 40 percent of the cost. Japan's budget shows that it covers about $4 billion in base-related expenses. \u2014 Elise Hu That's why we're losing, we're losing, we lose on everything. I say you makes these? All I said that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share because this isn't forty years ago where we could do what we're doing. We can't defend Japan. The U.S. and Japan are signatories to a mutual defense treaty. \u2014 Phil Ewing LESTER HOLT:We need to move on. DONALD TRUMP: But wait, it's very important. All I said was that they may have to defend themselves or they may have to help us out. For a country that owes twenty trillion dollars, they have to help us out. LESTER HOLT: Our last. DONALD TRUMP: As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agreed it is the single greatest threat that this country has. LESTER HOLT: Which leads my next question as we enter our last segment here, still on the subject of securing America on nuclear weapons President Obama reportedly considered changing the nation's long-standing policy on first use. Do you support the current policy Mr. Trump you have two minutes on that. DONALD TRUMP: Well, I have to say for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. But Russia's been expanding. They have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint I look the other night I was seeing B-52s there old enough that your father, your grandfather could be find them. The Air Force's fleet of B-52s was delivered in the administrations of Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy. The newest bomber in the fleet is more than 50 years old. \u2014 Phil Ewing We are not we are not keeping up with other countries I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it but I would certainly not due for a strike. I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over. At the same time we have to be prepared. I can't take anything off the table because you look at some of these countries you look at North Korea we're doing nothing there. China should solve the problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea. China, while not pleased about the nuclear advancement of North Korea, also has a historical \"lips and teeth\" relationship with North Korea and is Pyongyang's largest trading partner. An estimated 90 percent of North Korea's trade goes to or through China. But China is not interested in \"going into\" North Korea, as a collapse of the Kim Jong Un regime could lead to a refugee crisis at the Chinese-North Korean border or worse, a chaotic situation in which remaining North Korean military take control of its nuclear weapons. \u2014 Elise Hu And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal. Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. Iran has power over North Korea. And when they made that horrible deal with Iran they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea. And they should've done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places and when I asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that, why didn't you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including four hundred million dollars in cash nobody's ever seen it before that turned out to be wrong. It was actually 1.7 billion dollars in cash obviously I guess for the hostages it certainly looks that way. So you say to yourself why didn't they make the right deal? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history. The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems. All they have to do is sit back ten years and they don't have to do much. And they're going to end up getting nuclear. I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day, believe me he is not a happy camper. In January, when the U.S. and Iran announced a prisoner swap, the U.S. also cleared $400 million in claims that date to the 1979 Iranian Revolution. The Obama administration also agreed to pay interest, in total $1.7 billion. It was paid in cash. \u2014 Michele Kelemen LESTER HOLT: Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes. HILLARY CLINTON: Let me start by saying words matter, words matter when you run for president and they really matter when you are president. And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them. It is essential that America's word be good. While this Clinton statement is underlining the basics of America's traditional foreign policy, it illustrates a key difference between the candidates. Trump doesn't want to be \"policeman of the world,\" but a longstanding key of America's Asia policy for keeping peace in the Pacific is maintaining decades-old alliances with Japan and South Korea. Many view the U.S.-Japan-R.O.K alliance as a bulwark against a rising China, so it's interesting that Trump both demonizes China when speaking of trade and believes China to be key in solving the North Korea problem but does not support alliances that can be a counterweight to it. \u2014 Elise Hu And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and some worries on the part of many leaders across the globe. I've talked with a number of them. But I want to, on behalf of myself and I think on behalf of the majority of the American people, say that you know, our word is good. It's also important that we look at the entire global situation. There is no doubt that we have other problems with Iran but personally I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that. And Donald never tells you what he would do. What he have started a war? Would he have bombed Iran? If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be. But it's like his plan to defeat ISIS \u2014 he says it's a secret plan but the only secret is that he has no plan. So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues. People around the world follow our presidential campaigns so closely trying to get hints about what we will do. Can they rely on us? Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values? That's what I intend to do. I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on both here at home and around the world. To make decisions that will further peace and prosperity. But also stand up to bullies whether they are abroad or at home. We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security. LESTER HOLT: Your two minutes is... HILLARY CLINTON: Be given any opportunities at all. LESTER HOLT: Is expired. DONALD TRUMP: Lester, one thing I'd like to say. LESTER HOLT:One very quickly. DONALD TRUMP:I will go very quickly but I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS which she could've defeated by never having it get going in the first place. Right now it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them because they are in more places more and more states more and more nations LESTER HOLT: Mr. Trump. DONALD TRUMP: And it's a big problem, and is as far Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies but we are losing billions and billions of dollars. We cannot be the policeman of the world. We cannot protect countries all over the world. LESTER HOLT:You have just a... DONALD TRUMP: Where they're not paying us what we need. LESTER HOLT:Just a few final questions. DONALD TRUMP:She can't say that because she's got no business ability. We need heart, we need a lot of things but you need some basic ability. And sadly she doesn't have that. basic ability All of the things that she's talking about could have been taken care of during the last ten years, let's see, while she had great power. But they weren't taken care of and if she ever wins this race, they won't be taken care of. LESTER HOLT: Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton became in the first woman nominated for president by a major party earlier this month. You said quote she doesn't have a presidential look. She's standing here right now what you mean by that? DONALD TRUMP: She doesn't have the look. She don't have the stamina. I said she doesn't have the stamina. And I don't believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country you need tremendous stamina. LESTER HOLT: The quote was, \"I just don't think she has a presidential look...\" DONALD TRUMP: Wait a minute, Lester, you asked me a question. Did you ask me a question? You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals. You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan with Saudi Arabia I mean can you imagine where defending Saudi Arabia and with all of the money they have we're defending them and they're not paying...all you have to do is to speak to them. What you have so many different things you have to be able to do and I don't believe that Hillary has the stamina. Saudi Arabia has purchased more than $90 billion worth of weapons from the U.S. during the Obama administration according to the Congressional Research Service. \u2014 Phil Ewing LESTER HOLT: Let's let her respond. HILLARY CLINTON: Well as soon as he travels to one hundred and twelve countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, and opening of new opportunities and nations around the world or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina. Clinton testified before a House panel investigating the attacks in Benghazi, Libya, in which a U.S. ambassador died, for about 11 hours in 2015. \u2014 Carrie Johnson DONALD TRUMP: The world. :[(APPLAUSE)] DONALD TRUMP: Let me tell you, let me tell you. Hillary has experience but it's bad experience. We have made so many bad deals during the last so she's got experience that I agree but it's bad, bad experience. Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with where we gave them 150 billion dollars back...whether it's the Iran deal whether it's anything you almost can't name a good deal. I agree, she's got experience but it's bad experience. And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience. LESTER HOLT: We are at the \u2014 rear of the final question. HILLARY CLINTON: Well, one thing Lester, is you know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina but this is a man who is called women pigs, slobs, and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers DONALD TRUMP: I never said that. Here is a clip of Trump saying that pregnancy is an inconvenience for businesses. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben HILLARY CLINTON: who has said women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men and one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest, he loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman Miss Piggy. Then he called her Miss Housekeeping because she was Latina. Donald she has a name. DONALD TRUMP:Where did you find it? HILLARY CLINTON:Her name is Alicia Machado and she has become a US citizen and you can bet she's going to vote this November. DONALD TRUMP:Okay, good let me just tell you -- LESTER HOLT: Mr. Trump are going to take ten seconds and then we're going to have a final question. DONALD TRUMP: You know Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials, some of it's entertainment, some of it is said somebody's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said tough things to her and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her but you want to know the truth I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself I can't do it, I just can't do it. It's inappropriate, it's not nice but she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me many which are absolutely untrue. They're untrue and they're misrepresentations. And I will tell you this, Lester, it's not nice and I don't I don't deserve that. But it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done. It's hundreds of millions of ads and the only gratifying thing is I saw the polls come in today and with all of that money, over two hundred millions of spent and I'm either winning or spent. LESTER HOLT:One of you will not win this election. So my final question to you tonight are you willing to accept the outcome as the will of the voters Secretary Clinton. HILLARY CLINTON: Well, I support our democracy. And sometimes you and sometimes you lose, but I certainly will support the outcome of this election. And I know Donald trying very hard to plant doubts about it but I hope the people out there understand this election's really up to you. It's not about us so much is it about you and your families and the kinds of country and future you want. So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it because I think it does. LESTER HOLT: Mr. Trump very quickly . will you accept the outcome as the will of the voters? DONALD TRUMP:I want to make America great again. We are a nation that is seriously troubled. We're losing our jobs people are pouring into our country the other day we were deporting eight hundred people and perhaps they passed the wrong button they pressed the wrong button or perhaps worse than that it was corruption. We will for good reason and up and becoming citizens ended up becoming 800 now it's 1500 and they don't even know, The Bureau of Labor Statistics' data show net job growth during President Obama's two terms is about 10.5 million new private sector jobs. \u2014 Marilyn Geewax Trump is correct that the inspector general of Homeland Security released a report on Sept. 8 faulting immigration officials for granting citizenship to 858 deportable immigrants because of missing fingerprint records. The records had never been digitized and entered into federal databases. Further, Immigration and Customs Enforcement identified an additional 148,000 older fingerprint records of deportable immigrants, some of whom are criminals or fugitives. There is no proof, as Trump asserted in the debate, that this mistake was due to corruption. \u2014 John Burnett LESTER HOLT:Will you accept the outcome of the election? DONALD TRUMP: I want to make America great again. I'm going to be able to do it. I don't believe Hillary will. The answer is if she wins I will absolutely support her. LESTER HOLT:All right with that is going to do for us that concludes our debate for this evening - a spirited one. We covered a lot of ground, not everything as I suspected we would. The next presidential debates are scheduled for October ninth and Washington University in St. Louis and October nineteen at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. The conversation will continue. A reminder, the vice presidential debate is scheduled for October fourth at Longwood University in Farmville Virginia. My thanks to Hillary Clinton and to Donald Trump and to Hofstra University for hosting us tonight. Good night everyone.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton's responses to the incidents in New Jersey, New York and Minnesota highlight differences in their leadership styles as they prepare for the first debate next week.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: When events like this weekend's bombings in New York and New Jersey happen in the middle of a presidential campaign, it's natural to ask how the next president would handle the situation. Today Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton gave us contrasting images. Trump spoke to FOX News. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: We're trying to be so politically correct in our country, and this is only going to get worse. This isn't going to get better. And I've been talking to you guys for years. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: You have. TRUMP: And I've been saying it. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Well... TRUMP: This is only going to get worse. And what I said is you have to stop them from coming into the country. SHAPIRO: And Hillary Clinton addressed reporters. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) HILLARY CLINTON: I've laid out a comprehensive plan to meet the evolving nature of this threat and take the fight to ISIS everywhere they threaten us, including online. SHAPIRO: NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson joins us now. And Mara, what do you hear in those two very different reactions? MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: I hear a microcosm of the entire campaign. On the one hand, you've got Trump with a message that comes straight from the gut. It's an emotional reaction. The bottom line is be afraid; be very afraid. And I can keep you safe. We're going to get tough. Then he usually points to some kind of policy solution, in this case profiling and a ban on Muslim refugees and immigrants. When you scratch below that, it's hard to figure out exactly what he means because the suspect was not a refugee. He was an American citizen, and law enforcement caught him right away. On Hillary's part, as usual, her message comes from the head. She was measured and practical. The bottom line for her is this is complicated. I live in the real world. I understand this problem. We do need to do more, but we can't demonize an entire religion. And we don't need to sacrifice our values to fight terror. SHAPIRO: And what does the contrast between those two candidates and their messages tell you about the broader arc of the campaign? LIASSON: Well, what it tells you is you've got a establishment, status quo candidate who's playing by the normal rules, wants to go after ISIS with the tools that are available. And then you've got Donald Trump, who is not playing by any historical rules at all. He has a powerful emotional message geared to people who are afraid of terrorism and don't have the time or interest to think about the details. And many of them think, why should I? That's the commander in chief's job. And this has worked for him in the past. During the Republican primaries, his numbers went up the most after the San Bernardino attacks, and now we'll see if this has any effect on his numbers in the general election. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, has almost the entire national security establishment on her side, including many former Republican officials. Former Defense Secretary Bob Gates all but endorsed her, but Trump has a ready answer to that. He says the establishment made a mess. They didn't keep us safe, and ISIS grew on Clinton's watch. SHAPIRO: Well, Trump and Clinton will meet face to face one week from tonight for their first debate. What does each of them need to accomplish? LIASSON: Hillary Clinton needs to finally make the sale. There are a lot of people out there who don't want to vote for Donald Trump, but they are not sure about her. She has to make herself seem more likable, honest and trustworthy. Those are her weak points. That's very hard to do in a debate. Donald Trump, who's now practically even with her nationally and in many battleground states has an arguably lower bar - he needs to show that he's a plausible president. He has to help people imagine him as a commander in chief. SHAPIRO: We've been saying since the Republican and Democratic conventions that the first debate is the next big potential turning point. Do you see it as that important? LIASSON: Yes, I do see it as that important. It's going to have a huge audience. This race has gotten close. And because Trump is so unpredictable, there are going to be so many people tuning in just to see what he will do. And I do think - I think this debate is hugely important. SHAPIRO: NPR's Mara Liasson, thanks a lot. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: The usually stoic chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, gave a somewhat emotional speech today. She took responsibility for her party's loss yesterday in state elections in Berlin. Voters deserted the Christian Democrats in favor of a new anti-immigrant nationalist newcomer. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reports from Berlin. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats came in second in the vote count but just barely. It wasn't enough for them to keep governing here with the Social Democrats, who also had a poor showing, despite coming in first. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANGELA MERKEL: (Foreign language spoken). NELSON: The chancellor called the outcome bitter. She blamed herself for this and other recent protest votes over her refugee policy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MERKEL: (Foreign language spoken). NELSON: But she said anyone who doesn't want to take in foreigners, especially Muslims, can forget it. Her defiance is unlikely to win back supporters who are turning to the anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim Alternative for Germany or AfD. AfD now has seats in 10 of Germany's 16 state legislatures, despite allegations of anti-Semitism and ties to far-right extremists against some party officials. Georg Pazderski, who is AfD's leader here, lauded his party's success as a win for German democracy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GEORG PAZDERSKI: (Foreign language spoken). NELSON: He said, \"clearly we speak the language of regular German citizens and workers.\" It's a connection AfD leaders hope will land them in the next German parliament.

There will officially be no third-party candidate on the presidential debate stage. Libertarian Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green Party officially did not make the cut, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced Friday. To qualify for the stage, a candidate needs to be polling at 15 percent or higher in an average of five major national polls and qualify for the ballot in enough states to have a mathematical chance to win the presidency. Johnson had the best chance. His campaign said he made the ballot in all 50 states, the first third-party candidate to do so in 20 years since independent billionaire Ross Perot. But Johnson was only polling at an average of 8 percent in the five polls used for the criteria. (Stein is only averaging 3 percent.) Stein and Johnson struggled to gain traction, but both gained attention in an election that has seen dissatisfaction with their choices for president at similar levels to 1992. That year, Perot got the highest share of the vote for a third-party candidate since Theodore Roosevelt in 1912. But both have also stepped into controversies. On MSNBC's Morning Joe, Johnson awkwardly asked, \"What is Aleppo?\" when asked about the Syrian city that is at the center of the refugee crisis. Stein was accused of spray painting construction equipment during a Dakota Access pipeline protest in North Dakota and was charged with criminal trespass and criminal mischief. Stein, a pediatrician, raised concerns about children being exposed to Wi-Fi. There's no evidence wireless signals are harmful. Still, both have been reservoirs of protest support for those dissatisfied with Trump and Clinton, and polling is not clear who is potentially hurt most by their presence on the ballot. The first of three presidential debates is Sept. 26 at Hofstra University in New York.",

Presidential candidates deliver hundreds of stump speeches over the course of their campaigns. This week, we're looking closely to the messages that the two major-party candidates deliver in city after city. In his stump speech, Donald Trump brings the energy and spends a lot of time talking about core issues like illegal immigration and trade as well as attacking the media and hitting Hillary Clinton, especially over her emails. And there's plenty of ad-libbing, especially about what's in the news. Here, we take a closer look at how a speech Trump delivered on September 9 in Pensacola, Fla. lines up to his \"stump\": It is so great to be back in Florida, my second home. [Like most politicians, Trump thanks and acknowledges the people of the place that's hosting him. When he says Florida is his \"second home,\" he's referring to the exclusive Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, where he spends some of his time.] Let me also thank our good and dear friend, Chairman Jeff Miller, for joining us here today. We've worked closely together on developing much-needed reforms to take care of our Veterans. [Trump has made veterans' issues, particularly reforming Veterans Administration health system, a major theme of his campaign and speeches. He's outlined several proposals on his website, including giving veterans the option to see a private health care provider paid for by the government if they prefer that option to VA doctors.] Let me open by making this very important declaration: I love this state, I love the people of this state, and together we are going to have an amazing victory in November. Decades of political failure and corruption will come swiftly to an end, and a New American Future will begin. [This is a constant theme of Trump's speeches \u2014 that the political establishment of both parties, but especially the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton, has failed the American people through corruption and incompetence. For example, Trump often accuses Clinton of giving favors to people who've donated to her family's charity, the Clinton Foundation.] The citizens of this country will be in charge once more. The special interests have had their day. That chapter in our history is closing. The history book is closing on the failed politicians of yesterday. A new chapter is beginning, and this chapter will be authored by you, the American people. This will be your time. You will be running the show. Not the donors, not the insiders, not the media executives. Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people. All we have to do is cut our ties to the bitter failures of the past, and anything becomes possible. Change is coming. All the people who've rigged the system for their own personal benefit are trying to stop our change campaign because they know that their gravy train has reached its last stop. [Trump often uses this language, and began stepping up this kind of rhetoric as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign was flailing, in an attempt to woo Sanders supporters.] It's your turn now. This is your time. The fact that so many encrusted old political insiders oppose our campaign is the best proof you will ever need that we are fighting for real change \u2013 not partisan change. We are fighting for all Americans \u2013 Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Conservatives, Liberals \u2013 who've been failed by this corrupt system. We're fighting for everyone who doesn't have a voice. We're also fighting for every region of this country. For every part of Florida, and every part of America. From Pensacola to Pittsburgh, from Baltimore to Baton Rouge, we are fighting for every last city and every last person in this country. [Trump often promises to win in places that are traditionally Democratic strongholds, like New York and California, which would defy conventional political wisdom and so far is not backed up by polling in either state.] Hillary Clinton is the candidate of the past. Ours is the campaign of the future. In this future, we are going to pursue new trade policies that put American workers first \u2013 and that keep jobs in our country. All the people who got NAFTA wrong, and China wrong, and who are trying to give us the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2013 are the same failed voices pushing for Hillary Clinton. [Trump often promises to renegotiate or even walk away from trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump blames the Clintons for supporting even though it was heavily supported by members of his own party at the time.] Our trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars. We've lost one-third of our manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary Clinton gave us NAFTA. China is manipulating its currency and taking our jobs. We are going to stop companies from leaving our country and keep those jobs right here in America. The era of economic surrender is over. We will also have a very strong border that stops people and drugs from illegally pouring into our country \u2014 and we're going to build a border wall, and Mexico will pay for it. [Trump says this often. But Mexican leaders, including President Enrique Pena Nieto, continue to say they will not pay for a border wall. After a recent meeting with Pena Nieto, Trump said he had not made that request; Pena Nieto said Trump had asked and he reiterated to Trump that Mexico will not pay.] In this new future, we are going to raise your wages. Household incomes are over $4,000 less today than they were in the year 2000. [Trump often blames the Obama administration for problems in the U.S. economy. New Census data released this week found that while incomes were still down compared to before the recession, they've recently been recovering,] My tax, trade, energy, immigration and regulation reforms will get your salaries and wages up. Hillary Clinton will continue the failed economic agenda that has only made her friends rich at your personal expense. Many people in this room tonight, and across this country, haven't seen a real wage increase in 18 years. The people getting rich off of our rigged system have sent tens of millions of dollars to Hillary Clinton \u2013 much of it to her personal bank account \u2013 to keep you from having the future you deserve [It's unclear exactly what Trump is referring to with this accusation, though it's true that the Clintons have made millions of dollars in speaking fees to groups including Wall Street banks]. But on November 8th, you get to vote for the future you want. In this future, we are going to pursue new education policies. At the center of my plan is school choice. I want every disadvantaged child in America to be able to attend the public or private school that is right for them and their family. [Trump has been pushing school choice in recent days, including during a visit to a predominantly black charter school in Cleveland. He's promised $20 billion in new federal funding for school choice programs. He says he will pay for it with cutting inefficiencies in existing federal programs, though he has not identified which ones.] In this future, we are also going to keep our country out of the endless wars that have defined Hillary Clinton's career. To keep our country out of war, we will remember those three very famous words: Peace Through Strength. [This is a very old idea, in keeping with Trump's emphasis on the military and security, and it was a favorite of Ronald Reagan.] That means rebuilding our badly depleted military. I laid out a detailed plan this week to re-invest in our military and our troops. We are going to build a 350 ship Navy, a 540,000 soldier Army, an Air Force of 1,200 combat-ready fighter jets, and a Marine Core built on 36 Battalions. Crucially, we are also going to pursue a state-of-the-art missile defense. We will start by modernizing our cruisers to provide the Ballistic Missile Defense capability our nation needs. As we expand our Navy toward the goal of 350 ships, we will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed to handle the missile defense mission in the coming years. Just today we were reminded of the need for missile defense after North Korea performed its fourth nuclear test since Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State. One more massive Hillary Clinton failure. Just like she failed in Iran and put them on the path to nuclear weapons. Hillary Clinton has presided over the greatest series of foreign policy failures and blunders anyone has ever seen. Her policies have produced massive global disorder. She handed Iraq over to ISIS, unleashing that terror group onto the world. ISIS would not be threatening the West today if not for the decisions Hillary Clinton made. She helped destabilize Egypt by supporting the ouster of President Mubarak in exchange for the Muslim Brotherhood. Fortunately, President El-Sisi is now in charge, but terrorists have gained a foothold in that country. She helped push Syria into a prolonged civil war by pushing regime change in that country too \u2013 without any plan for the day after. She failed with China, which has only grown more aggressive. By the way, she also let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property. [The idea that Clinton has \"failed\" the American people is a constant theme for Trump. The Iran deal was finalized after her term as secretary of state was completed, though she was involved in the negotiations. Trump also frequently attacks her handling of the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya as secretary of state. Clinton was cleared of wrongdoing by a House Committee report this summer, though the report had harsh words for the State Department as a whole.] And of course, Hillary Clinton failed with her Russian Reset. She gave up missile defense in Poland and the Czech Republic in exchange for nothing in return. Then, she gave up 20% of U.S. uranium to Russia \u2013while those who benefited from the deal gave money to the Clintons. Let's not forget, Russia went into Crimea on President Obama's watch. Unlike Clinton and Obama, we will negotiate with Russia from a position of strength \u2013 not weakness. And weakness is all we get from President Obama and Hillary Clinton. The difference between me and my opponent on Vladimir Putin, and in all negotiations, is that I negotiate by creating leverage so I can extract a good deal for the United States. Hillary Clinton negotiates but never gets anything of value for the United States. Putin laughs at our leaders, and takes them to the cleaners again and again. That is why we will rebuild our military, strengthen our economy, and regain our position of leadership in the world \u2013 so we can negotiate from a position of great strength once again. If I cannot get a good deal for the United States, I will follow the example of Ronald Reagan and walk away. That is completely contrary to the way President Obama and Hillary Clinton negotiate which gets nothing of value for the United States, ever. They just keep losing. I will end this legacy of failure and strongly defend the interests of the United States. But I will also keep focused on the ultimate goal. We will not seek endless conflict and hostility; we won't get trapped in the failed approaches of the past. A future where America can find common ground with countries like Russia and China is a better future for our children. We will pursue these relationships with our eyes wide open, and a clear understanding of our many, many differences. I will advocate the American position with a strength and clarity President Obama and Hillary Clinton never have. No more apology tours. No more bowing to foreign powers. We proudly defend America at every single turn. America will get the respect it deserves. And if we don't, I will walk away from the deal like you've never seen anyone walk before. And, believe me, within a short while, they will come back \u2014 but only on my terms, therefore the terms of the American people. On these principles, we will pursue our long-term goals of peace \u2013 for the sake of our kids, and for the sake of the world's future. Hillary Clinton has failed in every single country where she has ever gotten involved, and at a very high price for the world. Her policies have produced only death and destruction, not diplomacy. She's trigger-happy, pushing recklessly for regime change \u2013 but never creating or promoting stability, or advancing the core interests of the United States. Her only real achievement as Secretary of State has been getting away with her massive email scandal. She bleached, deleted and destroyed her emails after a subpoena from Congress. She lied to Congress while under oath, and smashed her phones with a hammer to keep them from getting to authorities. By the way, who has thirteen phones in the first place? Only somebody with a whole lot to hide. [Trump frequently attacks Clinton for using a private email server while secretary of state. The FBI found that Clinton used up to 13 devices to send emails as secretary of state, a fact Trump has seized on as further evidence of what he describe as her corruption.] And we all know what Hillary Clinton was hiding. She was hiding her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State. Hillary Clinton isn't just part of the corrupt establishment, she is the corrupt establishment. I just saw her press conference today where Hillary Clinton complained about all of the problems in the world. If only we'd had a competent Secretary of State who could have prevented all of these problems from happening. Throughout it all, Hillary Clinton and her Foundation raked in millions and millions of dollars from the most oppressive and brutal regimes on earth. Hillary Clinton and her Foundation have cozied up to regimes that oppress and brutalize women, that murder gays, and that violate human rights on an unimaginable scale. My Administration will be a voice for all people who are oppressed, including the millions of women being oppressed by Radical Islam. Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years and produced only failure. Yet people keep giving her money and protecting her. It's the powerful protecting the powerful. The insiders fighting for insiders. I am fighting for you. All the people advising Hillary Clinton are the people responsible for the endless wars and conflicts, and the tragedies in the Middle East. I am proud to have the support of the retired generals and admirals who know how to win \u2013 and how to avoid endless war. [Both Clinton and Trump are touting military support, and have released dueling lists of supporters.] Let me also take this moment to express our deepest thanks and gratitude to everyone who has worn the uniform, but most especially to those who have given the ultimate sacrifice for this country. There is no greater expression of love than the love shown by the men and women who have laid down their lives for their country and its people. It is our duty to ensure that their sacrifices are not in vain. That means we don't issue timetables for political reasons, but that we work with our generals and our leaders to produce a real plan for victory. We will pursue a new, steady foreign policy that seeks to advance the national security interests of the United States \u2013 not a reckless, interventionist globalism that has failed this country so badly. And we will be clear in naming our enemy: Radical Islamic Terrorism. The fact that Hillary Clinton can't even say these words proves how unfit she is to lead this country. This is one single fact she can never escape. Any country that shares our goal of defeating this enemy will be our partner in this mission. We will break the cycle of regime change, and refugee crisis, that has gone on for so many years. We simply can't afford to continue down the road we are on right now. That applies to everything. Change is needed at every single level of our society. When I talk about making America Great Again, I'm talking about creating a future that includes each and every American. I want the most inclusive, generous and prosperous society we have ever had. The possibilities for our future are unlimited. The Hillary Clinton campaign is so small, so petty, so tired. If we just break from this bitter, divisive past, we can achieve anything. That also means breaking from the lies and the deceit of the Clintons. They want to scare you out of voting for change. The most recent smear comes from Bill Clinton, who said that the theme of Make America Great Again is somehow racist \u2013 now they've unearthed video footage of Bill Clinton repeatedly using this same phrase. It's just one more Clinton lie, one more desperate slander to keep the people from having the future they deserve. When I talk about Making America Great Again, I'm talking about making it Great Again for Everyone \u2013 but especially for all of the Americans who have been left behind. We are the campaign of unity, and we will deliver amazing things for all of our people. New schools, new factories, new infrastructure. Beautiful skyscrapers will rise all across this nation. We will develop Detroit, Not Beijing. Most importantly, we will fight to end the systemic poverty in our inner cities, and to lift millions of African-Americans and Hispanics out of poverty. Here, in Florida, we have such an amazing and diverse community of Hispanic-Americans \u2013 from Cuba, from Puerto Rico, from Venezuela, from Haiti, from all over. These incredible Americans will have in Donald J. Trump a President who is determined to fight for their jobs, their wages, their schools, and their futures. To all Hispanic-Americans who want better jobs and higher wages: I will be your champion. All working people, of all backgrounds and from all places, will have a true friend in Donald Trump. [Trump is struggling in the polls with minority voters and has been tailoring a message to these voters in recent weeks, though he's making the pitch in front of largely white audiences and there's little evidence the message is resonating with black and Hispanic voters.] In particular, I have a very special place in my heart for those who make a living as tradesmen, craftsmen and construction workers. I've spent my professional life among construction workers, bricklayers, electricians and plumbers. I feel more comfortable around blue collar workers than Wall Street executives. There's a reason the hedge fund managers are funding Hillary Clinton's campaign, and not mine. My campaign is powered by my own money, but also small dollar donations from people like all of you who just want their country back. This is our chance. It's our last chance to give the people control over their own futures once again. Gleaming new plants stretching across our nation. Young Latino children getting an amazing education at the school of their choice \u2013 and their parents having their jobs protected from unfair competition. Our Veterans will get the best healthcare in the world. You can read the whole plan on our website, DonaldJTrump.com. Massive tax reductions and tax simplification \u2013 so that you can keep more of your precious time and your hard-earned money. Hillary Clinton wants to raise your taxes big time. Most importantly, 2017 will be about unity. Once again, we will be One American Nation. We Will Be One American People. Just imagine what we can accomplish together if we set aside our differences, and focus on what we have in common as Americans. We will be one people, living under One God, saluting one beautiful American Flag. [Trump has been delivering this line in multiple recent speeches, including at the Values Voter Summit with evangelicals in DC last week, and to a group in Philadelphia. His campaign has not responded to requests for clarification. Critics have complained that the line sounds unfriendly to Americans of non-Christian faiths or no faith.] We Will Make America Proud Again. We Will Make America Prosperous Again. We Will Make America Safe Again. Friends and fellow citizens, We Will Make America Great Again! [Trump's promise to \"Make America Great Again\" is the central slogan of his campaign, but he has appropriated the line to emphasize other major themes, including security and the economy.]",

Researchers think this might be driven in part by their earliest experience of power \u2014 the family. It can happen anywhere: that moment when you gaze at the people around you and realize you simply can't understand their politics. How can these people \u2013 be they our friends, colleagues or, worst of all, our spouses \u2013 believe as they do, when facts and reason clearly point in the opposite direction? How can they support political candidates whose views are so antithetical to our definition of common sense? They're questions voters across the country have been asking a lot this election season \u2013 voters like Kate Burkett of Indiana and Tom Barnes of Maryland. Burkett is an English teacher in an Indianapolis high school. Many of her students are juggling not just their schoolwork, but more acute problems like hunger. \"The specific school that I teach at is a 73% free and reduced [price] lunch school. And also we are a minority majority school where we are 34% white students,\" she says. Burkett's experience in this school has taught her the importance of a social safety net. She doesn't just think government-supported lunch programs are useful. She knows it. \"I know these kids. I've known them for years. And I see the good that they go on to do in the world. And It's worth it. It's worth the investment.\" Six hundred miles to the east, Tom Barnes lives in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. Barnes is a farrier \u2013 he trims and shoes horses' hooves for a living. He believes in hard work, self-reliance and personal responsibility. And these qualities have shaped his political views, which he describes as \"fiscally and internationally conservative, not hard right, but conservative.\" Barnes would never take on too much household debt. And he wants his country to run like his home. \"I don't think people should take on more debt than they would be able to repay. And, if they can't, I think that there should be consequences for that. And I think the country is no different. We should not take on debt that we can't repay.\" When he thinks of what ails America, he returns to a model of how a family should operate. \"America need stricter parents. I truly do feel that way.\" Both Tom Barnes and Kate Burkett have good reasons to believe what they do. They are reasonable people with deeply held convictions. But put millions of Toms and millions of Kates together, and what you see isn't reasonable disagreement. Increasingly, Democrats and Republicans can't comprehend the other's point of view. It's not just the current campaign. Beyond the noise of the contest between Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton lies a gulf of distrust and misunderstanding. How did we get to a divide that feels so...unbridgeable? Here's one theory: our political preferences are driven by hidden moral frameworks we're not even aware of. George Lakoff is a cognitive linguist and retired professor from the University of California, Berkeley. He noticed decades ago that politicians often used metaphors describing the nation as a family. Was it possible, Lakoff wondered, that this metaphor of the country as a family lay beneath the mutual incomprehension that Democrats and Republicans feel toward one another? The moment this notion occurred to him, he started seeing examples everywhere. \"We have a metaphor that the nation is a family. We have Founding Fathers, we send our sons and daughters to war, we have homeland security, we don't want missiles in our backyard and so on and so on,\" he says. \"And the idea that occurred to me is that if that's the case, if you have two different views of the nation, you may have two different views of the family. So I worked backwards. I took the two different views of the nation, worked backwards through the metaphor and out popped two different views of the family.\" He describes the two models as \"strict father\" and \"nurturant parent.\" In the former, he says, \"the father knows best, the father knows right from wrong, and the job of the father is not just to support and protect the family but also, with respect to children, to teach them right from wrong so they have the right moral views.\" Nurturant parents, by contrast, feel their job is to empathize with their child, to know what their child needs, and to have open two-way discussions with their child. The real world, of course, is far more nuanced than these two models would suggest. Parents can, of course, be both strict and empathetic. Parents can disagree about the importance of rules and structure. But Lakoff argues that as we grow up, these models, based on love and the certainty that our way is the best way to raise kids, can shape the way we see the world. Psychologist Marti Gonzales at the University of Minnesota decided to test whether these basic family models are, in fact, reflected in our politics. She and her team analyzed all the presidential political ads that have played on daytime and prime time TV going back to 1980. She had research assistants listen to the ads and code them according to whether they had underlying metaphors that spoke to the idea of the strict parent and the nurturant or empathetic parent. \"The bottom line is Professor George Lakoff was right,\" she says. \"Republicans were much more likely to rely on strict father ideas to make their points, to persuade voters. Democrats were much more likely to use nurturant parent ideas.\" And when we draw on these moral frameworks, our political opponents and their views may become simply incomprehensible to us \u2013 although we may not realize how these hidden frameworks are shaping our opinions. \"The idea that we have alternative world views is not in our public discourse,\" says Lakoff. So here's one way to think about the next two months of this political season. The nation is in the middle of a parenting dispute. Each feels the other is on the wrong path, and so much is at stake. \"Parents who adhere to one or another conception of the ideal family want what's good for their children, and they parent in ways that they believe firmly believe with love in their hearts that will most benefit children in this complex world,\" says Gonzales. Like parents who can't get along, our political parties each believe they have the right answer to what the country needs. Partisans feel bewildered when policies that seem so self-evidently correct to them are rejected by the other side. Understandably, we explain these differences by pointing fingers and questioning each other's motives. And yet perhaps what fuels our inflexible certainty isn't stupidity or callousness: It's love.

            "article_content": "Asked on cable news what he would do about Aleppo, the city at the center of the Syrian refugee crisis, Gary Johnson asked, \"What is Aleppo?\" It revealed a surprising lack of foreign policy depth and could cause problems for his candidacy as he seeks to try and make the presidential debate stage.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: A lot of Americans aren't happy with either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, so third party presidential candidates are getting a closer look this year. And sometimes it's not very flattering. Libertarian White House hopeful Gary Johnson was getting some coveted TV time this morning on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\" It was going OK until Mike Barnicle asked the candidate what he would do about Aleppo, and here's what happened next. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MORNING JOE\") GARY JOHNSON: And what is Aleppo? MIKE BARNICLE: You're kidding. JOHNSON: No. BARNICLE: Aleppo is in Syria. It's the epicenter of the refugee crisis. JOHNSON: OK, got it, got it. CORNISH: Johnson went on to say the U.S. should stay out of Syria and work on a diplomatic resolution along with Russia. NPR's Scott Horsley is in the studio with us now. Hey there, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Hi, Audie. CORNISH: So how significant of a political problem could this be for Gary Johnson? HORSLEY: Johnson told Bloomberg Politics he feels horrible about this lapse and that he has to get smarter. He also issued a statement saying at first, he thought he was being asked about some acronym, which certainly suggests that Gary Johnson has not been paying close attention to the civil war in Syria which has been going on now for more than five years. Aleppo is a central battleground in that war. It's where that iconic photograph of the 5-year-old bombing victim with - that was all over the newspapers and TV last month was taken. I dare say most NPR listeners would at least recognize the name Aleppo. But you know, I want to be careful about throwing too many stones here. The New York Times, in writing about this lapse, confused Aleppo with Damascus, the capital of Syria, and Raqqah, the de facto capital of the Islamic State and had to issue a couple of corrections. CORNISH: Now, Johnson is a former Republican. He's running for the second time, though, as a Libertarian nominee. How much of a premium does libertarian philosophy put on foreign policy? HORSLEY: The basic doctrine of the Libertarian Party is that the U.S. should be prepared to defend itself but otherwise should generally not meddle in other parts of the world. And Johnson himself made that point once he finally realized that the question today was about Syria. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MORNING JOE\") JOHNSON: I understand the crisis that is going on, but when we involve ourselves militarily, when we involve ourselves in these humanitarian issues, we end up with a situation that in most cases is not better and in many cases ends up being worse. HORSLEY: Johnson also suggested that civil war in Syria is part of a U.S.-backed effort at regime change, although in fact the Obama administration has carefully avoided committing military forces to ousting the Syrian president. CORNISH: Now, Gary Johnson has said this episode leaves no doubt that he's human, but does that really matter in a presidential race? HORSLEY: Right now Gary Johnson's polling average is around 9 percent, which is relatively high for a third party candidate. Up until now, the question's been, who does he take more votes away from, Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump? If Johnson's numbers drop because of this, the question will be, who does that help more, Trump or Clinton? It certainly doesn't help Johnson, who's trying to reach the 15 percent threshold that would earn him a spot on the debate stage. And, Audie, one other bit of fallout - Senator Lindsey Graham joked today. This sets the cause of legalized marijuana back by 50 years. CORNISH: I want to talk about another third party candidate, Jill Stein, because she made news this week as well. HORSLEY: She did. She took part in a demonstration against a controversial oil pipeline in North Dakota, and the sheriff there says she could face criminal charges for trespassing and vandalism - not the way most presidential candidates want to become known. But at least in her case, the notoriety was deliberate. CORNISH: That's NPR's Scott Horsley. Scott, thank you. HORSLEY: My pleasure, Audie. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson asked a television interviewer Thursday, \"What is Aleppo?\" betraying a lack of interest or even superficial knowledge of the civil war in Syria that has been raging for more than five years. The question came during an interview on MSNBC's Morning Joe. Panelist Mike Barnicle asked the two-time Libertarian nominee and former governor of New Mexico, \"What would you do if you were elected, about Aleppo?\" At first, Barnicle thought Johnson was joking \u2014 replying with \"you're kidding\" \u2014 when Johnson didn't recognize the city. Here's the beginning of the exchange: BARNICLE: What would you do if you were elected, about Aleppo? GARY JOHNSON: About? BARNICLE: Aleppo. JOHNSON: And what is Aleppo? BARNICLE: You're kidding. JOHNSON: No. BARNICLE: Aleppo is in Syria. It's the \u2013 it's the epicenter of the refugee crisis. JOHNSON: OK, got it. Got it. BARNICLE: OK. Aleppo was Syria's largest city before the war and it's a central battleground in the fight between government forces and the opposition. The iconic photo of 5-year-old bombing victim Omran Daqneesh, widely seen on TV and newspapers last month, was taken in Aleppo. Once Barnicle explained, \"Aleppo is in Syria. It's the epicenter of the refugee crisis,\" Johnson tried to regroup. \"OK. Got it,\" Johnson said, falling back on Libertarian principles of limited foreign engagement. \"Well, with regard to Syria, I do think that it's a mess. And I think the only way that we deal with Syria is to join hands with Russia to diplomatically bring that at an end. But when we've aligned ourselves with, when we've supported the opposition, the Free Syrian Army, the Free Syrian Army is also coupled with the Islamists, and then the fact that we're also supporting the Kurds. And this is \u2014 it's just a mess,\" he said. \"I do understand Aleppo,\" he continued later in the interview. \"And I understand the crisis that is going on. But when we involve ourselves militarily, when we involve ourselves in these humanitarian issues, we end up with a situation that in most cases is not better and in many cases ends up being worse.\" Johnson also suggested that the war in Syria is the result of a U.S.-backed effort at regime change. While President Obama argues that Syrian President Bashar Assad should be removed from power through diplomatic means, the administration has avoided military action directed at the regime. Johnson later tried to explain. \"This morning, I began my day by setting aside any doubt that I'm human. Yes, I understand the dynamics of the Syrian conflict \u2014 I talk about them every day,\" Johnson said in a statement, as reported by Politico. \"But hit with 'What about Aleppo?' I immediately was thinking about an acronym, not the Syrian conflict. I blanked. It happens, and it will happen again during the course of this campaign.\" Johnson also acknowledged the interview was a black eye for his campaign, which is currently drawing support from 9 percent of the public, according to an average of polls compiled by Real Clear Politics. \"I feel horrible,\" Johnson told Mark Halperin of Bloomberg Politics. \"I have to get smarter, and that's just part of the process.\" Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton briefly addressed the flub Thursday morning in response to a question from a reporter. \"Well, you can look at the map and find Aleppo,\" she said. \"Aleppo\" quickly trended nationally on Twitter, with many criticizing the candidate's misstep. Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein have attracted unusual attention for third-party candidates this year, as many voters seek an alternative to the Republican and Democratic standard-bearers, both of whom are saddled with high unfavorable ratings. Stein also garnered headlines this week while taking part in a demonstration against a controversial oil pipeline in North Dakota. The local sheriff says Stein could face criminal charges for trespassing and spray-painting construction equipment.",

            "article_content": "Angela Merkel's approval ratings are plummeting over her government's disjointed refugee policy. Voter anger over the issue led to a stinging rebuke in the state where she has her political base.  STEEVE INSKEEP, HOST: The leader of Germany received a rebuke yesterday. Chancellor Angela Merkel has welcomed more than 1 million migrants and refugees to her country. Yesterday, an anti-immigrant party did well in a local election. And it was in a German state that is at the heart of Merkel's support. Here's NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Angela Merkel has tended to ignore critics of her we-can-do-this approach to the large number of asylum seekers coming to Germany. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Shouting in German). SARHADDI NELSON: Even disgruntled constituents in her electoral district haven't rattled her, including these protesters who earlier this year shouted, Merkel must go, as she got out of a car. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Shouting in German). SARHADDI NELSON: But not responding to voters' concerns here in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania proved to be a mistake when a new nationalist party capitalized on it in yesterday's state elections here. The 3-year-old Alternative for Germany, or AfD, will now be a sizeable presence in the local Parliament, having cut not only into Merkel's voter base, but that of other established political parties, most of whom embrace her refugee policies. AfD's strategy was to raise fears that asylum seekers under Merkel's watch are swarming the country and tearing it apart economically and culturally. (SOUNDBITE OF RAINFALL) SARHADDI NELSON: Despite heavy rain, voter turnout yesterday was unusually high, which many here in the state capital attributed to a desire to send the three-term German chancellor a harsh message. Germans are fiercely private about their voting. And this man would only give me his first name, Thorsten. THORSTEN: (Speaking German). SARHADDI NELSON: He says it may have been a state election but that he and his friends cast their ballots as a protest vote against Berlin. He wouldn't say whether he voted for AfD but said his friends did so over Merkel's failure to come up with a sensible refugee policy. Other voters I interviewed say the financial insecurity of living in the former East Germany is why people are embracing the AfD and its calls for people power and German pride. Salaries in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania are lower and unemployment higher than the national German average. Fifteen percent of the population has moved away since the reunification of East and West Germany a quarter century ago. ANKE GROTHEER: (Speaking German). SARHADDI NELSON: Voter Anke Grotheer says she was frightened by the pro-AfD turnout and that such parties are able to get on the ballot. The 72-year-old pensioner says, it's almost like the Weimar Republic, referring to the fractured German government that preceded the Nazi regime. She adds, one has to ask oneself, how is something like this even possible again in Germany? Local AfD leader Leif-Erik Holm, on the other hand, was ecstatic. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LEIF-ERIK HOLM: (Speaking German). SARHADDI NELSON: \"People have shown they no longer want Merkel's politics,\" he told German broadcaster ARD, adding this could be the beginning of the end of her chancellorship. But with national elections still a year off, that view isn't widely shared in Germany, not even by her mainstream political opponents, like Green Party leader Cem Ozdemir, whose party lost its seats in yesterday's state vote. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CEM OZDEMIR: (Speaking German). SARHADDI NELSON: He says, \"it's not right to blame Merkel. I'm not one who usually defends her, but we all wanted this refugee policy and have to accept responsibility for it.\" Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson, NPR News, Schwerin, Northeastern Germany.

            "article_content": "After major upheaval in his staff, presidential candidate Donald Trump has rallied voters in North Carolina and Michigan. His supporters describe how they now feel about their candidate's chances.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: It's been a week of upheaval for Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Maybe we should make that another week of upheaval. There were campaign shake-ups, a different tone and, this weekend, the first round of general election television ads. NPR's Scott Detrow reports from Dimondale, Mich., where Trump held a rally last night. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: The big question at the beginning of the week - the big question all summer, really - was whether Trump would ever broaden out and soften up his message, whether he'd ever try to appeal to anyone who wasn't the true believer core of voters that carried him to the Republican nomination. As June has turned into July into August and as Trump has kept making incendiary comments and falling behind in the polls, a lot of Republicans were starting to give up hope. Longtime GOP strategist Mike Murphy talked to NPR's Morning Edition on Wednesday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MIKE MURPHY: Well, his problem is the only voters that have liked him are a little less than half the voters in the Republican primaries. But that's over now, and everybody understands that except Donald Trump. In the general election, he's alienating all those swing voters by the very style that helped him in the primaries. So I don't think he knows his act doesn't play anymore, and I don't think he knows how to change it. DETROW: Trump insisted he was who he was, that he wasn't going to change, but then a campaign reshuffle. Trump brought in two new staffers to run his campaign, including Steve Bannon, the head of Breitbart News, a hard right-wing firebrand website known for throwing bombs at the political and media establishment. That had many, if not most, observers predicting Trump would go all in on the hard-line insurgent and nationalist tone that won him the Republican primaries. But a surprising thing happened in North Carolina when Trump gave his first speech after the shake-up. Trump did something he's rarely, if ever, done publicly. He kind of apologized. He acknowledged he had not chosen the right words or said the wrong thing at several points over the course of the campaign. (SOUNDBITE OF CAMPAIGN RALLY) DONALD TRUMP: And I do regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain. DETROW: And Trump made a point to reach out to African-Americans. TRUMP: We are going to work with everybody in the African-American community in the inner cities, and what a big difference that is going to make. It's one of the things I most look forward to doing. DETROW: The irony? The very next day Paul Manafort announced he was resigning from the campaign. Manafort is a longtime D.C. operative, and he was brought in earlier this year to try to make the anti-establishment insurgent just a bit more establishment. It never really worked, leading to moments like this when Manafort was questioned on \"Fox News.\" UNIDENTIFIED MAN: There are reports out there that your campaign is in turmoil, that you personally, as campaign chairman, have lost control of your candidate. Your response? PAUL MANAFORT: Well, first of all, the candidate is in control of his campaign. That's number one. And I'm in control of doing the things that he wants me to do in the campaign. DETROW: But here's the thing about that much-discussed softer tone. It wasn't really present in the hard-edge ads Trump released Friday. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD, \"TWO AMERICAS: IMMIGRATION\") BRUCE MCGILL: In Hillary Clinton's America, the system stays rigged against Americans. Syrian refugees flood in. Illegal immigrants convicted of committing crimes get to stay. DETROW: And by Friday night, Trump was back to his usual self. Wearing a Make America Great Again hat at a packed Michigan rally, Trump reached out to black voters again, but he did so in a much different tone. (SOUNDBITE OF CAMPAIGN RALLY) TRUMP: Why do you have to lose? You're living in poverty. Your schools are no good. You have no jobs. Fifty-eight percent of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose? (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) DETROW: Trump predicted he could eventually earn 95 percent of the African-American vote. But right now, Trump's actually polling under 1 percent with black voters in some national and state polls. African-Americans are just one of the many demographic groups that have turned away from Trump over the last few months. That's a trend that Trump needs to turn around as quickly as possible if he has any hope of closing the gap with Hillary Clinton and having a shot at winning the White House.

I'm officially on the ballot in #Utah! Thank you to all our volunteers who collected signatures! #StandUpWithEvan pic.twitter.com/My0tVfhs7e For voters dissatisfied with both major party candidates, there are a few other options. There's Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, and a lesser known late arrival to the scene \u2014 Evan McMullin. McMullin is running as an independent with support from the #NeverTrump movement. He has been a vocal critic of Donald Trump \u2014 and he's seen as a conservative alternative to the candidate. He has blasted Trump as personally unstable on his website and \"a real threat to our Republic.\" McMullin has worked for the CIA, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Goldman Sachs, and as chief policy director of the House Republican Conference. The 40-year-old Utah Mormon has qualified for the ballot in his state and his candidacy there could potentially split the state's conservative vote, giving Hillary Clinton an avenue to win what has traditionally been a red state. In an interview with NPR's Scott Simon, McMullin argued he is the best candidate on national security. He also spoke about his stance on the Affordable Care Act, trade and Syrian refugees. On why he's the most qualified on national security I believe that one of the largest challenges this country faces is that of national security right now. It comes from terrorism threats as well as others. And I am prepared on day one to handle those unlike any of the other candidates. I also understand in a way that I think the other candidates do not what kind of reforms this government needs to put in place and to advance in order for the American people to feel once again like they're being heard by their government and like their government is accountable to them. On his plan for Syria Syria's an issue I've worked quite a long time on. ... I believe that we've made some mistakes as a country in the way we've responded to that and not just as a country but as an international community. The longer we've waited to engage, the worse it's gotten and now it's affecting whole world. We have a refugee crisis that's the largest humanitarian disaster since World War II. These refugee flows into Europe are destabilizing Europe. They're also creating political strife here in the United States, our civil liberties and our ideals as a country are now being threatened by some of the rhetoric coming from Donald Trump. ... We need to get serious about defeating ISIS, we just aren't serious about it yet, I would be very serious about getting it done, I know how to do it. We need to take the fight to them on the battlefield in a more serious way. We also need to be more seriously committed to fighting the ideological battle, this is a battle of ideas just as much as it is a traditional battle on the field. On whether he'd overturn the Affordable Care Act What I would do is look for a better option. We see it not delivering what, I think, even its proponents hoped it would. Premiums are going up for many middle class Americans who are already suffering. Insurance companies, as we saw just this last week, are pulling out of the exchanges. There are good things about it \u2014 for example, people with pre-existing conditions ... but we can do better. We need to do better so that everybody has better access to care and better care and it's done more affordably. The ACA didn't do anything about the underlying costs of health care, which is part of its problem. So I'm for delivering the most convenient, highest quality health care to all Americans. ... We're a wealthy, capable country that can get this done. It's less than an entitlement, but just something that we can do. On his vision for the country We're a country of 330 million people. It is absolutely natural that we're going to have different ideas and different background and different preferences on a whole range of things. But in this country, we are all empowered to pursue happiness. That was the \"why\" of our country \u2014 that's what our founders envisioned for this country. And it wasn't perfect but over time we've done better and better and better. We need to get to a place where we understand that we're not always going to agree with each other on everything but we're in a place in which we still respect each other's decisions. ... I'm advocating for a new era in American politics and society where we understand that we're all different, we're all different people and we embrace those differences, and we respect those differences and we allow people to pursue happiness in the way they'd wish.",

Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump said Monday it's time to \"chart a new course\" in the battle against \"radical Islamic terrorism,\" though much of what he proposed is similar to the course already set by President Obama. \"My administration will aggressively pursue joint and coalition military operations to crush and destroy ISIS,\" Trump said during a foreign policy speech in Youngstown, Ohio. He also called for international efforts to cut off funding to terrorist groups, expanded intelligence sharing, and cyberwarfare \u2014 all steps that are part of the existing White House strategy. Trump broke with current policy, though, in calling for sharp new limits on visitors and immigrants from countries with a history of exporting terrorism. \"We will be tough and we will be even extreme,\" Trump said. \"Our country has enough problems. We don't need more.\" Trump did not renew his controversial call for a ban on all Muslim immigrants. But he did advocate a new ideological test for newcomers, backed by what he described as \"extreme vetting.\" \"In addition to screening out all members of the sympathizers of terrorist groups, we must also screen out any who have hostile attitudes towards our country or its principles or who believe that Sharia law should supplant American law,\" Trump said. \"Only those who we expect to flourish in our country and to embrace a tolerant American society should be issued visas.\" Trump also said he would temporarily suspend all immigration from countries where the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security conclude that adequate screening is not possible and he suggested a sharp reduction in the number of visitors from the Middle East. \"If we don't control the numbers, we can't perform adequate screening,\" Trump said. He attacked Hillary Clinton's push to accept more Syrian refugees in the U.S., saying his Democratic rival \"wants to be America's Angela Merkel.\" In another break with goals of the Obama administration, Trump vowed to maintain the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and devote more effort to capturing, rather than killing, terrorist leaders, in hopes of gathering more intelligence. While critics argue Trump's rhetoric alienates moderate Muslims, he promised to include those voices in a new commission on radical Islam. \"We want to build bridges and erase divisions,\" he said. Trump more broadly criticized the Obama administration \u2014 and his Democratic rival, Clinton \u2014 saying their policies created a power vacuum in the Middle East that allowed ISIS to flourish. He focused on the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011 and the military intervention in Libya, which Clinton advocated when she was secretary of state. \"With one episode of bad judgment after another, Hillary Clinton's bad policies launched ISIS onto the world stage,\" Trump said. \"As she threw the Middle East into violent turmoil, things turned out really to be not so hot.\" Trump suggested the course of history would have been different had the U.S. taken a more colonial approach to Iraq, keeping control of that country's oil supply following the 2003 invasion. \"In the old days, when we won a war, to the victor belonged the spoils,\" Trump said. \"I just said it so many times, virtually every time I was interviewed: Keep the oil, keep the oil.\" He argued U.S. control of Iraq's oil fields would have denied ISIS a key source of financing, while the American troops needed to safeguard the wells would have provided a check against the rise of the terrorist group. Throughout his scripted policy address, Trump showed a more serious side than he did last week, when he erroneously described Obama as the \"founder\" of ISIS \u2014 a comment he later explained as sarcasm. GOP advisers have been encouraging Trump to exercise more discipline on the stump, in hopes of reversing his declining poll numbers. Despite the somber tone and subject of the speech, supporters periodically interrupted the candidate with chants of \"Trump\" and \"USA.\"",

He said he believed that \"our responsibility is for safety and protection of American citizens abroad and at home,\" but that will require having \"to think differently and we have to use some imagination, and we have to still protect our American values and what we represent to the rest of the world.\" Flynn appeared to agree that a travel ban on countries affected by terrorism \u2014 which could include European allies such as France or the United Kingdom \u2014 may not be the best approach. \"To put a blanket [ban] on any organization, any segment of the population, is not workable, but we do have to recognize what types of things must we be able to do to continue to protect our own country and our way of life, \" Flynn said. The comments by Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, came on Monday during an interview about his new book, The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies. Like Trump, Flynn believes more forceful measures must be taken to protect the U.S. from the threat of what Flynn calls \"radical Islamism.\" Trump's proposals have evolved since last December, when he first called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. Facing a storm of criticism that he was violating principles of religious freedom, in June Trump proposed \"suspend[ing] immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States.\" \"This is not about a permanent ban,\" Flynn said. \"This is about understanding what is happening with this rapid rise of radical Islamism. And we know, Steve, that the Islamic State has, and they've stated it, they actually stated it in their various media outlets, that they are going to infiltrate into the refugee populations that are entering different countries around the world.\"",

Republicans opposed to Donald Trump are making a last-ditch effort to put forth an alternative to the GOP presidential nominee. Evan McMullin, a onetime chief policy director for House Republicans and a former CIA officer, is launching an independent presidential campaign with the help of political group Better for America. Blasting Trump as personally unstable and \"a real threat to our Republic,\" McMullin said on his website that he felt compelled to run as an independent. \"With the stakes so high for our nation and at this late stage in the process, I can no longer stand on the sidelines,\" McMullin wrote. \"Our country needs leaders who are in it for the right reasons and who actually understand what makes this country the greatest on earth. Leaders who will unite us and guide us to a prosperous, secure future, beyond the dysfunction of a broken political system.\" In an interview with ABC News shortly after announcing, McMullin said that both Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton were unacceptable. \"Look, Donald Trump is defeating himself. He is ensuring that Hillary Clinton is elected,\" he told ABC. \"I think they would both be absolutely terrible.\" McMullin called Trump inhuman and an authoritarian who does not care about anyone but himself. \"I do believe he is a fraud and a con man and that's not something I say lightly,\" he continued. McMullin also said he is strongly anti-abortion, calling it \"a test of our humanity\" and that Roe v. Wade should be overturned. To say McMullin has an uphill battle ahead of him is an understatement. The deadline for filing as an independent presidential candidate has already passed in 26 states. But with three months left until the general election, some members of the GOP's anti-Trump movement are nonetheless rallying behind the \"Hail Mary\" alternative. Rick Wilson, a veteran Republican strategist who's working with McMullin, said his phone's been ringing off the hook from \"big time\" donors and volunteers looking to assist with the former House operative's bid. \"We don't have a Death Star of operations like Hillary Clinton or the celebrity of Donald Trump,\" Wilson said. \"But can we put a campaign together that gets on enough ballots? Yes. Can we raise the money? Yes, we can.\" \"A lot people have been looking for an alternative to the disaster on both sides,\" Wilson continued, argued that there's rare opening thanks to both Clinton and Trump's high unavailability ratings. \"The money is coming. Americans are responding very quickly,\" McMullin told ABC News. Although McMullin starts out virtually unknown to the general public, he has a lengthy history in government work. He spent 11 years working at the CIA as an undercover operations officer in several conflict zones in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Before working at the CIA, he spent a year as a volunteer refugee resettlement officer in the Middle East and Africa for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Earlier in May, he gave a Tedx Talk at London's Business School discussing genocide and how individuals and companies can help to end it. For the past three years, he's worked on foreign affairs, national security and women's empowerment policy for the House Republican Conference, though an aide said he was no longer an employee there. \"The House Republican Conference has zero knowledge of his intentions,\" said Nate Hodson, a spokesman for the House Republican Conference. McMullin's work as a policy director could strike a chord with those worried about Trump's lack of political and policy experience, even though McMullin himself has never held a position in public office. \"He isn't corrupt and he isn't crazy. He's an accomplished guy who's served this country,\" Wilson argued. Conservatives opposed to Trump have been trying to find an alternative for some time now, but McMullin is the only one who has actually gone through with a candidacy. National Review's David French had been mulling a bid and had the backing of the Weekly Standard's Bill Kristol. But in June he decided to pass.",

Editor's note: NPR will also be fact-checking Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's planned economic speech this Thursday. Donald Trump is coming off a week of disastrous headlines and cratering poll numbers. His major economic speech on Monday at the Detroit Economic Club, a vision described by his campaign as \"Winning the Global Competition,\" was a chance to turn the page. During an address of just over an hour \u2014 which was interrupted multiple times by protesters \u2014 the GOP presidential nominee unveiled a new iteration of his proposal to reshape America's tax system. It has just three tax brackets (one fewer than the tax plan he released in September, which was removed from his website in the past 24 hours), would limit taxes on all forms of business income to 15 percent, would end the estate tax and would \"exclude childcare expenses from taxation.\" Other highlights include a proposed moratorium on all new federal regulations and would \"remove bureaucrats who only know how to kill jobs [and] replace them with experts who know how to create jobs,\" according to a preview released by his campaign. It's unclear exactly what that means or how it would work, but there are currently about 2.7 million civilian federal employees. As for trade, which has been a centerpiece of his economic agenda, Trump reiterated calls for the U.S. to pull out of the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal and for NAFTA to be renegotiated. He said would appoint trade negotiators whose goal will be to \"win for America,\" and he would apply tariffs on countries that cheat. Economists have raised concerns in the past that such tariffs could lead to a trade war that would ultimately hurt American interests. Speaking at a rally later Monday afternoon in Florida, Hillary Clinton didn't pass up the opportunity to criticize Trump's economic speech. The Democratic presidential nominee pointed to a recent analysis, written by a former adviser of 2008 GOP presidential nominee John McCain, which showed her economic plan would create upwards of 10 million jobs, while Trump's could cost the country more than 3 million. She also accused Trump of \"scrambling to do damage control\" by listing a new group of economic advisers. \"He's got, I don't know, a dozen or so economic advisers he just named: Hedge fund guys, billionaire guys, six guys named Steve, apparently. And so they wrote him a speech and he delivered it in Detroit. Now, they tried to make his old tired ideas sound new. But here's what we all know, because we heard it again. His tax plans will give super big tax breaks to large corporations and the really wealthy, just like him and the guys who wrote the speech, right,\" said Clinton. \"He wants to basically just repackage trickle-down economics.\" Below is Trump's speech in its entirety, with annotations and fact-checks from NPR's team of political and economic reporters. Thank you everybody, thank you very much. Thank you. Such a crowd - beautiful. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Please. Thank you for the invitation to speak to you today. It's wonderful to be in Detroit. I've been here many times. We now begin a great national conversation about economic renewal for America. It's a conversation about how to make America great again - for everyone, especially and I say especially, for those who have the very least. The city of Detroit is where our story begins. Detroit was once the economic envy of the world. The people of Detroit helped to power America to its position of global dominance in the 20th century. When we were governed by the America First policy, Detroit was absolutely booming. Engineers, builders, laborers, shippers and countless others went to work each day, provided for their families and lived out, totally, lived out the American Dream. But for many living in this city, that dream has long ago vanished. [One measure of Detroit's decline: As of 1950, it had more than 1.8 million residents. Today, it's fewer than 700,000. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] When we abandoned the policy of America First, we started rebuilding other countries instead of our own. The skyscrapers went up in Beijing and many other cities in the world while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled right here in Detroit. Our roads and bridges fell into disrepair. Yet we found the money to resettle millions of refugees at taxpayer expense. Today, Detroit has per capita income of under $15K - about half of the national average. [True. Detroit's per capita income, which includes retirees and children, is $14,810 per year. This is roughly half the national average of $28,889. The median household income in Detroit is $25,769, roughly half the national average of $53,657. -Will Huntsberry] 40% of the city's residents live in poverty, over two and a half times the national average. [This is true. The most recent figures show Detroit's poverty rate is 39.3 percent, which is more than the double the national average of 15.5 percent. -Will Huntsberry] The unemployment rate is more than twice the national average. [This is technically true. Detroit city proper has an unemployment rate of 11.6 percent, which is twice the national average of 4.9 percent. However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics often figures these numbers by metro area. The Detroit metro area has an unemployment rate of 5.8 percent. -Will Huntsberry] Half of all Detroit residents do not work. [It is true, according to the most recent data, that less than half of Detroiters have a job, but this figure includes small children and retirees. The 'employment-population ratio,' as calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed that 43.9 percent of Detroiters had a job in 2014, while 59 percent of people in the United States had a job the same year. A more often cited statistic, which removes people younger than 16 from the calculus, is the 'participation rate.' It was 53.4 percent in Detroit and 62.9 percent for the United States. -Will Huntsberry] Detroit tops the list of the most dangerous cities in terms of violent crime. [Recent FBI data do show that among major cities, Detroit has the highest violent crime rate. However, the FBI also cautions against comparing cities' rates, as many factors, like population density, can affect a city's rate. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] These are silenced victims whose stories are never told by Hillary Clinton. But victims whose suffering is no less real or permanent. In short, the city of Detroit is the living, breathing example of my opponent's failed economic agenda. Every policy that has failed this city and so many others is a policy supported by Hillary Clinton. [Detroit's decline began more than 50 years ago, decades before NAFTA and other trade deals. Hillary Clinton wasn't in elected office or even first lady then. -Tamara Keith] She supports the high taxes and radical regulation that forced jobs out of your community and the crime policies have made you far far less safe. And the immigration policies that have strained local budgets and the trade deals like NAFTA, signed by her husband, that have shipped your jobs to Mexico and other countries and she supports the education policies that deny your students choice, freedom and opportunity. She is the candidate of the past. Ours is the campaign of the future. This is a city controlled by Democratic politicians at every level, and unless we change policies, we will not change results. One hundred percent. [Mayor Mike Duggan is a Democrat, and they city's mayors have been Democratic since 1962. But Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder is a Republican. \u2014 Jessica Taylor] Today, I will outline my economic vision. In the coming weeks, we will be offering more detail on all of these policies, and the ones we have already rolled out (protesters interrupt) ...thank you everybody. This is what happens when you go from thirty five people to close to two thousand people, I guess. \u2014 in the coming weeks, we will be offering more detail on all of these policies and the ones we have already rolled out can be viewed on my campaign website. Our opposition, on the other hand, has long ago run out of ideas. All Hillary Clinton has to offer is more of the same: more taxes, more regulations, more bureaucrats, more restrictions on American energy and on American production. More of that. If you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn't do better than Hillary Clinton's economic agenda. Nothing would make our foreign adversaries happier than for our country to tax and regulate our companies and our jobs right out of existence. The one common feature of every Hillary Clinton idea is that it punishes you for working and doing business in the United States. Every policy she has tilts the playing field towards other countries at our expense. And that's why she tries to distract us with tired political rhetoric that seeks to label us, divide us, and pull us apart. My campaign is about reaching out to everyone as Americans, and returning to a government that puts the American people first. Here is what an America First economic plan looks like. First, let's talk tax reform. Taxes are one of the biggest differences in this race. Hillary Clinton \u2013 who has spent her career voting for tax increases \u2013 plans another massive job-killing $1.3 trillion-dollar tax increase. Big increase - one of the biggest ever. Her plan would tax many small businesses by almost fifty percent. Recently, at a campaign event, Hillary Clinton short-circuited - you know this, you've heard this one - Hillary Clinton short-circuited again \u2013 to use a now famous term \u2013 when she accidentally told the truth and said she wanted to raise taxes on the middle class. [Politifact has rated this claim \"pants on fire,\" but Trump continues to say it at events, including in this highly scripted speech. Clinton has campaigned extensively on not raising taxes on the middle class. His campaign has circulated a misleading video with a caption saying she said she wants to raise taxes on the middle class, but you can hear she says \"we aren't going to raise taxes on the middle class\" - Tamara Keith] I am proposing an across-the-board income tax reduction, especially for middle-income Americans. This will lead to millions of new and really good-paying jobs. The rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs, or undermines our ability as a nation to compete. As part of this reform, we will eliminate the Carried Interest Deduction, a well-known deduction, and other special interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street investors, and people like me, but unfair to American workers. Tax simplification will be a major feature of the plan. Our current tax code is so burdensome and complex that we waste 9 billion hours a year in tax code compliance. My plan will reduce the current number of brackets from 7 to 3, and dramatically streamline the process. [Many politicians argue that streamlining the U.S. tax code is a good idea. However, cutting the number of brackets doesn't do a whole lot to simplify things. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] We will work with House Republicans on this plan, using the same brackets they have proposed: 12, 25 and 33 percent. [Last September Donald Trump released a tax plan with four tax brackets: 0, 10, 20 and 25 percent. It was pulled down from his website in the last 24 hours but can still be found through the internet archive. The new proposal eliminates the 0 percent bracket, thus making this line from Trump's original tax plan null: \"If you are single and earn less than $25,000, or married and jointly earn less than $50,000, you will not owe any income tax. That removes nearly 75 million households \u2013 over 50% \u2013 from the income tax rolls. They get a new one page form to send the IRS saying, \"I win,\" those who would otherwise owe income taxes will save an average of nearly $1,000 each.\" -Tamara Keith] [UPDATE: In an interview with Fox News Wednesday morning, Trump said the zero bracket is in there \"big league.\"] For many American workers, their tax rate will be zero. While we will develop our own set of assumptions and policies, agreeing in some areas but not in all or in others, we will be focused on the same shared goals and guided by the same shared principles: jobs, growth and opportunity. These reforms will offer the biggest tax revolution since the Reagan Tax Reform, which unleashed years of continued economic growth and job creation. We will Make America Grow Again. In the days ahead, we will provide more details on this plan and how it will help you and most importantly your family. It will present a night-and-day contrast to the job-killing, tax-raising, poverty-inducing Obama-Clinton agenda. So important - the State of New York has already lived through Hillary Clinton's failed leadership. The Washington Post just published today a devastating article on Hillary Clinton's broken promises. [Here is that article. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] She pledged 200,000 jobs for upstate New York as Senator. But what happened? What happened? The Washington Post writes, and I quote: \"upstate job growth stagnated overall during her tenure, with manufacturing jobs plunging record-setting levels, plunging nearly 25 percent...the former first lady was totally unable to pass big ticket legislation... Many promised jobs they were all promised, I remember it so well...\"Vote for Hillary - she'll bring back your jobs\", many promised jobs never materialized and others migrated to other states as she turned to her first presidential run which also was a disaster. Data shows that upstate actually lost jobs a lot them during Clinton's first term. In other words, she was all talk, no action, upstate New York is a disaster. What's happened to upstate New York. And NAFTA, which her husband signed, is a very, very big reason. [Bill Clinton did sign NAFTA, but it's misleading to attribute that policy entirely to him. In fact, it was negotiated under George H.W. Bush, who signed it in 1992, as the Washington Post's Fact Checker has pointed out. After Congress passed it, Clinton then signed it into law in 1993. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] Compare that to my record. In a recent New York Post article by Steve Cuozzo, \"How Donald Trump Helped Save New York City,\" the paper writes that I \u2013 and this is a direct quote in other words, it's not from me (crowd interruption) thank you...it's all very well planned out \u2013 and this is a direct quote that basically Donald Trump \"waded into a landscape of empty Fifth Avenue storefronts, the dust-bowl mugging ground that was Central Park so dangerous and a Wall Street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out...then almost by sheer force of will \u2014 [he] rode to the rescue. Expressing rare faith in the future, he was instrumental in kickstarting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up on for dead.\" True. Have to say. I didn't say it. They said it. It's true. This is what I want to do.... We all remember New York City was a disaster. We made it great. We made it great. This is want I want to do for our country \u2013 I want to jumpstart America. And it can be done. And it won't even be that hard. Now let's look at what the Obama-Clinton policies have done nationally. Their policies produced 1.2% growth, the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression, it's been written about all over, it's a disaster and a doubling of the national debt during the Obama years. There are now 94.3 million Americans outside of the labor force. It was 80.5 million when President Obama took office, an increase of 14 million people. [His numbers are right (the number of people outside the labor force has grown by 13.8 million, according to the Labor Department). However, this statistic alone is misleading. The number of people in the labor force (that is, either working or looking for a job) has also grown by more than 5 million altogether since January 2009. It's true that the labor force participation rate \u2014 the share of Americans in the labor force \u2014 is low in recent years. However, as of 2014, the Congressional Budget Office attributed half of the recent decline to simple demographics, as an aging population retires. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] The Obama-Clinton agenda of tax, spend and regulate has created a silent nation of jobless Americans. Home ownership is at its lowest rate in 51 years. [Homeownership recently hit a 51-year low, as the Associated Press recently reported. However, the homeownership rate can be deceiving, as Trulia Chief Economist Jed Kolko wrote in 2014 at the New York Times. For some young adults who live with their parents, renting their own apartments could be a sign of economic progress. But as they go out and create their own households in those rented apartments, that could push down the homeownership rate (measured as a share of all households), even while their situations are improving. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] (More protesters interrupt) Thank you...I will say the Bernie Sanders people had far more energy and spirit, I will say. Nearly 12 million have been added to the food stamp and, these people are growing and growing so rapidly, since President Obama took office. [According to annual totals, more than 12 million more people were receiving SNAP benefits in 2015 than in 2009. However, Trump is wrong that the total is \"growing and growing so rapidly.\" The total number of recipients has fallen every month since December 2015, according to the USDA. And by the annual numbers, participation has been falling since 2013. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] Another nearly 7 million people, great Americans, are right now living in poverty. [The number of Americans in poverty grew by 6.8 million from 2008, the year before Obama took office, through 2014, the latest year of data available. The poverty rate (a better measure here, though it's still very flawed) is up by 1.6 percentage points, to 14.8 percent, though it is down from a high of 15.1 in 2010. Numbers aside, though, it's hard to blame President Obama for all these increases \u2014 for example, poverty was already rising when he took office. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] We have the lowest labor force participation rates in four decades. [His numbers are generally right here: the labor force participation rate \u2014 the share of people working or looking for work \u2014 right now is at 62.8 percent. That rate hit a recent low of 62.4 percent in September 2015, but it has been hanging in the 62 to 63 percent range for around two years now. The last time it was in that range was the late 1970s. However, this statistic is very easy to misunderstand. As we explained above, though some of the recent decline was due to weakness in the economy, some of this decline has been due to demographics (i.e., Baby Boomers retiring), so the decline in the rate isn't entirely a bad thing. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] 58 percent of the African-American youth are either outside the labor force or not employed. [Trump pointed to this table from the Labor Department, and the data do show that 58.5 percent of African-Americans age 16 to 24 aren't in the labor force or are unemployed. It's true that the unemployment rate is higher among black youth than among whites and Asian-Americans. Still, this figure seems high because many 16-to-24-year-old Americans (of any race) aren't in the labor force (for example, because they're in school). Around 49 percent of African American youth aren't in the labor force, by these data, compared to around 45 percent of all 16-to-24-year-olds. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] One in five American households do not have a single member in the labor force. Not a single member of a household. These are the real unemployment numbers \u2013 the five percent figure is one of the biggest hoaxes in American modern politics. [Earlier in the speech, Trump used Labor Department measures of unemployment for Detroit, but here he is calling the unemployment rate a hoax, which is a contradiction. His son, Donald Jr., has also said the numbers are manipulated for political gain. PolitiFact gave that claim a \"pants on fire\" rating. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] [Aside from that, it's true that the current unemployment figure \u2014 4.9 percent \u2014 is an incomplete way of measuring joblessness. In fact, that figure is just one of six different unemployment rates that the Labor Department computes each month to show different aspects of joblessness. However, that doesn't make the headline unemployment rate a \"hoax.\" As for the 1 in 5 figure, Trump is working off of a BLS report that found that 19.7 percent of families had no employed family members in 2015. That's different from \"in the labor force,\" and it's also an incomplete measure \u2014 the Labor Department's definition of family would include retired couples, for example. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] Meanwhile, American households are earning more than $4,000 think of that, $4,000 less today than they were sixteen years ago. The average worker today pays 31.5 percent of their wages to income and payroll taxes. On top of that, state and local taxes consume another 10 percent. Very grim picture. The United States also has the highest business tax rate among the major industrialized nations of the world, at 35 percent. It's almost 40 percent when you add in taxes at the state level and in many cases and in many states, it's much higher than that. In other words, we punish companies for making products in America \u2013 but let them ship products into the United States tax-free if they move overseas. This, ladies and gentlemen, is backwards, it's backwards. All of our policies should be geared towards keeping jobs and wealth inside of the United States. Under my plan, no American company will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes. In other words, we're reducing your taxes from 35% to 15%. [While the federal corporate tax rate is 35%, the Congressional Research Service found in 2014 that the average effective corporate tax rate was around 27% and the Government Accountability Office calculated in 2010 that profitable businesses were paying federal income taxes amounting to about 13% of their total global income. --Arnie Seipel] [Independent budget analysts have raised concerns that the 15% business rate would cause many people to quit their jobs and become independent contractors to pay lower taxes. This could cut into revenues severely. -Tamara Keith] Thank you. Small businesses will benefit the most from this plan. Hillary Clinton's plan will require small business to pay as much as three times more in taxes than what I am proposing, and her onerous regulations will put them totally out of business and you won't be able to start \u2014 you can not ever start a small business under the tremendous regulatory burden that you have in today in our country. We're going to end it. I am going to cut regulations massively massively. Our lower business tax will also end job-killing corporate inversions, and cause trillions in new dollars and wealth to come pouring into our country \u2013 and by the way into cities like right here in Detroit. To help unleash this new job creation, we will allow businesses to immediately expense new business investments. No one will gain more from these proposals than low-and-middle income Americans. My plan will also help reduce the cost of childcare by allowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of childcare spending from their taxes. [Tax and childcare experts say this proposal would favor upper middle class and wealthy Americans who spend more money on childcare than lower income familes. Lower income families are less likely to owe taxes and often do not file itemized taxes, so wouldn't be able to take advantage of a childcare deduction. Trump's campaign responded to criticism that his proposal would favor the wealthy with the following statement about his plan: \"Mr. Trump's plan would better help struggling families. Current policy does little to help afford costs that can exceed $1000 per month. The deduction will do more than credit for most working and middle class families. We provide credit to stay-at-home caregivers, which no current federal policy provides. To provide benefits to lower-income taxpayers who may not benefit from the deduction, the plan also allows parents to exclude childcare expenses from half of their payroll taxes\u2014increasing their paycheck income each week. \" \u2013 Trump campaign The campaign says to expect a fully detailed plan in the coming weeks. --Tamara Keith] We are also going to bring back trillions of dollars from American businesses that are now parked overseas they can't bring their money back into our country. Our plan will bring that cash home, applying only a 10 percent tax. This money will be re-invested in states like Michigan, states like Michigan which are having serious problems. Finally, no family will have to pay the death tax. American workers have paid taxes their whole lives, and they should not be taxed again at death \u2013 it's just plain wrong. And most people agree with that. We will repeal it. [The death tax, or estate tax, applies this year to estates with combined assets exceeding $5.45 million. \u2014 Peter Overby ] [That applies to very few people \u2014 around 1 in 500 estates were subject to the tax last year, according to the Tax Policy Center. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] Next comes regulatory reform. As with taxes, I will have one overriding goal when it comes to regulation: I want t jobs and I want wealth to stay in America. Motor vehicle manufacturing is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the country and even in the world. The U.S. economy today is twenty-five percent smaller than it would have been without the surge of regulations since 1980. It is estimated that current over-regulation is costing our economy as much as $2 trillion dollars a year \u2013 that's money taken straight out of cities like Detroit. So many of our cities are suffering so gravely, right out of Detroit and others. The federal register is now over 80,000 pages long. As the Wall Street Journal noted, President Obama has issued close to four hundred new major regulations since taking office, each with a cost to the American economy of $100 million or more. In 2015 alone, the Obama Administration unilaterally issued more than 2,000 new regulations \u2013 each a hidden tax on American consumers, and a massive lead weight on the American economy. It is time to remove the anchor dragging us down, and that's what it's doing - it's dragging us down. Upon taking office, I will issue a temporary moratorium on new agency regulations. My running mate, Mike Pence, and by the way, a great guy, signed a similar order when he became and when he worked so hard in Indiana as its governor. This will give our American companies the certainty they need to reinvest in our community, get cash off of the sidelines, start hiring new jobs, and expanding their businesses. So important. That's what it's about. I will also immediately cancel all illegal and overreaching executive orders. Next, I will ask each and every federal agency to prepare a list of all of the regulations they impose on Americans which are not necessary, do not improve public safety, and which needlessly kill many many jobs. Those regulations will be eliminated quickly. We are in a competition with the world, and I want America to win. We don't win anymore. But when I am president, we will start winning again, big league. One of the most important reforms of all is trade reform. As Bernie Sanders has said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgment. We've seen this bad judgment overseas, in Libya, Iraq, and Syria. We've seen it in Iran. We've seen it from President Obama, when he gives $150 billion to Iran, the number one terror state, and even gives them $400 million in money-laundered cash as a ransom payment. [Trump is referring to the $400 million dollars flown to the Iranian government by the Obama administration in January, at the same time American prisoners were released from Iran. The money was part of a settlement of a decades-old legal dispute, involving military sales before the Shah was overthrown in 1979. The State Department said it is \"completely false\" to say it was a ransom payment, though it coincided with the release of American prisoners. The payment was made in foreign currencies because it's illegal to conduct a transaction with Iran in U.S. dollars under current law. --Arnie Seipel] But we've also seen the terrible Obama-Clinton judgment right here for everybody to see in Detroit. Hillary Clinton has supported the trade deals stripping this city, and this country, of its jobs and its wealth. She supported Bill Clinton's NAFTA, she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, she supported job-killing trade deal and that was a really bad one with South Korea, and she supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Not now, but very soon if she wins and we can't let her win. Cause that will be a disaster for Detroit and everybody else. Let's talk about South Korea for a moment, because it so perfectly illustrates the broken promises that have hurt so many American workers. President Obama, and the usual so-called experts who've been wrong about every trade deal for decades, predicted that the trade deal with South Korea would increase our exports to South Korea by more than $10 billion \u2013 resulting in some 70,000 jobs. Like Hillary Clinton's broken promises to New York, these pledges all turned out to be false. Instead of creating 70,000 jobs, it has killed nearly 100,000 jobs, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Our exports to South Korea haven't increased at all, but their imports to us have surged more than $15 billion \u2013 more than doubling our trade deficit with that country. What else is new? It's happening with everyone. The next betrayal will be the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Hillary Clinton's closest friend, Terry McAuliffe, confirmed what I have been saying, and this is from the beginning: if sent to the Oval Office, Hillary Clinton will enact the TPP. As sure as you're sitting there. Her donors will make sure of it. A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for TPP \u2013 and it's also a vote for NAFTA. [Clinton and Trump alike are in favor of renegotiating NAFTA, as the Washington Post's Fact Checker reports. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] Our annual trade deficit in goods with Mexico has risen from close to zero, think of that, in 1993 to almost $60 billion today. Our total trade deficit in goods hit nearly $800 billion last year. Total trade deficit. Almost $800 billion. This is a strike at the heart of Michigan, and our nation as a whole. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, before NAFTA went into effect, there were 285,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is only 160,000. Detroit is still waiting for Hillary Clinton's apology. She has been a disaster. Obama has been a disaster. I expect Detroit will get that apology right around the same time Hillary Clinton turns over the 33,000 emails she deleted. Hillary Clinton's Trans-Pacific Partnership will be an even bigger disaster for the auto industry, believe me, even bigger and even worse than NAFTA. In fact, Ford Motor Company has announced its opposition to the deal. According to the Economic Policy Institute, the U.S. trade deficit with the proposed TPP member, all of the member countries has cost over 1 million manufacturing jobs in the year 2015. By far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parts, which lost nearly 740,000 manufacturing jobs. What are we doing? Michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of state workforce due to the trade deficit with TPP members. Just imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if the TPP is actually approved. It will be catastrophic. That is why I have announced we will withdraw from the deal before that can ever ever ever happen. Hillary Clinton will never withdraw from TPP. She is bought, controlled and paid-for by her donors and special interests. One hundred percent. Because my only interest is the American people, I have previously laid out a detailed 7-point plan for trade reform, available on my website. It includes strong protections against currency manipulation, big problem, tariffs against any countries that cheat by unfairly subsidizing their goods, and it includes a total renegotiation of NAFTA, which is a disaster for our country. A total renegotiation. If we don't get a better deal, we will walk away. At the center of my plan is trade enforcement with China. This alone could return millions of jobs into our country. They break the rules in every way imaginable. China engages in illegal export subsidies, prohibited currency manipulation, and rampant theft of intellectual property. They also have no real environmental or labor protections, further undercutting American workers. Just enforcing intellectual property rules alone could save millions of American jobs. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America's intellectual property in China would produce more than 2 million more jobs right here in the United States. Add to that the saved jobs from cracking down on currency cheating and product dumping, and we will bring trillions of dollars in new wealth and wages back to the United States. Trade has big benefits, and I am in favor of trade. But I want great trade deals for our country that create more jobs and higher wages for American workers. Isolation is not an option, only great and well-crafted trade deals are. Also critical to our economic renewal will be energy reform. The Obama-Clinton Administration has blocked and destroyed millions of jobs through their anti-energy regulations, while raising the price of electricity for both families and businesses. As a result of recent Obama EPA actions coal-fired power plants across Michigan have either shut down entirely or undergone expensive conversions. The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs. [According to a study in Energy Policy, the coal industry lost about 50,000 jobs nationally between 2008 and 2012. Another study by the Energy Information Administration suggests that the rise of cheap natural gas has impacted the coal industry \u2014 Jonquilyn Hill] Hillary Clinton says her plan will \"put a lot of coal companies and coal miners out of business.\" We will put our coal miners and steel workers back to work. Clinton not only embraces President Obama's job-killing energy restrictions but wants to expand them, including going after oil and natural gas production that employs some 10 million Americans. According to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, the Obama-Clinton energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person. A Trump Administration will end this war on the American worker, and unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth to our country. According to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on all sources of American energy will: Increase GDP by more than $100 billion dollars annually, add over 500,000 new jobs annually, and increase annual wages by more than $30 billion dollars over the next 7 years; Increase federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion dollars over 4 decades; Increase total economic activity by more than $20 trillion dollars over the next 40 years. The reforms I have outlined today are only the beginning When we reform our tax, trade, energy and regulatory policies, we will open a new chapter in American Prosperity. We can use this new wealth to rebuild our military and our infrastructure. As part of this new future, we will also be rolling out proposals to increase choice and reduce cost in childcare, offering much-needed relief to American families. I will unveil my plan on this in the coming weeks that I have been working on with my daughter Ivanka and an incredible team of experts. Likewise, our education reforms will help parents send their kids to a school of their choice. We will also give our police and law enforcement the funds and support they need to restore law and order to this country. Without security, there can be no prosperity. We must have law and order. In the coming days, we will be rolling out plans on all of these items. One of my first acts as President will be to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare, saving another 2 million American jobs. [In a footnote to the speech, Trump pointed to a December 2015 CBO working paper, which estimated that in 2025, the labor force would be smaller by 2 million full-time-equivalent workers than it would be without Obamacare \u2014 meaning people would work fewer hours, enough to equal 2 million FTE workers. However, that's not necessarily bad for those people: a combination of factors would reduce the amount of work done in the U.S. economy: \"Some people would choose to work fewer hours; others would leave the labor force entirely or remain unemployed for longer than they otherwise would,\" the CBO reported. In other words, some people might work less because health insurance is no longer a big incentive to working. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] We will also rebuild our military, and get our allies to pay their fair share for the protection we provide \u2013 saving us countless more billions to invest in our own country. We also have a plan, on our website, for a complete reform of the Veterans Health Administration. This is something so desperately needed to make sure our vets are fully supported and get the care they deserve. Detroit \u2013 the Motor City \u2013 will come roaring back. We will offer a new future, not the same old failed policies of the past. Our party has chosen to make new history by selecting a nominee from outside the rigged and corrupt system. The other party has reached backwards into the past to choose a nominee from yesterday \u2013 who offers only the rhetoric of yesterday, and the policies of yesterday. There will be no change under Hillary Clinton \u2013 only four more years of Obama. But we are going to look boldly into the future. We will build the next generation of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, sea ports and airports that our country deserves. American cars will travel the roads, American planes will connect our cities, and American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send new skyscrapers soaring. We will put new American metal into the spine of this nation. It will be American hands that rebuild this country, and it will be American energy - mined from American sources - that powers this country. It will be American workers who are hired to do the job. [This is a frequent campaign promise from Trump, but his own hiring practices haven't always reflected this view. A recent Buzzfeed article detailed Trump's effort to bring in foreign guest workers for his Mar-a-Lago resort. When asked about this, Trump has said it is hard to get enough American workers for these seasonal jobs. -Tamara Keith] Americanism, not globalism, will be our new credo. Our country will reach amazing new heights. All we have to do is stop relying on the tired voices of the past. We can't fix a rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place. We can't solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created them. Only by changing to new leadership, and new solutions, will we get new results. We need to stop believing in politicians, and start believing in America. Before everything great that has ever happened, the doubters have always said it couldn't be done. America is ready to prove the doubters wrong. They want you to think small. I am asking you to think big. We are ready to dream great things for our country once again. We are ready to show the world that America is Back \u2013 Bigger, and Better and Stronger Than Ever Before. Thank you, and God Bless You.",

The Democratic National Convention is over. Here are some of the big takeaways from a week in Philadelphia that had more suspense and drama than expected. Just like Barack Obama's two conventions, this one was flawlessly choreographed. Even the revolt of the Bernie Bros had a more-or-less happy ending. The speakers, the videos, and even the entertainment were all designed to drive the message of optimism and inclusion, hour after hour, day after day. The Democrats even had a lot more \"showbiz\" than Donald Trump promised but might not have quite delivered. The pacing was also effective. The first two days were all about locking down the base and the lineup of speakers on Monday and Tuesday was what you'd expect at a Democratic convention. But the last two days presented the Democrats as the \"big tent\" party; the podium on Wednesday and Thursday was filled with emissaries to the other side \u2014 former Reagan White House staffers, the former Republican mayor of New York City, retired military leaders, and the families of police officers killed in the line of duty. Donald Trump has given the Democrats a lot of openings and they tried to take advantage of every single one of them last week. They appropriated the rhetoric and imagery of patriotism and American exceptionalism, something that used to be a Republican franchise. Audience members wave American flags as Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks on the last day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 28.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Harnik/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Audience members wave American flags as Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks on the last day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 28. From the chants of \"U.S.A! U.S.A!\" to the huge American flags waving during the speeches of retired military officers supporting Clinton, the Democratic Party is arguing that it is the more patriotic party. Speaker after speaker seemed to be sending the message that it is not American to build a wall, bar an entire religion from entering the country, and denigrate people based on their looks or disabilities. Presidential elections are supposed to be won by the candidate who is more optimistic and future-oriented. Donald Trump is trying to send that bit of conventional wisdom to the scrap heap. But the Democrats are still betting that hope, love and optimism sells better than gloom, doom and fear. Many people were expecting Hillary Clinton to offer more of herself in her speech. But Clinton is a guarded, cautious politician and rarely shows big crowds a peek of the person who can be warm and engaging one-on-one and in small groups. Hillary Clinton delivers an acceptance speech framing herself as a workhorse on the last day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 28.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Hillary Clinton delivers an acceptance speech framing herself as a workhorse on the last day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 28. Her speech was a more polished, even sometimes soaring version of her usual stump speech but any glimpses of the \"real\" Hillary Clinton were just slivers. Yes, she sweats the details of policy because it matters to her and yes, she cares more about the \"service\" part of public service more than the \"public\" part, but voters looking for a revealing insight to help them relate to her didn't get one. There were no new insights or even new anecdotes. Sometimes her voice was modulated; sometimes she was lecturing. But she did touch all the themes of the convention and she used humor when she went after Trump. Instead of reinventing herself, she embraced her brand. She's steady and ready \u2014 a workhorse not a show horse. And, yes, she's been around a long time. \"Sometimes the people at this podium are new to the national stage,\" she said. \"I am not one of those people.\" So much has been said about how far to the left the Democratic Party has moved. And that's true. But there was something else happening in Philadelphia. The agenda was liberal, but the rhetoric and imagery were conservative. If Donald Trump is laying a wrecking ball to the Republican Party, the Democrats are assuming there will be plenty of refugees \u2014 defense hawks, suburban women, moderate Republicans and independents \u2014 looking for a new home. Both parties are responding to a growing nationalist sentiment. In Philadelphia, the Democrats were trying to develop a new kind of multi-ethnic nationalism, more inclusive and welcoming than Trump's white identity politics. The Democrats had a great convention. Hillary Clinton's speech was solid if not spectacular. But the next day's GDP report \u2014 only 1.9 percent growth in the second quarter \u2014 was a dose of reality. The number of people who think the country is on the wrong track is close to 70 percent. Hillary Clinton is still enormously unpopular. And third terms are historically very hard to get. Only 100 days left until Election Day.",

She hopes to capitalize on the wave of support for Bernie Sanders.\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jill Stein is leading the Green Party ticket. She hopes to capitalize on the wave of support for Bernie Sanders. Third parties are not new to American politics. The Anti-Masonic Party emerged in the 1820s to campaign against the Freemasons, which its members viewed as corrupt. The Free Soil Party opposed the expansion of slavery in the years before the Civil War. Others throughout history have emerged to champion various causes, like the Know-Nothings, the Progressives, the Prohibition Party, the Reform Party and many others. In a country that's been dominated by iterations of the Republicans and Democrats for more than a century and a half, 58 percent of respondents told Gallup pollsters in 2014 that \"a third party is needed.\" Today the biggest third party in the U.S. is the Libertarian Party, which has taken a new prominence as it courts Republicans who have refused to fall in line behind the party's nominee, Donald Trump. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian nominee in 2012 and again this year, amassed 1.27 million votes in the last presidential election. On the other end of the spectrum is the Green Party. The party traces its history to 1984. Its platform focuses on environmental issues and \"social justice, peace and non-violence, local and regional self-management and grassroots democracy.\" In 2000, 2.8 million people voted for Ralph Nader as the Green Party presidential candidate \u2014 leading to accusations of \"spoiling\" the election for Al Gore, a charge Nader has rejected. This year Dr. Jill Stein is leading the Green Party ticket for president. She has run before \u2014 Stein garnered almost 470,000 votes in 2012 running as a Green. Stein is hoping to capitalize on the wave of support Bernie Sanders experienced over the past year in his challenge to Hillary Clinton from the left. Stein told The Guardian she would even be willing to let Sanders run in her place as the Green candidate. Sanders didn't respond and has now endorsed Clinton. Stein is heading to Philadelphia to go to the Democratic National Convention \u2014 or at least to be outside of it. She is planning to take part in protests on the street in support of \"economic justice\" and a \"Green New Deal,\" among other causes. She talked with NPR's Michel Martin about why she's crashing the party in Philadelphia and responds to criticism from columnist Dan Savage. Interview highlights contain Web-only extended answers. On what the Green Party stands for In a nutshell, the Green Party is the one national party that does not accept corporate money, lobbyist money, or have a superPAC. So we have the unique liberty to stand up for everyday people. We are basically a party that puts people, planet and peace over profit. And we put forward the real solutions that everyday Americans are just clamoring for. On why they're going to Philadelphia We'll be in Philadelphia to be at the convention in the streets \u2014 the people's convention. I will be marching in the \"March for Our Lives.\" We'll conclude that march with a \"Power to the People\" rally, which is sponsored by my campaign. And we are here especially for the Bernie Sanders movement that does not want to go back into that dark night, into the Hillary Clinton campaign, that for so many people represents the opposite of what Bernie was building and what they were building. We are here to provide the support for that campaign. I think so many people learned that you cannot have a revolutionary campaign inside of a counter-revolutionary party. So we are here as plan B for Bernie to ensure that this fight will go on. On columnist Dan Savage's (explicit language-laden) criticism that supporting the Green Party is helping Donald Trump I do not say there is no difference between the parties. What I say is that there's not enough difference to save your job, to save your life, or to save the planet. And the scary things, the horrific things that Donald Trump says, Hillary Clinton has already done. Whether it's massively deporting immigrants, whether it's threatening nuclear warfare. ... Put it this way: I will feel horrible if Donald Trump is elected, I will feel horrible if Hillary Clinton is elected, and I feel most horrible about a voting system that says: Here are two deadly choices, now pick your weapon of self-destruction. On Green Party candidates in local elections We have hundreds of candidates, and unfortunately the media pays no attention to them, so of course the likes of Dan Savage have no clue. Not only do we have candidates, but we have had scores of elected officials. Including, for example, the mayor of Richmond, Calif., who was the Green mayor, Gayle McLaughlin, for eight years, where they did incredible, transformative things. This is why the corporate media and the corporate political parties don't want you to know that in fact, this revolution is alive and well. And it's especially alive in the Green Party, because all of the other noncorporate parties that have challenged power \u2014 whether you're talking about the Progressive Party or the Labor Party \u2014 they have been wiped off the map. They've been absolutely wiped off the map. So it's only the Green Party that survives as a noncorporate, truly people-powered challenge. And we are challenging all over the place. So Dan Savage doesn't have a clue about the fight that is going on. And if I weren't running for president, no one will know. This is why Frederick Douglass said, \"Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never [did] and it never will.\" We have to bring that demand up into the highest headliner as possible. Why give them a pass to conduct these wars? Hillary Clinton cannot challenge Donald Trump, because she agrees with him on too many things. Like these outrageous wars, like nuclear weapons, like devoting half of our budget and more to militarism. Half of your income tax is going to militarism \u2014 $75,000 per American household has been spent when you include the health costs of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. ... These wars on terror that have done what? Created more terror, have created failed states, have created mass refugee migrations. On what happens if the Green Party does not win the presidency We are involved in social movements, we are involved in local races, and we are involved in building a party that provides an infrastructure for what is succeeding. And Bernie Sanders showed how powerful this movement is, how much momentum it has, and believe me, that movement and those supporters are rushing into our campaign, absolutely flooding in through every portal imaginable. And they have found a place in a party that supports the revolution, and we are going to continue to go forward. On commonalities between the Greens and Gary Johnson and the Libertarian Party We both support open debates, for example. We share two lawsuits between our two parties \u2014 we are both suing the Commission on Presidential Debates. Because Americans have a right not only to vote, but to know who we can vote for. So we are suing to open debates. We're both calling for an end to the war on drugs and for an end to American imperialism and being the policeman of the world. But where we differ: The Libertarians, one of their first candidates was one of the Koch brothers. And their agenda is in some ways, it is the wish list of big corporate America \u2014 to get government out of the way. They would like to eliminate all controls on campaign finance. They would like to go to Citizens United on steroids, provided there is a corporate logo that is put on the politicians and policies who are bought. We say it's not enough to put a corporate logo on it. That's the area where we differ. We think we need to get money out of politics so we can get the people back in. On the possibility of all third parties uniting Americans have a right to more than three choices. Americans deserve to hear from the whole political spectrum. Particularly when the two major parties are funded by the same predatory banks, fossil fuel giants and war profiteers. And the prison-industrial complex. And they have put an entire generation into debt. My campaign is the one campaign that will cancel that student debt and liberate a generation to move us forward as a society. We think people have a right to hear about this as much as they have a right to hear about the Libertarian vision. On what would make a success in Philadelphia I could not conscience sitting this one out and just letting politics as usual continue to throw people, planet and peace under the bus. So for me, success is showing up, building a movement and moving forward as hard and fast and loud as we can. And right now the American public is screaming for exactly that. ... If we get to 5 percent, it's a whole new ballgame. Then we don't have to spend the whole election just getting on the ballot. We are in ballot fights right now. We have had to put all of our money that we've raised into the ballot access struggles. We could actually begin without a huge handicap and begin to really get the word out in a much bigger way. So there are many targets here which will advance the cause. But I would not underestimate the power of a generation who's been locked out of a future, locked out of an income, locked out of getting out of debt.

Alvarado will speak at the Republican National Convention during prime time Wednesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Meg Kelly/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ralph Alvarado, the first Hispanic elected to a state office in Kentucky, watches the stage on Tuesday evening. Alvarado will speak at the Republican National Convention during prime time Wednesday. It's no secret that Donald Trump is struggling to woo Hispanics voters. He's currently polling worse with Latinos than Mitt Romney in 2012 (In that election, Romney captured just 27 percent of the Hispanic vote.). But on Wednesday night, the Trump campaign might have a chance to shift its messaging ever-so-slightly when three Hispanic Republicans take center stage during prime time. Two of them, former GOP presidential candidates, are familiar faces from the primary season: Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco (who will deliver a video message). The other man, Ralph Alvarado, is a little-known state senator from Kentucky. Alvarado, 46, is also a doctor and a delegate for his home state. And in 2014, he became the first Hispanic elected to state office in Kentucky. In an interview at the Quicken Loans Arena between floor speeches, Alvarado took some time to chat about Trump, Hispanics and the Republican Party. \"Back about three months ago, I wrote an email to people that I know that were kind of connected to national campaigns, expressing my concern for where things were going as far as the dialogue, the talk about Hispanics, and that sort of thing. And, I said I wanted to make sure that somebody at this convention will give a speech about what Hispanics are \u2014 that it's not that we're a bunch of refugees coming across the border, which is what I think a lot of people think that Latinos are.\" A couple of months of later, Alvarado got a call from the Trump campaign inviting him to speak in Cleveland. The state senator from Kentucky admits that Trump was not his first choice. \"My first choice was Rand Paul back in Kentucky. When he dropped out, I kind of got behind Marco Rubio. When he dropped out, I thought \u2014 I'm zero for two, might as well just keep it where it's at,\" he said. Even though the businessman-turned-politician wasn't his top pick, Alvarado says he's now fully behind Trump as his party's choice, and he wants to help him get elected over Hillary Clinton. \"For me, I look at somebody who's brutally honest to somebody who's dishonest. And, so even though he may not say the things the way you want him to say it, he is an honest guy and he's straight up on things,\" he said. But some of Trump's brutal honesty regarding Hispanics has troubled Alvarado. He says the way Trump referred to the Hispanic judge overseeing a fraud case against Trump University was \"inappropriate.\" Trump called the judge a \"hater\" and insisted he was being unfair because he's a \"Mexican.\" \"That comment bothers me, of course,\" said Alvarado. \"You know, I'm like that judge. I'm a physician. I'm a son of immigrants .... No one can come to me and say you're gonna treat me a certain way as a doctor because of your Hispanic roots, your background, we don't do that.\" But when it comes to Trump's immigration ideas, Alvarado is more sympathetic. He says people have to follow the immigration rules, and some Latinos are frustrated by those who don't because illegal immigration makes the entire ethnic group look bad. Tonight, Alvarado wants to humanize Hispanics. He thinks he can help the party with minority outreach. \"We've got to get the right people, and I think I can hopefully provide at least for one night a fresh face with a perspective of a son of immigrants to say here's what I think is important. Here's what I think all Hispanics share with Republicans as far as our values,\" he said.",

A chaotic first day at the Republican National Convention gave way to an emotional evening centered on national security and capped off by a rousing speech by Donald Trump's wife, Melania. The presumptive GOP presidential nominee broke tradition and took to the convention stage Monday night to introduce his wife. The hall darkened and Queen's \"We Are The Champions\" played as Trump took the stage in a dramatic fashion and was greeted with a hero's welcome. Melania praised Trump as a wonderful father and husband who \"gets things done\" and is \"intensely loyal to family, friends, employees, country.\" \"He will never, ever give up. And most importantly, he will never ever let you down,\" she said. \"Donald is, and always has been, an amazing leader. Now, he will go to work for you. His achievements speak for themselves.\" Donald Trump enters the stage to introduce his wife, Melania.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Slovenian-born former model spoke of how she immigrated to the country and became a citizen, calling it \"the greatest privilege on Planet Earth.\" Melania conceded that \"the race will be hard fought, all the way to November, and that \"there will be good times, and hard times.\" But she laughed that it \"would not be a Trump contest without excitement and drama.\" Following her speech, several social media users pointed out that a section was startlingly similar to one Michelle Obama gave at the Democratic National Convention in 2008. In response to press inquiries about the similarities in the two speeches, Jason Miller, senior communications adviser for the Trump campaign, issued this statement: \"In writing her beautiful speech, Melania's team of writers took notes on her life's inspirations, and in some instances included fragments that reflected her own thinking. Melania's immigrant experience and love for America shone through in her speech, which made it such a success.\" Mother of Benghazi victim: \"Donald Trump is everything Hillary Clinton is not.\" #RNCinCLE https://t.co/Sb0pUDkq2B Speakers earlier in the evening underscored the night's theme \u2014 \"Make America Safe Again\" and featured people touched by the attacks on Benghazi and, affected by crimes by illegal immigrants and focused on protecting law enforsement. The evening began with a last-ditch effort by the anti-Trump Republicans to force a voice vote to call for releasing delegates, which resulted in competing factions yelling at each other on the floor. The only past GOP presidential nominee who came was Bob Dole. Instead of the usual top Republican lawmakers and past nominees who would speak, Trump turned to reality TV stars and former teen heart-throb actors whose careers had faded. Pat Smith, the mother of diplomat Sean Smith, who was killed in the 2012 attacks on the consulate in Benghazi, Libya, didn't mince words in pointing the finger at the presumptive Democratic nominee for her son's death. \"I blame Hillary Clinton personally for the death of my son,\" Smith said, adding that she couldn't get anyone at the State Department to answer questions about her son's death because she wasn't \"immediate family.\" \"Donald Trump is everything Hillary Clinton is not,\" Smith told the crowd at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, where many delegate and attendees were shown on television tearing up as she spoke. \"He is blunt, direct and strong. He speaks his mind and his heart,\" she continued. \"And when it comes to the threat posed by radical Islamic terrorism, he will not hesitate to kill the terrorists who threaten American lives.\" Former Benghazi security team members Mark Geist and John Tiegen also recounted that Sept. 11, 2012, attack in detail, which was depicted in Michael Bay's 13 Hours movie earlier this year. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani delivers a passionate speech in defense of law enforcement on stage at the Republican National Convention.\n                \n                    \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The two described how they were initially said to stand down but then ran into the siege after State Department security radioed for help. They saved 30 lives that night, they said, but argued that \"opportunities squandered when Hillary Clinton failed to protect her people on the ground,\" and four Americans subsequently lost their lives. \"Now, we as Americans have the opportunity to elect someone who will make this country safe again. Someone who will have our backs. Someone who will bring our guys home. Someone who will lead with strength and integrity. That someone is Donald Trump,\" Geist said. But even as some of the most damning indictments of the evening were coming from Trump's chosen speakers against Clinton, the unpredictable Republican couldn't seem to stop himself from counter-programming. While Smith and others were speaking, Trump called in to Fox News's Bill O'Reilly to slam former rival Ohio Gov. John Kasich for skipping this week's convention in his own state. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani had one of the most fiery speeches of the night, opening with a forceful defense of law enforcement and condemning recent attacks against them in Dallas and Baton Rouge, La. \"When they come to save your life, they don't ask if you are black or white. They just come to save you!\" he said to cheers. The former 2008 presidential candidate argued Trump was the best to protect the country from increasing terrorist threats and wouldn't recoil from identifying the attackers. \"In the last seven months, there have been five major Islamic terrorist attacks on us and our allies. We must not be afraid to define our enemy. It is Islamic extremist terrorism,\" Giuliani said. \"I, for the purposes of the media, I did not say all of Islam. I did not say most of Islam. I said \u2014 Islamic extremist terrorism. You know who are! And we're coming to get you!\" Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke also got a rousing reception as he called for America to defend and protect police in the wake of the recent police shootings. \"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make something very clear: Blue Lives Matter!\" the African-American sheriff told the crowd to raucous applause. \"What we witnessed in Ferguson, in Baltimore, and in Baton Rouge was a collapse of social order,\" Clark continued. \"So many of the actions of the Occupy movement and Black Lives Matter transcend peaceful protest, and violates the code of conduct we rely on. I call it anarchy.\" Former Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell, winner of the Purple Heart for his actions during Operation Red Wings in Afghanistan, got some of the loudest applause of the night as he argued Trump would take care of veterans and strengthen the U.S. military. \"The only way we're going to make America safe again is to have an elite military made up of warriors and prepared by the toughest training that we have to offer,\" Luttrell said. Families whose loved ones had been killed by illegal immigrants were also highlighted. Mary Mendoza said her son, police officer Brandon Medoza, was \"stolen from me\" after he was killed in a car wreck by someone \"who had been living in the country illegally for two decades\" and \"had no business being in the country.\" \"It's time we had an administration that cares more about Americans than about illegals,\" Mendoza said. \"A vote for Hillary is a vote that puts Americans' life at risk. It's time for Donald Trump.\" Sabine Durden also told the story of how her son Dominic, a 911 dispatcher, was killed by a drunk driver who was an illegal immigrant from Guatemala who had previously been deported for felonies for grand theft and robbery. Scott Baio gives two thumbs up during his speech on the first day of the Republican National Convention on Monday at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"I have been talking about illegal immigration since 2012, and no one listened\u2014 until Donald Trump,\" Durden said. \"Donald Trump is not only my hero, he's my lifesaver. Hillary Clinton, or as we know her, 'Crooked Hillary,' always talks about what she will do for illegal aliens and what she will do for refugees. Well, Donald Trump talks about what he will do for America!\" Trump also turned to reality TV stars and onetime Hollywood actors to make his case. Duck Dynasty star Willie Robertson, the first speaker, said the country was in a \"tough spot\" and that \"we need a president who will have our back.\" \"I can promise you this, no matter who you are, Donald Trump will have your back,\" the long-haired duck-call manufacturer from rural Louisiana said of the billionaire real estate mogul. \"If you're looking for a job or trying to grow a business like I am, Donald Trump will have your back,\" Robertson told the crowd in Cleveland. Former Happy Days and Charles In Charge actor Scott Baio told the crowd that Trump was a \"man who wants to get things done\" and \"wants to be president for all of us.\" \"We can go with Hillary Clinton who wants to continue the same policies that are wrecking the country ... or we can go with Donald Trump, a man doing this from the goodness of his heart and genuinely wants to help,\" Baio said. Former Calvin Klein model and soap opera star Antonio Sabato Jr. acknowledged he wasn't the usual convention speaker and wasn't particularly political, but that \"my belief in this country and my faith in Jesus Christ have compelled me to speak now.\" \"Donald Trump believes in one America, with liberty and justice for all. Having secure borders, protecting our citizens \u2014 none of this is hateful,\" the Italian immigrant said. \"This is the responsibility of the government \u2014 and the right thing to do.\" Sabato later revived Trump's \"birtherism\" charges, telling ABC News in an interview that he \"absolutely\" believed President Obama was a Muslim.

            "article_content": "Indiana Gov. Mike Pence introduces Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump earlier this month.\n                \n                    \n                    Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Indiana Gov. Mike Pence introduces Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump earlier this month. Donald Trump could stand to benefit from his reported vice presidential pick Mike Pence in a number of ways, in particular from his strong Christian identity, which might help Trump gain needed support in evangelical communities. But Pence initially endorsed Ted Cruz, albeit without enthusiasm, and there were some reports that the Indiana governor disliked Trump. Less than a week after Cruz dropped out, Pence endorsed Trump. The initial hesitation from Pence might be the result of differences between the two men. Here's how they differ on some key issues: In a March interview on MSNBC, Trump said that women should be punished for having abortions. Pence opposes abortion rights \u2014 in Indiana, Pence signed a bill earlier that month banning abortions because of a fetal abnormality. The bill sparked criticism from women who found the law invasive. But Trump's comments went too far for Pence, whose office responded with a statement that he disagrees with Trump: \"As someone who has embraced the pro-life position all of his life, he has a deep compassion for expected mothers and the unborn. The governor believes that it's important to focus on policies, as we advance the sanctity of life on those that are performing the abortions.\" The two are starkly different in their views on Planned Parenthood. In 2007, when Pence was a U.S. representative for Indiana's 6th Congressional District, he sponsored the first bill to defund Planned Parenthood, Vox reports. \"If Planned Parenthood wants to be involved in providing counseling services and HIV testing, they ought not be in the business of providing abortions,\" Pence told Vox. \"As long as they aspire to do that, I'll be after them.\" Trump, on the other hand, has indicated that he supports Planned Parenthood. In a March news conference in Florida, he said that \"millions of women have been helped by Planned Parenthood,\" adding that he is \"a common-sense conservative.\" He did indicate that he wants the organization to end abortion practices, which seems to be in line with Pence's view. Trump's campaign released a statement on Dec. 7, 2015, calling for \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.\" Since then, Trump has been fairly consistent in his call to ban Muslims from entering the country, despite widespread criticism at the extreme remark and some in his campaign signaling that it may soften to only include countries that have a record of terrorism. After the shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., Trump appeared to expand his proposed ban to include all immigrants from countries with a \"proven history of terrorism.\" Pence was quick to denounce Trump's original proposed ban on Muslims. He tweeted a criticism the day after, on Dec. 8, 2015, saying the proposed ban is \"offensive and unconstitutional.\" Calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional. Pence did suspend the resettlement of Syrian refugees to Indiana after the Paris attacks last fall, but a spokesman for Pence defended the act, saying there is a difference between a total ban on Muslims and suspending Syrian refugees \"when it comes to security issues when members of the Obama Administration's intelligence community have said that ISIS has attempted to gain entry into the United States via the Syrian refugee program.\" Whereas Trump leaned more extreme on his views toward Muslims, Pence might be the more extreme politician when it comes to LGBT rights. Trump has said that marriage is between a man and a woman, but according to the New York Times, he has \"nurtured long friendships with gay people, employed gay workers in prominent positions, and moved with ease in industries where gays have long exerted influence, like entertainment.\" Trump also said in an NBC interview that he opposed North Carolina's ban on individuals using public bathrooms that do not correspond to their biological sex. Pence has been more hard-nosed on LGBT rights. In 2015, he signed a \"religious freedom\" bill in Indiana that critics argued would have allowed businesses to refuse service to LGBT people on the basis of religious freedom. After facing backlash, Pence signed an amended version into law. In September 2014, Pence tweeted his support of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the free trade agreement between the United States, Canada and 10 Asian countries. Pence tweeted that \"trade means jobs, but trade also means security. The time has come for all of us to urge the swift adoption of the Trans Pacific Partnership.\" Trade means jobs, but trade also means security. The time has come for all of us to urge the swift adoption of the Trans Pacific Partnership Trump has been strongly opposed to the trade deal, a stance that has become one of his most prominent positions. In a June 28 speech on the economy, Trump called TPP \"a death blow to American manufacturing.\" \"Not only will the TPP undermine our economy,\" Trump said, \"but it will undermine our independence. That's what's happened. The TPP creates a new international commission that makes decisions the American people are no longer given the right to veto.\" Pence has expanded Medicaid in Indiana, although he did so with \"a litany of controversial rules and restrictions for how poor people in Indiana could qualify for the newly generous Medicaid coverage,\" according to Politico. Regardless, Pence's expansion of Medicaid is a fact that White House press secretary Josh Earnest pointed out Thursday. Pence expanded coverage to more than 300,000 low-income adults. \"I know that Gov. Pence did do some important work with the administration to expand Medicaid in his state,\" Earnest said. \"That's something President Obama has been encouraging Democratic and Republican governors across the country to do.\" Pence also tweeted about the program's expansion in June 2015. \"Indiana\u2019s alternative to Medicaid expansion is proving to be a huge success.\" @JGfortwayne  Read about it here: https://t.co/ffnUjojl2m Trump has said he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, including the Medicaid expansion. As Modern Healthcare reports, Pence could now be in the position of calling for repeal of his own Medicaid expansion.",

Voters go to the polls in five states on Tuesday, where congressional primaries in New York and Colorado in particular could have an important impact on key competitive House and Senate races. Democrats hope to contest as many as four congressional seats in the Empire State, a place that could prove critical in whether they're able to flip the 30 they need to win back the House. Many of those contests could come with female nominees, too. Democrats have made recruiting pushes for more women to run this year, and they believe that Hillary Clinton, as the first female nominee of a major party, at the top of the ticket will help those candidates, especially in the state she now calls home. EMILY's List, which recruits women who are pro-abortion rights to run, is supporting five candidates in New York. That includes Anna Throne-Holst in the primary to take on vulnerable GOP Rep. Lee Zeldin, and Colleen Deacon, a former aide to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, in the primary to take on another top target, GOP Rep. John Katko. Deacon also has the backing of the national party. Democrats hope Deacon's background as a single mother who relied on food stamps after her son was born will resonate with voters, giving her a unique story at a time when paid family leave is becoming an important national campaign issue. \"It's not a unique story, not a unique experience, but it's a perspective not represented in Congress,\" Deacon told NPR. Deacon is competing against college professor Eric Kingson \u2014 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders held a rally for him last week. In an an open GOP-held seat to succeed retiring Rep. Chris Gibson, EMILY's List is backing former gubernatorial candidate Zephyr Teachout; she also has the backing of Sanders, who helped raise money for her earlier this year. Polls show Teachout with an advantage on the Democratic side. In the Republican primary, state Assembly Minority Leader John Faso, who has the backing of much of the state and local GOP leadership, leads wealthy businessman Andrew Heaney in what's been a bitter primary. Republicans have a rare offensive opportunity in the state too, thanks to the retirement of Rep. Steve Israel, who led the Democrats' House campaign committee for the past two cycles. EMILY's List is backing North Hempstead Town Councilwoman Anna Kaplan there. Kaplan has made her story of coming to the U.S. at age 13 as a Jewish refugee from Iran a central part of her campaign, especially following presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump's controversial Muslim ban and call to stop immigration from certain Middle Eastern countries. \"America gave me a chance. So when Donald Trump says these hateful things, I know how dangerous that can become, and how important it is to fight back,\" she says in one TV ad. \"People can sit and read books about Iran, but I've lived that life and that culture,\" Kaplan told NPR of her five-way primary. \"I'm a female, but because of my background, where I come from, my life experience \u2014 I think sometimes that could be a lot more meaningful or appropriate on a congressional level than having 20, 30 years in public office.\" In Colorado, Republicans will pick their Senate nominee for a race the national party had once hoped to make competitive against Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet. But a messy primary that's been beset by ballot problems and other candidate gaffes have made that a likely long shot now. National Review reports that Darryl Glenn, an African-American Air Force veteran and county commissioner, appears to have a narrow edge for Tuesday night, buoyed by an inspiring speech at the state GOP convention and further aided by outside spending from conservative groups on his behalf. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz traveled to campaign with him earlier this month. Early on, national Republicans had preferred former state lawmaker Jon Keyser, who's been plagued by questions about forged signatures on his ballot petitions.",

And you see it in Europe, all over Europe.\" And while Scotland itself voted overwhelmingly to remain in the European Union, Trump is right. Right-wing nationalist movements, fueled by anger toward political elites and mistrust of immigration \u2014 and primarily backed by white voters \u2014 are gaining more and more momentum on the continent. \"This is not a unique phenomenon to the United States, and 2016 is not a short moment that will pass,\" says Yascha Mounk, who teaches political theory at Harvard University and has studied the rise of nationalist movements. \"This is a real populist turn that has been happening for the last 15 or 20 years.\" In recent decades, nationalist movements have shifted from vocal minorities to powerful parties that gained control of governments in places like Hungary, have lost national elections by the slimmest of margins in countries like Austria, and, this week, forced the United Kingdom out of the European Union. Mounk pegs economic stagnation among lower- and middle-class whites as a main driver for nationalism's rise around the globe. \"You have a socially descending middle class that hasn't had real gains in the standard of living in 30 years,\" he said. \"And at the same time, you seem to have real improvements in social status, if not necessarily economic status, for ethnic minorities. So they feel like our country is being taken away.\" Add to that mix an immigration and refugee crisis tied to Syria's civil war, which has flooded European countries, especially, with scores of migrants looking for jobs, social-services protections and housing. While each movement has its own unique characteristics, there are many similarities that are fueling nationalism in the United States, the U.K. and other European nations. A contempt for the elite ruling classes \"People feel, quite rightly, that they have no real control over political systems \u2014 that the political class does what it wants and it sort of ignores ordinary people,\" Mounk says. \"And to a large extent, that's because of the necessities of globalization.\" The contempt was clear in the victory speech of Nigel Farage, the head of the U.K. Independence Party and a leading voice in the long push for the U.K. to disassociate from the EU. \"This will be a victory for the real people, a victory for the ordinary people,\" he said early Friday morning when it was clear the Leave campaign had won the referendum. \"We have fought against the multinationals. We fought against the big merchant banks. We fought against big politics.\" Trump has sounded similar calls throughout his campaign. UKIP leader Nigel Farage, after placing a bet his \"leave\" campaign would win the Brexit vote.\n                \n                    \n                    Corbis via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption UKIP leader Nigel Farage, after placing a bet his \"leave\" campaign would win the Brexit vote. \"We'll never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who have rigged it in the first place,\" Trump said earlier this week, adding, \"It's rigged by big donors, who want to keep wages down. It's rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country.\" While the feeling has largely gone mainstream in recent years \u2014 both of those quotes could have been said by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2014 anti-elite sentiments have been a key part of nationalist parties' persona for decades. Blaming immigrants After the ISIS-inspired mass shooting in San Bernardino last December, Trump amped up warnings about Syrian refugees immigrating to the United States. He called for an across-the-board halt of all Muslims entering the country, warning they carried the risk of additional terror attacks. While many Republicans hoped Trump would back away from his proposed ban on an entire religion, he embraced it even tighter after the Orlando shootings. \"We need to tell the truth, also, about how radical Islam is coming to our shores,\" Trump said in the wake of the attack. \"And it's coming. With these people, folks, it's coming.\" Trump even blamed \"Muslim communities,\" en masse, for failing to tip off authorities about both the Orlando and San Bernardino attacks. \"The idea of nativism \u2014 of seeing your country under threat by non-natives, specifically immigrants and Muslims, is something that Marine Le Pen and Donald Trump clearly share,\" says Cas Mudde, a University of Georgia professor, who specializes in nationalist movements. French far-right leader Marine Le Pen reacts to the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption French far-right leader Marine Le Pen reacts to the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union Le Pen heads the National Front party in France. In the wake of last year's Paris terror attacks, she told NPR that France needed \"to institute a major policy, which would reestablish our own borders. This means we need to stop accepting this influx of immigrants.\" She called the continued flow of Syrian refugees into Europe \"madness\" and urged for an end to the open-border policy that is a hallmark of the European Union. \"I think when people are disappointed and hurt and angry, they revert to a very basic part of human psychology,\" Mounk says. \"And that is in-group versus out-group. Us versus them. And it's always easy to blame immigrants.\" It can be popular, too. Exit polls conducted throughout the Republican primaries this year consistently showed a solid majority of GOP voters supporting Trump's call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration. Simple solutions Mounk says the basic approach of many populist, nationalist candidates can be boiled down to this: \"I embody the will of the people. And the problems that we face are actually completely straightforward,\" he said. \"The problem is that the elites are corrupt. They're in cahoots with minorities, with business interests. And all that needs to happen is for me to be elected.\" It's a sentiment that can be heard in Trump's most recent major campaign speech. \"When I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries for that matter,\" he said, \"I know these problems can all be fixed. But not by Hillary Clinton. Only by me.\" The best example of a simple solution to a complex problem: Trump's vow to curtail immigrants from entering the country illegally by building a wall across the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 and forcing Mexico to foot the bill. Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, is perhaps the most high-profile nationalist politician to head a nation. He went ahead and built a wall of his own last year in an attempt to stem the flow of migrants from Syria. \"Many people criticize the physical barrier we are just setting up at this moment in Hungary,\" he said at the European Union headquarters in Brussels last year. \"I ask everybody \u2014 all the European leaders \u2014 what else ideas they have.\" Is nationalism here to stay? It's clear that the factors galvanizing nationalist sentiments aren't going anywhere any time soon. Western democracies continue to become increasingly multicultural. Globalization will remain \u2014 despite attempts to stop it, like the U.K.'s Brexit vote. And the most powerful factor \u2014 economic stagnation \u2014 appears more likely to remain, too. The Brexit vote triggered market turmoil around the globe Friday, raising questions about long-term economic affect of the move. So nationalism will continue to be a powerful political tool, and it's clear Trump will embrace the theme through the November election, seeing Brexit as fuel. \"I really do see a parallel between what's happening in the United States and what's happening here,\" he said in Scotland Friday. \"People want to see borders. They don't necessarily want people pouring into their country that they don't know who they are and where they came from. They have no idea.\" How much is nationalism at the core of Trump's political ethos? At the end of his speech Wednesday, Trump veered off script into an almost stream-of-consciousness mantra. \"Americans, Americans,\" he said. \"The people that we love.\" \"Americans,\" he continued. \"America first. Make our country great again. \"Americans.\"",

Trump endorsed the U.K. decision to leave the European Union even though Scotland was against it. Donald Trump celebrated voters' stunning decision in the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, while he marked the re-opening of his golf course and resort in Scotland. Trump contended that the U.K. had \"taken back their independence\" and predicted similar populist, nativist movements throughout the Western world, like the one fueling his candidacy in the U.S. At a press conference from the 9th tee of the golf course, a lighthouse along the rocky coast in the southwest of Scotland in the distance, Trump seemed unconcerned about the precipitous, overnight drop in the British pound. the pound fell to a 30-year low following the vote, but Trump said it could be a good thing \u2014 at least for businesses like his. \"Look if the pound goes down, they're gonna do more business,\" Trump said. \"You know, when the pound goes down, more people are gonna come to Turnberry, frankly, and the pound has gone down, and let's see what the impact of that is.\" That is a remarkable suggestion from a man looking to lead the world and who is already facing criticism, even from within his own party, for tending to business interests while running for president of the United States. Trump linked the \"Brexit\" vote to the current political climate in the United States. \"I think I see a big parallel,\" Trump said. \"I think people really see a big parallel \u2014 a lot of people are talking about that. And not only the United States, but other countries. People want to take their country back.\" Take Our Country Back was a slogan of the Tea Party that mirrored Trump's Make America Great Again presidential slogan. It has great parallels in the sentiment in the U.K. to go through with this historic move that was driven by blue-collar whites without college degrees put off by immigration that has become a scapegoat for lower wages for some. Nativist sentiment in the U.K. has also been a factor for those who believe the British brand has been watered down. The decision to leave the E.U., which was by a narrow 52-to-48-percent margin, followed a contentious debate about problems in the European economy and the wave of immigration of refugees fleeing violence in countries including Syria. \"People want to see borders,\" Trump said. \"They don't necessarily want people pouring into their country that they don't know who they are and where they come from.\" The real-estate developer added that he thinks the departure from the E.U. will benefit Britain, at least in the long term. Trump predicted more travel to the U.K., saying, \"I think it could very well turn out to be a positive. Nobody really knows; you'll know in about five years; you'll be able to analyze it.\" Upon arriving in Scotland, Trump tweeted, \"Place is going wild over the vote. They took their country back, just like we will take America back.\" Just arrived in Scotland. Place is going wild over the vote. They took their country back, just like we will take America back. No games! That's despite the fact that 62 percent of Scots voted to remain in the E.U. Trump was met with a small group of protesters outside the club. As the press conference began, a protester who'd managed to get inside was escorted out after attempting to pass out golf balls painted with Nazi symbols. Comedian Lee Nelson is taken away by security Friday while holding golf balls stamped with swastikas, as he protests Donald Trump, at the opening of Trump's resort in Scotland.\n                \n                    \n                    Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Comedian Lee Nelson is taken away by security Friday while holding golf balls stamped with swastikas, as he protests Donald Trump, at the opening of Trump's resort in Scotland. \"These are the new balls available from the clubhouse \u2014 part of the new Trump Turnberry range,\" said the man, identified by some news outlets as comedian Lee Nelson. During a question-and-answer session, Trump was asked about Prime Minister David Cameron, who'd opposed leaving the E.U. Cameron resigned after results of the vote became clear. Trump said it was appropriate for Cameron step down. \"He was wrong on this,\" Trump said. \"He didn't get the mood of his country right. He was surprised. I think he was very surprised to see what happened, but he is a good man and he felt that way - and probably did the right thing,\" Trump said. Trump and Cameron had previously clashed over Trump's call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration to the U.S. At the press conference, and in a statement released by his campaign, Trump promised to strengthen ties with the U.K. if he's elected president. \"I think zero will change on that score,\" Trump said. \"There's never been a better ally.\" NPR's Domenico Montanaro contributed to this report.",

Donald Trump laid out a series of campaign promises and leveled a slew of accusations at rival Hillary Clinton on Wednesday. Read more about the speech here. NPR's politics team (with some help from our colleagues on the international desk) has annotated Trump's speech, below. Portions we commented on are bolded, followed by analysis and fact-check in italics. We will update further. The speech follows: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, everyone. Today I'd like to share my thoughts about the stakes in this upcoming and very important election. People have asked me why I'm running for president. I built an amazing business that I love. And I get to work side by side with my children every single day. We come to work together and turn visions into reality. We think big, and then we make it happen. We absolutely make it happen. I love what I do. And I'm grateful beyond words to the nation that has allowed me to do it. So when people ask me why I am running, I very quickly answer: I'm running to give back to this country, which has been so very good to me. When I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries, for that matter, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton. Only by me. The fact is, we can come back bigger and better and stronger than ever before. Jobs, jobs, jobs. Everywhere I look, I see the possibilities of what our country could be. But we can't solve any of these problems by relying on the politicians who created the problems themselves. We'll never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who have rigged it in the first place. The insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money. That's why we're asking Bernie Sanders' voters to join our movement. So together we can fix the system for all Americans. So important. This includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals. And they are disastrous. They are destroying our country. Because it's not just the political system that's rigged, it's the whole economy. It's rigged by big donors who want to keep wages down. [Trump himself has said during this cycle that wages are \"too high.\" He said it in a November debate in response to a question about raising the minimum wage, then repeated the point the next day on MSNBC's Morning Joe. Since then, he has walked that comment back, telling Meet the Press' Chuck Todd in May, \"I have seen what's going on. And I don't know how people make it on $7.25 an hour.\" He added that he would like to see an increase, but that states \u2014 not the federal government \u2014 should do it. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] It's rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country, fire our workers, and sell their products back into the United States with absolutely no consequences for them. [Trump has expressed great outrage over trade deals leading to the offshoring of American jobs. But when it comes to his own Trump-branded products, the vast majority are made overseas. \u2014 Tamara Keith] It's rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools. It's rigged against you, the American people. Hillary Clinton, and, as you know, most people know, she's a world-class liar. Just look at her pathetic email server statements, or her phony landing. Or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack. And the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers. A total and so \u2014 look, this was one of the beauts \u2014 a total and self-serving lie. [The Washington Post Fact Checker did an excellent piece on this. And, yes, it was a four-Pinocchio whopper. In AP video from the time, she does appear to be holding a bouquet of flowers. \u2014 Tamara Keith] Brian Williams' career was destroyed for saying less. [Brian Williams did lose his post as anchor of NBC Nightly News, the network's signature program. He's now an anchor on MSNBC. Their inaccurate claims about being under fire in aircraft were remarkably similar. \u2014 Tamara Keith] Just remember that. Yesterday, she even tried to attack me and my many businesses. [True, she did. \u2014 Tamara Keith] But here, and this is the way it is, is the bottom line. I started off in Brooklyn, New York, not so long ago, with a small loan and built a business that today is worth well over $10 billion. [It depends on your definition of small. Trump says the loan was $1 million, which by most standards is not small. Additionally, the Washington Post Fact Checker finds that Trump benefited from significantly more help than that from his father, a successful real estate developer. \u2014 Tamara Keith] And that's the kind of thinking we need in our leadership of our country. I've always had a talent for building businesses, and importantly, for creating jobs. That's a talent our country desperately needs. I'm running for president to end the unfairness and to put you, the American worker, first. It's about time. We're going to put America first. And we're going to make America great again. This election will decide whether we are ruled by the people or by the politicians. Here is my promise to the American voter: If I'm elected president, I will end the special-interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. Very important. [Trump has said that he loves \"the idea of campaign finance reform\" and regularly decries the influence of money in politics, but he has yet to outline how he would \"end the special-interest monopoly in Washington, D.C.\" His website does not list campaign finance reform, money in politics or checking the influence of lobbyists in the section devoted to issues. His campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, was formerly a partner in a successful lobbying firm. \u2014 Tamara Keith] The other candidate in this race has spent her entire life making money for special interests. And, I will tell you, she's made plenty of money for them. And she's been taking plenty of money out for herself. Hillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and even theft. She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund, doing favors for oppressive regimes, and many others, and, really, many, many others, in exchange for cash. Pure and simple, folks. Pure and simple. Then, when she left, she made $21.6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests. And, in less than two years, secret speeches that she doesn't want to reveal under any circumstances to the public. I wonder why. Together, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs and foreign governments in the years since 2001. [According to CNN, the Clintons did earn $153 million in speaking fees since 2001. Bill Clinton earned the bulk of that money. Hillary earned $21.7 million TOTAL. According to CNN it was just $1.8 million \u2014 still not tiny \u2014 which came from big banks. It's unclear where the rest came from (Trump would argue it was all some sort of \"special interest\"), but it seems the bulk was not from Wall Street, as Trump is clearly implying. \u2014 Will Huntsberry] They totally own her. And that will never, ever change. Including if she ever became president, God help us. The choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests or surrendering, really, the last scrap of independence to the total and complete control of people like the Clintons. Those are the stakes: Hillary Clinton wants to be president. But she doesn't have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders said very strongly, the judgment to be president. She does not have the judgment. She believes -- She believes she's entitled to the office. Her campaign slogan is \"I'm with her.\" You know what my response is to that? I'm with you, the American people. Thank you very much. She thinks it's all about her. I know it's all about you. I know it's all about making America great again for all Americans. All Americans. Our country lost its way when it stopped putting the American people really first. We have to go back to putting our American people first. We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism, focusing on what's good for America's middle class, to a policy of Globalism, focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries, all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy itself. We reward companies for offshoring, and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed. They get punished. This is not a rising tide that lifts all boats. This is a wave of globalism that wipes out our middle class and our jobs along with it. We need reform, and we have to reform our economic system so that once again we can all succeed together and America can become rich again. We have to make America rich again. And that's what I mean by America first. Our country will be better off when we start making our own products again. Bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to the shores. [According to a report from Michael Hicks, Ball State professor, 9 out of 10 manufacturing jobs have been lost to mechanization, not trade policies. \"No matter how you measure it, 2015 was the record year for manufacturing production in the USA. Right now manufacturing in Indiana and the USA is at record levels. There's no ambiguity on this. ... To be sure, our trade deficits have cost us manufacturing jobs. The high-end estimates are that today we have 1.5 million fewer manufacturing jobs across the nation because of foreign trade. All the other 6 million or so lost manufacturing jobs are due to mechanization, better technology and better production practices. Today's typical factory workers make twice as much 'stuff' in an hour as they did in 1977. For every manufacturing job lost to trade, nearly 9 have been lost to machines. But trade also creates jobs. We have 7 million more transportation and logistics jobs alone, likely attributable to trade, since the 1970s.\"  \u2014 Will Huntsberry] I mean, we have to bring our manufacturers back to the United States. Desperately needed. Desperately, we need those jobs. And we need it even from our psyche. One of the really great things and one of the first major bills that George Washington signed was \u2014 amazing, when I saw this for the first time \u2014 the encouragement and protection of manufacturing in America. Our first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, warned us by saying: The abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people. In other words, we have to protect our country. I have decided and visited cities and towns across America, all across America, and seen the devastation caused by the trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton. And it's total devastation. All over New York. All over Pennsylvania. All over New England. All over the country. Hillary Clinton supported Bill Clinton's disastrous and totally disastrous NAFTA. Just like she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization. [It's very hard to tease out the exact effects of NAFTA because of the many economic factors at play. However, by several nonpartisan analyses, it is not \"disastrous.\" In 2003, the Congressional Budget Office characterized the 1994 agreement as having a \"very small positive effect on U.S. gross domestic product.\" A 2015 study from the Congressional Research Service likewise characterized the effect on the economy as \"relatively small\" and also noted that it's difficult to put exact numbers on the effect. They added, \"In reality, NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters.\" One additional bit of context: It's true that trade deals, broadly speaking, are sometimes disastrous on the micro level \u2014 that is, a trade deal can be disastrous for a person whose job is moved to another country. But on the macro level, trade deals often provide broader, less readily visible benefits (like cheaper goods for U.S. consumers). \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] We've lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs since these two Hillary-backed agreements were signed. [U.S. employment in manufacturing has dropped by 27 percent since January 1994 when NAFTA took effect. Since 2010, jobs in manufacturing have seen a slight uptick. \u2014 Tamara Keith] Among the worst we've ever done. Among the most destructive agreements we've ever signed. Our trade deficit with China soared 40 percent during Hillary Clinton's time as secretary of state. A disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated but rather scorned. [The U.S. trade deficit with China grew by approximately 39 percent from 2009 to 2012, the years that Clinton was secretary of state. However, it would be hard to put much responsibility for U.S. trade policy and the imbalance on the secretary of state. \u2014 Tamara Keith] As the AP pointed out when Trump attacked Clinton on the U.S.'s trade deficit with China, \"In her role as the nation's top diplomat, Clinton had no direct control over the difference in the cost of U.S. imports from China versus its exports to the nation.\" \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] Then she left China \u2014 so true. Then she left China and what happened is billions and billions of dollars in our intellectual property, and China has taken it. And it's a crime which is continuously going on and is going on right now. They are stealing billions and billions of dollars of our intellectual property. Hillary Clinton gave China millions of jobs, our best jobs, and effectively let China completely rebuild itself. In return, Hillary Clinton got rich. The book Clinton Cash by Peter Schweitzer documents how Bill and Hillary used the State Department to enrich their family at America's expense. She gets rich making you poor. Here is a quote from the book: At the center of U.S. policy toward China was Hillary Clinton. At this critical time for U.S.-China relations, Bill Clinton gave a number of speeches that were underwritten by the Chinese government and its supporters. These funds were paid to the Clintons' bank account directly while Hillary was negotiating with China on behalf of the United States. Tell me, folks, does that work? She sold out our workers and our country for Beijing. Hillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas and give up congressional power to an international foreign commission. Now, because I pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal, she's pretending that she's against it. [Proving causation here would be nearly impossible. But it is highly unlikely that Trump's criticisms of the Trans-Pacific Partnership had anything to do with Clinton's movement on the matter. Bernie Sanders was putting pressure on Hillary Clinton to oppose the TPP as well as fast-track authority before Trump even announced he was running for president. Labor unions whose support Clinton sought strongly oppose the deal as well. As a candidate, Clinton resisted taking a position one way or another on TPP until negotiations were completed. Then, in October, one week before the first Democratic presidential debate, her campaign weighed in, saying she couldn't support it in its current form. \u2014 Tamara Keith] She's given, and deleted, as you know \u2014 and most people have heard about this. Have we ever heard about her deleting anything? No, I don't think so \u2014 she deleted the entire record from her book. [This has been widely reported, including here. \u2014 Tamara Keith] And deletion is something she really does know something about, because she's deleted at least 30,000 emails. Which, by the way, should be able to be found. Should be able to be found, because the government \u2014 I will say, I've always heard, you can never really delete an email. So it should be able to be found, if they really wanted to find them. But I don't think they want to find them. This is the latest Clinton cover-up, and it doesn't change anything. If she is elected president, she will adopt the Trans-Pacific Partnership. [Clinton has said she is opposed to the TPP \u2014 or, more clearly, her campaign has said she's opposed to it \"in its current form,\" and that it needs changes to bolster jobs, wages and national security. However, she wasn't always opposed to the agreement. As secretary of state, she had characterized it as \"the gold standard\" of trade agreements. In October 2015, when she came out against the deal, CNN counted 45 instances in which she had previously spoken in favor of the deal. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] And we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good. She'll do this and, just as she has betrayed the American worker on trade at every single stage of her career \u2014 and it will be even worse than the Clintons' NAFTA deal, and I never thought it could get worse than that \u2014 we will lose jobs, we will lose employment, we will lose taxes, we will lose everything. We will lose our country. I want trade deals, but they have to be great for the United States and for our workers. We don't make great deals anymore. But we will once I become president. I promise you that. It's not just our economy that's been corrupted but our foreign policy, too. The Hillary Clinton foreign policy has cost America thousands of lives and trillions and trillions of dollars and unleashed ISIS across the world. No secretary of state has been more wrong, more often and in more places than Hillary Clinton. Her decision spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched. Among the victims of our late ambassador Chris Stevens \u2014 I mean, what she did with him was absolutely horrible. He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed. When the phone rang, as per the commercial, at 3 o'clock in the morning, Hillary Clinton was sleeping. Ambassador Stevens and his staff in Libya made hundreds and hundreds of requests for security. They were desperate, they needed help. Hillary Clinton's State Department refused them all. She started the war that put them in Libya, denied him the security he asked for, then left him there to die. To cover her tracks, Hillary lied about the video being the cause of death, the famous video. [In marathon testimony to a congressional committee last year, Clinton said she had \"lost sleep\" and had been \"racking my brain over what more could have or should've been done.\" But she said she relied on lower-level officials to make determinations about a security presence at the compound and had not personally denied any requests for more security there. \u2014 Carrie Johnson] All a lie. Another Hillary lie. Here's what one of the victim's mother had to say: I want the whole world to know it. She lied to my face. And, you know, this person cannot be president. She cannot be president. In 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn in, it was a different world. Libya was cooperating. Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence, believe it or not. Syria was under control. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Egypt was governed by a friendly regime that honored its peace treaty Israel. Something very nice because, by the way, Israel has been totally mistreated by the United States. ISIS wasn't even on the map. Fast forward to 2013. In just four years, Secretary Clinton managed to almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East. Her invasion of Libya handed the country over to ISIS \u2014 the barbarians. Thanks to Hillary Clinton, Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East and on the road to nuclear weapons. Hillary Clinton's support for violent regime change in Syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen, while giving ISIS a launching pad for terrorism against the West. [The Arab uprisings of 2011 included peaceful demonstrations in Syria. But President Bashar Assad's security forces began attacking protesters, and the clashes rapidly escalated into a civil war. President Obama was extremely wary of direct U.S. involvement, and his administration was criticized for not taking stronger action in the first few years. U.S. forces began bombing the Islamic State in Syria in 2014, well after Clinton left her post as secretary of state. Clinton has generally supported similar, if slightly tougher positions, than Obama has. She has called for intensifying the current bombing campaign and has advocated measures such as a no-fly zone. She has opposed sending U.S. ground troops. The Islamic State began emerging in its current form in 2013 \u2014 as Clinton was leaving office \u2014 and made its most spectacular territorial gains in Syria that year, and in Iraq the following year. \u2014 Greg Myre] She helped force out a friendly regime in Egypt, and replace it with the radical Muslim Brotherhood. The Egyptian military has retaken control. But Clinton has opened the Pandora's box of radical Islam. Then, there was the disastrous strategy of announcing our departure from Iraq, handing large parts of the country over to ISIS and the ISIS killers. ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made along with President Obama. ISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims across the Middle East and peaceful Muslims across the world, who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality. And who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety. In short -- In short, Hillary Clinton's tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another. One by one, they're all bad. She's virtually done nothing right. She's virtually done nothing good. It all started with her bad judgment in supporting the war in Iraq in the first place. Though I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war. And, yes, even before the war ever started. [Politifact has rated this claim as False, saying it \"didn't find any examples of Trump unequivocally denouncing the war until a year after the war began.\" In fact, in September 2002, he told Howard Stern, \"Yeah, I guess so\" when questioned as to whether he supported the invasion of Iraq. \u2014 Jessica Taylor] But Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq. Because when she got into power, she couldn't wait to rush us off to war in Libya. She lacks the temperament and the judgment and the competence to lead our country. She should not be president under any circumstances. In the words of a Secret Service agent posted outside the Oval Office, somebody that saw her a lot ... [According to a Politico report, the Association of Former Agents of the U.S. Secret Service has put out a statement questioning whether that agent could possibly have been stationed where he said he was stationed, and whether he could have seen what he claims. \u2014 Tamara Keith] ... and knows her probably better than almost anybody: \"She simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office. From the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true.\" Her leadership style, volcanic, impulsive, disdainful, and disdainful of the rules set for everyone else, hasn't changed one bit. Perhaps the most terrifying thing of Hillary Clinton's foreign policy is that she refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by radical Islam. In fact, Hillary Clinton supports a radical 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States. And that's an increase over President Obama's already high number. [Politifact has rated this \"mostly true\" \u2014 Clinton said during a September 2015 appearance on Face the Nation that she wanted to increase the number of Syrian refugees allowed in to somewhere between 10,000 to 65,000 people. In 2015, the U.S. allowed in about 2,000. So that would be more than a 500 percent increase. \u2014 Jessica Taylor As NPR's Michele Kelemen has recently fact-checked, the high number of refugees that Trump claims the Obama administration is allowing into the country is described as more of a trickle by activists working on behalf of refugees. \u2014 Arnie Seipel] Under her plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth with no way to screen who they are, what they are, what they believe, where they come from. [This repeats a claim that Trump made in his speech right after the Orlando attacks, which was false. There is indeed a lengthy system in place, which begins with the U.N. identifying people as refugees. Their names and fingerprints are then run through criminal and terrorism background checks, and are cross-referenced with classified material. The entire process takes about one to two years. \u2014 Jessica Taylor] Already, hundreds of recent immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorist activity inside the United States. [A 2015 Migration Policy Institute study found that just three resettled refugees had been arrested on terrorism charges, though this depends on the definition of \"refugee\" \u2014 for example, it did not count the Tsarnaev brothers of the Boston Marathon bombing because they had been brought to the U.S. as kids after their parents had been granted asylum. Politifact found that \"about 140 migrants have been charged with or are credibly believed to have been involved in jihadist extremist activity in the United States since the World Trade Center attacks. Some number more \u007f\u2014 up to a maximum of 184 additional individuals \u2014 are children of immigrants.\" Those are incomplete, so it's unclear how large the numbers are. \u2014 Jessica Taylor] The father of the Orlando shooter was a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan, one of the most repressive anti-gay and anti-woman regimes on Earth. [In an interview with CNN, the shooter's father condemned the Taliban, and CNN reported that one of the quotes where it seemed he had sympathized with the terrorist group had been mis-translated. He called these groups \"the enemy of humanity.\" \u2014 Jessica Taylor] I only want to admit people who share our values and love our people. Hillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death. Maybe her motivation lies among the more than 1,000 foreign donations Hillary failed to disclose while at the State Department. Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency of the United States. Thank you. So true. Here is some of really what we learned from the book in addition to what we've already discussed: A foreign telecom giant faced possible State Department sanctions for providing technology to Iran and other oppressive regimes. So, what did this company do? For the first time ever, they decided to pay Bill Clinton $750,000 for a single speech. The Clintons got their cash. The telecom company escaped all sanctions. [Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer alleged a corrupt link between a Bill Clinton speech and a State Department decision. Clinton gave the speech in November 2011, and was paid $750,000 by Swedish telecom company Ericsson. The following week, the State Department said it wouldn't sanction telecom companies doing business with Iran. Schweizer qualified the allegation on MSNBC's Morning Joe, saying, \"Is there evidence of a quid pro quo [a felony] in that case? No, I'm not saying that.\" \u2014 Peter Overby] Hillary Clinton's state department approved the transfer of 20 percent of America's uranium holdings to Russia, while nine investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton foundation \u2014 $145 million. Hillary Clinton appointed a top donor to a national security board with top-secret access, even though he had no national security credentials \u2014 although he did make a very large campaign contribution. Hillary Clinton accepted $58,000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was secretary of state, plus millions more for her foundation. [Clinton accepted the jewelry, but it went to the State Department, as required for gifts worth $350 or more that are presented by foreign governments. (It's in the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution.) Brunei gave between $1 million and $5 million to the foundation. Trump's next two points also refer to foundation money. \u2014 Peter Overby] The sultan of Brunei has pushed oppressive Sharia law, including the punishment by death and stoning if you happen to be gay. The government of Brunei also stands to be one of the biggest beneficiary of Hillary's Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she would absolutely approve if given the chance. Hillary Clinton's book, just think of this \u2014 the book talks about it, but look: Hillary Clinton took $25 million from Saudi Arabia, and much more from others, where being gay is also punishable by death. [Politifact and the Washington Post have reported that the Clinton Foundation took donations from Saudi Arabia and the UAE after Clinton left the State Department. \u2014 Arnie Seipel] Hillary took millions from Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and many other countries that horribly abuse women and the LGBT citizens. [The Clinton Foundation and the administration drew up a memorandum of understanding that Politifact reports stipulated that \"the foundation would seek approval from the State Department's ethics office before accepting donations from new foreign interests that hadn't given in the past, or from past donors who upped their contributions from previous levels.\" Kuwait, Qatar and Oman all were allowed by the terms of that memorandum, per Politifact. \u2014 Arnie Seipel] To cover up her corrupt dealings, Hillary illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server. She's under investigation, but it seems like nothing's going to happen. Even though other people who have done similar things but at a much lower level, their lives have been destroyed. It's a rigged system folks. It's a rigged system. Her server was easily hacked by foreign governments, perhaps even by her financial backers in communist China \u2014 sure they have it \u2014 putting all of America and our citizens in danger, great danger. Then there are the 33,000 emails she deleted. While we may not know what's in those deleted emails, our enemies probably know every single one of them. [The FBI and Justice Department are investigating the security of Clinton's private server but have made no public determination about its legality. The State Department inspector general recently concluded Clinton had not sought permission for the server, and officials would have denied it had she asked. There's no evidence the server has been hacked by foreign governments, although emails contained in the IG report reflect at least two attempts by hackers to infiltrate it. \u2014 Carrie Johnson] So they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be the president of the United States. This fact alone disqualifies her from the presidency. We can't hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies. Can't do it. National security is also immigration security. And Hillary wants neither. Hillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States. She's pledged to grant mass amnesty and, in her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement and ... [Depends on your definition of amnesty. From the Clinton website: \"she will focus enforcement resources on detaining and deporting those individuals who pose a violent threat to public safety, and work to ensure refugees who seek asylum in the U.S. have a fair chance to tell their stories.\" \u2014 Tamara Keith] ... thus create totally open borders for the United States. [Clinton is not calling for totally open borders. From her website: \"As president, Hillary will fight for comprehensive immigration reform that provides a full and equal path to citizenship, treats every person with dignity, upholds the rule of law, protects our borders and national security, and brings millions of hardworking people into the formal economy.\" \u2014 Tamara Keith] Totally open borders. And, by the way, 16,500 border patrol agents have endorsed Donald Trump. First time in the history that they've endorsed a presidential candidate. The first victims of her radical policies will be poor African-American and Hispanic workers who need jobs. They're also the ones that she will hurt the most by far. Let me share with you a letter our campaign received from Mary Anne Mendoza. She lost her amazing son, police Sgt. Brandon Mendoza, after he was killed by an illegal immigrant because of open borders and policies supported by Hillary Clinton. Sadly, the Mendoza family is just one of thousands who have suffered the same fate. Here's an excerpt from Mrs. Mendoza's letter: Hillary Clinton, who already has the blood of so many on her hands, is now announcing that she is willing to put each and every one of our lives in harm's way. An open-door policy to criminals and terrorists to enter our country. Hillary is not concerned about you or I. She's only concerned about the power of the presidency and the power that it would bring. She needs to go to prison to pay for the crimes that she's already committed against our country. That's from Mrs. Mendoza. Hillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to settle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States on top of the current record level of immigration that we already have. [Per the Migration Policy Institute, granting of legal permanent resident status is way down from its peak in the late 1980s. According to Pew, illegal immigration had leveled off as of 2014. And specifically, Mexican immigration fell dramatically from 2009-2014. \u2014 Sarah McCammon] For the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America. Hillary's Wall Street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor, and unemployed Americans totally out of work. She can't claim to care about African-American and Hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new low-wage earners to compete against them and win against them. Because the system is rigged against our people. Here are a few things a Trump administration will do for the Americans, and for the American people, but for our country. No. 1, the first 100 days, I'll appoint judges who will uphold the Constitution of the United States. Hillary Clinton's radical judges will virtually abolish the Second Amendment. Can't let that happen. I will change immigration rules to give unemployed Americans an opportunity to fill good, really good-paying jobs. We don't have good jobs anymore. These will be good-paying jobs. We'll stand up to countries that cheat on trade, of which there are many. We'll cancel rules and regulations that send jobs overseas and everywhere else but our country. We'll lift restrictions on energy production. We will repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare. It is a total disaster. We'll pass massive tax reform to create millions of new jobs and lower taxes for everyone. And we are, by the way, the highest taxed nation in the world. Please remember that. [Not true. Out of 34 OECD countries, the U.S. has the 16th-highest top marginal income tax rate. As a share of GDP, this doesn't stack up, either. U.S. tax revenue equals around 26 percent of the nation's GDP. The OECD average as of 2013 was around 34 percent. If Trump is talking about corporate taxes, he is closer to correct. The U.S. has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world, according to the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning tax policy think tank. As of late 2015, the U.S. had the third-highest top marginal corporate tax rate in the world, behind Chad and the United Arab Emirates (though the UAE has discretion on which businesses pay that tax rate, per the Tax Foundation). \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] We're going to impose tough new ethics rules to restore dignity to the office of the secretary of state. There is one common theme in all of these reforms. It's going to be America first. This is why stakes in November are so great. On Election Day, the politicians stand trial before the people. The voters are the jury. Their ballots are the verdict. We don't need or want another Clinton or Obama. We just can't take it anymore. So bad for our country and our people. Come November, the American people will have a chance to issue a verdict on the politicians that have sacrificed their security, betrayed their prosperity and sold out their country. And I mean totally sold out their country. They will have a chance to vote for a new agenda, with big dreams, bold ideas and enormous possibilities for the American people. Hillary Clinton's message is old and tired. Her message is that things can't change. My message is that things have to change, and that this is our one chance and maybe our only chance to do that change, and if we don't do it now, folks, I don't know that we'll ever, ever have another chance. We have to have change, but real change, not Obama change. Americans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system, that built the great dams and so much more. Then we really started thinking small. Something happened. Something happened to our mentality. We started thinking small. We stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people and other institutions. We lost our sense of purpose and daring. But that's not who we are. Come this November, we can bring America back. Bigger and better and stronger than ever before. We will build the greatest infrastructure on the planet Earth. The roads and railways and airports of tomorrow. Our military -- Our military, which has totally depleted, will have the best technology and the finest equipment. We will bring it back to the way that it must be. Strong, strong, strong. Massive new factories will come roaring into our country, breathing life and hope into our communities. Inner cities, which have been horribly abused by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, will finally, finally, finally be rebuilt. Construction is what I know. I say nobody knows it better. The real wages for our workers have not been raised for 18 years. [Trump appears to be talking about median household income here. As of 2014, it was $53,657, a sizable drop from 1999's $57,843. That 2014 figure is the lowest median household income has been since 1996. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] But these wages will start going up along with new jobs, jobs, jobs. Hillary's massive taxation, regulation and open borders will destroy jobs and drive down wages for everyone. And that's what's been happening. And that's why you're seeing so many people coming to our rallies and so much unbelievable support. We're also going to be supporting our police and law enforcement. We can never forget the great job they do. Thank you. I'm also going to appoint great Supreme Court justices, so important, one of the most important factors in this election. Going to have many appointments. Could be as many as five, could be three, could be four. One of the really big factors in this election, we are going to appoint Supreme Court justices who will be outstanding. Outstanding. So important. Our country is going to start working again. Jobs. People are going to start working again. Parents are going to start dreaming big for their children again, including parents in our inner cities. Americans, Americans, the people that we love, Americans. America first. Make our country great again. Americans are going to start believing in the future of our country. We are going to make America rich again. We are going to make America safe again. We are going to make America great again. And great again for everyone. Everyone. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. I appreciate it.",

            "article_content": "At their annual meeting this week, the Southern Baptist Convention passed resolutions calling for the end of the display of the Confederate battle flag and urged churches to welcome refugees.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: Southern Baptists are one of the most conservative, reliably Republican groups in the country. But at a convention in St. Louis this week, they differed from the presumptive Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump. The Southern Baptist Convention passed a resolution urging churches to welcome refugees. And Baptist leader Russell Moore defended Muslims' right to worship. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RUSSELL MOORE: Sometimes we have really hard decisions to make. This isn't one of those things. What it means to be a Baptist... (APPLAUSE) MOORE: ...Is to support soul freedom for everybody. MCEVERS: And with us now to talk about this is NPR's Sarah McCammon. Hi there. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Hi, Kelly. MCEVERS: So first let's talk about the resolutions on refugees and Muslims. Was this a long time coming, or was this a response to Donald Trump? MCCAMMON: Well, the refugee issue has been brewing for a while. You may remember that last November, in the wake of the Paris attacks when a lot of Republicans were calling for blocking Syrian refugees from entering the country, the National Association of Evangelicals and a lot of other religious groups, including Catholic and Jewish groups, made statements in support of refugees. But this week, in the wake of Orlando, we heard Trump essentially expand on his proposal. He says he would bar anyone from countries with a terrorist presence from coming in. So church groups I've talked to say they're worried about that. A lot of them are active with welcoming refugees, and they don't believe in a religious test for anyone, they say, and note that such a policy would likely bar Christians and other religious minorities fleeing violence along with Muslims. MCEVERS: So has Donald Trump responded to these resolutions from the Southern Baptists? MCCAMMON: No, not directly to the Southern Baptists. But you know, he's often touted his popularity with evangelicals. Evangelicals, Southern Baptists are a really important constituency for a Republican nominee. And this is the kind of issue that's been giving some of them pause and some concern about Donald Trump as their nominee, especially for those faithful churchgoers who vote based on their faith. You know, Trump often lists off pastors and faith leaders who are supporting him, but he's also willing to go after his critics. For example, Russell Moore, who we heard from earlier, has called him a lost soul in need of repentance. Trump fired back at Moore on Twitter last month, calling him a nasty guy with no heart. MCEVERS: The Southern Baptists also came out against the display of the Confederate battle flag. Talk about the politics around that. MCCAMMON: The church has its roots in the South and in the history of segregation. You know, Baptists split apart over the slavery issue before the Civil War. That gave birth to the Southern Baptist Church. They much later apologized for that. But you know, the murders of nine people at an African-American church in Charleston about a year ago touched off a renewed debate over the flag which has been popular in parts of the Deep South. So this year, the Southern Baptist Convention took that up and basically passed language saying that - standing up against, you know - repudiating the display of the flag, quote, \"in solidarity with our African-American brothers and sisters.\" MCEVERS: And the convention also issued a statement about the victims of the Orlando shooting. Did they speak specifically about gay rights? MCCAMMON: No, they did not in that resolution. The church still views marriage as between a man and a woman, something they reaffirmed in another resolution calling for freedom of conscience. This is an idea that many religious groups who oppose same-sex marriage are talking about in the wake of controversies over whether businesses, say, have to bake a cake for a gay wedding. So the Southern Baptist Convention has not changed its theological position on that. Though I will say the outgoing president, Ronnie Floyd, said publicly on the convention floor that, quote, \"an attack against gay Americans in Orlando is an attack against each one of us.\" MCEVERS: That's NPR's Sarah McCammon on the recent Southern Baptist Convention.

            "article_content": "Delegates at prayer during the annual meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention in St. Louis.\n                \n                    \n                    Jeff Roberson/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Delegates at prayer during the annual meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention in St. Louis. Southern Baptists are one of the most reliably Republican religious groups in the U.S. But in a week when the party's presumptive presidential nominee has expanded on his proposal for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, the Southern Baptist Convention is taking a different approach. During the annual meeting of Southern Baptist churches in St. Louis, participants weighed in on a variety of hot-button issues, among them the controversy over refugee resettlement. Participants voted to approve a resolution urging Southern Baptist churches and families to welcome refugees, affirming \"that refugees are people loved by God, made in His image, and that Christian love should be extended to them as special objects of God's mercy in a world that has displaced them from their homelands.\" The resolution also called on the government to \"implement the strictest security measures possible\" in screening refugees applying to enter the country. A History Of Welcoming Refugees It's not the first time conservative Christians have weighed in on the issue. Last November, the National Association of Evangelicals called on believers to welcome Syrian refugees. That came in the aftermath of the Paris attacks as many elected officials \u2014 mostly Republicans \u2014 called for a halt to immigration of those refugees. Matthew Soerens of the evangelical refugee resettlement group World Relief praised the move, noting that churchgoers of many religious denominations are eager to aid refugees, and are \"strongly opposed to governmental efforts that would block their ability to be a part of this sort of ministry.\" Soerens says Donald Trump's proposal to bar immigration from countries with a \"proven history of terrorism\" would likely keep out Christians and other religious minorities as well. \"Trump's proposal would close the doors of our country to persecuted individuals of all backgrounds from these countries, presumably, and local churches do not want to be a part of turning our backs on the persecuted church,\" Soerens wrote in an email to NPR. Affirming Religious Freedom For Muslims The question of religious freedom \u2014 and how it should apply to Muslims \u2014 was also part of the discussion at the convention. At one point, John Wofford, a pastor from Arkansas, stood up to ask why a Southern Baptist should support the right of Muslims living in the United States to build mosques when, as Wofford put it, \"these people threaten our very way of existence as Christians and Americans?\" Russell Moore of the Southern Baptist Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission responded unequivocally: \"Sometimes we have to deal with questions that are really complicated,\" Moore said. \"This isn't one of those things.\" As the crowd applauded, Moore cautioned Southern Baptists that religious freedom has to be for everyone. \"When you have a government that says we can decide whether or not a house of worship can be constructed based upon the theological beliefs of that house of worship,\" Moore said, \"then there are going to be Southern Baptist churches in San Francisco and New York and throughout this country who are not going to be able to build.\" Orlando, LGBT Rights And Southern Baptists The convention also passed a resolution mourning the victims of this week's mass shooting at an Orlando gay nightclub, and calling on church members to pray, donate blood and offer other forms of support. Some critics noted, however, that the Orlando resolution made no mention of LGBT rights or the fact that many of the victims appear to have been targeted because of their sexuality. The constitution of the Southern Baptist Convention explicitly states that churches that \"affirm, approve, or endorse homosexual behavior\" are not \"in cooperation\" with the organization as a whole, and the organization has repeatedly passed resolutions condemning homosexuality. This year, a new resolution reiterated the belief that marriage is \"between one man and one woman.\" While the resolution didn't mention gay and lesbian victims, outgoing SBC President Ronnie Floyd said in an address to attendees that an \"attack against gay Americans in Orlando is an attack against each one of us,\" adding that Christians should oppose violence and bigotry against \"anyone in this world,\" according to minutes kept by Baptist Press. Calling For An End To The Display Of The Confederate Battle Flag Southern Baptists also weighed in on another emotional issue at the intersection of race, religion and violence. Almost exactly a year after the murder of nine people at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., set off a debate over the Confederate battle flag, the Southern Baptist Convention approved a resolution calling on \"our brothers and sisters in Christ to discontinue the display of the Confederate battle flag as a sign of solidarity with the whole Body of Christ, including our African-American brothers and sisters.\" That's notable for a church that has its roots in the history of racial segregation in the Deep South and, in 1995, apologized for its past position on slavery. During the debate over the wording of the resolution, Pastor James Merritt of Cross Pointe Church in Duluth, Ga., delivered an emotional speech calling for the removal of language stating that for some, the display of the flag serves not as a \"symbol of hatred, bigotry and racism, but as a memorial to loved ones who died in the Civil War.\" \"I am the great-great-grandson of two men who fought in the Confederate army,\" Merritt told the convention. \"I cannot undo what they fought for. But they cannot undo what I wish they had done, and what I pray we will do today.\" The language was stricken. Baptist Press reported that the resolution passed by a \"wide margin.\"",

Responding to the Orlando shootings in a New Hampshire speech Monday, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump used the appearance to expand on his previous call to temporarily ban all Muslims from immigrating to the United States. \"The only reason the killer was in America in the first place is because we allowed his family to come here,\" Trump said. \"That is a fact, and a fact we need to talk about.\" That policy proposal, one of the main planks of Trump's campaign, would not have stopped Omar Mateen, the man allegedly responsible for the deadliest mass shooting in United States history. Mateen was born in New York City and was a U.S. citizen. Trump's proposed temporary ban on Muslim immigration would also have not affected one of the two perpetrators of the December 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino. Syed Farook was born in the United States, although his wife, Tashfeen Malik, was born in Pakistan. \"I called for a ban after San Bernardino and it was met with great scorn and anger,\" Trump said, before appearing to change the terms of his proposal. \"When I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe, or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats.\" Trump also criticized \"Muslim communities,\" as he put it, for failing to tell law enforcement agencies about potential terrorist threats. \"They have to work with us,\" Trump said. \"They know what's going on. They know that [Mateen] was bad. They knew the people in San Bernardino were bad. But you know what, they didn't turn them in. and we had death and destruction.\" Trump's speech came shortly after his fall opponent, presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, delivered her own address responding to the Orlando shootings. In her speech Clinton did not name Trump himself but spoke out against \"inflammatory anti-Muslim rhetoric.\" Referencing the days after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Clinton recalled President George W. Bush's visit to a Muslim community center. \"To anyone who wanted to take out their anger on our Muslim neighbors and fellow citizens, he said, that would not and should not stand in America.\" \"It is time to get back to the spirit of those days,\" Clinton said. Trump repeatedly criticized existing immigration policies as dangerous and ineffective. \"Our government has been admitting ever-growing numbers [of Middle Eastern immigrants], year after year, without any effective plan for our security.\" Trump said that allowing more Syrian refugees to enter the United States \"could be a better, bigger version of the legendary Trojan horse.\" In fact, as NPR reported in the wake of last year's Paris terrorist attacks, screening for refugees is a lengthy process that can take up to two years to complete.",

Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton both delivered speeches in Washington on Friday aimed at firing up their political bases that they'll need to win come November. But in a speech to a major evangelical confab, many Republicans still seemed skeptical of their presumptive nominee, while Democrats at a Planned Parenthood gathering were fired up about theirs. Trump Tries To Reassure The Faithful Trump addressed the Faith and Freedom Coalition's annual \"Road to the Majority\" conference \u2014 a group of social conservatives, many of whom remain skeptical of the authenticity of Trump's conversion to their side. He boasted that he had done well with \"the evangelicals\" and \"religions generally speaking\" in the primaries. While exit polls showed Trump did win over many self-described evangelical voters, he did much poorer with weekly churchgoers. And talking about his own faith is something Trump has never been comfortable with \u2014 flubbing Bible verses and saying he's never asked God for forgiveness. He largely eschewed talking about his own faith in Friday's speech. He began by bragging about his past speeches to the group and listing off preachers who were supporting his bid, which got a tepid response. Trump joked that he was Presbyterian, while many in the audience were not. \"I think there are three of you out there,\" he said. The speech was more succinct and restrained than the free-flowing, wide-ranging speeches that have become the norm for Trump in this campaign. For the second time this week, he was reading from prepared remarks on a teleprompter. The twice-divorced billionaire, who was once pro-abortion rights, told the crowd he was going to discuss \"our shared values\" on faith, marriage and life. His main argument to persuade these voters was that he would fill the federal bench with \"highly, highly respected judges.\" He assured the audience that the judges \"were all pro-life.\" But it wasn't until he began attacking Clinton that the crowd seemed to really get behind him. \"Hillary Clinton won't even say 'Radical Islam,'\" Trump said. \"She wants a 500 percent increase in refugees from Syria.\" Then Trump was interrupted multiple times by Code Pink protesters. \"Amazing what goes on,\" Trump said, visibly holding back from harshly criticizing like in several large campaign rallies during the primary. He went on to say he had a \"freedom of speech\" and called them \"very rude, but what are you going to do? ... Thank you, darling. ... very sad.\" He ticked off Clinton's sins \u2014 her private email server, potential conflicts at the Clinton Foundation, her record as secretary of state, taking Wall Street money for speeches and that \"she wants to raise your taxes bigly, folks. big-ly.\" He argued that her economic policies would \"plunge our inner cities into even deeper poverty, if that's possible.\" And after a week in which he was chastised by many within his own party for singling out the presiding judge in a Trump University fraud case for his Hispanic heritage, which Trump said made him biased because of the Mexico border wall he wants to build, Trump told the gathering, \"Freedom of any kind means no one should be judged by their race or their color or the color of their skin.\" On the issues of religious freedom, though, Trump promised to \"respect and defend Christian Americans.\" \"We will work together to rebuild and restore and lift up everyone,\" Trump said. \"Not a certain group, everyone, the whole country we're going to lift up.\" Trump has proposed a temporary ban on Muslims coming into the country given terrorism concerns \u2014 which many evangelical leaders have condemned, saying it runs counter to the religious freedoms the country was founded upon. He expounded on that in his speech, saying that the U.S. still has to \"temporarily stop this whole thing that's going on with refugees\" fleeing Syria. \"We don't know where they come from, but we have to take a rest,\" Trump said. \"We have to take a timeout. We have to use the money to take care of our poorest Americans and work with them, so they can come out of this horrible situation that they're in.\" Trump closed off a morning of speeches by other politicians and faith leaders, and many still seemed uncomfortable with the idea of Trump as their nominee. Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, who ran against Trump in the primaries, didn't mention Trump once in her speech, which came before him, and instead talked about down-ballot contests. Concerned Women for America CEO Penny Young Nance, whose group was one of the co-sponsors of the conference, told NPR's Morning Edition that she backs Trump over Clinton, but the question was just how hard she and other like-minded supporters would work to get him elected. \"He has my vote, but will I work to turn out our members? Are we going to put our babies in strollers and go door to door for him?\" Nance wondered. \"He's got to win our hearts to get us to do that.\" Clinton Fires Up Supporters Of Planned Parenthood Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton arrives for a Planned Parenthood Action Fund membership event Friday in Washington.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Brandon/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton arrives for a Planned Parenthood Action Fund membership event Friday in Washington. In sharp contrast to Trump, Clinton had won over the hearts of the crowd at Planned Parenthood Action Fund before she even stepped onstage. The group's president, Cecile Richards, introduced her as \"our friend. She's a fighter. She's our leader, and she's going to be the next president of the United States.\" The love was mutual \u2014 Clinton addressed the organization as \"family\" and thanked supporters for \"being there for women no matter their race, sexual orientation or immigration status ... being there for every woman, in every state, who has to miss work, drive hundreds of miles sometimes ... to exercise her constitutional right to safe and legal abortion.\" Planned Parenthood has faced controversy because it provides abortion services in some of its clinics. The Republican National Committee was sharply critical of Clinton's speech, saying, \"Just days into the general election, Hillary Clinton is already touting a radical agenda\" and said her support for the group \"is totally out of line with many Americans' beliefs and denies our Founders' vision of an unalienable right to life for all.\" Clinton praised the organization's work on providing birth control and breast-cancer screenings. And she called for greater federal funding for Planned Parenthood, something Republicans have tried to cut. Clinton also pledged to strengthen Obamacare \u2014 another controversial subject for conservatives \u2014 and called for increased funding for long-term birth control. Clinton told the crowd that, as president, she would \"always have your back.\" Calling women's access to reproductive health services \"under attack,\" she made it very clear who she believes is perpetuating those attacks: Donald Trump and other Republicans. Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" would actually mean \"taking the country backward\" on women's and reproductive health, she said \u2014 a line she used earlier in the week on more general issues. \"We are not going to let Donald Trump or anyone else turn back the clock,\" Clinton said. She also called out Trump's comments \u2014 which he later walked back \u2014 that women should be punished for having an abortion. \"Instead of working to continue the progress we've made, Republicans, led by Donald Trump, are working to reverse it,\" she charged. \"Well, Donald, those days are over.\" That was met with raucous cheers.",

            "article_content": "Election officials in Austria say mail-in ballots being counted on Monday will help to determine the race. The election could produce Austria's first far-right president since World War II.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Let's turn to an election in Europe that has brought a presidential candidate who talks tough on immigration and Muslims to the cusp of victory. Austrians voted for a new president yesterday. But there's still no winner. Nearly all the votes have been counted, and there's an even split right now between a far-right populist and a left-leaning independent who says immigration helps the economy. The results are being watched very closely across Europe where the migration crisis has upended establishment politicians. Reporter Joanna Kakissis is on the line now from Vienna. Joanna, good morning. JOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: So let's get this straight. Austria is a parliamentary democracy. The presidency there, I mean, normally seen as mostly a ceremonial post. So why are people watching this election so closely? KAKISSIS: You know, well, Austria is just one of a string of European countries where a far-right anti-immigrant party is gaining momentum. Ninety thousand migrants applied for asylum in Austria last year. All these migrants and refugees arriving in such a short time led to this backlash against the government that allowed this to happen. So, you know, in the first round of the Austrian presidential vote last month, the two candidates from the ruling government coalition were eliminated. And the man who got the most votes was Norbert Hofer from the far-right Freedom Party. He has said, and I quote, \"we have to stop this invasion of Muslims.\" And half of Austrians voted for him yesterday. If Hofer is elected, he would be the first European Union head of state from a far-right party. And this carries very special symbolism in Austria because of the Nazi past here. GREENE: Well, you mention all these migrants applying for asylum. I mean, is the refugee situation - I mean, is that really what has led to his political rise? KAKISSIS: Yes, in part. I mean, the arrival of so many refugees is a big reason because the party has often evoked a German phrase ueberfremdung, which means, roughly, being overtaken by strangers. And Freedom Party voters - I interviewed several of them at the polls yesterday - they told me that migrants are taking social welfare benefits intended for Austrians or that migrants are attacking them. Here's how one Freedom Party member - her name is Katharina Wurzner - here's how she sees things. KATHARINA WURZNER: There was a woman raped two weeks ago just going on the toilet in the metro station, yeah. And it was an immigrant, very young. There was a woman in Vienna also killed by migration people from Kenya. KAKISSIS: Now the crime rate hasn't increased overall. But there has been media coverage of a spate of recent attacks by migrants against women. So yes, there is this sense that strangers are literally overpowering you. GREENE: All right. So we have this candidate who, I mean, is certainly responding to some of that anger, on the cusp of victory. I mean, does he have a real shot here? What are the - what's the latest with the vote count? KAKISSIS: So Austria's interior ministry is saying Hofer is in the lead right now with nearly 52 percent of the vote. And his opponent, former Green Party leader Alexander Van der Bellen - he has about 48 percent. But what we're waiting for today are the absentee ballots. And those account for about 14 percent of eligible voters. GREENE: And Joanna, I mean, while this could be very important symbolically, is it largely symbolism? I mean, would Hofer actually have power in this role as president? KAKISSIS: That's a good question because the Austrian president actually does have the power to dissolve Parliament and trigger new elections, although no Austrian president has actually ever done it. But Hofer has said that if he's elected, he would do this. And opinion polls are suggesting that if parliamentary elections were held today, Hofer's Freedom Party would win. GREENE: All right, Joanna Kakissis reporting on the Austrian elections from Vienna. Joanna, thanks as always. KAKISSIS: You're welcome, David. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Voters in Austria totally rejected the mainstream parties in the first round of presidential elections, so the two candidates in Sunday's runoff are from the political fringe, including one from the far right.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: In Austria, a populist far-right candidate could win Sunday's presidential runoff thanks to his blunt talk against immigrants and Muslims. The Austrian presidency is largely a ceremonial post, but the vote is getting a lot of attention. It could be the first significant victory for the far-right parties that have been growing stronger in Europe. Joanna Kakissis sent this report from Vienna. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ALEXANDER VAN DER BELLEN: (Foreign language spoken). NORBERT HOFER: (Foreign language spoken). JOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: The debate was tense, and the two candidates could not be more different - on one side, Alexander Van der Bellen, a retired economics professor with wiry gray hair and a cigarette-cured voice. He used to chair for the leftist Green party - on the other side, the man interrupting him - Norbert Hofer of Austria's Freedom Party, a career politician who trained as an airplane mechanic. He sometimes wears a blue cornflower on his lapel, a symbol once favored by Austrian Nazis. Hofer says he wants to secure Austria's southern borders, stop the Muslim invasion and shake up the European Union. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HOFER: (Foreign language spoken). KAKISSIS: \"I don't need Europeans to vote for me,\" he declares. \"I need Austrians.\" FRITZ STEIN: Mr. Hofer is No. 1 for Austria, and Austrian people for Mr. Hofer, number one. KAKISSIS: That's businessman Fritz Stein. He's drinking a beer at a boisterous pro-Hofer rally in a working-class neighborhood in South Vienna. He says moderate politicians only care about foreigners. STEIN: (Foreign language spoken). KAKISSIS: \"They would give lots of welfare money to an Afghan family,\" he says, \"not an Austrian family.\" Also at the rally is waitress Karin Schwartz, who says Austria has admitted too many migrants - 90,000 last year. KARIN SCHWARTZ: (Foreign language spoken). KAKISSIS: \"We don't need any more Muslims,\" she says. \"They cause problems. We only want Christians.\" UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing in foreign language). KAKISSIS: The night before, at a much smaller anti-Hofer rally, Van der Bellen supporters sang about solidarity and waved posters supporting refugees. Van der Bellen is a child of refugees. His parents fled the Soviet occupation of Estonia. VAN DER BELLEN: (Foreign language spoken). KAKISSIS: He says immigrants help a country's economy. Just look through Vienna's phonebook, he says, and you will find many successful immigrant businesses. That's one reason why the bohemian neighborhood of Neubau in central Vienna strongly backed Van der Bellen in the first round of the presidential election last month. Ursula Berner, a publisher and longtime Green party supporter, stops by a cafe where volunteers offer free German lessons to refugees. She says that besides railing against immigrants, Hofer has won support by playing the antiestablishment card like other national politicians across Europe. URSULA BERNER: (Through interpreter) I'm worried about radicalization in Europe. Look at what's happening in Poland and Hungary or with the rise of Marine Le Pen in France. We don't need another politician in Europe who divides us by blaming everything on an outside enemy. That could kill the European Union. KAKISSIS: Polls show a tight race, but Hofer is already acting like he's won. He threatens to dissolve Parliament if the government, a coalition of long-ruling establishment parties, does not deal with migrants and the economy within six months.

Be confident in your blackness,\" President Barack Obama told graduates and their families at Howard University's 2016 Commencement Ceremony. It was one of many moments in a speech that honored the achievements of black folks \u2014 many Howard alumni \u2014 and called on graduates to get and stay politically active. His speech was met with laughter, generous applause, and largely positive reviews. Paul Holston, editor-in-chief of Howard's student newspaper The Hilltop, wrote that Obama's address was \"strong, eloquent, and inspirational,\" and would \"go down as one of the most significant moments in Howard University's history.\" Howard students weren't the only ones cheering over the speech. Janell Ross at The Washington Post lauded Obama's call for \"empathy and [an] expanded moral imagination\" as one of the few surprising and thought-provoking messages that graduates will receive this season. On Twitter, Slate writer Jamelle Bouie called the speech \"a great mediation on democracy AND a celebration of black life.\" Mathew Rodriguez at Mic described Obama's speech as \"one of the best and blackest he's given.\" Melissa Harris-Perry, editor-at-large of Elle, wrote that Obama's speech was remarkable in its treatment of gender as well as race, and proved \"that he is our most black, feminist president to date\" by highlighting the genius of black women like Lorraine Hansberry, Harriet Tubman, Fannie Lou Hamer and Zora Neale Hurston: \"Once again, [Obama] put black women at the very center of the stories he told and the lessons he imparted. As he warmed up, he jokingly referred to 'Shonda Rhimes owning Thursday night' and 'Beyonce running the world.' They were casual references, not central themes of his talk, but even here he deployed two boss black women as representatives of black excellence and achievement.\" The tone surprised some African-Americans who had been critical of what they see as the president's habit of talking down to primarily black crowds. The last time Obama spoke at an HBCU's commencement was at Morehouse College in 2013, where he was criticized for promoting a finger-wagging brand of respectability politics with remarks like these: \"Just as Morehouse has taught you to expect more of yourselves, inspire those who look up to you to expect more of themselves. We know that too many young men in our community continue to make bad choices. And I have to say, growing up, I made quite a few myself. Sometimes I wrote off my own failings as just another example of the world trying to keep a black man down. I had a tendency sometimes to make excuses for me not doing the right thing. But one of the things that all of you have learned over the last four years is there's no longer any room for excuses.\" Ta-Nehisi Coates responded to that speech by calling out what he saw as the double standard Obama used in addressing African-Americans. In a piece called \"How the Obama Administration Talks to Black America,\" Coates wrote that the president acts like someone \"who sees holding African Americans to a standard of individual responsibility as part of his job. This is not a role Barack Obama undertakes with other communities.\" Some observers who were worried that the president might affect the same scolding posture at Howard were pleased, if not entirely won over. Michael P. Jeffries, over at The Boston Globe, said that the Howard speech was more earnest in its depiction of structural inequality: \"...noting that a black woman is only paid 66 cents for every $1 earned by an equally qualified white man, and that mass incarceration has exploded since [Obama's] college days. In one striking passage, he reminded the audience: 'We have cousins and uncles and brothers and sisters who we remember were just as smart and just as talented as we were, but somehow got ground down by structures that are unfair and unjust.' Rather than individual failings, Obama shifted responsibility away from black families and toward the institutions that produce black suffering.\" Still, Jeffries observes \"how much further [Obama] has to go\" to fairly depict race in America. In his speech, Obama praises Black Lives Matter activist Brittany Packnett as someone who broke with the orthodoxy of her movement to enact change. But, according to Jeffries: \"What Obama left out is that Packnett is not an anomaly among Black Lives Matter leadership. Protesters have interrupted campaign events for Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Donald Trump, but activist DeRay McKesson certainly believes in voting: He ran for mayor of Baltimore. The Chicago-based Black Youth Project has protested mayor Rahm Emanuel and held rallies in the name of Rekia Boyd and other victims of police violence. The organization has also published research reports, and its directors have worked with several well established and likeminded groups, including the NAACP. So, in many respects, Black Lives Matter is already living out the charge put forth by the president.\" Clarence B. Jones, at HuffPost Black Voices, wrote that \"the content of what President Obama said, and the way in which he spoke it were engaging; at times, powerfully moving.\" But he agreed with Jeffries's sentiment that the president undersold the accomplishments of the BLM movement when he chastised young people for not turning out to vote in midterm elections: \"It is not enough to patronizingly lecture that 'the perfect' 'should not be the enemy of the good or the better.' He should have not just singled out Brittany Packnett, a leader in the Black Lives Matter Movement, for praise in meeting with him and other establishment political leaders. He should have said, flat out, like 'Straight Outta Compton,' that leaders of the Movement, like Dr. King earlier, had forced America's conscience to confront the reality of successive police shootings of black men, in several circumstances where the use of non-lethal force appeared to be an available option to effect an arrest. In effect, President Obama should have acknowledged that he AND ALL America owe a debt of gratitude to the courage and leadership of the Black Lives Matter movement in highlighting the apparent systemic racism in our criminal justice system when applied to African-Americans in several or our communities, nationwide.\" BLM activists themselves had some things to say about Obama's speech. DeRay McKesson tweeted his approval of the president's remarks, but also warned about oversimplifying the message: \"Obama's commencement speech at HowardU today was important, as we both reflected on the past in blackness and our future. Obama's speech was complicated, as he noted the role of compromise in the work of progress, while maintains a commitment to one's values. Obama also rightly noted that awareness is not the win, but is the initial work that creates space for later wins. [He] also noted the work of activists like [Brittany Packnett], noting that we will have to be intentional in how we change systems/structures. In many ways, this speech echoed themes he offered when [she and I] met with him a month ago. He is becoming more explicit re: discussing blackness.\" McKesson continued: \"We protest to change the world, not to continue protesting until the end of time. Awareness must lead to work focused on concrete solutions. Obama's focus on voting was not an indictment of the movement, of protest, or of organizing. Don't reduce his speech to this stale reading.\" Still, others weren't blown away by the speech. Maya Rhodan at Time magazine described Obama's Howard speech as another replica from the \"mold he often leans on in remarks to black audiences.\" She offered up the president's time-tested speech recipe: \"a nod to our nation's racial history, a pit-stop on his presidency, and a call to pay it forward.\" Over at The Guardian, Steven W. Thrasher reflected that \"part of Obama's genius as our first black president is that he can provoke so many responses...even in the course of a single speech.\" But that genius is complicated. Thrasher was inspired by Obama's address until \"respectability politics started to creep in,\" and the president began urging the crowd to empathize with \"the refugee, the immigrant, the rural poor, the transgender person and yes, the middle-aged white guy who you may think has all the advantages, but over the last several decades has seen his world upended by economic and cultural and technological change and feels powerless to stop it.\" Here's more from Thrasher: \"Why did the nation's first black president feel the need to equate the transgender person who can't use the bathroom in North Carolina, and the unfairly maligned immigrant with that 'middle-aged white guy'? Who feels so threatened by the 'cultural' change of living under a black president and living under conditions a little more like those black Americans have endured for hundreds of years that he's likely voting for Donald Trump? Who isn't losing all of his white privilege, because he still has a black president telling black grads to get in his head?

The next presidential primary battle has arrived in a state with one of the country's largest Asian populations. A bulk of New York's more than 903,000 eligible Asian-American voters lives in New York City, where 24-year-old Brenda Nguyen has been going door to door for the Bernie Sanders campaign in Sunset Park, a Brooklyn neighborhood with a growing Chinese-American community. Nguyen can't vote herself on Tuesday. Like two of Donald Trump's children, she missed the Oct. 9 deadline to update her voter registration and enroll with a party before New York's closed primary. But she says she's still talking up the primary in her neighborhood with as many voters as she can \u2014 everyone except her father. \"It's a very sad moment when you realize your dad is going to vote for Donald Trump,\" said Nguyen, whose father is a former refugee from Vietnam \u2014 and technically can't vote in the Republican primary, because he, too, didn't register with the party in time. As for other Asian-American voters, Nguyen said she hadn't gotten very far with many of them either. \"They're like, 'Oh, I'm not going to vote.' I'm like, 'But why?'\" she said with a long sigh, gesturing to a nearby polling site. \"It's, like, right there. You have no reason not to just stop in, cast your vote and get out.\" 'Can't Sit At Home And Not Participate' Getting Asian-Americans to the polls is a challenge not only in New York but also around the country. The fastest growing racial group in the U.S. is also among the least likely to vote. \"We just can't sit at home and not participate,\" said Moumita Ahmed, 26, another volunteer for the Sanders campaign. She recently worked at a phone bank in Jamaica, Queens, where volunteers targeted Muslim voters with calls in Bengali and English. Hoshneara Begum (left) and other volunteers with the Bangladeshi American Advocacy Group held a phone bank for the Bernie Sanders campaign in Jamaica, N.Y.\n                \n                    \n                    Hansi Lo Wang/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Hoshneara Begum (left) and other volunteers with the Bangladeshi American Advocacy Group held a phone bank for the Bernie Sanders campaign in Jamaica, N.Y. \"I have to make sure I let them know that this election is important, that it is really crucial that they come out,\" she said. \"We have a front-runner who's talking about banning Muslims.\" That may drive more Asian-Americans to vote. But Jerry Vattamala, who runs the country's largest exit poll of Asian-American voters for the Asian-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, said they'll need to clear a major hurdle in New York, where only registered party members can vote in the closed primary. \"Chinese-Americans, almost half in New York, are not registered in any party,\" he explained. \"They're basically shut out from the primary process.\" So are many other ethnic groups. Although the Asian-American vote has been shifting toward Democrats, 51 percent of Asian-Americans choose to not identify as Democrat or Republican, according to a 2012 national survey. Vattamala said many Asian-American voters don't feel bound to a political party. \"They tend to look more at the issues of a specific race and where candidates and parties fall on those issues,\" he added. Newly registered voters may not want to commit to a party immediately. \"It's a learning process for our first-, second-generational people,\" said Kamal Bhuiyan, chairman of the Bangladeshi American Advocacy Group in New York City. 'Unprecedented Outreach' Still, this election season has not been your average presidential race: Democrats and the Republicans are heading into the New York primary without presumptive nominees. \"It's going to be close, and I think the candidates know that. That's why they have this sort of unprecedented outreach to communities like the Asian-American community,\" said Vattamala, who added that the ethnic diversity of New York's voters makes the state an ideal testing ground for ways to reach Asian-American voters elsewhere in the U.S. Another one of New York City's growing Chinatowns in Flushing, Queens, got a taste of that recently during a Hillary Clinton campaign rally. It was held at a Chinese banquet hall inside a mall with a South Korean chain bakery and a food court serving dim sum, ramen and bubble tea. Former figure skater Michelle Kwan, a daughter of immigrants from Hong Kong, played host. Attendees of a Hillary Clinton campaign rally raise their smartphones to take photos of former President Bill Clinton inside a Chinese banquet hall in Flushing, N.Y.\n                \n                    \n                    Hansi Lo Wang/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Attendees of a Hillary Clinton campaign rally raise their smartphones to take photos of former President Bill Clinton inside a Chinese banquet hall in Flushing, N.Y. \"Let's give President Bill Clinton a good Queens welcome!\" exclaimed Democratic Congresswoman Grace Meng \u2014 the first Asian-American from New York elected to Congress \u2014 as she introduced Clinton to an adoring crowd armed with selfie-ready smartphones and tablets. \"Your community has been great for America. It's been a blessing of hard work and family values and lifting up,\" said Clinton before addressing the backlog of family visa applications by relatives waiting to be reunited with their families in the U.S. His audience ranged from native English speakers with law degrees to retired, Cantonese-speaking garment workers \u2014 most of whom pledged to Hillary Clinton. Some still-undecided voters stood along the fringes of the room. \"Asian-Americans tend to vote more traditionally,\" said 65-year-old Joe Gong, a retired telecom manager who added that Hillary Clinton is \"more traditional\" than Sanders, whom some Asian-Americans may see as \"more left of center.\" For Gong, who said he's voting for Clinton, it was a hard choice. But that was not the case for Catherine Xie, 22, an MBA student from Long Island. \"It was so easy, because he just makes sense to me,\" said the Sanders supporter, as she waited outside the banquet hall after the event. So far, she's the only one \"feeling the Bern\" in her family. She is disappointed that her parents have been focusing more on news from China than on the U.S. presidential race. \"We're living here,\" she said, \"so we should be more focused on the politics here\" \u2014 where campaigns are trying to draw in more Asian-American voters like her.",

Sanders went to Rome to attend a conference sponsored by the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences. Bernie-mania hit Vatican City today with a crush of Italian media, cameras, boom microphones, shouting reporters and a ring of civilians, smartphones held aloft, chanting \"Bernie, Bernie, Bernie!\" Sanders was not there to meet with Pope Francis, who is on the road himself visiting a refugee camp in Greece. The Democratic hopeful had accepted an invitation from the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences to speak at a conference on social and economic justice. Speaking to reporters at the Vatican, Sanders noted that he had a choice, given the timing of the event \u2014 stay in New York in advance of the state's big delegate-rich presidential primary vote, or head to Europe. \"I know it's taken me away from the campaign trail for a day,\" he said. \"But when I received this invitation, it was so moving\" that he felt compelled to come. The Vermont senator boarded a charter flight \u2014 along with staff and his traveling press corps \u2014 after the Democratic presidential debate in Brooklyn and flew overnight to Rome, arriving early afternoon local time. No surprise that Sanders' message in Italy was the same as it has been in speeches from Iowa and New Hampshire to Wisconsin and now New York state. At a press conference, Sanders spoke of a world where \"people are so much more concerned about their own billions than they are about our children and the future of our planet.\" \"We have to ingrain moral principles into our economy that serve more than those who are at the top,\" he said. And while meeting Pope Francis was never on Sanders' schedule for this round-trip red-eye visit to the Vatican, the senator was quick to praise the pope's agenda and in the process make it clear that on these big economic issues, the two are kindred spirits. \"I have been enormously impressed by Pope Francis speaking out, and his visionary views about creating a moral economy, an economy that works for all people, not just the people on top,\" Sanders said. The images of the warm greeting the candidate received at the Vatican, along with the swarms of cameras and reporters as he emerged from the conference, are certainly a positive for the Sanders campaign. While there are many Catholic Democratic voters in New York, Pennsylvania and Maryland, which all hold primaries in the coming weeks, it's not clear whether Sanders' visit to Rome will hold much electoral impact. Still, the conference was on a subject Sanders has built his entire run for the White House around. The downside may be the time spent away from New York just four days before the state's primary. There are rallies he could be holding, hands he could be shaking, and voters he could be inspiring as the clock ticks down. Polls show him trailing Clinton in the Empire State by double digits.",

There are some weeks in which there is so much news about death, loss, and cruelty that you are happy to find a story that can remind you in unexpected ways about life and kindness. Stefan Jagsch, who is a local leader of Germany's far-right NPD party, is reported to be recovering after a car crash near B\u00fcdingen. The NPD won a little over 10 percent of the vote in that municipality in state elections this month. The party has campaigned against opening Germany to the more than a million people who have sought asylum in the country, mostly from Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan. Stefan Jagsch took part in a neo-Nazi march in January, where immigrants were assailed as \"benefit-scrounging tourists,\" \"invaders,\" and \"lawless primates.\" Chancellor Angela Merkel has called the NPD \"anti-democratic, xenophobic, ant-Semitic, and anti-constitutional.\" Earlier this month, Stefan Jagsch was driving when he lost control of his car and crashed into a tree. The local fire brigade says that passengers in a mini-bus driving along the road saw his crumpled automobile and stopped. Two people got out of the bus and pulled Stefan Jagsch from the wreckage of his car; they began to give him emergency first aid. An ambulance arrived, and the two men assured emergency workers that the man they had rescued from a smoldering wreck had been wearing his seat belt in the car. The ambulance then took Stefan Jagsch to the hospital. Who were the strangers who stopped to help a man they didn't know? According to press reports, the people in the van were Syrian refugees. They left before police could arrive, perhaps because they did not want to tell authorities who they were, or how they had gotten into Germany. This is a nice, even inspiring story, but it doesn't have storybook ending. The head of the local NPD called the rescue of his party's candidate, \"apparently a very good, humane act.\" But he didn't indicate that their humane act had changed his party's view of refugees as \"lawless primates.\" Stefan Jagsch insisted this week on his Facebook page that he was unconscious when he was saved. He gave thanks to \"all the people who were on the spot to help me,\" but didn't mention who they were, much less suggest that their kindness caused him to question his feelings about refugees. His post appears to have been taken down. It is hard for politicians to ever change the views that get them a following. But perhaps a few more citizens may hear the story and see people they had dismissed with a few hateful phrases as people who would help them, too.",

            "article_content": "Germany is determined to dissuade more asylum seekers from coming there, but a new law its parliament passed last month targets an especially vulnerable group: children.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Germany allowed more than a million migrants into the country last year, but anti-immigration sentiment is growing. Earlier today, the party of German Chancellor Angela Merkel was significantly weakened in regional elections in three states because of her pro-immigration stance. Meanwhile, the German parliament is trying to made the country less attractive to asylum-seekers. A new law would delay family reunification for some recent arrivals, and that law has a particular impact on children who make the dangerous trek to Germany on their own. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reports from Berlin. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Zara Hussein looks right at home at this Berlin high school with his gelled hair and faded jeans. ZARA HUSSEIN: (Speaking German). NELSON: He's 16 and rather shy, not what you'd expect from a kid who managed to sneak across a half-dozen borders and travel 2,000 miles to escape the war in Syria. Zara is one of more than 60,000 minors seeking asylum who arrived in Germany on their own, a number that's climbed exponentially in recent years according to refugee advocates. HUSSEIN: (Speaking foreign language). NELSON: He says he was 14 when he fled northeastern Syria after the Kurdish YPG army tried to forcibly draft him. An uncle helped him scale a border fence in the middle of the night into Turkey. But even there, his family felt he wasn't safe, so his older brother arranged for smugglers to take Zara to Europe. HUSSEIN: (Speaking foreign language). NELSON: Zara says he anxiously waited in an Istanbul hotel for the smugglers, who had arranged for a plane ticket to Belgrade and a fake Turkish passport with the Serbian visa. From Serbia, Zara says he was driven to another country - he isn't sure which one - from where he and three other teenagers sprinted 20 minutes across an uncontrolled border into Germany. HUSSEIN: (Speaking foreign language). NELSON: He says he was scared out of his wits the entire time, and his only comfort was the thought of someday reuniting with his parents and little brother in Germany. But that reunion is now in jeopardy. A new law delays certain refugees from bringing their families to Germany for at least two years, and that can also apply to minors. Stephan Mayer is an MP with the ruling coalition that passed the law. He believes the new measure actually protects children. STEPHEN MAYER: We have the impression that there is a business model to send first the children and, if they have the possibility to make a reunion with their parents, to get the parents also to Germany. So we want to cut off this business model. NELSON: Tobias Klaus of the German Federal Association of Unaccompanied Minor Refugees disputes Mayer's claim that a disincentive is needed. He says only 400 parents had been reunited with the 60,000 minors in Germany by the end of last year, even under the old law. TOBIAS KLAUS: (Through interpreter) Every child needs his or her parents no matter where they are from. These youth have suffered so much trauma being separated from their family and their homeland and all the dangers they face there, and on the journey here. NELSON: Zara says the German government's decision to delay family reunification has upset his parents back in Syria. He speaks to them and his little brother by Skype when they are able to get close enough to the Turkish border to pick up a Wi-Fi signal. HUSSEIN: (Speaking foreign language). NELSON: Zara says his parents won't be deterred even if the German government tries to make them wait. He says that if left with no other choice, they will go on the same illegal journey their son did more than 18 months ago. Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson, NPR News, Berlin. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

            "article_content": "The rise in hostile rhetoric against migrants in Germany is being linked to the country's new populist political party. The Alternative for Germany is expected to win pivotal elections on Sunday.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: Tomorrow's elections in three German states are being watched as an indicator of Chancellor Angela Merkel's popularity. Her decision last year to welcome hundreds of thousands of refugees could lead to a voter backlash in this weekend's voter. And it could benefit an anti-immigrant political party that's been gaining support. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reports from Berlin. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Many Germans don't take kindly to their government sending asylum-seekers to their cities and towns, and more and more of them are showing their displeasure. Recently, it was the residents of the eastern German town of Clausnitz who took to the streets. (SOUNDBITE OF SHOUTING) NELSON: About 100 of them, including members of the Alternative for Germany party came out to heckle 20 terrified Syrians who were moving into a local shelter. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Chanting in German). NELSON: The protesters chanted we are the people, a phrase associated with a popular uprising in the former East Germany against communism a quarter century ago. It's since become the battle cry of Germany's growing anti-immigrant movement. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRAUKE PETRY: (Speaking German). NELSON: Party co-chair Frauke Petry later denounced the Clausnitz protest and told reporters she's against taking German frustration with the government out on migrants. Never mind that a month earlier, she had suggested that, if necessary, police should shoot migrants who illegally try to enter Germany. Petry claims she was misunderstood. She says the hostility toward refugees should be blamed on the German government for not listening to its constituents. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PETRY: (Speaking German). NELSON: Petry says officials may think they have the migrant situation under control, but that based on what she's heard from people across Germany, it's not true. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PETRY: (Speaking German). NELSON: Unlike the government's slogan for the migrant crisis that says we can do it, Petry says we can't do it. Some political scientists say it's that German fear of failure Petry and her populist party have capitalized on. In the two years since it was established, Alternative for Germany has gone from a fringe Euroskeptic party to an anti-immigrant force to be reckoned with - one that is expected to be voted into the next German Parliament in 2017. Hans Vorlander is a political scientist at the Technical University in Dresden. HANS VORLANDER: (Speaking German). NELSON: He says none of Germany's established political parties criticize Merkel's migration politics enough to suit all of their constituents. And it's those disaffected people that Petry and her group are going after. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VORLANDER: (Speaking German). NELSON: Alternative for Germany isn't expected to win a majority this weekend. But polls suggest the party will get enough votes to become a vocal minority in the three state's legislatures. It's the first time since the 1960s that right-wing populists are regaining a foothold in Germany. Back then, their rise was linked to neo-Nazi sympathies and harsh economic times. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PETRY: (Speaking German). NELSON: Petry, however, shuns any comparison of her party to Nazism, new or old. She doesn't even like the term right-wing and prefers to draw comparisons between her life and that of Chancellor Merkel. Both women were born in the former East Germany, and both are chemists-turned-politicians. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PETRY: (Speaking German). NELSON: Petry says - I imagine Mrs. Merkel as acting because of her Christian background. She's the daughter of a Lutheran pastor, and I'm the former wife of one. But she's confusing personal empathy with government action. Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson, NPR News, Berlin.

            "article_content": "Nearly 10 percent of people voting this presidential election will be naturalized citizens. What does the American political circus look like to a relatively new immigrant who's a first-time voter?  DAVID GREENE, HOST: And now have the story of one refugee. He lives in Ohio. He's now a U.S. citizen. And this Tuesday he'll be casting a vote for the very first time. M.L. Schultze from member station WKSU reports. UNIDENTIFIED WOMEN: Please raise your right hand. M.L. SCHULTZE, BYLINE: Two things are a constant at naturalization ceremonies, lots of pictures, and lots of reminders that with citizenship comes responsibility, the responsibility to vote. Mahananda Luitel takes that responsibility seriously. He and his wife became citizens last April. They were born in Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, and forced with about 100,000 others into refugee camps in Nepal. 10 years ago with little of the attention now swirling around other groups of refugees the Bush administration opened the U.S. borders to about 60,000 of them. MAHANANDA LUITEL: We were looking for a durable solution to life for our sustenance, for the better life of our children and the U.S. government becomes so willing, so acceptable, so generous. SCHULTZE: After medical, security and other screening the Luitel's expecting their second child headed for Texas in 2009, then moved north, where a large Bhutanese Napeli population has settled in and around Akron. Now, these refugees are learning just what it means to be a voter in the key swing state of Ohio. As a political refugee, Mahananda says voters should insist that country comes before party. He's particularly intrigued by Hillary Clinton. LUITEL: A great nation like America would give an example to the rest of the world that Americans are not biased. They would give opportunity even to women. SCHULTZE: And, still trying to make up his mind, he sat down to watch one of the most recent GOP debates with his 13-year-old son, Anuj. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: This little guy has lied so much. SCHULTZE: The Luitel's have just moved into a new house so the Internet connection was spotty. And that may be a good thing. It cut out briefly just about the time Donald Trump and Marco Rubio got into a debate about the size of body parts. But Mahananda and Anuj heard plenty of the rest, including a debate over immigration. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: I'm going to build a wall. I'm the one that wants the wall. SCHULTZE: Anuj looked up from his iPad, quizzical. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: There's always negotiation. ANUJ: If you are trying to get Mexico to build wall, that's like me try to get my brother to give me the iPad when we just came home from school. He's not going to do it unless I convince him saying he can use my laptop. So he will have to negotiate. He doesn't seem very good at negotiating from the debate. SCHULTZE: Mahananda says he would have no heart if he didn't think about the fate of other refugees and immigrants. But he's also worried about national security, the economy and education. And as a man of peace he says he worries about guns on the streets. But for Mahananda Luitel the American election is not just for Americans. It's an example for the rest of the world. And that's where he hesitates over the nature of the current political debate. He says it's all tone over substance. LUITEL: It pleases our ears when we hear who wears what sort of pants and who makes what sort of personal comments but let there be a serious debate on the issues. SCHULTZE: A recent Pew Center study shows naturalized citizens are more likely to vote than the U.S. population overall. One reason may be the process, the classes, the tests, the ceremonies. Mahananda Luitel says he'll vote simply because he is now a very responsible member of this nation. How he'll vote though, he hasn't yet decided. For NPR News, I'm M.L. Shultze in Akron, Ohio.

Donald Trump has feuded with other candidates, reporters and TV networks during his run for president. Now, the front-runner for the Republican nomination is feuding with Pope Francis. On Thursday, the pontiff criticized Trump for the proposal at the heart of his campaign: a pledge to keep people from crossing into the United States illegally by building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. \"I'd just say that this man is not Christian if he said it in this way,\" Francis told reporters in a midflight press conference after a trip to Mexico. \"A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,\" Francis said, according to The Associated Press' translation of the press conference. Trump wasted no time firing back. \"If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISIS's ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been President because this would not have happened,\" Trump said in a statement released by his campaign. \"For a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful.\" Trump has aggressively courted evangelical Christian leaders and voters during his run for president, though as NPR reported after his visit to Liberty University last month: \"There have been some missteps along the way. Last year, he told an Iowa evangelical gathering he had never asked God for forgiveness \u2014 a central tenet of the Christian faith \u2014 and he repeated that Sunday on CNN. He's declined to cite his favorite Bible verse or even his favorite testament. And the Presbyterian church he says he attends in Manhattan has said he's not an active member.\" Trump still won the endorsement of the school's president, Jerry Falwell Jr., after that appearance. For his part, Francis has not shied away from politics since becoming pope. While simply repeating long-held church positions on the dangers of capitalism and globalization, concern for the environment, and other social justice issues, he has repeatedly made headlines over the course of his career as pontiff and, before that, cardinal, for challenging political leaders. The first Latin American pope has made immigration a top concern. Earlier this week, he celebrated Mass along the U.S.-Mexico border, saying immigrants crossing the border \"are 'cannon fodder,' persecuted and threatened when they try to flee the spiral of violence and the hell of drugs.\" Francis even floated the idea of drawing attention to immigration concerns by entering the U.S. via the Mexican border when he made his first visit to the country last fall.",

Ted Cruz, R-Texas participate in the sixth GOP debate on Jan. 14 in North Charleston, S.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican presidential candidates, from left to right, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas participate in the sixth GOP debate on Jan. 14 in North Charleston, S.C. Monday's Iowa caucuses are being billed, as they are every election season, as \"a fight for the soul of the Party,\" both Democratic and Republican. Yes, it's a worn-out clich\u00e9, but especially on the Republican side this year, it's a real battle. For some insight into the race and the state of the GOP, we've turned to some young Republicans: Chelsi Henry, 27, was the youngest elected woman in the history of Jacksonville, Fla. Will Estrada, 32, works as an advocate for a home-schooling nonprofit in Northern Virginia. And Margaret Hoover, 38, is a political strategist and author whose great-grandfather was President Herbert Hoover. We started with the man who's grown to dominate the GOP. Will Estrada: Donald Trump talks a good talk but when you look at where he stands on, there's nothing to base it on. While I like that he's talking a conservative talk, I prefer candidates who have a background in it \u2014 there's evidence that you can look back and say they've fought, they've been in the trenches, they're trying to lower our taxes, reduce the size of the federal government rather than just say the right things. But he talks as a conservative and so you have the top two candidates in the polls both making a very strong push for the conservative movement as opposed to the establishment movement. I actually must say, I'm very optimistic. As a young Republican, I think tomorrow Ted Cruz is gonna win Iowa. I think it's gonna basically deflate Donald Trump and I think this race \u2013 my crystal ball is a little foggy but I think it's gonna come down to the two Cubans, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and I think one of them will be our nominee this summer. And as a young, Latino conservative, I'm very, very excited about that. Chelsi Henry: I think that Will made a great point in terms of Mr. Trump is and I think about this all the time, where does he really stand. I mean, he was a Democrat, now he's a Republican \u2013 which, that happens, but I think there's been many things that he's flip-flopped on and so I really wanna see someone who's gonna go in, stand to their platform, stand to their promises and most importantly stand to their values and implement those for all Americans. ... Jeb Bush. I'm a Florida girl so I've seen how the policies and principles \u2013 from job creation to education \u2013 when it comes to looking at all areas of government, looking at all areas where there's need from criminal justice reform, education, health care, the policies that the governor has put out are ones that I support. Margaret Hoover: I would say I was optimistic before Donald Trump got in. now that Trump's gotten in, and it is just Trump versus Cruz, the narrative, the tone, the quality of the conversations \u2013 we're not talking about policy, we're not talking about how to do the kinds of things that people like Paul Ryan are talking about: how to alleviate poverty, how is the Republican Party, the conservative movement going to make America better, fix sort of this economic stagnation that the middle class have been in for a decade or more? We're not talking about any of the real problems. This has just become a reality TV food fight that frankly, not only is not good for the country, it's really terrible for the Republican Party as well. So quite frankly, I'm hesitant to say, it's quite terrifying as a young Republican. RM: Why is Donald Trump leading in the polls so dramatically then? CH: He's the one that's saying, no more political correctness, I'm going to say what's on my mind, I'm a person just like you, I have these really strong feelings, that sometimes, those who are trying to be politically correct don't share. So I think just his style has allowed people to feel like, \"Oh my gosh, we can take back control, of the government.\" But it doesn't address the policy concerns, that myself as a young African-American attorney, activist feels needs to be addressed. MH: It's more than that though Chelsi ... We talk about and you're talking about the fight for the soul of the Republican Party. This is also the fight for the soul of the conservative movement in many ways because the conservative movement has counted on many of these individuals who are finding affinity with Trump. And you see National Review, the really primary publication of the really modern American conservative movement, coming out against Trump. But many of their readers are angry. Many of FOX News viewers are angry. They support Donald Trump. And what he's tapped into is an economic populism and what I think is really more of a European style xenophobic nationalism that is a very, very strong feeling out there and he's riding that wave. RM: What do you think about the rhetoric surrounding immigration policies and the influx of Syrian refugees and some of the language and rhetoric that's been used by Ted Cruz and Donald Trump? WE: As an evangelical Christian, we see in the bible that we're all created equal in the image of God and a lot of the rhetoric that is used in modern American politics detracts from that. We need to be caring for the poor and the vulnerable. ... But having said that it also starts with we've got to protect our citizens, we've got to protect men, women, children here in America. And I'm very concerned, Rachel, and I think a lot of Americans are concerned when we see young men of military age coming over from war-torn countries, who we don't know and we can't verify. I always think, what would happen \u2013 that movie Red Dawn that came out in the 80s \u2013 what would happen if our country were attacked? Would we be fleeing or would we be fighting for our country? RM: But Red Dawn is a fictionalized account that stirs up fear and paranoia. I'd like for us to be a Party that's known for standing what we are for \u2014 not what we're against. Margaret Hoover WE: It also, though, kind of strikes to the soul of what we've always said in America \u2014 that we will fight for our land. And I think a lot of Americans, myself included, are saying we should let the women and children in. But why are letting in people who should be fighting for their own country, frankly. RM: Margaret, you've done a lot of work as an advocate for same sex marriage, worked to get pro-LGBT republicans elected to Congress. This is obviously still a very divisive issue in the GOP. Who's your candidate if that's an issue that's important to you, how does that weigh into your calculus when looking at the field? MH: I believe that better government is less government. I also believe in equal opportunity as every American does. But I think that where we come down differently in terms of the political spectrum is, on the right we tend to think that the government's job is to stay out of the way and at the very minimum, enforce a level playing field to make sure that everybody does actually get a fair shot. And LGBT rights and freedoms is one area where government very clearly isn't giving Americans a fair shot because LGBT Americans don't have the same rights, they don't have all the same freedoms. Even post marriage, there are 30 states where you can just be fired for being gay, at cause. Nobody knows this. Republicans especially don't realize this. But there are Republicans who have taken strong positions on LGBT freedom. ... I thought it was a great moment in one of the first debates where John Kasich came out and said I've been to a gay wedding and I was for traditional marriage but I went to a gay wedding and it reflected that people are open to changing and the Party isn't a Party of bigots. I mean, that has been the false caricature, I think. RM: Explain what change, if any, you'd like to see in the GOP in the next few years? WE: I would love to see us talking more about policy. We do a good job about it but we need to do it more. And I think it gets to what Chelsi said of reaching out into minority communities. They want strong families; they're pro-life, many of them in the Latino community. Many of the Islamic-American communities are again of a very strong, civil society and faith. And we need to go out and talk with them, we need to say the conservative, Republican message is one that empowers you \u2014 one that will protect you and your faith and your religious freedom and your family and your job and we need to go into these communities and just say you should be a Republican, you should vote with us because of these big policy issues. CH: One, I think that we should hold true to our values and our principles. I am a Republican because of the values and principles of the Party align with my personal values. Yet, with that, I think that we have to be better messengers to all communities. We have to be better messengers of how our conservative policies will directly affect the lives of people when they're sitting down sat their kitchen table every month to pay bills, how it's going to affect their bottom line. And from that, I think we also have to grow in our diversity. So, my hope's, being optimistic because I happen to be a conservative, is that in 10 years we'll look around and those who are helping make decisions, those who are helping candidates get elected, they will be a diverse group of people who represent the demographics of America. MH: I'd like for us to be a Party that's known for standing what we are for \u2014 not what we're against. And this is I think what Paul Ryan and the speakership is trying to do, is set an agenda of what we're for so the country knows that the Republican Party is for. Nikki Haley is trying to do this too. We are for a stable Middle East, we are for a free-market health care system, we are for social mobility and getting people out of poverty. And people will know how we're for those things. And I think as young Republicans, the principles are there, but we need to adjust them and message them in order to really connect to a new generation.",

            "article_content": "President Obama delivers his final State of the Union speech to a Congress and country already in the throes of a presidential campaign. NPR has a preview of what he might say, and how it will frame the 2016 presidential race.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: The news today that about 10 American sailors strayed into Iranian waters and were taken into custody of Iran comes as President Obama prepares to deliver his last State of the Union address. White House officials confirmed the sailors' detention during a briefing on the speech. The White House says the president wants to set an optimistic tone in his remarks tonight. Here's how former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau previewed it on Morning Edition today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) JON FAVREAU: This is the \"Morning In America\" speech in response to the malaise speech the Republican candidates have been giving the entire primary season. SHAPIRO: Tonight's primetime speech is one of Obama's last big chances to make the case for his own legacy and shape the debate among those who are running to replace him. NPR's Scott Horsley joins us now from the White House with a preview. Hi Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Hi Ari. SHAPIRO: The White House says this is going to be an untraditional State of the Union address. I'm sure they weren't referring to today's breaking news when they said that. What did they mean by that? HORSLEY: Well, Ari, you've sat through a lot of these speeches, and I think what they hope they mean is that it's going to have some staying power. You know, if you look back at all the memorable speeches this president has given during his time in office, there's probably not a State of the Union that makes the top 10. So often there's just not a lot of room for poetry or even a coherent argument in these speeches. Instead they tend to be sort of laundry lists of programmatic proposals that the president wants Congress to take up. Obama has said he wants to get away from that in this speech. After all, Congress, under the control of the GOP, is not likely to approve much of his program anyway. So instead, he's planning to take a step back and offer a sort of big picture of the challenges and what he sees as the opportunities facing country. SHAPIRO: Still a fair amount of campaign politics in this speech though. It is, after all, a presidential election year. HORSLEY: Oh, of course. I mean, as his former speechwriter Jon Favreau said, this is a chance to paint Obama's own record in the warm, glowing colors - the way President Reagan's \"Morning In America\" campaign ad did - at a time when Republican candidates have been running a pretty negative campaign about what they see as the sorry state of the union, both in terms of the economy and security. Obviously, both sides have evidence they can call on to make their case. You can expect the president to talk tonight about the best couple of years of job growth we've had since late 1990s, record auto sales last year after he rescued GM and Chrysler. Republicans instead will focus on lackluster wage growth and mounting concerns in the American public about terrorism. SHAPIRO: Scott, is there a risk of the president sounding too rosy if he gives a wholly optimistic speech, especially with news breaking about American sailors in Iranian custody right now? HORSLEY: Well, certainly. And this is a challenge that the president's faced, really, throughout his tenure and even more so in the supercharged political atmosphere of an election year. And Republicans have a strategic rationale for highlighting the president's shortcomings and trying to tie those shortcomings to his fellow Democrats, especially Hillary Clinton, who served in Obama's cabinet. Democrats, on other hand who are running for office want to, on the one hand, celebrate successes of their president but not handcuff themselves to a person whose approval rating is still, you know, languishing below 50 percent. Now, keep in mind, Ari, this is a president who burst on the national scene all those years ago promising to bridge the partisan divide. Instead, that divide is deeper than ever, and Obama told NBC News's \"Today\" show this morning that is one of his regrets. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"TODAY\") BARACK OBAMA: Politics in Washington are so much more divided than the American people are. And part of what I want to do in this last address is to remind people, you know what? We've got a lot of good things going for us and if we can get our politics right, it turns out that we're not as divided on the ideological spectrum as people make us out to be. SHAPIRO: Well, Scott, the president is sticking with one State of Union tradition. He's invited some special guests to watch from the first lady's box. Who's going to be there? HORSLEY: Yeah, this is another tradition that began with Ronald Reagan inviting ordinary and not so ordinary Americans to attend the speech and help to illustrate the president's points. Obama has a lot of folks to choose from tonight including an empty seat representing the victims of gun violence. Also in the first lady's box, one of the young Americans who tackled a gunman on that Paris-bound train, a Syrian refugee who's now living in the Michigan, one of the first women to graduate from Army Ranger School and the named plaintiff in the same-sex marriage case decided by the Supreme Court last summer. The president botched his name in the Rose Garden. This gives him another chance to say Jim Obergefell. SHAPIRO: (Laughter). Finally, Scott, do you think they're scrambling for a rewrite given that these sailors are in Iranian custody right now? HORSLEY: You know, news of this broke as I and some other reporters were getting a briefing on the speech, and the White House was keeping mum. I don't think they want to say too much until the sailors' fate is maybe a little bit more secure. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Scott Horsley speaking with us from the White House. Thanks Scott.

            "article_content": "The calendar has finally turned to 2016, and the Republican presidential candidates are ramping up their campaigning. The theme this week is national security, an issue that unites the GOP establishment and the conservative grassroots.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: This is a big week for Republican presidential candidates. The holidays are over, and there is now less than a month to go before the first round of voting in the election, the Iowa caucuses. And the Republican theme of how scary the world has become under President Obama's watch is only getting more intense. With us now to talk about this is NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. And Mara, it really seems like almost all the Republican candidates are talking about the same thing right now. What's going on? MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Well, the theme is pretty clear. The world is on fire, and it's all President Obama's and Hillary Clinton's fault. Now national security and the fight against terrorism is an issue that almost always gives Republicans an advantage, and the president's numbers on this are very bad right now. People don't feel he's kept them safe. And not only is this an issue that's worked for the Republicans in the past, but it has the added value of uniting the Establishment and Grassroots Conservative wings of the GOP. And here's a sample of what we heard from Republicans just today. First, an ad from Jeb Bush airing in New Hampshire. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JEB BUSH: We are at war with radical Islamic terrorism. We have but one choice, to defeat it. LIASSON: Here's Chris Christie giving a national security speech in New Hampshire today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHRIS CHRISTIE: These are among the most dangerous and perilous times in our country's recent history. These times and these challenges demand a grown-up to be our candidate. LIASSON: And Marco Rubio also giving a national security speech in New Hampshire. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARCO RUBIO: When America needed a bold plan of action from our commander-in-chief, we instead got a lecture on love and tolerance and gun control. It was designed to please the talking heads at MSNBC. The result of all this is that people are afraid, and they have every right to be. LIASSON: So this is a theme that's been building for months in the GOP race. But as you can hear, this is a very, very dark picture they're painting of the state of the world. Voters are afraid and, says Marco Rubio, they should be afraid. This makes perfect political sense for an opposition party which is anticipating running against a de facto incumbent, Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state of the current administration. MCEVERS: With all this ominous language that we're hearing, there is one voice that I haven't heard yet and that's Donald Trump. LIASSON: We did hear from him today. Donald Trump aired his first TV ad. He has rocketed to the top of the polls and stayed there without spending hardly any money on advertising, but now he says he's going to spend a couple million dollars a week to air this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: He'll quickly cut the head off ISIS and take their oil, and he'll stop illegal immigration by building a wall in our southern border that Mexico will pay for. LIASSON: There's a little glitch in that ad when you hear that line about the border and the wall. You see footage of what turns out to be refugees in Morocco running to a border. But the point is Trump is doubling down here. There's nothing new in the ad. It's a kind of Donald Trump's greatest hits. But he is using a narrator, an outside voice, which is run-of-the-mill for most candidates, but Trump hasn't seemed to need anyone to vouch for him but himself. But here, the narrator's voice serves as a powerful outside validator. It makes Trump seem more like a typical candidate, something most politicians wouldn't want. But in Trump's case, it probably helps. MCEVERS: And quickly, what is the state of play in the Republican primary? As you said, Trump is still on top, right? LIASSON: Trump is still on top in most state polls, but not Iowa, where Cruz is ahead. But inside all those anti-Obama national security speeches today is a furious intramural battle. You heard both Christie and Rubio disparage a candidate who they said was running to be entertainer-in-chief. Translation? Donald Trump. Rubio said you can't defeat ISIS with a filibuster, that's a clear swipe at Ted Cruz. So here we are, 27 days from the first votes, and the race is still very, very unsettled on the Republican side. MCEVERS: That's NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thanks so much. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "An independent candidate narrowly defeated his far-right opponent in Austria's down to the wire presidential election Monday. The close vote betrays a deeply divided country that the new president has vowed to unite.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: Austria came very close to electing a far-right, anti-immigration airplane technician as its new president today. In a cliffhanger of a race, he lost to an economist backed by the leftist Green Party. That has relieved many European leaders, but the results underscore how polarized some European countries have become. Joanna Kakissis begins our coverage in Vienna. JOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: When economics professor Alexander Van der Bellen was finally declared president today, teacher Brigitta Eichhorn sang and celebrated in a Vienna courtyard. BRIGITTA EICHHORN: I don't want my country to exclude other people. I want to live in an open country. KAKISSIS: She was alluding to Norbert Hofer, the candidate from the far-right Freedom Party who ran on an anti-immigration integration ticket. He lost to Van der Bellen by just 31,000 votes. In his acceptance speech, Van der Bellen spoke of the division in Austria. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ALEXANDER VAN DER BELLEN: (Through interpreter) It was nearly a 50-50 finish. It's a symbol that couldn't be clearer. We talked a lot about the separation between left and right, city and country, young and old. But I think we are equal, two parts and both parts equally important. KAKISSIS: Political analyst Eva Linsinger says Van der Bellen is not exciting, but he seems thoughtful. EVA LINSINGER: He thinks. He talks slowly. He thinks before he answers. Then sometimes he gives kind of complicated answers. KAKISSIS: Ali Vakili, an Austrian doctor of Iranian descent, says he hopes Van der Bellen will help to change what he calls growing racism in Austria. ALI VAKILI: They see your skin color. They see your hair color. And for them, you're just using the system and getting people's money, you know? They don't see what you actually do. They don't see how hard-working you are. KAKISSIS: Renee Von Paschen, an Austrian-Canadian theater scholar, says many peole are unhappy about how the government handled the more than 90,000 asylum seekers in Austria last year. RENEE VON PASCHEN: There's a definite polarization. The migrant crisis was managed very badly, and it wasn't acknowledged that it was going to be a problem early enough, and that has led to a certain degree of discontent. KAKISSIS: That discontent helped bring the rise of the Freedom Party which Austrians call the FPO. Mario Zuzan, a salesman who joined the party two years ago, says that those who vilify the party do not understand Austria today. MARIO ZUZAN: We reached 50 percent this election, so I don't think you can say the people are afraid of the FPO. KAKISSIS: He says the party's neither racist nor xenophobic. He says it just wanted to preserve Austrian culture and keep out corrupt politicians. ZUZAN: For me, it's important to - just to make sure that I've done everything to leave the country, to leave an environment for my kids which is worth to live in. KAKISSIS: He says the Freedom Party is in Austria to stay. For NPR News, I'm Joanna Kakissis in Vienna. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

A left-leaning, Green Party-backed candidate has won Austria's presidential election, edging out an anti-immigrant populist by just 0.6 percent of the vote. Alexander Van der Bellen, a retired economics professor, had 50.3 percent of the vote, according to The Associated Press. His rival, Norbert Hofer of the far-right Freedom Party, had 49.7 percent. A mere 31,000 votes \u2014 out of more than 4.6 million \u2014 separated the two candidates. Joanna Kakissis, reporting for NPR from Vienna, described der Bellen as a 72-year-old, chain-smoking economist. The man he defeated, 45-year-old Hofer, is a polarizing figure, as Joanna explains: \"Hofer, who trained as an airplane mechanic, talked tough on migrants \u2014 especially Muslims. His party's anti-migrant message struck a chord with Austrians. \"Many are concerned that this small country of fewer than 9 million cannot support the 90,000 asylum-seekers who arrived last year. \"Had Hofer won, he would have been the first elected head of state from a far-right party in the European Union.\" Even though Hofer lost, the narrow margin was, for many, a sign of the popularity of far-right movements in Europe. Hofer looked ahead in a Facebook post thanking his supporters. He said their work during the campaign was \"not lost but an investment in the future,\" according to a translation by The Associated Press.",

            "article_content": "The chancellor announced on Sunday she'll seek another term. \"This election will be even more difficult than those we have had before as we are facing a strong polarization,\" she says.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: She was declared the world's most powerful woman by Forbes magazine, and she has now declared last night that she will run next fall for a fourth term. We are talking about Angela Merkel. She's Germany's first female chancellor. And if she wins and serves her next term, she would tie her one-time mentor Helmut Kohl for that country's post-war record of most years in office. Let's turn now to NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson in Berlin. Soraya, good morning. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: So didn't the chancellor have a lot of reservations about running again? What happened here? NELSON: Yeah, she said it took her a long time to come to a decision. Part of it is that she really isn't in favor of four-term chancellors. I mean, she just thinks that you can be in office too long. She's worrying about whether she still has something to bring to the job and whether she's still hungry for it. And she also was pretty upset about this idea that's sort of been growing within Europe and even the United States that she's somehow going to take the baton from President Obama and become leader of the free world. She said it's - it's absurd and even grotesque to assume that one individual, even with a lot of experience, can actually change things in the world, you know, for the better. I mean, this is something that's sort of a group effort. So, yeah, she - she definitely had some reservations. GREENE: OK, so she's sending a message of being humble, talked about maybe chancellors shouldn't serve this long, has now decided that she wants to do it. How are Germans reacting to this? NELSON: Well, they seem to be very happy, which is a bit surprising considering she's had a lot of problems as of late. But a recent Forsa poll showed that 60 percent of the people polled wanted her to run. GREENE: This is, like, a polling agency in Germany? NELSON: Yes, correct. GREENE: OK. NELSON: And many of the analysts here in Germany are saying that the Trump victory in the United States - Donald Trump becoming president-elect - seems to have solved her recent image problem because, again, people are looking to her to fix everything in the Trump era, as it were. GREENE: So, I mean, I know it's early - 10 months or so before an election - but any idea what message Merkel might have as she - as she takes another run at this? NELSON: Well, one thing is she's trying to communicate that she's really eager to listen to people to the middle of the road to try and reduce this polarization that's been going on in Germany. So she says that that's something she's going to do. She's talking about fixing the refugee policy and better integrating asylum seekers who've been approved to stay here. She says that whatever happens, her campaign is going to be a lot different this time. Although, by American standards, it's probably going to be rather boring because German elections tend to be low-key, and Merkel isn't really known for giving electrifying speeches. But the 62-year-old research-scientist-turned-politician has a reputation for being tough, smart and persistent in tackling problems, which should play in her favor. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Speaking German). NELSON: Her relentless drive is something she and her political party pointed out from the time she first successfully ran for chancellor in 2005, beating two-term incumbent Gerhard Schroder. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANGELA MERKEL: (Speaking German). NELSON: Merkel, who was then 51, told Germans they should vote for her and her party to steer the country toward economic growth and more jobs, an appeal that sounded a bit forced as she read from a teleprompter. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MERKEL: (Speaking German). NELSON: \"Germany can do this,\" she said, a trademark phrase that has come back to haunt her. Born in Hamburg to a mother who was a teacher and a father who was a Lutheran pastor, Merkel is the first German leader to have grown up under communism in the former East Germany. Her historic rise to power began in the first post-unification election, when she was elected to the German parliament as a representative from Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, a district she won in six federal elections since then. As chancellor, Merkel gained recognition, if not always support, for her measured and dogged approach to international issues, like the euro debt crisis. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MERKEL: (Speaking German). NELSON: She became the face of the EU response to Russian aggression in Ukraine and Syria, always pushing for diplomacy but unafraid to slap sanctions on Moscow when it didn't back down. Merkel was also adamant about opening Germany's borders to hundreds of thousands of asylum-seekers from the Middle East, Africa and Asia and repeatedly told Germans, we can do this. But many here feared the growing number of refugees would swarm the country and tear it apart economically and culturally, fears that right-wing and populist groups have exploited. Even in Merkel's electoral district this past February, protesters demanded she leave office. The anti-Merkel sentiment has helped the new nationalist party, Alternative for Germany, or AFD, to win seats in more than half of Germany's state legislatures. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MERKEL: (Speaking German). NELSON: Last September, in a rare emotional moment, Merkel accepted responsibility for the losses after her party suffered defeats in the Berlin state election. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MERKEL: (Speaking German). NELSON: She said her refugee policy and trademark phrase, we can do it, have been so twisted around that she didn't even like to say it anymore. But she remains adamant that Germany has a moral and historic obligation to continue welcoming refugees. GREENE: All right. Listening there to NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson talk about Angela Merkel. And Soraya's still on the line with us. Soraya, I mean, Merkel has - has struggled to retain popularity at times, I mean, with the refugee question, lots of other things. Are there people who are going to challenge her? NELSON: Well, it doesn't seem like there's anyone that jumps out from any of the established parties, although there have been a number of media reports talking about the head of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, that he might run against her. So far, he's said that this is news to him. He has no plans to run. Meanwhile, Merkel says that given, you know, Germany's polarization, she is expecting strong challenges from the right and left fringes of German society. GREENE: OK, speaking about German politics with NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson in Berlin. Soraya, thanks. NELSON: You're welcome, David. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The Tatar restaurant has become an asylum-seeker of sorts in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, in the wake of Russia's annexation of Crimea.\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of Musafir\n                    \n                \nhide caption Chebureki, thin, deep-fried pockets of cheese, meat or mushrooms, are a best seller at Musafir. The Tatar restaurant has become an asylum-seeker of sorts in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, in the wake of Russia's annexation of Crimea. In the language of the Crimean Tatars, the word musafir means \"guest.\" It's also the name of one of Crimea's most popular restaurants. But that name took on added significance when the Tatar outpost relocated to the Ukrainian capital of Kiev in May of last year. According to Sorina Seitvelieva, who owns the restaurant with her sister-in-law, Emine Emirsalieva, Musafir was forced to cease operations in the Crimean city of Bakhchyserai after Russia orchestrated an armed takeover of Crimea in March of 2014. The restaurant was closed just as the pair were opening Musafir's second location in mainland Ukraine. This \"guest\" in peaceful Kiev had become a kind of asylum-seeker. Crimea's Tatar population, which endured mass deportations during Stalin's reign of the Soviet Union, is once again subject to persecution at the hands of local authorities. Seitvelieva says armed and masked policemen searched the original restaurant three times before shuttering its doors \u2014 while other restaurants in the area remained unscrutinized. But that's awakened a burgeoning interest in Crimea and Tatar culture among Ukrainians and tourists. And guests have flocked to Musafir at its new home in Kiev, located just a 20-minute walk from Kiev's Independence Square. It has become one of the city's most popular restaurants. \"We sort of caught the wave,\" says Seitveliev. Business has been favorable for Musafir in Kiev since day one, according to its owners. \"Interest towards whatever is Crimean Tatar was part of it,\" Seitvelieva says. But since then, Emirsalieva adds, visitors have begun to flock to the restaurant for a different reason: \"Now ... they come because they like to eat.\" Far from the varenyky and borscht typical of chilly mainland Ukraine, Musafir's menu speaks to the temperate climate of the Black-Sea peninsula, with many of the staples and flavors Westerners expect of Turkish cuisine: pastries \u2014 sweet and savory \u2014 and flatbreads, grilled and stewed meats, stuffed nightshade vegetables, and fine Turkish-style coffee prepared with spices. Musafir's specialty, however, is its very best seller: the cheburek, a thin, deep-fried pocket of cheese, meat or mushrooms. At Musafir, chebureki are half the size of dinner plates, with elegantly crimped edges and a whisper-thin pastry exterior. Musafir's menu features foods from the temperate climate of Crimea, with flavors resembling those in Turkish food.\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of Musafir\n                    \n                \nhide caption Musafir's menu features foods from the temperate climate of Crimea, with flavors resembling those in Turkish food. Walk into Musafir for dinner without a reservation, and you're likely to be politely turned away. While many neighboring restaurants remain nearly empty in the midst of Ukraine's economic downturn, Musafir consistently draws a crowd of local businesspeople, who favor the restaurant for its lunch specials, and tourists who have ventured out of downtown Kiev in search of Musafir's famed coffee and kebabs. \"We have to open something else, because people are getting upset,\" Seitvelieva says with a laugh. For Tatars who have migrated westward and the many Ukrainians who once spent their holidays on the Crimean peninsula, chebureki elicit nostalgia for a region that has grown increasingly violent and uninhabitable. They're also a hallmark of a population that is vulnerable to extinction. The Crimean Tatars, an ethnic group with nearly a thousand years of history in Eastern Europe, are a Turkic-speaking people who traditionally practice Islam. In early 2014, the head of the Mejlis, the Tatar self-government organ, told Radio Free Europe that the group feared annihilation if the escalating tensions with Russia resulted in a partitioning of Ukraine. Since Crimea's annexation, the preservation of Tatar culture has become a priority for some activists in Ukraine, while human rights organizations have criticized Russia for the harassment, torture and murder of Crimean Tatars. Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election could signal an even bleaker future for Tatars and others in Crimea, as well as for the rest of the Eastern European nation. The U.S. has played a key role in backing Ukraine against aggression, and many in Kiev fear that Trump's move to the White House could signal the loss of its greatest ally. Emirsalieva, herself a Tatar, and Seitvelieva, a white Romanian married to a Tatar man, speak warmly of Kiev and its tolerant local culture, but they describe an increasingly bleak reality for the remaining Tatars in Bakhchysarai. The two women still try to visit Crimea during the summer, but note that simple activities have become emotionally and bureaucratically challenging since the annexation. Emirsalieva described having to fill out an immigration form for her 10-month-old son, born in Kiev, to travel from western Ukraine into Crimea. \"Earlier there were no borders, and now there are. To me ... this was difficult,\" Emirsalieva says. \"You have to cross the border to get home.\" While beer and wine appear on the menu at Musafir, alcohol is not served during the month of Ramadan. Both of Musafir's owners share a vested interest in continuing to use the Tatar language and perpetuating the traditions of the ethnic group, in and out of the restaurant. They also both send their children to Tatar school on the weekends. Musafir hosts a twice-weekly performance by a Tatar musician and welcomes large families and religious groups who want to hold dinners at the restaurant. \"It's nice to see [guests] in the evening coming and bringing their families for some special occasions,\" Seitvelieva says of the Crimean Tatars who visit Musafir. \"It's a nice place,\" she adds, \"but it's not home.\"",

            "article_content": "Voters in Austria choose a new president in an election Sunday. It could deliver the first significant victory for far-right, anti-migrant parties that have been growing in strength across Europe.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Let's head back overseas to Austria now, where voters will elect a new president. The post is largely ceremonial, but the race is being closely watched in Europe as it copes with its migrant crisis. It's closely watched because Austria could be the first European Union country to choose a head of state from a far-right party. Joanna Kakissis has been covering the story from Vienna and sent us this report. JOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: At a boisterous campaign rally in a working-class Vienna neighborhood, Norbert Hofer, the charismatic, gun-toting airplane mechanic who hopes to be president of Austria talked about foreigners. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NORBERT HOFER: (Speaking German). KAKISSIS: \"Those people who don't appreciate our country,\" he said, \"will go to war for the Islamic State or rape women. I tell those people, this is not your home.\" More than 90,000 asylum-seekers arrived in Austria last year. And Hofer's party, the Freedom Party, has risen to prominence by playing on fears that migrants are criminals. Hofer himself has said that he wants to stop what he calls an invasion by Muslims. I meet Austrian rapper Esra Ozmen in a lively western Vienna neighborhood settled by immigrants, including Turks. She says the Freedom Party's anti-migrant rhetoric has even found support among a few Austrian Turks who are Muslim. ESRA OZMEN: Because, yeah, the refugees come and take our jobs. KAKISSIS: But she says most Austrian Turks worry that a Hofer win will make racism more visible. She explains how some Freedom Party supporters are already speaking to her. OZMEN: We have the points, we have the voices, so shut up and go if you don't want to live in Austria. And before, this racism was hidden. KAKISSIS: I meet newspaper editor Florian Klenk in the same neighborhood. He says even if Hofer does not win tomorrow, his party, which Austrians call the FPO, has already moved Austrian politics to the right. FLORIAN KLENK: We have the problem that the FPO party presents themself as standing in the middle of society. But actually, they are not in the middle of society. They are not a centrist party. They are a right-wing party. A lot of positions that the FPO party have are extremist. KAKISSIS: But political analyst Eva Linsinger says the FPO has also tapped into people's unhappiness with the establishment. She says many Austrians view their own government, as well as European Union leaders, as weak and indecisive. EVA LINSINGER: If you compare it to different countries, we've got this phenomenon that people seem to be attracted to persons who say, I'm going to take the lead. I'll do that and that and that. You've got it in America with your Donald Trump. KAKISSIS: Hofer faces retired economics professor Alexander Van der Bellen, an independent supported by the Green Party, tomorrow. The election is expected to be close. For NPR News, I'm Joanna Kakissis in Vienna. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

He applied for asylum, and, like many others, he says he fled persecution from gang members in San Salvador. When he thinks about his future, Alfredo Trejo takes a deep breath. \"Many of the people who have been rounded up and will be deported, they already know their future,\" he says. \"They'll die of hunger or they'll be killed by bullets.\" Trejo came to the United States in 2014, one of thousands of unaccompanied minors from Central America who flooded the U.S. border. He applied for asylum and, like many of the others, he says he fled persecution from gang members in El Salvador. He says they assaulted him and stole from him and threatened to kill him, so he had no choice but to flee. Like the thousands of Central Americans who increasingly are seeking asylum in the United States, Trejo's future will be determined by how a judge interprets one sentence from a law passed in 1980. It puts him smack in the middle of a debate fraught with politics and argued in a system that has struggled to find an answer to what seems like a simple question: When is a migrant a refugee? That debate has also become more urgent because the Obama administration is fast-tracking these cases and then prioritizing the deportation of those who lose in court. Sitting in the living room of his lawyer in Virginia, Trejo looks very young. He's tall and lanky, and when he talks about serious things, he lowers his voice and looks down at his hands. You can tell that he would rather be talking about soccer. Yet he's still facing a very adult situation: Odds are that his journey to the United States will end with a deportation order. \"My case has been a bit hard, but hopefully I'll be allowed to stay,\" Trejo says. \"Because the truth is, I don't want to go back. I don't want to die at 18 years old.\" He looks at his lawyer, who's sitting right next to him. He says he trusts her. \"We intend to win.

Mark Metcalf served for a little more than two years as an immigration judge in Miami. In his words, there \"is no such thing as easy cases\" in immigration court. Metcalf says that many of them \u2014 especially asylum cases \u2014 are tough to decide because they're heartbreaking and pit human emotion against the hard letter of the law. \"It's a question of what the law says versus what our compassion indicates,\" Metcalf says. In a case like Trejo's, that's even more true because, ultimately, a judge may be making a life-or-death decision. But, Metcalf says, if he were to follow the law, he would deny most asylum petitions from Central Americans fleeing gang violence. The U.S. law Metcalf is talking about is the 1980 Refugee Act. The key sentence from that act grants asylum to any person who can't or won't return to their country \"because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" For decades now, many of the Central American and Mexican asylum cases have been argued using the \"particular social group\" provision. Attorneys argue that gangs targeted their clients because they are young or because they won't join a gang or because they are women. But, as Metcalf interprets it, these migrants are fleeing crime, which is affecting \"all people in a particular country,\" and are not being targeted because of a characteristic that they can't change about themselves. If fleeing crime becomes grounds for asylum, he says, every \"barrio\" in Latin America would empty out into the United States. \"We'll have a very difficult time being able to say no to any person who claims to flee a country because of criminal conditions,\" Metcalf says. Since about 2009, many more Central American migrants \u2014 including many minors \u2014 are making the trip north and seeking asylum. The reasons for the increase are fairly easy to explain. They parallel the ebb and flow of violent crime in the region. As the homicide rate spiked in Mexico, so did asylum applications; as San Pedro Sula became the murder capital of the world, asylum applications from Honduras increased. The U.N.'s refugee agency has interviewed hundreds of women and children who have crossed the U.S. border over the past couple of years, and a vast majority of them said they were fleeing violence from organized crime. The big question is: Just how many Central American asylum seekers are being classified as refugees and allowed to stay in the U.S.? In 2010, Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC, found that 9 in 10 Hondurans and Salvadorans were being denied asylum, and 8 in 10 Mexicans and Guatemalans were denied. TRAC also keeps tabs on cases fast-tracked by the Obama administration involving thousands of women and children. And those numbers show that not much has changed: 9 in 10 Hondurans and Salvadorans have been denied asylum, and 8 in 10 Mexicans and Guatemalans have been denied. The Justice Department, which oversees the immigration courts, hasn't publicly released comprehensive numbers on these cases. But a spokesperson said DOJ analyzed a subset and found that judges denied asylum in about 60 percent of cases involving women and children from July 2014 through December 2015. In other words, Central American asylum seekers have little hope of winning in court. Trejo holds his phone with the last photo taken with his mother in El Salvador.

For weeks in 2014, Trejo had resisted the urge to stop showing up to soccer practice in San Salvador. As he tells his story, he took a daily 45-minute bus ride from an area controlled by the 18th Street gang to an area controlled by MS-13. He said MS-13 thought he was part of the 18th Street gang, and that's when they robbed him and mugged him and threatened to kill him. But he dreamed of a spot on the Salvadoran national team, so he ignored the threats and kept showing up to practice. Then one summer day in 2014, a group of gang members waited for him to leave a team meeting. When they pulled out knives, Trejo thought his life was over. One of his neighbors saw them and pulled out a gun to scare off the gang members. Trejo escaped, but he'd had enough. Four days later, by car and foot across Guatemala and Mexico, the 17-year-old began a long journey north. \"We're practically forced out of the country when they find out that you're trying to make something of yourself,\" Trejo said. \"Maybe they're jealous. ...

And in his mind, immigration attorneys have been focusing on the wrong part of that 1980 law to defend asylum seekers. To Van Wyke, leaving a country torn by violence because you refuse to be a part of it is an act of conscience. \"Let's say somebody did join a gang \u2014 what would we say about that person? We would immediately make all sorts of judgments about how bad the person is,\" Van Wyke explains. \"So let's say they're in a situation where they feel obligated to join a gang and put ourselves in those circumstances and say, 'What kind of resistance would it take, what kind of moral strength would it take to say no?' I don't think we have a difficulty understanding what conscience is in a circumstance like that.\" It's a lot like when a person speaks out against a government or other repressive forces, Van Wyke says. \"We admire that. We say that person has character, that person has some sort of moral strength,\" Van Wyke says. \"If they're going to be harmed because of that and they are afraid and have a reasonable fear of the consequences for having done that or for being in a situation where they are going to have to do that, then it's perfectly in line with our law to grant them political asylum.\" But a spokeswoman for the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees U.S. immigration judges, says the asylum process is working. \"Our immigration judges adjudicate cases on a case-by-case basis, according to U.S. immigration law, regulations and precedent decisions,\" Kathryn Mattingly says. \"They consider all evidence and arguments presented by both parties and decide each case based on the available information.

They came to ask 18-year-old Jairo Jonathan Elias-Zacarias to join them in the fight against the Guatemalan government. According to court records, Elias refused. As they left, the two masked guerrilleros told him, \"Pi\u00e9nsalo bien\": Give it good thought. About two months later, Elias left Guatemala afraid the guerrilleros would come back. He traveled north to Mexico and eventually made it to the United States. Like thousands of others, he claimed political asylum, arguing that either the guerrillas or the government would hurt him and his family for choosing sides. His request was denied, but Elias fought. His case made it all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. On Jan. 22, 1992, the high court ruled against him in a 6-3 decision, saying that just because a person resists forced recruitment by a guerrilla doesn't necessarily mean he is expressing a political opinion. \"Even a person who supports a guerrilla movement might resist recruitment for a variety of reasons \u2014 fear of combat, a desire to remain with one's family and friends, a desire to earn a better living in civilian life, to mention only a few,\" Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority. In his dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens said the narrow reading of the law betrayed the spirit in which it was written. \"A refusal to support a cause \u2014 by staying home on election day, by refusing to take an oath of allegiance, or by refusing to step forward at an induction center \u2014 can express a political opinion as effectively as an affirmative statement or affirmative conduct,\" Stevens wrote. \"Even if the refusal is motivated by nothing more than a simple desire to continue living an ordinary life with one's family, it is the kind of political expression that the asylum provisions of the statute were intended to protect.\" Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Elias-Zacarias became one of the most important cases in asylum law in the United States. It was a big victory for the George H.W. Bush administration, which argued that a broader reading of the law would open the floodgates along the southern border. The decision didn't foreclose on the idea that Central Americans fleeing forced conscription could claim political asylum, but it raised the bar for proving it. Suddenly, it meant that asylum seekers not only had to show that they had expressed a political opinion but that their persecutors would come after them because of that opinion. Central American immigrants just released from U.S. Border Patrol detention board a bus for Houston and then other U.S. destinations on July 25, 2014, in McAllen, Texas. Federal agencies have been overwhelmed by tens of thousands of immigrant families and unaccompanied minors from Central America crossing illegally into the U.S.\n                \n                    \n                    John Moore/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Central American immigrants just released from U.S. Border Patrol detention board a bus for Houston and then other U.S. destinations on July 25, 2014, in McAllen, Texas. Federal agencies have been overwhelmed by tens of thousands of immigrant families and unaccompanied minors from Central America crossing illegally into the U.S. The question of whether Central Americans fleeing violence should be considered refugees under the law has been debated since the 1980 Refugee Act was passed. Deborah Anker, a professor at Harvard Law and one of the pre-eminent scholars on asylum law in the United States, says before that time, U.S. law gave asylum only to migrants from the Middle East or communist countries. \"We were really trapped in this Cold War framework, whereas the international definition was global and humanitarian in its basic focus,\" Anker says. The 1980 law was intended to bring the U.S. in line with the international community, but the system clearly continued favoring migrants fleeing from conflict in Soviet-friendly countries, including Laos, Cuba, Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan. In fact, at the same time, war was raging in three Central American nations, and hundreds of thousands of migrants were fleeing to the U.S. seeking asylum. But in the eyes of the United States, they were \"economic migrants.\" Nicaraguans were largely granted asylum because of the U.S. government's opposition to their country's regime. But less than 3 percent of Salvadorans and Guatemalans were granted asylum. Activists and refugees filed a class-action suit saying the U.S. was discriminating against those groups. Anker says that at the time, the Salvadoran and Guatemalan cases put U.S. immigration officials in a difficult position: Migrants were coming to the U.S. saying they were being persecuted because they had political and ideological objections to the actions of dictators, such as Guatemala's Efra\u00edn R\u00edos-Montt, whom the United States was supporting. Adjudicators, she says, had a hard time believing their stories of death squads and other government persecution. She thinks that a similar misperception of the situation on the ground is happening now. \"I don't think they understand the political nature of the gangs,\" she says. \"I think this is just dismissed as a question of law enforcement, and just as criminal street gangs. It's a very simplistic approach to analyzing what the country conditions are.\" What's more, Anker says, adjudicators then and now sometimes dismiss the claims because the asylum seekers are often poor and adjudicators believe that they could not possibly articulate a political opinion. \"But poor people can have political opinions,\" she says. \"Uneducated people can have political opinions. And women who are being raped can have an opinion that it's not right and that men don't have the right to do that to women, and that kind of culture and violence is supported by their government.\" Anker says the concept \u2014 that political opinion isn't only for elites and members of formal political parties \u2014 is fundamental. It was inspired by the thinking behind the 1951 Refugee Convention, an international accord that spells out how refugees are to be treated and that the Supreme Court has accepted as the anchor for U.S. immigration law. By 1991, the U.S. government had settled the suit brought by Central Americans, admitting that it had discriminated and that all asylum cases decided during the first decade of the 1980 Refugee Act should be reheard. Ultimately, the vast majority of those cases never made it to court again, because Congress passed the 1997 Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act, which granted many Salvadorans and Guatemalans legal status in the U.S. The question of whether they were migrants or refugees was never vigorously debated in the immigration courts. The odds were always stacked against Elias-Zacarias, but somehow he kept beating them. An immigration judge rejected his asylum application, the Board of Immigration Appeals declined to rehear his case, and then the 9th Circuit ruled in his favor. When the Supreme Court overturned that decision, it should have been the end of his journey in the United States. He should have been returned to Guatemala to face all that he feared. But Elias-Zacarias won the lottery \u2014 the visa lottery \u2014 and was allowed to remain in the United States. In a short telephone interview with NPR, he said he wasn't interested in talking about his past. But he said that after he won the lottery, he quickly became a legal resident and began a normal life in the U.S. He has a house and a family now, and about 10 years ago, he became a U.S. citizen.

In the short time he has been in the U.S., he has built a life. On a cold winter night in Virginia, Trejo heads out for dinner with his lawyer. His case is a family affair, after all. His lawyer, Jill M\u00e1rmol, is married to Trejo's cousin Alexis M\u00e1rmol, who is about to take the bar exam to work as an immigration lawyer. Trejo wanted to take them out to dinner to El Sol Azteca, where he works after high school. As they walk in, he's greeted warmly by the staff. It's obvious that in the short time he's been here, he has built a life. \"He's a really well-liked kid,\" Jill says. As soon as they sit down, Jill and Alexis start asking about his life. He's working six days a week. He goes to school, then comes to the restaurant and works until the place closes. He's taking biology and history entirely in English, and it's tough, he says. His grades are suffering. Just as quickly, the talk turns to U.S. asylum policy. Both Jill and Alexis M\u00e1rmol work at a law firm that takes a lot of asylum cases. They hear stories like Trejo's every day, and just as often, they have to have frank discussions with their clients: The odds of getting asylum are slim. At best, they can drag out their case, and then they can cross their fingers that by the time a final decision is upon them, the popular interpretation of the law \u2014 or the law itself \u2014 will have changed. \"It's frustrating,\" Alexis says. \"We do the best that we can with what we have, but the law doesn't allow us to do much more than that. And someone like [Trejo] deserves to be here, absolutely.\" Jill shakes her head. The biggest repercussion of letting people like Trejo in, she says, is that it might encourage others to make the journey north. \"These kids are escaping certain violence and probable death,\" she says. \"What is bad about that? What is bad about them escaping that?\"",

They are fully vetted and well-trained agency employees.\" The sun rises over the Supreme Court of the United States in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Samuel Corum/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The guerrillas came at dusk in January 1987. They came to ask 18-year-old Jairo Jonathan Elias-Zacarias to join them in the fight against the Guatemalan government. According to court records, Elias refused. As they left, the two masked guerrilleros told him, \"Pi\u00e9nsalo bien\": Give it good thought. About two months later, Elias left Guatemala afraid the guerrilleros would come back. He traveled north to Mexico and eventually made it to the United States. Like thousands of others, he claimed political asylum, arguing that either the guerrillas or the government would hurt him and his family for choosing sides. His request was denied, but Elias fought. His case made it all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. On Jan. 22, 1992, the high court ruled against him in a 6-3 decision, saying that just because a person resists forced recruitment by a guerrilla doesn't necessarily mean he is expressing a political opinion. \"Even a person who supports a guerrilla movement might resist recruitment for a variety of reasons \u2014 fear of combat, a desire to remain with one's family and friends, a desire to earn a better living in civilian life, to mention only a few,\" Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority. In his dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens said the narrow reading of the law betrayed the spirit in which it was written. \"A refusal to support a cause \u2014 by staying home on election day, by refusing to take an oath of allegiance, or by refusing to step forward at an induction center \u2014 can express a political opinion as effectively as an affirmative statement or affirmative conduct,\" Stevens wrote. \"Even if the refusal is motivated by nothing more than a simple desire to continue living an ordinary life with one's family, it is the kind of political expression that the asylum provisions of the statute were intended to protect.\" Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Elias-Zacarias became one of the most important cases in asylum law in the United States. It was a big victory for the George H.W. Bush administration, which argued that a broader reading of the law would open the floodgates along the southern border. The decision didn't foreclose on the idea that Central Americans fleeing forced conscription could claim political asylum, but it raised the bar for proving it. Suddenly, it meant that asylum seekers not only had to show that they had expressed a political opinion but that their persecutors would come after them because of that opinion. Central American immigrants just released from U.S. Border Patrol detention board a bus for Houston and then other U.S. destinations on July 25, 2014, in McAllen, Texas. Federal agencies have been overwhelmed by tens of thousands of immigrant families and unaccompanied minors from Central America crossing illegally into the U.S.\n                \n                    \n                    John Moore/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Central American immigrants just released from U.S. Border Patrol detention board a bus for Houston and then other U.S. destinations on July 25, 2014, in McAllen, Texas. Federal agencies have been overwhelmed by tens of thousands of immigrant families and unaccompanied minors from Central America crossing illegally into the U.S. The question of whether Central Americans fleeing violence should be considered refugees under the law has been debated since the 1980 Refugee Act was passed. Deborah Anker, a professor at Harvard Law and one of the pre-eminent scholars on asylum law in the United States, says before that time, U.S. law gave asylum only to migrants from the Middle East or communist countries. \"We were really trapped in this Cold War framework, whereas the international definition was global and humanitarian in its basic focus,\" Anker says. The 1980 law was intended to bring the U.S. in line with the international community, but the system clearly continued favoring migrants fleeing from conflict in Soviet-friendly countries, including Laos, Cuba, Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan. In fact, at the same time, war was raging in three Central American nations, and hundreds of thousands of migrants were fleeing to the U.S. seeking asylum. But in the eyes of the United States, they were \"economic migrants.\" Nicaraguans were largely granted asylum because of the U.S. government's opposition to their country's regime. But less than 3 percent of Salvadorans and Guatemalans were granted asylum. Activists and refugees filed a class-action suit saying the U.S. was discriminating against those groups. Anker says that at the time, the Salvadoran and Guatemalan cases put U.S. immigration officials in a difficult position: Migrants were coming to the U.S. saying they were being persecuted because they had political and ideological objections to the actions of dictators, such as Guatemala's Efra\u00edn R\u00edos-Montt, whom the United States was supporting. Adjudicators, she says, had a hard time believing their stories of death squads and other government persecution. She thinks that a similar misperception of the situation on the ground is happening now. \"I don't think they understand the political nature of the gangs,\" she says. \"I think this is just dismissed as a question of law enforcement, and just as criminal street gangs. It's a very simplistic approach to analyzing what the country conditions are.\" What's more, Anker says, adjudicators then and now sometimes dismiss the claims because the asylum seekers are often poor and adjudicators believe that they could not possibly articulate a political opinion. \"But poor people can have political opinions,\" she says. \"Uneducated people can have political opinions. And women who are being raped can have an opinion that it's not right and that men don't have the right to do that to women, and that kind of culture and violence is supported by their government.\" Anker says the concept \u2014 that political opinion isn't only for elites and members of formal political parties \u2014 is fundamental. It was inspired by the thinking behind the 1951 Refugee Convention, an international accord that spells out how refugees are to be treated and that the Supreme Court has accepted as the anchor for U.S. immigration law. By 1991, the U.S. government had settled the suit brought by Central Americans, admitting that it had discriminated and that all asylum cases decided during the first decade of the 1980 Refugee Act should be reheard. Ultimately, the vast majority of those cases never made it to court again, because Congress passed the 1997 Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act, which granted many Salvadorans and Guatemalans legal status in the U.S. The question of whether they were migrants or refugees was never vigorously debated in the immigration courts. The odds were always stacked against Elias-Zacarias, but somehow he kept beating them. An immigration judge rejected his asylum application, the Board of Immigration Appeals declined to rehear his case, and then the 9th Circuit ruled in his favor. When the Supreme Court overturned that decision, it should have been the end of his journey in the United States. He should have been returned to Guatemala to face all that he feared. But Elias-Zacarias won the lottery \u2014 the visa lottery \u2014 and was allowed to remain in the United States. In a short telephone interview with NPR, he said he wasn't interested in talking about his past. But he said that after he won the lottery, he quickly became a legal resident and began a normal life in the U.S. He has a house and a family now, and about 10 years ago, he became a U.S. citizen.

In the short time he has been in the U.S., he has built a life. On a cold winter night in Virginia, Trejo heads out for dinner with his lawyer. His case is a family affair, after all. His lawyer, Jill M\u00e1rmol, is married to Trejo's cousin Alexis M\u00e1rmol, who is about to take the bar exam to work as an immigration lawyer. Trejo wanted to take them out to dinner to El Sol Azteca, where he works after high school. As they walk in, he's greeted warmly by the staff. It's obvious that in the short time he's been here, he has built a life. \"He's a really well-liked kid,\" Jill says. As soon as they sit down, Jill and Alexis start asking about his life. He's working six days a week. He goes to school, then comes to the restaurant and works until the place closes. He's taking biology and history entirely in English, and it's tough, he says. His grades are suffering. Just as quickly, the talk turns to U.S. asylum policy. Both Jill and Alexis M\u00e1rmol work at a law firm that takes a lot of asylum cases. They hear stories like Trejo's every day, and just as often, they have to have frank discussions with their clients: The odds of getting asylum are slim. At best, they can drag out their case, and then they can cross their fingers that by the time a final decision is upon them, the popular interpretation of the law \u2014 or the law itself \u2014 will have changed. \"It's frustrating,\" Alexis says. \"We do the best that we can with what we have, but the law doesn't allow us to do much more than that. And someone like [Trejo] deserves to be here, absolutely.\" Jill shakes her head. The biggest repercussion of letting people like Trejo in, she says, is that it might encourage others to make the journey north. \"These kids are escaping certain violence and probable death,\" she says. \"What is bad about that? What is bad about them escaping that?\"",

            "article_content": "Chancellor Angela Merkel is standing by what she calls the historic task of making war refugees part of Germany. But fellow Germans are growing increasingly skeptical that this can be done.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: German Chancellor Angela Merkel is Europe's most powerful leader. And she staked her political career on the decision to take an open-arms approach to last year's flood of migrants. She is now up for re-election, launching her campaign at a time when many Germans are growing skeptical that she can pull off what she calls the historic task of making war refugees part of Germany. NPR's Joanna Kakissis is in Berlin and joins us now. Good morning. JOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: And you've been talking to Germans. And what sort of things are they telling you? KAKISSIS: Well, you know, you have to remember that Merkel, you know, she's not only powerful but she's been popular. She's one of the most popular leaders in Europe. And she's been in office for more than a decade. Germans trust her. But that may be changing. Here's one person, Frank Schiefelbein. He's 54, installs telephones and home alarm systems for a living. I met him at the zoo in eastern Berlin. He had the day off and took his 3-year-old grandson Kai there. And, you know, Schiefelbein really worries about Kai, worries that these faraway conflicts in the Middle East are making Germany unsafe. FRANK SCHIEFELBEIN: (Through interpreter) The world has become scarier and more complicated in the last few years. Situations in countries far away are like volcanoes ready to erupt. KAKISSIS: Those eruptions could send more migrants fleeing to Europe. He worries that Chancellor Angela Merkel will let them all in just as she did last year. SCHIEFELBEIN: (Through interpreter) People from Syria, families with children - these people need to be helped, no question. It's outrageous not to help them. But what about those who slipped in with them, those who exploited the chancellor's open door policy? People are afraid. They're worried about crime. Women are worried about being harassed on the street. KAKISSIS: Schiefelbein frowns. He's a law-and-order conservative who's been voting for the Christian Democratic Union, Merkel's party, as long as he can remember. And Merkel was his kind of chancellor - a pastor's daughter with the deliberate, problem-solving mind of the chemist she was trained to be. SCHIEFELBEIN: (Speaking German). KAKISSIS: Now he worries she was actually gullible about migrants, especially after two recent attacks by asylum-seekers. But at a press conference last month, after the attacks, Merkel reiterated her support for welcoming refugees. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL: (Through interpreter) I am as convinced as ever that we can do it. We can fulfill our historic task in this time of globalization. We can do it, and we have already done a lot over the last 11 months. KAKISSIS: Political journalist Margaret Heckel, who wrote a recent biography of Merkel, says the chancellor, who grew up in what was then communist East Germany, spends a lot of time debating pros and cons before making a decision. And with migrants, Merkel's decision did not involve shutting borders. MARGARET HECKEL: For somebody who lived 38 years of her life in Eastern Germany being surrounded by walls, to erect another wall - that's just incomprehensible. You know, anybody who would call upon her to do that doesn't know her at all. You know, behind this is the basic idea that Europe has to come to terms with the problem. KAKISSIS: Heckel says Merkel wants Germany, in part because of its Nazi past, to lead the European Union in welcoming refugees. HECKEL: We always said, oh, no, no, no. Our heritage and, you know, World War II, and no, no, no, we keep off. But now things have changed. Angela Merkel was really clear about that when she started her term in 2005 that these times were gone. KAKISSIS: But now several EU countries are undermining her policy by refusing to accept refugees. And a recent poll shows that 65 percent of Germans don't trust her when it comes to migrants and that more than half view her unfavorably. One is Barbel Franke, a middle-aged cook from Klosterheide-Lindow, a village northeast of Berlin. She lives across the street from a bankrupt hotel that houses 60 asylum-seekers. And she says Merkel cares more for them than for Germans. BARBEL FRANKE: (Through interpreter) I don't think Angela Merkel will be chancellor again. She won't be voted for again because there's not enough being done for us. And many people here are unemployed as well. Many people need help, and they're not helped. KAKISSIS: Federal elections are just over a year away. And already, one of Merkel's key allies, Bavarian leader Horst Seehofer, has hinted he will challenge her. Most migrants entered Germany through Bavaria last year, and that's where the recent attacks took place. Seehofer criticized Merkel's rallying phrase, wir schaffen das, or we can do it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HORST SEEHOFER: (Through interpreter) I cannot, for the life of me, embrace this phase as my own. The problems we face are too big. And the solutions we've come up with so far are just too unsatisfactory. KAKISSIS: Pollster Manfred Guellner told NPR that despite Merkel's dip in the polls, Germans also don't see Seehofer or other politicians as serious alternatives to her. So remember Frank Schiefelbein, the disenchanted Merkel voter visiting the zoo with his little grandson? SCHIEFELBEIN: (Speaking German). KAKISSIS: Well, he told me, \"I would not ask any other politician about the situation in the Middle East, for example, because they don't have a clue about it.\" And comparing Merkel to her challengers, he said, \"they don't understand that you cannot solve conflicts by screaming and shouting.\" MONTAGNE: And Joanna, to wrap this up, Angela Merkel is already backing off her open-door policy. Is that because of all of this political pressure? KAKISSIS: Yes, in part. But remember she also negotiated this deal with Turkey to stop migrants from arriving to the EU. So she's not having to deal with the kind of massive numbers of asylum-seekers that we saw last year. And the question is, will this deal with Turkey hold up, and if it doesn't, you know, how will she manage another big flow of migrants? That's what Germans want to know. MONTAGNE: That's Joanna Kakissis speaking to us from Berlin. Thanks very much. KAKISSIS: You're welcome, Renee. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Democrats have some major tasks ahead in the new year as they try to rebuild their party after a bruising 2016 election outcome put them well out of power in the White House, Congress and many states.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: The Republican Party is heading into 2017 on a high that they haven't felt in a long time. For the Democrats, it's a different matter. They lost the presidency. They failed to retake the Senate and the House, and they're struggling in state houses around the country. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson has been thinking about what Democrats need to do in the New Year as they start to rebuild, and she joins us now. Hi, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Robert. SIEGEL: How bad are things for Democrats as they try to put 2016 behind them? LIASSON: Bad, bad, bad, bad for... SIEGEL: That bad. LIASSON: Yes, that bad. For all the success of President Obama, no president has lost more seats for his party in eight years than he has. Democrats right now have a trifecta - in other words, both state houses and the governor's mansion in only six states. Republicans have total control - a trifecta - in 26 states. So they're shut out in Washington. They are in a minority around the country, but they can still filibuster at least until Republicans change the rules completely. However, to put this into perspective, they won the popular vote. Their strength is among the parts of the electorate that are growing. So I would say the diagnosis is the Democrats have a gaping head wound. The Republicans are suffering from a longer-term demographic illness that might be fatal but is not as urgent. SIEGEL: So what's the first order of business for the Democrats in 2017? LIASSON: I think the first order of business is to get an economic message that can appeal to everyone, that can appeal to the young millennial who's saddled with college debt and the laid-off union worker. Don't forget. President Obama did this. Many Trump voters were Obama voters. This is always what Democrats did in the past. SIEGEL: Right. LIASSON: That's how Democrats have been successful. This is their DNA. They just have to get back to it. SIEGEL: I mean there is a controversial critique, though, of the Democratic Party that it's been putting the kind of unifying bread-and-butter issues that you've alluded to second and identity politics first and that by doing that, it's inadvertently intensified white, working-class identity politics. LIASSON: With a big assist from Donald Trump. SIEGEL: Yeah. LIASSON: Don't forget. He was the master identity politician this year. And yes, there's no doubt about that. There are a lot of Democrats who think they need to develop an economic nationalism without the nativism - so less emphasis on identity politics, more emphasis on economic growth that's more broadly shared. SIEGEL: So let's turn more tactically to the Congress right now. There are different theories about how Democrats there could oppose Donald Trump. They could try to obstruct him at all costs. They could look to be constructive in some way. Which is it? LIASSON: I think they're going to push back against Trump when he goes against their core values. Yes, it's possible that if he presents a big infrastructure program that truly creates a lot of jobs, they might want to work with him on that. There are a bunch of senators in red states, people like Joe Manchin or Heidi Heitkamp. They might be willing to work with Donald Trump on some things. But there are some red lines for Democrats. Medicare is one of them. And if the Republicans in the House in particular go ahead with their plans to privatize Medicare - their new buzzword is modernize Medicare - the Democrats will stop them. And also, overall, what they want to communicate to Trump voters who maybe once were Obama voters is that Trump is abandoning them. In other words, if you look at the first things on the Republican agenda, it's tax cuts mostly for the wealthy, getting rid of Obamacare and putting someone on the Supreme Court and getting rid of regulations. That doesn't sound like a real populist agenda. The other thing is, what you're not hearing from them, which is interesting - you're not hearing from them saying, our first job is to make Trump a one-term president, which is what Mitch McConnell... SIEGEL: Yes. LIASSON: ...Famously said... SIEGEL: About Barack Obama. LIASSON: ...About Barack Obama. SIEGEL: As you've said, Democrats were not just turned out of power in Washington, but also the Republicans have complete control of state houses in 26 states. That'll have some real political implications. LIASSON: Real political implications because in 2020, we're going to have another census. And after every 10-year census, we redraw congressional district lines. And who draws them - governors and state legislators. And that's why in 2010 when Republicans had their big, historic surge, took over a lot of state legislatures and governor's mansions, they redrew the lines that kept their congressional majority safe for the next 10 years. SIEGEL: In January, Barack Obama will complete his second term in the White House. Hillary Clinton - we assume her career is over at this point. Are the Democrats lacking for a leader of their party? LIASSON: The Democrats are lacking for a leader. The Clinton era is over. But I would argue that having a leader for the Democrats is not as important right now than a message, than infrastructure, than getting down-ballot candidates, refilling their pipeline. One thing that happens when you're wiped out in midterms - your seed corn is gone. All those people who were moving up the pipeline who will eventually become the leaders of the party - they are just wiped out. And they need to get an infrastructure that turns out their voters every two years, not every four. That has been the great failing of Democrats. SIEGEL: They have now won the popular vote in 2000, in 2008, in 2000. LIASSON: Six of the last 7 elections. SIEGEL: And yet in the off-year elections, they lose everything. LIASSON: They lose everything. SIEGEL: Sounds like the Democrats have lots of work to do. NPR's Mara Liasson - Mara, thanks. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

But it wasn't all bad. There was also John Legend. With three weeks left, the reality of the past year is starting to sink in. Racial conflict showed up in all corners of the news the past week. Electoral racism The election may be over, but the trauma lives on. Asma Khalid has been covering the presidential campaign since Marco Rubio's boots were scandalworthy. Along the way, she heard emotional stories from America's heartland about voters' aspirations and fears. She was also routinely questioned, threatened and berated for being a Muslim woman and wearing hijab. After months and months of telling other peoples' stories, Khalid finally shared her own. Khalid; NPR Police racism In Charleston, S.C., residents are busy reliving another trauma. After a mistrial in the case of Michael Slager, the police officer who shot Walter Scott in the back, people are wondering whether a black man can ever hope for justice in the courts. In light of the mistrial, it's worth revisiting Feidin Santana's story. Santana filmed Scott being shot on April 5, 2015. Months after, he still dreamed about the shooting every night. Laughland, Swaine; The Guardian Prison racism The injustices extended behind the bars and razor wire. A New York Times investigation found that in most New York prisons, black inmates are disproportionately assigned to the worst jobs and living spaces and are subject to harsher, more frequent punishments than white inmates. In one case, a black man was punished with 180 days in solitary confinement for trying to take waffles to his cell. In another, it was bread: \"[Paul] Sellers was returning from dinner at Five Points Correctional Facility when he was stopped by an officer for taking 'a loaf of state bread' back to his cell, according to the guard's report.\" After refusing to give up the bread, Sellers was sent to solitary for 166 days. Schwirtz, Winerip, Gebeloff; New York Times Liberals and racism After President-elect Trump's win, some liberal analysts argued that \"identity politics\" had cost Democrats the election. In a commentary for Code Switch, our former editor, Tasneem Raja, offered a contrary point of view. She says identity politics are a (small, imperfect) attempt at making the United States more equitable across racial lines, and that the folks who criticize that politicking are playing right into the hands of white supremacists. Raja; NPR Neoconservative racism Speaking of white supremacists: Richard Spencer is becoming a household name as he fights to legitimize white nationalism following Trump's victory. But Spencer didn't come from nowhere. A piece in Tablet profiles Paul Gottfried, a mentor of Spencer's and the so-called Jewish Godfather of the alt-right. It's a fascinating, troubling look at how conflicting identities can fold into each other without ever truly reconciling. Siegel; Tablet Interpreting racism While 2016 has been racially stressful for just about everyone in this country, people of color, for the most part, are pretty accustomed to it. Some white people have been looking for guidance. Sometimes that means hitting up their best black friends \u2014 the writers, analysts and voices they follow on social media. Four writers who are often the subject of this unburdening (including our own Gene Demby) discuss the challenges that come with being someone's POC help desk. Bouie, Demby, Harris, McMillan Cottom; Slate Posthumous racism Paul Revere Williams has become the first African-American to win the Gold Medal in Architecture \u2014 the highest prize given by the American Institute of Architects. Williams' nearly 3,000 designs are famous in Southern California. He has designed homes for Frank Sinatra and Lucille Ball, as well as the Neon Museum Visitors' Center and a cathedral in Las Vegas. Williams, who has been dead for 36 years, was not available for comment, but writer Kriston Capps hopes that the award will serve as a wake-up call to an industry that he says attracts and rewards white men. Capps; CityLab Historical racism The Standing Rock protests are about protecting the water, sure. But Shannon Prince says that water represents only a small part of the story.

Here in rural northwest Montana, there is postelection unease in some communities about far-right extremist views entering the mainstream.\n                \n                    \n                    Kirk Siegler/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Flathead Lake in Montana's Flathead Valley is fed by the glaciers in Glacier National Park. Here in rural northwest Montana, there is postelection unease in some communities about far-right extremist views entering the mainstream. The day after the election, Jen Stebbins-Han's kids came home from school and posed a question that before this year, she says, she might have laughed off. \"My kids came home and asked us if their dad was going to be deported,\" she says. \"I don't know where they heard that because it wasn't from us.\" Stebbins-Han's husband is Korean-American. Jen is white. The couple has three young biracial kids. \"There is a part of me that's afraid because I don't know what somebody's going to do because they feel emboldened to be able to,\" she says. Stebbins-Han grew up in northwest Montana's Flathead Valley, a pristine area wedged between the snow-capped mountains of Glacier National Park and the glacier-fed Flathead Lake. Like a lot of people here with the means, she moved away as a young adult. Five years ago, she returned with her husband so he could take over her dad's orthodontist practice. The couple's kids go to the same little country school Jen and her father and grandfather attended. But she says the valley she came back to seems different now. \"What I've noticed is ... I didn't realize how OK with blatant racism so many people are,\" Stebbins-Han says. A sign near an old railroad station is shown in Kalispell, Mont., in 2011. In rural northwest Montana, controversy erupted in 2010 when a white supremacist group calling itself Kalispell Pioneer Little Europe began screening Holocaust denial films at the library in Kalispell.\n                \n                    \n                    Nicholas K.

In rural northwest Montana, controversy erupted in 2010 when a white supremacist group calling itself Kalispell Pioneer Little Europe began screening Holocaust denial films at the library in Kalispell. A move to the right Long before the 2016 election, rural northwest Montana had a reputation as a haven for anti-government extremists and white supremacists. According to numerous interviews with longtime locals, this used to get shrugged off. These were the fringe types, the locals said, holed up in remote cabins in the woods of northwest Montana and the Idaho panhandle. Then things started bubbling up to the surface. Controversy erupted in 2010 when a group calling itself Kalispell Pioneer Little Europe began screening Holocaust denial films at the library in Kalispell, Flathead Valley's largest city. Then, white nationalist leader Richard Spencer moved to the lakeside resort town of Whitefish. \"The impression that I get from the people that I talk to is that nobody wants them here. Everybody would rather not be known for this,\" Stebbins-Han says. \"But at the same time they're put up with and maybe even listened to a lot more than I would like.\" That is the tension. After the election, some of these groups' arrivals into the mainstream of American politics are cause for unease in the valley. Local conservatives distance themselves from these outside extremist groups moving in. But northwest Montana has also been trending deep red in recent years, especially as several of this area's timber mills and manufacturing plants closed. On rural highways, bumper stickers mocking President Obama are common, and so are the billboards listing the Ten Commandments. Instead of the usual classic rock or country, the radio is now dominated by Christian and conservative stations. This trend toward the far-right in politics has local activists like Taylor Rose excited. \"I describe it as a re-emergence of populist nationalism,\" he says. Rose is talking local and national politics on a frigid morning over coffee at a City Brew. The bustling local chain sits along a busy highway lined with shiny new big-box stores that cater to thrifty Canadians who drive down to the valley to shop. For Rose, Donald Trump's surprise victory is a stand against globalist trade policies, mass immigration and multiculturalism. \"We have our heritage, we have our values, and we should take pride in that,\" Rose says. \"And if you come to this country and want to be a citizen of this republic, you have to assimilate.\" Rose is 29. His longish blond hair is parted down the middle. He's wearing a North Face T-shirt. He ran for the state Legislature this year as a Republican and lost, but not by much. He's quick to say his views are not xenophobic, rather just protectionist. \"We should reject things that are antithetical to our way of life, that are enshrined in our ancient Anglosphere heritage that we have inherited from the British,\" Rose says. Rose's parents divorced when he was little, so he grew up splitting time between the Flathead and Oregon. Locally, he's eager to see whether Trump will get the loggers back in the forests. \"To help this valley out, the best thing that Donald Trump could do is to get the federal government out of our way so that we could allow our industries to thrive,\" Rose says. To be clear, the Flathead Valley, with its resorts and its famous national park, is quite prosperous compared with a lot of Montana, especially the state's remote eastern plains. The unemployment rate is 5.1 percent, slightly higher than the state average of 4.3 percent here, but there are still jobs. It's just that people like Rose want to see the area go back to an economy that had fewer regulations and relied more on natural resources. \"Not a very diverse community\" While the Flathead Valley has trended red recently, it's also known for its fierce libertarianism. Groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Montana Human Rights Network warn that the region's \"live and let live\" mentality is one of the reasons why far-right extremist groups are drawn here and in some cases thrive here. Another reason is demographics; Flathead County is nearly 100 percent white. It's a fact not lost on Will Randall, who grew up and raised his family here. Today he's a carpenter specializing in building higher-end homes. \"We are not a very diverse community,\" Randall says. \"Montana has a sizable Native American population, and they don't feel welcome here for the most part, people of color don't feel welcome here, Hispanics don't generally feel comfortable here. Many of our young people that are LGBT move out of the area.\" When Spencer relocated to Whitefish, Randall and his neighbors pressed the city council to ban him from doing business. They ended up getting an anti-discrimination ordinance passed. Since the election, Randall says he has tracked an increase in hate speech incidents in local schools. A group of teenagers who paraded through town with Confederate flags on their pickups also ignited controversy. Still, some here think things are getting overblown in the wake of a divisive election. At Whitefish Handcrafted Spirits, one of the latest hip hangouts to open in the upscale resort town, Rebecca Moreno is polishing tumbler glasses, getting ready for her shift tending bar. \"I work in this bar, I see a lot of people, a lot of locals, and I've never once been bothered or threatened. I mean, I'm clearly Mexican,\" she says, laughing. Moreno moved to Whitefish two years ago from Southern California. She also voted for Trump. She says she's not afraid even if the more extreme elements of the far right are becoming mainstream. \"I know that we are going to be OK,\" Moreno says. \"If they were to come out and be more violent, that's why I want to encourage more people to take action and learn how to protect themselves.\" Protect themselves, she says, with their Second Amendment rights. It's the main reason she voted for the president-elect.",

Here, Trump turns to talk to members of the press at an event in Orlando in March. Protests raged after Americans elected Donald Trump president. Another massive protest is planned for inauguration weekend. Online, his opponents express their dread that he could be \"normalized.\" Before the election, more Americans believed Trump's opponent had the better temperament and ability to serve as president. And, yet, half of Americans now believe Trump will do a good job as president. That's one finding from a new CNN poll that captures Americans' feelings toward the president-elect. (And before we go forward, yes, there is reason to take polls with a few grains of salt, given Trump's surprise win on Nov. 8. Then again, Clinton is winning the popular vote still, by 1.7 million votes as of publication time, and is expected to inch up higher. Clinton is also ahead by 1.3 percentage points, and the final RealClearPolitics polling average showed Clinton ahead by 3 points, just 1.7 points off.) Taken together, this and other postelection polls suggest Americans are cautiously optimistic about a Trump presidency. One poll shows his favorability rating climbing. Another shows that even a majority of Clinton supporters want to \"give him a chance.\" However, even some of his own voters have reservations about him (and particularly his children's influence). And, of course, the nation remains heavily ideologically divided. Half of Americans think Trump will be a good president Fifty-three percent of American adults say they believe Trump will do a \"very good\" or \"fairly good\" job as president, according to the CNN poll out Tuesday. That's fairly good news for a man who had some ugly polling numbers before the election. As of late October, a CNN poll showed that only 40 percent of registered voters thought he could \"better handle the responsibilities of commander-in-chief\" and one-third thought he had the \"temperament\" to serve. And only 4 in 10 registered voters viewed Trump favorably (to be clear, that's a smaller population than \"American adults\"). On the other hand, this number isn't all that impressive compared to Trump's predecessor. Just after the 2008 election, fully three-quarters of Americans believed Obama would be a very or fairly good president. A majority of voters \u2014 56 percent \u2014 say they believe Trump will have a \"successful\" first term as president, according to a Pew Research Center poll released this week. Once again, it's perhaps an encouraging finding for Team Trump, but it's not quite as good as Obama's 2008 marks (two-thirds thought he would be successful) \u2014 and he had no glide path when it came to legislating. Importantly, \"successful\" could mean any number of things to different people. Does it imply policy outcomes that the voter considers good? That Trump could be successful in pushing his policies through Congress? Or something else? Another poll suggests voters are slowly warming to Trump. A new Morning Consult poll shows Trump's favorability ratings have climbed: right now, Americans are evenly split, with 46 percent viewing him favorably and 46 unfavorably. That's up from a 37 favorable, 61 unfavorable split before the election. Considering the continuing outrage over his policy proposals and appointments (more on this below), that favorability rating could hit a ceiling soon. But considering all those other times the world tried to guess where the Trump ceiling was, hazarding a guess here is probably a bad idea. Voters don't want leaders to cooperate \u2014 except they kind of do Yes, more people seem to see Trump favorably than did prior to the election. However, many Americans remain strongly opposed to him. While half of Americans are \"hopeful\" or \"happy\" about his election, half are also \"uneasy.\" Four-in-10 are also sad, and 4 in 10 are scared, according to Pew. So it's no surprise that Clinton voters want their party to be obstructionist. Nearly two-thirds say Democrats should \"stand up to Trump on issues important to Democrats \u2014 even if it means less gets done.\" (Interestingly, 15 percent of Trump voters said the same thing.) Several of Trump's postelection actions have worried his opponents: his appointment of Stephen Bannon as a top adviser is one \u2014 Bannon served as chairman at Breitbart News, which has published misogynistic articles, and which Bannon called a platform for the alt-right, a movement that is closely associated with white nationalism. Trump opponents worry about the fact that his campaign has gained the approval of white-nationalist groups, as well as the possibility of a Muslim registry (RNC Chairman Reince Priebus told NBC's Meet the Press last weekend, \"Look, I'm not going to rule out anything.\" But he then added, \"We're not going to have a registry based on religion\" and said there needed to be more vetting to keep \"radical folks\" out.) It's not that Clinton voters are uniquely unwilling to compromise here; only one-quarter of Trump voters say Trump should pick Democrats to serve in his administration (half of Obama's voters said so of Republicans in 2008). In many of Pew's questions, it's clear that voters are heavily divided. Back then, 40 percent of McCain voters thought Obama would have a successful first term \u2014 less than half as many Clinton voters say so of Trump. In light of all that, here's what's jarring: Despite their polarization, Americans still hope leaders can work together \u2014 55 percent of Trump voters want him to \"work with Democrats to get things done, even if it means disappointing supporters.\" And 58 percent of Clinton supporters say they are \"willing to give Trump a chance to see how he governs.\" So maybe Americans really underneath it all are OK with their own sides compromising a bit if it means a more effective government. Or they're just hopeful that the other side will cave first. Voters concerned about conflicts of interest This is Trump's \"honeymoon phase,\" as Morning Consult co-founder Kyle Dropp said of Trump's higher favorability marks. But even mid-honeymoon, voters have reservations about how much Trump will (or won't) keep his family business and politics separate. A clear majority of Americans (59 percent) believe that Trump handing over his business to his children \"does not go far enough\" toward preventing conflicts of interest. This includes some people who in general support him: nearly 4 in 10 conservatives and one-quarter of Republicans agreed that giving his children control of the Trump Organization isn't enough. Recently, Trump claimed his businesses would be placed in a \"blind trust\" led by his children. However, several outlets have argued that that's not a terribly \"blind\" setup. And just as a majority of Americans want Trump out of the family business, many also want the family out of the West Wing. Nearly 6 in 10 voters told Morning Consult they believe Trump's children and immediate family shouldn't be involved in the administration.",

Prior to the news conference, which was held in the same room as the broader NPI event, Spencer told journalists they could not take photos of the room because attendees could be identified without their permission. This story was updated with video at 8:08 p.m. ET  Loyalists of the self-described white nationalist, alt-right movement from around the country gathered in D.C. Saturday afternoon, enthused by the election of Donald Trump and optimistic that their controversial, offensive views such as calling for a white, ethnocentric state were on the rise throughout the country. \"The alt-right is here, the alt-right is not going anywhere, the alt-right is going to change the world,\" Richard Spencer, head of the white nationalist think tank the National Policy Institute (NPI) promised at a press conference. About 300 people \u2014 split nearly evenly between conference attendees and protesters of the conference outside \u2014 were on hand at the downtown D.C. event. Spencer told journalists that he doesn't believe Trump himself is alt-right, the term he coined that's come to embody white supremacist, anti-Semitic and sexist ideas. But it was clear that his surprise election has given the once fringe movement a jolt, and on Saturday they were eager to take a victory lap. Spencer called Trump's campaign \"the first step towards identity politics in the United States.\" Spencer also restricted journalists from taking photos of the crowd inside the building to prevent the identification of attendees without their permission. Before Trump, Spencer said, the alt-right was like a \"head without a body,\" but then Trump came along and his campaign became \"kind of a body without a head.\" He described the alt-right as having a \"psychic connection\" with Trump in way they don't have with other Republicans, and expressed hope that, \"moving forward, the alt-right can, as an intellectual vanguard, complete Trump.\" One of their chief policy proposals they hope to push through is a 50-year immigration freeze, with a preference given to European immigrants coming into the U.S. Spencer told NPR's Kelly McEvers in an interview Thursday that their ultimate goal was \"a safe space effectively for Europeans,\" arguing for a return to the white origins of the country and protecting the white race. Spencer on Trump's picks for cabinet, senior strategist Speakers taking questions from the press included alt-right supporters (left to right) Peter Brimelow, Kevin MacDonald, Jason Jorjani, and Jared Taylor.\n                \n                    \n                    Ariel Zambelich/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Speakers taking questions from the press included alt-right supporters (left to right) Peter Brimelow, Kevin MacDonald, Jason Jorjani, and Jared Taylor. The alt-right movement has gained attention and support throughout Trump's election and particularly through his appointment of Steve Bannon, the former head of alt-right-friendly Breitbart News, to be a senior strategist in the West Wing. Spencer, however, argued that Bannon wasn't fully representative of the alt-right movement either, but that it's \"very hopeful for me that Bannon is at least open to these things.\" Bannon told the Hollywood Reporter on Friday, \"I'm not a white nationalist, I'm a nationalist. I'm an economic nationalist.\" Spencer was highly complimentary of Trump's first cabinet picks, particularly choosing Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions to be attorney general. Sessions is well-known for his hard-line immigration stances, and has had his own past controversy over race when he was voted down to be a federal judge in 1986 over remarks he'd made about the NAACP and allegedly called a white civil rights lawyer \"a disgrace to his race.\" He said that while Sessions was not alt-right necessarily, his views on immigration \u2014 and a belief that he may not fully enforce some civil rights protections \u2014 were encouraging to Spencer. \"The fact that he is going to be at such a high level is a wonderful thing. What Jeff Sessions is not going to do, in terms of not prosecuting federal diversity and fair housing, I think is just as powerful as what he might do,\" he said. Spencer had praise for Trump's pick of retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn to be his national security adviser, calling him an \"independent thinker\" who wasn't aligned with the neoconservative movement, who the alt-right sees as too interventionist. In that same vein, Spencer said he would oppose former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton if he were selected to be secretary of state, criticizing him as too hawkish. He said the group was encouraged by Trump's foreign policy, particularly the way he praised Russia throughout the campaign and his skepticism for the U.S. commitment to NATO.

NPI said more than 250 people had registered for the conference. Some donned the signature Trump hat emblazoned with his slogan \"Make America Great Again.\" When asked what the biggest Trump priority should be, there were loud cheers of \"build that wall,\" reminiscent of Trump's massive rallies. Outside the atmosphere was very tense, reflective of the mood of the country in the nearly two weeks since the election. Protesters along 14th Street outside of the Reagan Building shout as police escort a man from the crowd after a brief confrontation.\n                \n                    \n                    Ariel Zambelich/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Around 1 p.m., just before the press conference began inside, a large crowd of the protesters began marching down Pennsylvania Avenue, coming from the new Trump Hotel toward the White House, which Trump will occupy come January, turning onto 14th Street Northwest outside the Reagan Building. They chanted \"fascists we will shut you down\" and \"love trumps hate.\" Some signs read \"alt-wrong\" and \"white nationalism is un-American.\" The confrontation got tense at several points, with protesters with bandannas covering their faces surrounding some apparent conference attendees, shouting \"f*** off Nazis.\" A man's head was bloodied, according to WUSA, and NBC Washington reported police detained at least two people. The NPI is classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, and Spencer and other alt-right leaders recently had their Twitter accounts suspended, something he decried as an assault on the First Amendment. Several said they were longtime attendees of the conference, and that there was definitely a new energy injected into their movement after Trump's victory. Matt Forney of Chicago had attended past alt-right conferences, and said there was now an \"infusion of new energy\" and a lot of new faces who found out about the movement through groups on the internet and were encouraged by Trump's election. \"It was more like a cocktail party among old friends,\" Forney said of previous gatherings. \"Now, it's like we're the vanguard of a new movement. People are happy and ready to change the world.\" Evan Thomas of Michigan said that alt-right in a way was a misnomer, and he preferred the moniker \"identitarian.\" He said that could encompass all sorts of people \u2014 as long as they were white. \"Identitarianism speaks to an understanding that, by nature, man is a creature of tribe,\" Thomas said. And while Trump had certainly energized white voters, he cautioned that unless immigration of any kind were ceased, Trump's reelection in 2020 would be an uphill battle. \"He's got to act very tough, very quickly to reverse the demographic decline of European-Americans very swiftly. The coalition that brought him to the White House, he's got to keep that going and strengthen it, otherwise he will be a one-term president,\" Thomas said. A Chilling Salute After most of the cameras and the reporters had left the conference on Saturday, Spencer's tone took a drastic and ugly turn. While NPR had reporters and producers at the afternoon press conference, we were not present for these later exchanges. In video captured by The Atlantic for a documentary out next month, Spencer's closing speech was rife with anti-Semitic comments and Nazi references. \"Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory\" Spencer exclaimed, as many NPI conference attendees cheered and enthusiastically held their hands up to make a Nazi salute. \"No one will honor us for losing gracefully, no one mourns the great crimes committed against us,\" Spencer continued, talking about the white race. \"For us, it is conquer or die.\" He goes on to slam the press, using the term l\u00fcgenpresse, a German word Nazis used for their media critics, and appearing to target Jews especially in the media. \"One wonders if these people are people at all, or instead soulless golem,\" Spencer said, referring apparently to the folklore of clay figure brought to life by rabbis in to protect the Jews. \"America was, until this past generation, a white country, designed for ourselves and our posterity. It is our creation, it is our inheritance, and it belongs to us,\" Spencer continued, drawing a standing ovation and more Nazi salutes. Greg Dixon contributed.",

WANG: Gaddis has been stopping by this art supply store for foam boards to make protest signs. GADDIS: We're just meeting at the tower every night if you ever want to tag along. SAM GOODSELL: I was there Saturday. WANG: That's Sam Goodsell, who works at this store. And he says they've been selling a lot of foam boards. GOODSELL: It activated a lot of people who don't usually do this, you know, march in the streets. WANG: Goodsell marched partly because he's worried about friends who've been told by strangers to go back to China or Mexico since the election. GOODSELL: It kind of, like, emboldened the bigots to say what they want now. WANG: But protesters underneath the city are having their say, too. On hundreds of brightly colored Post-it notes stuck to tile walls in the Union Square subway station. So you just wrote a note on this wall here... LISA DONTZIN: I've been writing notes almost every day. WANG: Lisa Dontzin of Manhattan says when she looks around the city now, she sees fear. And it reminds her of the days after 9/11. DONTZIN: Stay strong, get involved, love trumps hate and bigotry. You know, just because the election is over our voices aren't shut down. We still have a voice. And that's what makes America great already. (SOUNDBITE OF HORN HONKING) UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #1: (Cheering). WANG: Back above ground, drivers cheer on a small group of protesters pinned inside police barricades outside of Trump Tower where there's also the occasional shout from Trump supporters. UNIDENTITIED MAN #1: It's over. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: What's over, democracy? UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Johnny, it's over. Johnny, it's over. Live with it. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: The fight for democracy is never over. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Live with it. It's over, Johnny. WANG: Long Island resident Denise Riggio is living with it. She says she has accepted Donald Trump as our next president. DENISE RIGGIO: Well, I protested last week with some people who were screaming and chanting things like, you know, not my president and things like that. I didn't agree with that. WANG: But she worries about women's abortion rights and reports of harassment against women and people of color. She says she wants to remind Donald Trump about his responsibility now towards all Americans. RIGGIO: This isn't about big government or small government. This isn't about not wanting jobs. Of course, I want jobs. I want him to choose the right people who will give him good counsel and really think about all people, not just some. WANG: And she says making that happen will take more than protests. RIGGIO: So the time for whining is almost over. And people need to move on and be organized. WANG: And there are more demonstrations planned this weekend in New York and other blue cities and mostly blue states. For some protesters it's part of a Hail Mary to pressure the Electoral College to vote for Hillary Clinton next month or to bring attention to specific issues. For others, it's more of a form of therapy as they try to figure out what their country will look like after Donald Trump becomes president in January. Hansi Lo Wang, NPR News, New York.

            "article_content": "Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who is now overseeing President-elect Donald Trump's transition, walks by reporters while exiting Trump Tower on Tuesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who is now overseeing President-elect Donald Trump's transition, walks by reporters while exiting Trump Tower on Tuesday. President-elect Donald Trump's first week after pulling off an upset victory has had plenty of missteps. The rocky start to his transition planning that one source described to CNN as a \"knife fight\" has done little to assure his critics and skeptical Republicans that he'll have a smooth ascension to the Oval Office surrounded by qualified advisers. Trump denies that the transition is rocky. From the outset, his transition chief throughout the campaign, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, had to be replaced with Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Just days before the election, Christie's top aides were convicted of conspiracy and fraud in the \"Bridgegate\" scandal, and a pall of scandal hung over one of Trump's most loyal backers, who likely would have had a top job in the new administration. But with Pence at the helm, the Indiana governor has apparently done little to steady the ship or stop leaks to the media. Trump's closing refrain of his campaign was that he would \"drain the swamp\" in Washington, but his initial transition team was flush with lobbyists. In one of his first moves, Pence ordered the removal of all lobbyists, according to the Wall Street Journal. Several very experienced members of the transition team \u2014 whose presence gave wary lawmakers comfort \u2014 have departed too. Former Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers, who was a chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, stepped down; several reports say he was let go. He had been seen as a possible candidate to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, but NBC News reported he was ousted in what two sources close to the former congressman described as a \"Stalinesque purge\" of Christie loyalists. \"I think there is some confusion going on about a chain of command coming out of New York. Hopefully they'll get that settled pretty soon. I think they're going to need to do it, because as this clock ticks, all of these decisions become more important,\" Rogers told CNN's Anderson Cooper. CNN also reported that the overhaul of Christie's picks was spearheaded by Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. There's no love lost between Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump, and Christie, who prosecuted Kushner's father for tax evasion and witness tampering in 2004 as a U.S. attorney. Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Trump spokesman Jason Miller denied that Kushner was responsible for pushing Christie and his allies off the team. Still, his reported instigation of removing experienced hands like Rogers was described to CNN by sources as a \"knife fight\" that was \"mainly divided along the lines of establishment Republican operatives against more nontraditional influences on national security issues.\" Former State Department official Eliot Cohen, who served under President George W. Bush, had been a Trump critic but said he was open to advising him after Trump won. But on Tuesday, Cohen had done a complete turnaround, painting the transition as chaotic and motivated by revenge. After exchange w Trump transition team, changed my recommendation: stay away. They're angry, arrogant, screaming \"you LOST!\"  Will be ugly. Cohen later told the New York Times in an interview that \"Trump transition officials had excoriated him after he offered some names of people who might serve in the new administration, but only if they felt departments were led by credible people.\" \"They think of these jobs as lollipops,\" Cohen told the Times. President-elect Trump's outreach to and from foreign leaders has been confusing and disorderly too, per the Times: \"Prominent American allies were in the meantime scrambling to figure out how and when to contact Mr. Trump. At times, they have been patched through to him in his luxury office tower with little warning, according to a Western diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail private conversations. \"President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt was the first to reach Mr. Trump for such a call last Wednesday, followed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel not long afterward. But that was about 24 hours before Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain got through \u2014 a striking break from diplomatic practice given the close alliance between the United States and Britain.\" On Monday Trump touted his call with Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 whom he repeatedly praised throughout the campaign even as U.S. intelligence found the Russian government had hacked into the Democratic National Committee to try to influence the American elections. That drew a sharp rebuke from Arizona Sen. John McCain, the 2008 GOP presidential nominee, who said that Putin's promises of improved U.S.-Russia relations should be taken with \"as much faith in such statements as any other made by a former KGB agent who has plunged his country into tyranny, murdered his political opponents, invaded his neighbors, threatened America's allies, and attempted to undermine America's elections.\" Trump's rumored choices for America's top diplomat have also been met with controversy. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump's most passionate surrogates during the campaign, is said to be atop the list. But Politico reported Tuesday that consulting work he did for foreign governments and companies, and money he accepted from places like Qatar and Venezuela and from Iranian exiles, could prove problematic \u2014 not to say that Trump repeatedly criticized the Clinton Foundation for taking similar gifts from foreign governments. Another name that has surfaced to lead the State Department has been former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who was among the challengers to Trump during the GOP primaries, said on CNN Tuesday that the former Bush appointee was \"totally unfit\" for the job, and also dismissed Giuliani as a choice. In a closely divided Senate, where the GOP is expected to have a 52-48 advantage, Republican defections will matter. All of the skirmishes over Trump's transition team and possible Cabinet picks may pale in comparison to furor over his controversial appointment of former Breitbart News head and Trump campaign CEO Steve Bannon to be his senior counselor in the White House. Bannon has ties to the alt-right movement that's associated with white nationalism. Trump has also denied reports that he has sought security clearances for his children, Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric. NBC News reported Tuesday night that Trump had requested a security clearance for Kushner, his son-in-law, so that he could join him for his daily security briefings. Trump tweeted Tuesday denying that the transition was in turmoil. But he added a bit of bombast and suspense typical of his background as a reality TV host: Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are! And, in typical Trump fashion, he also took shots at the press, in particular the New York Times, calling its reporting \"inaccurate\": The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. It is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders. I have recieved and taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said. Russia, U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and more. I am always available to them. @nytimes is just upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me.",

            "article_content": "At his first news conference following his party's shocking loss at the ballot box last week, President Obama appeared to needle Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign for not paying enough attention to rural voters who eventually handed President-elect Donald Trump the upset victory. \"When your team loses, everybody gets deflated, and it's hard, and it's challenging,\" Obama said. \"I think it's a healthy thing for the Democratic Party to go through some reflection.\" \"We have to compete everywhere. We have to show up everywhere,\" the president said, noting that when he was campaigning he went to many rural places in a very white, blue-collar state like Iowa and ended up winning twice. Clinton lost the state by 10 points. \"I won Iowa not because the demographics dictated that I would win Iowa,\" Obama continued. \"It was because I spent 87 days going to every small town.\" But now the two-term Democratic president is tasked with overseeing a peaceful transfer of power to a man he repeatedly called unqualified to succeed him in the Oval Office. \"This office is bigger than any one person, and that's why ensuring a smooth transition is so important,\" the president said, taking questions before he departs on a weeklong trip to Greece, Germany and Peru to meet with foreign leaders. Throughout much of the news conference, it sounded like Obama was trying to reassure many worried Americans and leaders abroad about an incoming President Trump. He said that at their meeting last week, the president-elect said he would maintain the U.S. commitment to NATO \u2014 something the GOP nominee himself questioned on the campaign trail. \"This office has a way of waking you up. Campaigning is different from governing. I think he recognizes that,\" the president continued, echoing a theme he would return to many times. \"I don't think any president comes in saying to himself, 'I want to make people angry, or alienate half the country,' \" Obama said, striking a hopeful tone and adding that he didn't believe Trump was \"ideological. Ultimately he's pragmatic.\" He was pressed by reporters on some of Trump's recent hires, notably former Breitbart News Chairman Steve Bannon to be a senior adviser and chief strategist. Bannon and Breitbart have ties to the alt-right movement, which is associated with white nationalism. Obama sidestepped a direct question on Bannon, instead simply saying, \"It would not be appropriate for me to comment on every appointment the president-elect starts making.\" But the president had words of caution for his unlikely successor, too. \"Do I have concerns? Absolutely. He and I differ on a whole bunch of issues,\" Obama said, adding that there are \"certain elements of his temperament that will not serve him well, unless he recognizes them and corrects [them].\"",

President Obama used his final address to the United Nations General Assembly to make a spirited argument for international cooperation, while also delivering a stern warning about the countervailing forces of nationalism and tribal identity that have been gaining momentum in both the U.S. and Europe. Obama's message seemed tailored as much for American voters looking towards the November election as for the international leaders who assembled in New York City. \"We all face a choice,\" Obama said. \"We can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration. Or we can retreat into a world sharply divided, and ultimately in conflict, along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion.\" The president conceded that many people have grown frustrated with economic inequality and governments they see as unresponsive--attitudes that have helped fuel the rise of GOP presidential hopeful Donald Trump in this country as well as the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom. \"As these real problems have been neglected, alternative visions of the world have pressed forward,\" Obama said. He urged voters to reject what he called \"crude populism \u2014 sometimes from the far left, but more often from the far right \u2014 which seeks to restore what they believe was a better, simpler age free of outside contamination.\" The president cautioned that a retreat behind high barriers against trade and immigration would ultimately be self-defeating. \"Today, a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself,\" he said. Instead, Obama pushed for what he called a \"course correction,\" so national governments are more responsive to their people and the benefits of globalization are more broadly shared. \"A world in which one percent of humanity controls as much wealth as the other 99 percent will never be stable,\" he said. The president credited global economic integration with lifting billions of people out of poverty over the last quarter-century. \"We cannot unwind integration any more than we can stuff technology back into a box,\" Obama said. \"If we start resorting to trade wars, market distorting subsidies, beggar thy neighbor policies, an over-reliance on natural resources instead of innovation \u2014 these approaches will make us poorer, collectively, and they are more like to lead to conflict.\" This is the eighth time Obama has addressed the General Assembly and he catalogued some of the foreign policy achievements of his time in office including the Iran nuclear deal, the United States' diplomatic opening to Cuba, and a global climate agreement. But the speech was less a celebration of the past than a cautionary tale about the future, as he sees it, if people around the world choose tribalism and strong-man leaders. \"Time and again, human beings have believed that they finally arrived at a period of enlightenment only to repeat, then, cycles of conflict and suffering,\" Obama said. \"Each nation can choose to reject those who appeal to our worst impulses and embrace those who appeal to our best.\"",

In a speech Thursday in Reno, Nev., Hillary Clinton argued that Donald Trump is \"helping a radical fringe\" \u2014 the alt-right \u2014 take over the Republican Party. \"From the start, Donald Trump has built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia. He's taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over one of America's two major political parties,\" she said. \"His disregard for the values that make our country great is profoundly dangerous.\" The alt-right has been described as a loose movement, largely fueled online, that ranges from fringe conservatism to white nationalism, racism and anti-Semitism. As explained by NBC News, it is a \"blanket term for a loose gathering of conservatives primarily based online that can include everyone from critics of so-called 'political correctness' on college campuses to hardcore white supremacists and neo-Nazis.\" Clinton also hit Trump for his recent hiring of Steve Bannon of conservative news site Breitbart. A \"de facto merger between Breitbart and the Trump Campaign represents a landmark achievement for the 'Alt-Right,' \" she continued. \"A fringe element has effectively taken over the Republican Party.\" \"All of this adds up to something we've never seen before. Of course there's always been a paranoid fringe in our politics, steeped in racial resentment. But it's never had the nominee of a major party stoking it, encouraging it, and giving it a national megaphone. Until now,\" she said. Clinton also blasted Trump for quipping that President Obama founded ISIS, proposing a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. (that proposal appears to have softened) and not quickly condemning the support of former KKK leader David Duke. \"He says he wants to 'make America great again,' but his real message remains 'Make America hate again.'\" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Thursday's speech \"proved to the American public what we have known all along \u2013 Hillary Clinton has no hope, no vision and no ideas for the future of our country.\" Conway continued: \"Clinton lied about her emails, she lied about Colin Powell, and today she lied about Donald Trump. Donald Trump is talking about issues; Hillary Clinton is talking about Donald Trump. Today, as she took a break from her Hillary-in-Hiding Tour, she missed another opportunity to talk about education, infrastructure, terrorism, healthcare, the economy and energy. We're living in her head rent-free, and that must terrify the political insiders who want to keep things exactly the way they are.\" There's a reason the most hateful fringe of the right wing is supporting Donald Trump.https://t.co/AqB3DM2m0N In anticipation of Clinton's speech and response to an earlier ad from the Clinton campaign, Trump addressed the allegation in his own speech earlier in the day Thursday. Trump said that Clinton is \"going to accuse decent Americans who support this campaign, your campaign, of being racist, which we're not. It's the oldest play in the Democratic playbook.\" \"The people of this country who want their laws enforced and respected, respected by all, and who want their borders secured are not racist,\" Trump said. Clinton also released an ad Thursday arguing \"there's a reason the most hateful fringe of the right wing is supporting Donald Trump\": A statement from Trump campaign proxy Pastor Mark Burns called on Clinton to disavow the video: \"Hillary Clinton and her campaign went to a disgusting new low today as they released a video tying the Trump Campaign with horrific racial images. This type of rhetoric and repulsive advertising is revolting and completely beyond the pale. I call on Hillary Clinton to disavow this video and her campaign for this sickening act that has no place in our world.\" A number of news outlets have reported on and explained the alt-right.

Organizers of this week's Republican National Convention unveiled their program and theme late Sunday, on the eve of the gathering's first session. The theme \u2014 \"Make America Great Again\" \u2014 will surprise no one who has heard of Donald Trump and been sentient in the year 2016. Many people may not even realize that conventions have themes, as most are forgotten soon after the last balloon has fallen. But as the Trump convention gets underway, it's worth a moment of reflection on the theme of the last Republican nominating extravaganza. In 2012, in Tampa, the giant letters looming over the RNC podium proclaimed: \"WE BUILT THAT.\" The sentiment might have been lost on a casual viewer, but it was a retort to something President Obama had said about government support for business. \"If you have a business,\" Obama had told a crowd at a rally, \"you didn't build that.\" It sounded shocking, but the president had gone on to say that nothing significant gets done by just one person alone. Any business needs roads and police and fire protection and courts and schools and other public sector contributions. Still, the \"you didn't build that\" meme caught fire that spring of 2012, with the flames fanned by gusts of commentary from conservatives. And so it became a motto quite natural for a convention nominating a businessman in Mitt Romney and a pro-business member of Congress in Paul Ryan. Unfortunately, the theme may have been misunderstood by some. It morphed in some minds into a claim of ownership and enfranchisement, a celebration of the haves, the proud and the established. When Romney spoke of \"makers and takers,\" it was clear he saw his party as the former and the Democrats as the latter. Popular enough among partisan Republicans, this message proved to have limited crossover appeal. The convention in Cleveland this week is quite a different affair. Although Trump likes to describe himself as a builder, it is fair to say the GOP at this juncture looks less like a sound, intentional structure than an exercise in deconstruction. Scores of perennial convention attendees, including former presidents and presidential nominees, governors, senators and congressional leaders, are conspicuous by their absence. Few of Trump's former rivals for the Republican nomination will be present, and not all of those attending have even endorsed him. Even on the convention's eve, dissidents persisted in talking up delegate revolt. They held out a fleeting hope that a \"conscience vote\" might defy the results of the primaries and upset Trump's first-ballot victory. Most of the delegates here are not in rebellion. And there is surely something that could be called the \"House That Trump Built.\" But, even so, pollsters continue to find nearly half the Republicans nationwide wish they did not have to live in it. How can this be? Trump has won more votes than anyone before him in Republican primaries and caucuses. How can there be such resistance to the winner in what should be his own ranks? Republicans seeking answers might recall the \"We Built That\" theme from 2012. Because the party that Trump has taken over this year has been building toward a takeover by someone such as Trump for decades. Once a party of rigorous hierarchy, Republicans were said to \"fall in line\" behind a sequence of establishment champions who waited their turns. But this chain of command has weakened since the loss to Obama in 2008. A Gallup Poll in 2011 found nearly three-fifths of all Republicans could not name a favorite for the 2012 nomination. (Romney finished first as the choice of just 13 percent.) Four years later, the field was wide open once again. The establishment tried to rally around Jeb Bush, son and brother of former presidents. But even that dynasty and the $100 million it quickly raised were not enough to scare off more than a dozen serious rivals. The latest Bush scion was dismissed in the first weeks of voting. Trump emerged early as an unconventional front-runner and won the key contests, particularly in the South. Lifelong students of American politics were stunned to see a thrice-married New York billionaire casino owner win in Dixie, running at least even among self-described evangelical Christians. Those voters, combined with working-class white men across several regions, propelled Trump to a lead in delegates that gradually became insurmountable. The anti-Trump vote was divided among several rivals who chose not to take him on directly until it was too late. Each kept waiting to inherit Trump's backers when the upstart inevitably faded. But he never did. How did it become possible for the Republican Party to sort itself out in this way? To some degree, it was a vulnerability born of success. If it had not grown so strong in the South, among displaced workers, white evangelicals and older white males without college degrees, the GOP might not be crowning a champion chosen by these voters. Of course, the Republican Party has added these newer sources of votes to its traditional strongholds quite deliberately and with great effort over many years. But now they have come to supplant the traditional party strongholds as the wellspring of party power. And they are not as inclined to follow establishment predilections. If you want a pivotal year in this history, you might choose 1964. The Civil Rights Act was passed because Republicans of that time provided the votes to break the filibuster by Southern Democratic senators. One Republican who did not support the bill was Barry Goldwater of Arizona, who won the party's presidential nomination that same summer. Goldwater won only five states outside his home state that November, and they were all in the Deep South. Four years later, Richard Nixon and his \"Southern Strategy\" reclaimed the White House for the Republicans. Despite Alabama Gov. George Wallace's third-party candidacy, Nixon won five states from the old Confederacy plus Oklahoma, Missouri and Kentucky. Four years later, Nixon swept the region. With the exception of the election of Jimmy Carter in 1976, the South in presidential elections has been primarily Republican since. In years when Republicans won (1980, 1984, 1988, 2000 and 2004), their Electoral College majorities have relied heavily on their domination in the South. And since November 1994, the majority of governorships, Senate seats and House seats in the South have been held by Republicans. More recently, the GOP has come to rule in Dixie's state legislatures as well. One would expect the region to produce presidential contenders of its own. And it has, including half a dozen of its own officeholders and former officeholders who ran in 2016. But it was Trump who had his way in most of the primaries there. His \"America First\" mix of military strength, economic nationalism, support for growing entitlement programs (which most Republicans want to restrain), fierce resistance to illegal immigration and opposition to existing trade deals found resonance in the region and embarrassed its \"favorite son\" candidates. Some social scientists believe that in another decade or less, the changing demographics of the South will make nearly all its states competitive between the parties. It also appears clear that younger voters nationwide are less likely to support Trump. These factors combined suggest the Trump coalition that has emerged may be short-lived. But even if it proves transitory, it is a phenomenon arising from real historical trends and deep springs of voter sentiment from which the Republican Party has been benefiting for nearly half a century.",

Short/ Universal Studios\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Purge: Election Year The Purge series is all concept, no execution. (Forgive the criminally tasteless pun; some brains never stop Purging.) The three films (The Purge (2013), The Purge: Anarchy (2014) and now The Purge: Election Year) come with a B-movie hook that's just the right amount of idiotic: a future U.S. government sanctions one annual night of crime with no repercussions, then waits for its citizens to kill each other. John Carpenter would have had a lot of fun with this. But he wouldn't have made a franchise this visually ugly and technically incompetent, with scenes of nothing but garish close-ups, ponderous dialogue, and stagnant momentum. It's clear that James DeMonaco, the New Founding Father of the franchise \u2014 he wrote and directed all three Purge films \u2014 doesn't have the chops to make a great dystopian movie. But give him three tries, and he can at least figure out what that movie should be about. After the inert home-invasion action of the first film and the haphazard world-building of the second, DeMonaco has realized he can get better mileage by simply Purging our image of America itself. This silly idea has become more relevant not because it's grown in intelligence, but because the news keeps giving reminders that our culture is already at its level. The Purge: Election Year is content to pick at a scab until it festers, to call out the uneasiness many of us now feel in our American skins. The film's tagline, \"Keep America Great,\" will herald a gravy train of warped images, mashing together symbols from politics, religion, nationalism, and gun culture into a bubbling bloody smoothie of death. Cleverest of the bunch is the group of foreigners embarking on a night of \"murder tourism,\" letting out their violent, destructive urges the good ol' American way. We see them clad in patriotic costumes (Uncle Sam, Lady Liberty) while wielding assault rifles and chainsaws. There are also stacks of dead bodies at the foot of the Lincoln Memorial, discussions of \"Purge Insurance\" for small businesses, and a psychotic schoolgirl (Brittany Mirabile) who just killed her parents and is willing to murder a total stranger over a candy bar. And the climax? My friends, the climax is set at a church's midnight \"Purge Mass\" where a bloodthirsty pastor carts out ritual sacrifices before the Virgin Mary and instructs his congregants to \"Purge and Purify.\" There's very little continuity between films, all the better for keeping this series going beyond the wills of actor contracts. We get one significant returning face, Frank Grillo's pointy-jawed grimacing good guy Leo, now working security detail for a charismatic young senator (Elizabeth Mitchell) who's campaigning for President on the promise of eliminating the signature orgy of legalized madness. Come Purge night, this makes the senator the target of a government conspiracy \u2014 though who needs conspiracies in a world where everyone's OK with murdering each other for sport? Anyway, there are mercenaries after the politician, and these baddies are helpful enough to sew swastikas, Confederate flags, and \"White Power\" badges onto their military-grade uniforms. On the run through the streets of Future Washington, D.C. (actually Present-Day Rhode Island), the two heroes make alliances with a struggling deli owner (Mykelti Williamson, American Dreamin' since he was Bubba in Forrest Gump); his loyal Mexican employee (Joseph Julian Soria); and a former Purge superstar (Betty Gabriel) who now drives an armored medical van to aid victims. For once, the racial makeup of a horror movie doesn't doom every character of color, and we get treated to lines like, \"It's Purge Night, you don't sneak up on black people!\" Such pockets of \u2014 well, not intelligence exactly, but at least sustenance -- pop up now and again throughout Election Year's bloated 105-minute runtime. (Like a real election year, this movie is too long and appeals to our baser instincts.) The moments burn bright but dissipate quickly, because without a steady hand to guide them into coherent moviemaking they are but mere blips on a Purger's radar. If we continue to vote this franchise into the position of cultural relevance, it might be time to start demanding more from our cinematic elected officials.",

            "article_content": "President Obama is warning against financial and international \"hysteria\" in the wake of last week's vote by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. \"I think that the best way to think about this is, a pause button has been pressed on the project of full European integration,\" Obama said of the so-called \"Brexit\" decision in a wide-ranging interview with NPR's Steve Inskeep. \"I would not overstate it,\" the president continued. \"There's been a little bit of hysteria post-Brexit vote, as if somehow NATO's gone, the trans-Atlantic alliance is dissolving, and every country is rushing off to its own corner. That's not what's happening.\" After the vote last week by one of the U.S.'s most important allies, Obama said he respected the country's decision, which he said \"speaks to the ongoing changes and challenges that are raised by globalization.\" Obama, like many world leaders, had opposed such a move. Following the surprising decision by Britain, stocks fell domestically and internationally. While the president had remained restrained in his immediate response to the vote, Vice President Joe Biden was more blunt. Speaking in Ireland on Friday, Biden warned against the \"reactionary politicians and demagogues peddling xenophobia, nationalism and isolationism.\" Many have drawn comparisons to the U.K.'s decision in the wake of concerns about terrorism and immigration to the same sentiment fueling the rise of presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump in the United States. But speaking to NPR's Inskeep, Obama said the Brexit vote was largely a reaction to a rapidly growing EU \"that was probably moving faster and without as much consensus as it should have.\" \"I think this will be a moment when all of Europe says, 'Let's take a breath and let's figure out how do we maintain some of our national identities, how do we preserve the benefits of integration, and how do we deal with some of the frustrations that our own voters are feeling,' \" the president predicted. Ultimately, Obama said, he doesn't \"anticipate that there is going to be major cataclysmic changes as a consequence of this.\" \"Keep in mind that Norway is not a member of the European Union, but Norway is one of our closest allies,\" Obama added. \"They align themselves on almost every issue with Europe and us. They are a place that is continually supporting the kinds of initiatives internationally that we support, and, if over the course of what is going to be at least a two-year negotiation between England and Europe, Great Britain ends up being affiliated to Europe like Norway is, the average person is not going to notice a big change.\" Even if the Brexit decision was fueled by populist anger, Obama argued, that supporting Trump was not the way to register such frustration. \"Mr. Trump embodies global elites and has taken full advantage of it his entire life,\" the president said. \"So, he's hardly a spokesperson \u2014 a legitimate spokesperson \u2014 for a populist surge of working-class people on either side of the Atlantic.\"",

The big question is what effect this year's populist politics will have on both parties over time. Populism is one of the most important forces in American politics today. Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump have both tapped into widespread frustrations against the elites and the establishment. It's not hard to see where the rage at a rigged system comes from. Washington is gridlocked, the economy isn't growing fast enough and what growth there is hasn't been shared equally. Too many people feel left behind. University of Wisconsin political science professor Kathy Cramer has been tracking the increasingly populist sentiments of Wisconsin voters for the past nine years by listening to groups of people who meet on their own most every morning. They are the \"regulars\" who get together in gas stations and diners and McDonald's and maybe places of worship. Cramer's groups foreshadowed the angry voters of 2016. They felt ignored or dismissed by politicians, the media, the government and big business. Over the years what Cramer saw was that this resentment grew more intense, setting the stage for the explosion of populist politics this year. \"What I saw was people feeling a whole lot of economic stress, wanting some explanation for why they were having such a hard time making ends meet,\" said Cramer, \"and then placing the blame on other people in the population and the government.\" The big changes that caused their distress \u2014 demographics, globalization, wage stagnation, de-industrialization \u2014 are abstract and can be hard to understand. But populism has always told a simpler story with a defined villain. In the past, it might have been the gold standard or welfare queens. Now it's free trade, immigrants, billionaires or the campaign finance system. \"The things that are our biggest stresses these days are these very abstract, social change phenomena,\" said Cramer, \"and making an argument about that doesn't get you very far. It's not very mobilizing. But if you can give people a crystal-clear target of blame, it's much easier to rally people behind you.\" And that's exactly what Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump have done. Sanders blames a rigged economy, corruption on Wall Street, and billionaires. Trump's villains are Mexicans, politicians, free trade deals. Trump recently campaigned in Indiana excoriating his favorite corporate target \u2014 the Carrier air conditioner company, for leaving the state and moving to Mexico. In California, he held a rally featuring people whose relatives had been killed by immigrants in the country illegally. The big question is what effect this year's populist politics will have on both parties over time. In the past, populist movements have forced a realignment or a reshuffling of voters. Think George Wallace leading Southern whites out of the Democratic Party in the late '60s and early '70s. That kind of big shift in voter allegiance is probably not in the cards. There are not many socially conservative, economically populist white Democrats left that could switch to the Republicans. And there are not that many socially liberal, upscale white Republicans left who could switch to the Democrats. \"I think the party coalitions are pretty well defined,\" said Michael Lind of the New America Foundation. \"The civil wars within the parties are about defining the party platforms more than the party coalitions.\" For the Republicans, that civil war might lead to a debate about a new policy agenda, a more populist agenda that's less friendly to big business and the wealthy and more attuned to the concerns of the white working class. Henry Olsen, the author of The Four Faces Of The Republican Party, sees that as the lesson of this year's Republican primaries. \"Any ambitious politician has seen that there are millions of voters who can be mobilized using populist rhetoric who had not voted in any Republican presidential primary for the last 20 years,\" Olsen said. \"You probably won't see an identical Trump-like figure in future years. But anti-trade, more nativist, more anti-free markets are there for the taking in the Republican Party. And that will influence campaigns and candidates for years to come.\" For the Democrats, populism is also here to stay even though it hasn't had the kind of seismic consequences as it has for the GOP. Bill Galston, a former Clinton White House aide, says there's a lot of economic discontent among \"young adults, the working class and the middle class. So there's something real there for Democrats. And it's not going away.\" Hillary Clinton will have to absorb some of Sanders' left-wing populism as she moves forward to the general election. She has already moved toward Sanders on expanding Social Security, if not on breaking up the big banks. One consequence for both parties is that free trade agreements will have to be reframed as national security issues to have any chance at all to pass. And whoever is making foreign policy next year will have to deal with a new kind of nationalism. Galston calls it \"Americans first\" \u2014 which sounds pretty close to Donald Trump's foreign policy slogan. \"For people who are looking at the world through populist spectacles \u2014 their first question is now, what's in it for us?\" said Galston. \"And if there isn't a clear answer to that question, then the default conclusion is that what's going on beyond our borders is more of a burden than a benefit.\" Trump's populist positions are challenging the Republican Party's basic DNA, its core ideology about foreign policy and trade and limited government. On the Democratic side, Sanders doesn't represent as big a break with Democratic orthodoxy. He represents a wing of the party that's always been there but has just gotten to be a much bigger part of the coalition this year. In the past, there have been many populist movements in American politics. Sometimes they lead to great bursts of progressive reform. Sometimes they lead to nativism and isolationism. Where this populist moment ends up depends on who takes the oath of office in January.",

            "article_content": "It's been an unusual political year, to put it mildly, and you could write most of its story just by tracking its effects on the lexicon \u2014 the new words and new uses of old ones, some useful, some that we could do without. I'll come to some of these in a minute. But for my word of the year, I'll go with \"normal\" and its sister \"normalize.\" That may seem perverse for a year like this one, but when people are talking a lot about normal it's a sign that we're living in extraordinary times. Start with \"the new normal.\" Since the beginning of the century, that's how we've announced that events have forced us to accept new realities. In 2002 the new normal was long airport lines. In 2009 it was kids moving back in with their parents. Then came school lockdowns, soaring college debt and safe spaces. But when you search on the phrase now, the results are always political. For some it's an energized racist fringe. For a writer at Forbes it's Pizzagate and online vigilantism. For The Washington Post it's a succession of pre-presidential tweets, dramas and victory tours that swell to fill every corner of the mediasphere. But \"normal\" is a tricky word, with a Janus-faced meaning that it inherited from its origin as a medical term. It can refer to what's typical or expected, as in normal traffic or normal wear and tear. But it can also mean healthy or acceptable, as in a normal blood count. Geoff Nunberg But \"normal\" is a tricky word, with a Janus-faced meaning that it inherited from its origin as a medical term. It can refer to what's typical or expected, as in normal traffic or normal wear and tear. But it can also mean healthy or acceptable, as in a normal blood count. The meaning varies with context. When Newt Gingrich says that Donald Trump isn't normal, it means he's unconventional. When President Obama says it, it means he's bizarre. It's that meaning that people who are alarmed about the election results are getting at when they say that there's nothing normal about the new normal, and we shouldn't pretend otherwise. The air has been full of warnings about \"normalizing\" Trump's remarks and actions or the unsavory factions and ideologies that bubbled to the surface during his campaign. They come not just from Democrats and the left, but also from the \"never Trump\" conservatives like Charles Krauthammer and Bill Kristol. It's a genuinely new note in American politics. People may have challenged the legitimacy of both Bush and Obama, but nobody ever argued that they weren't normal. What people mean by \"normalize\" can be vague and open-ended. But one way or another, it usually comes down to a choice of language. People accused The New York Times of normalizing Trump's environmental adviser when they described him as a \"climate contrarian\" rather than a denialist, implying that his views were within the sphere of legitimate debate. The Times caught still more flak when it slid over Steve Bannon's role in building the site Breitbart.com into a platform for the so-called alt-right and described him in a headline as a \"combative populist,\" a term that could just as easily fit Bernie Sanders. The press has been particularly uneasy about normalizing that term \"alt-right,\" and with good reason. It doesn't really deserve to be a word in the first place. It was concocted by white nationalists as a rebranding move \u2014 it sounds like an indie music genre, as if you can make racism hip by slathering it in irony and squeezing it into a pair of skinny jeans. It embraces a collection of malignant Internet trolls, conspiracy theorists and the misogynists of what's called the \"manosphere\" \u2014 a whole basket of deplorables, to mention another word-of-the-year contender. Some people won't touch \"alt-right\" at all. You can get an extension for the Chrome browser that replaces every instance of \"alt-right\" with \"rebranded white nationalism.\" The mainstream media are wary of it, too \u2014 the AP urges reporters to put it quotes and to make its racist connotations explicit. But it's too late to drive it back into the shadows. The misgivings about the new normal most often come down to a sense that truth itself is on the ropes. Between Trump and Brexit, there was a lot of talk on both sides of the Atlantic last year about \"post-truth\" politics, which led Oxford Dictionaries to make \"post truth\" their word of the year. That term goes back to the early 1990s, but this really feels like a new era, with its epic tweetstorms, its fake news and its filter bubbles \u2014 more contenders for the word-of-the-year honors, though they've all been around for a while, too. And there's also the sense that people care less about facts than reassuring narratives. As a New York Times editorial pointed out, political figures no longer bother to spin the facts \u2014 now they feel free to ignore them. The establishment media seem to be sticking to their guns, though their own language is changing in response. It's become routine to see USA Today and nbc.com using words like \"baseless\" and \"bogus\" in the headlines over reports of dubious claims and stories. That's the new normal, too. I doubt whether \"normalize\" will have legs. As David Axelrod put it, it's already a hackneyed clich\u00e9. But the rules have changed for good. And so has the language. While we're ticking off all the new expressions, we might make a place for the ones that have dropped out of sight. It's been a while since I heard anybody talking about \"politics as usual.\"",

            "article_content": "The alt-right movement, which has been associated with white nationalism, is receiving new attention. The debate about the movement is also focusing on what is the best term to describe it.  LAKSHMI SINGH, HOST: The so-called alt-right is associated with a white nationalist movement, and it has received a lot of attention since the presidential election. Adrian Florido of NPR's Code Switch team reports on the debate emerging about whether alt-right is even the best term. ADRIAN FLORIDO, BYLINE: I met two of the alt-right's intellectual leaders at a meeting and press conference they held in Washington, D.C., last weekend. The first was Richard Spencer, who coined the term alt-right. And I asked him to respond to the argument that the term is really just a euphemism for white supremacy. RICHARD SPENCER: In some ways the alt-right is arbitrary. I mean, the whole point is that this is a movement of consciousness and identity for European people in the 21st century. That's what it is. If you don't like it, you can, you know, talk about linguistics. FLORIDO: Jared Taylor, another of the alt-right's leaders, also took issue with my question. JARED TAYLOR: The suggestion in your question is that this is some kind of attempt to hide the ball, to pretend that we are not who we are. No one is guilty of that. FLORIDO: They both said that alt-right is simply a name, and they rejected the suggestion that the movement is either racist or white supremacist. Ian Haney Lopez, a professor at UC Berkeley who has been closely observing the alt-right movement, says both of those statements are absurd. IAN HANEY LOPEZ: All you have to do is look at their website or read their material, and those conversations are replete with claims of white superiority, with the notion that whites are destined to rule, whites are destined to conquer. There is no doubt but that this belief in white nationalism is rooted in a claim of white supremacy. FLORIDO: Further evidence, he said, is a video that emerged this week showing Richard Spencer shouting hail Trump at the end of that conference last weekend, as supporters flashed Nazi salutes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SPENCER: Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory. (APPLAUSE) FLORIDO: Lopez says use of the term alt-right is an effort to make white supremacist views more palatable. LOPEZ: It's clearly a strategy designed to obfuscate the central tenets of the movement in a way that will hopefully allow that movement to enter mainstream discourse. That was the goal, and they've largely achieved that goal. FLORIDO: He points to how pervasive the term has become in just the last few months. Heidi Beirich tracks hate groups for the Southern Poverty Law Center. She thinks the term alt-right is just the latest way white supremacists have rebranded themselves since the Civil Rights Movement made their beliefs socially unacceptable. HEIDI BEIRICH: If you said I'm white supremacist, you weren't going to get talked to. So they rebranded to white nationalism in an attempt to still be in the conversation about politics in the United States. So it went from white supremacy to white nationalism and now from white nationalism to the alt-right or the alternative right. FLORIDO: But Beirich says this latest term has done something new and ingenious. BEIRICH: It specifically ditches the term white - right? - and it puts right in there. And what white supremacists were doing was to say we are part of the conservative coalition. We are part of the right wing. FLORIDO: The alt-right's leaders say that this is the kind of recognition they are trying to achieve. The president-elect has condemned the Nazi salutes in that conference video. He is standing behind his appointment of Steve Bannon, who the alt-right's leaders consider their strongest advocate in the Trump administration. Adrian Florido, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

On Thursday, both Obama and Merkel spoke of the importance of uniting their populations \u2014 and the challenges they've run into, from nationalist sentiments to the effects of social media. Obama also spoke about his successor, President-elect Donald Trump, and pointed to his own approval ratings as a sign that Americans aren't as dissatisfied with the results of globalism in the U.S. as it may seem. \"Based on current surveys of public opinion in the United States, it turns out that the majority of Americans think I've done a pretty good job\" in looking after the U.S. economy in a time of intense global shifts. Those surveys, Obama said, show that \"we haven't in fact gone too fast,\" as a reporter had suggested in a question about the pace of globalization and change. Obama also acknowledged that economic and social shifts of recent years have made some uneasy. The president said: \"But what is also true is that the American people, just like the German people, just like the British and people around the world, are seeing extraordinarily rapid change. The world is shrinking, economies have become much more integrated, and demographics are shifting. Because of the Internet and communications, the clash of cultures is much more direct. People feel, I think, less certain about their identity, less certain about economic security. They're looking for some means of control.\" It's up to national leaders, Obama said, to manage changes in technology and society along with global integration \"in a way that makes people feel more control, that gives them more confidence in their future \u2014 but does not resort to simplistic answers or divisions of race or tribe or crude nationalism, which I think can be contrasted to the pride and patriotism that we all feel about our respective countries.\" Worldwide, Obama predicted, \"our politics everywhere are going to be going through this bumpy phase.\" Leaders, he said, must now maintain core values and reach out to everyone who's been left behind by globalization, to \"address their concerns in constructive ways, as opposed to more destructive ways.\" Obama also singled out social media, saying that the ubiquity and nature of the platforms means that \"it's easier to make negative attacks and simplistic slogans than it is to communicate complex policies. But we'll figure it out.\" Answering a question about the rhetoric used by Trump and the current U.S. political scene, the president presented what came off as a diagnosis of the problems facing democracy in America \u2014 something that he repeatedly called \"hard work\": \"In the United States, if 43 percent of eligible voters do not vote, then democracy is weakened. If we are not serious about facts and what's true and what's not \u2014 and particularly in an age of social media where so many people are getting their information in soundbites and snippets off their phones \u2014 if we can't discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems. If people, whether they are conservative or liberal, left or right, are unwilling to compromise and engage in the democratic process, and are taking absolutist views and demonizing opponents, then democracy will break down.\" Merkel echoed many of those ideas and expanded on others, saying, \"I think we live in a period of profound transformation, very similar to when we had a transition from agricultural societies to industrial societies.\" Using the relocation of long-standing production lines to other countries, Merkel said, \"people tend to ask the question, 'Where's my place in this modern world?'\" The sentiment exists both in Germany and beyond \u2014 and it's up to world leaders to answer the question, she said. It's a high priority, Merkel said: \"Trying to keep a society together, trying to keep the older and the younger people together; trying to keep those who live in rural areas together with those who live in cities is one of the most important and most noble tasks of politicians these days \u2014 trying to see to it that each and every one can find his or her place. \"But those that belong purportedly to certain groups say, 'We are the people, and not the others' \u2014 that is something that we cannot allow to happen.\" The news conference also focused on Russia \u2014 including a question about whether Trump would support sanctions on Russia. Asked about how Trump might work with Russia, Obama said he hopes that Trump \"takes a similarly constructive approach\" in finding where U.S. and Russian interests align, but also that \"the president-elect also is willing to stand up to Russia where they are deviating from our values and international norms.\" Obama added, \"My hope is that he does not simply take a realpolitik approach, and suggest that if we just cut some deals with Russia, even if it hurts people or even if it violates international norms or even if it leaves smaller countries vulnerable or creates long-term problems in regions like Syria, that we just do whatever's convenient at the time.\" The president added that he's encouraged by Trump's statements that acknowledge the importance of maintaining stable ties to America's NATO allies. Of Russia, Obama said: \"I've sought a constructive relationship with Russia, but what I have also been is realistic in recognizing that there are some significant differences in how Russia views the world and how we view the world. The values that we talked about (here he gestured toward Merkel), the values of democracy and free speech, and international norms, and rule of law \u2014 respecting the ability of other countries to determine their own destiny and preserve their sovereignty and territorial integrity \u2014 those things are not something that we can set aside.\" Obama also called out Russia's involvement in hacking attacks, saying \"there has been very clear proof that they have engaged in cyber attacks.\" He added, \"This isn't new; it's not unique to Russia; there are a number of other states where we've seen low-level cyber attacks and industrial espionage and other behavior that we think should be out of bounds.\" Recalling his discussion about the issue with President Vladimir Putin , Obama said, \"I delivered a clear and forceful message, that though we recognize Russia's intelligence gathering will sometimes take place even if we don't like it, there's a difference between that and them either meddling with elections or going after private organizations or commercial entities.\" Saying that the U.S. will \"respond appropriately\" in such cases, Obama also called for the international community to develop standards and norms \"so that we don't see a cyber arms race\" as countries try to protect vulnerable infrastructure and economies. Obama's current visit to Germany comes as a sort of bookend to his trip there as a candidate in 2008, when he addressed a crowd of thousands at Berlin's Victory Column. In that 2008 speech, Obama discussed \"global citizenship\": \"Yes, there have been differences between America and Europe. No doubt, there will be differences in the future. But the burdens of global citizenship continue to bind us together. A change of leadership in Washington will not lift this burden. In this new century, Americans and Europeans alike will be required to do more \u2013 not less. Partnership and cooperation among nations is not a choice; it is the one way, the only way, to protect our common security and advance our common humanity.\"",

Michigan middle school students chanting \"build a wall\" at Latino classmates. A woman speaking a foreign language on a San Francisco Bay Area train being called an \"ugly, mean, evil, little pig.\" A Los Angeles student reportedly being teased that she was going to be deported. Since the presidential election, reports of intimidating and aggressive incidents toward minorities and women have surfaced across the country. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate incidents, has recorded more than 300 such reports in the past six days. SPLC spokesman Ryan Lenz tells The Two-Way that they \"span a number of different sorts of ideological motivators,\" including anti-black, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim and anti-woman attitudes. Rights groups have called for President-elect Donald Trump and other politicians to take a strong stand against intimidation. \"After a long campaign in which various ideologies from the radical right were given a direct conduit into the mainstream of American politics,\" Lenz says, \"it seems that with the election of President-elect Donald Trump, that these ideologies and those who adhere to them feel that they are legitimized or authorized in some way to act out in the public space where previously they existed only online.\" The only other comparable moment in this country since the turn of the 20th century was the flood of anti-Muslim incidents immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks, he adds. Trump was asked in a 60 Minutes interview that aired Sunday night about the widespread reports. He said he was \"saddened\" and called the reports \"terrible.\" Looking into the camera, he told the perpetrators to \"stop it\" and vowed to \"bring this country together.\" But a major political appointment on Sunday might fuel divisions: Trump tapped Stephen Bannon as his chief strategist. Bannon has served as head of Breitbart News, a far-right media outlet that has been a platform for the so-called alt-right movement, which espouses white nationalism. The SPLC says it hasn't been able to independently verify all of the recent reports. And it's worth noting that \"some anti-immigrant and other bullying stories are spreading unchecked on social media,\" as NPR's Kirk Siegler reported, \"but there are a growing number of confirmed investigations into alleged harassment and hate crimes.\" For example, a diverse Episcopal church in Silver Spring, Md., found racist graffiti scrawled in several spots prior to Sunday's services, member station WAMU reports. The messages read, \"Trump Nation Whites only.\" On one side an invitation to pray and love and on the other racist xenophobic hatred- Hillandale Church @wamu885news pic.twitter.com/9bspZDXcIS In Philadelphia, the Anti-Defamation League says swastikas combined with pro-Trump graffiti were discovered last Wednesday on an abandoned storefront. Many of these reports are coming from school and university campuses. At Minnesota's Maple Grove Senior High School, a bathroom stall was said to have been defaced with \"#whitesonly,\" \"#whiteamerica\" and \"Trump,\" among others. \"Students say they now worry about going to class,\" according to a local CBS affiliate. In a letter to parents, the school's principal said he was \"horrified\" and that it \"goes against everything for which our school stands.\" At San Diego State University, a student was walking in the stairwell of a parking structure when two men confronted her and robbed her, according to the police report, which says the men \"made comments about President-Elect Trump and the Muslim community.\" Many school districts around the country are proactively providing support and counseling to students, while trying to open up a dialogue in classrooms. \"We must ensure that our students feel safe by providing safe and respectful learning communities,\" Boston Public School Superintendent Tommy Chang said in a letter to parents the day after the election, as The Washington Post reported. In another letter sent the same day, Denver Public Schools Superintendent Tom Boasberg told parents, \"We encourage students, families and educators to talk, to create safe spaces where hopes, fears and differences can be raised \u2014 spaces where we can challenge each other to reach common ground on issues that divide us.\" A third-grade teacher in Philadelphia is responding by leading her students in anti-racist, empowering affirmations, as NPR's Eyder Peralta reports. \"I can do anything I put my mind to,\" the students say in unison in a video that has been viewed 3.2 million times. Teacher Jasmyn Wright posted the video on Facebook and says that ultimately, it's up to students \"to face adversity and defeat it.\" Larry Ferlazzo of Sacramento, Calif., asked his students, who include many immigrants, to write letters to Trump himself expressing their fears about the election. Several of the notes were published by the Post. \"During the election, some of the things you said made us feel really bad for myself and my family and others. It really made me cry,\" says one student from Afghanistan. \"My family and I hope you will be nice and don't be racist and love us back.\"",

His supporters entered Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone and parliament the same day. Dubbed by Newsweek a decade ago as \"the most dangerous man in Iraq,\" Muqtada al-Sadr, the figure at the center of Iraq's current political storm, isn't the man many might recall from the past. A firebrand Shiite cleric who at first derived legitimacy from the prominence of his own father \u2014 a populist religious leader assassinated by Saddam Hussein's forces in 1999 \u2014 Sadr became best known after the 2003 U.S. invasion for leading tens of thousands of Iraqi Shiites, especially the poor, and for his propensity for brinkmanship and violence. His street power was unmatched, and he sanctioned brutal sectarian killings via his militia, the Mahdi Army, which battled both the Iraqi government and U.S. forces. Sadr, now 42, still holds tremendous sway, but has reinvented himself since then. He left Iraq for Qom, Iran, in 2008 \u2014 to study Islam, he said \u2014 and returned in 2011. He did away with the Mahdi Army and started up new militias, one of which, the Saraya al-Salam or Peace Brigades, has fought on the side of Iraq's government \u2014 and, by extension, the United States \u2014 against ISIS. Meanwhile, other Iranian-supported Iraqi Shiite militias have sprung up, largely eclipsing his own. And Sadr has turned his attention to politics. In 2012, Sadr called for the ouster of fellow Shiite Nouri al-Maliki, then the prime minister; two years later, his allies won 34 parliamentary seats in elections that brought current Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to power. These days, in an about-face from his virulent, anti-government past, a more mature Sadr claims to be on Abadi's side. Huge demonstrations that Sadr began orchestrating in March have urged a resolution to a months-long political crisis that has paralyzed Abadi's government, preventing it from pushing through needed reforms. \"Yes, yes, to Iraq; no, no to corruption!\" has been one slogan at Sadr-led rallies, in a deliberate nod to nationalism and unity, not parochialism. Aside from the specific machinations in Iraq's parliament, Sadr seems to be capitalizing on widespread anger at Iraqi institutions and commonplace corruption and incompetence. When his supporters stormed Baghdad's Green Zone \u2014 encompassing Iraq's government ministries, parliament and some embassies \u2014 over the weekend, it was chaotic but largely peaceful. \"It is misleading to depict the Sadrist storming of parliament as a revolutionary call to dissolve the institution,\" write Renad Mansour of the Carnegie Endowment and Michael David Clark of the University of Cambridge. \"On the contrary, Sadr wants parliament to remain and to function effectively without delays.\" The protesters did inflict \"property damage and violence against some individuals,\" the U.S. Embassy said in a statement expressing concern. But it emphasized that Iraq's government should \"move the political and economic reform process forward\" and urged \"all parties to come together to defeat [ISIS] and to support the aspirations of the Iraqi people.\" So what's next for Sadr? On Sunday, he ordered demonstrators to leave the Green Zone, and they obeyed. Some analysts see Sadr continuing as a key political figure, possibly even as \"the last man standing.\" For the moment, though, he has gone to Iran. Sadr's Baghdad office tells NPR that he left the country Monday.",

Turkish authorities seized the headquarters in a midnight raid. Not long ago, Turkey was held up as a regional model: a Muslim-majority state with a thriving democracy and a market economy. These days, though, it's more often seen as a country where a ruling party with no serious opposition is drifting toward authoritarian rule. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan led the Justice and Development Party (AKP in its Turkish acronym) to power in 2002, in a breakthrough victory for politicians gathered together from earlier, failed Islamist parties. The AKP has won every election since. For Turkish liberals like Sahin Alpay, the AKP's early days as pro-democracy reformers are now memories from another time. Alpay, a veteran newspaper columnist, remembers that first AKP platform fondly. It was, he says, \"the most liberal political party program ever in the history of the Turkish Republic.\" Alpay, now in his early 70s, has lived through much of that history. His grandparents came to Turkey from Greece in the upheavals that led to massive population transfers in the 1920s. His parents embraced the former elite, the so-called \"Kemalists,\" followers of the Republic's founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. They enforced a secular Turkish nationalism that brooked no dissent. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, shown here on Feb. 10 at his Ankara palace, remains popular with conservative and religious Turks, while his critics face a growing crackdown.\n                \n                    \n                    Yasin Bulbul/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, shown here on Feb. 10 at his Ankara palace, remains popular with conservative and religious Turks, while his critics face a growing crackdown. The young Alpay liked the secular part but was appalled by the Kemalists' undemocratic tactics, especially the military coups that regularly put down opposition parties in the latter half of the 20th century. So in 2002, when Erdogan and the AKP burst onto the scene, Alpay wrote a column headlined \"A Victory For Democracy.\" It wasn't Erdogan's working class background or charisma that attracted him, but the program of reforms he offered. Here was something new under the Turkish sun: a party run by devotees of political Islam that proposed something Ataturk never had, European-style democratic institutions and freedoms. \"The centerpiece of the program was, 'We want to have Turkey as member of the European Union, and we're going to reform the country,' \" Alpay says. \"And they had a clear vision of a market economy.\" Foreign investment soared and living standards began to rise. The death penalty was abolished and minorities gained basic rights. By this time, Alpay was a columnist for Zaman, a paper linked to Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based Turkish cleric and the AKP's powerful ally. Alpay wrote columns defending the ruling party against attempted coups and cheered as the military's longstanding dominance over Turkish politics was cut back. It wasn't until early 2011 that Alpay began to have doubts about where Erdogan was leading the country. The AKP had won another election decisively, and Erdogan gave a famous \"balcony speech\" in which he vowed to represent all Turks, not just those who voted for him. But Alpay took note of Erdogan's other speeches \u2014 the ones attacking an independent judiciary and calling for a strong Turkish president, an office Erdogan would later win. Then came the Arab Spring uprisings, which Alpay says gave AKP leaders dreams of Muslim Brotherhood-style governments across the region. Large anti-government protests in Istanbul in 2013 were crushed, with many demonstrators prosecuted. Opposition media outlets were at first threatened, and then sometimes taken over. Alpay now believes Erdogan no longer stands for reform \u2014 or even any particular ideology. Riot police officers walk past the headquarters of Zaman newspaper, surrounded by police barriers in Istanbul, on March 6. Police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse hundreds of protesters who gathered in support of the paper outside its headquarters.\n                \n                    \n                    Emrah Gurel/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Riot police officers walk past the headquarters of Zaman newspaper, surrounded by police barriers in Istanbul, on March 6. Police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse hundreds of protesters who gathered in support of the paper outside its headquarters. \"I think it's a gang of people who are united in their financial and political interests,\" he says. \"So it's a terrible situation, and I think Mr. Erdogan is leading the country into very, very dire times.\" These days, Erdogan remains popular with conservative and religious Turks, while his critics face a growing crackdown. The security forces are on the streets almost constantly, either responding to terrorist attacks or putting down protests. More than 1,000 academics were arrested for calling for peace with the Kurdish minority. Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook have been periodically shut down or filtered. As for Alpay, he can no longer air his opinions in the pages of the Zaman newspaper, since police stormed its offices and installed court-appointed trustees earlier this month. Overnight, the country's largest opposition paper began offering uncharacteristically glowing coverage of Erdogan's struggle against those he calls the \"accomplices of terror.\" In a recent speech, the president warned of further crackdowns. \"Being an academic, author, journalist or an NGO executive does not change the fact that this person indeed is a terrorist,\" he said. Civil liberties groups \u2014 who have heard autocratic leaders in other countries use similar logic to silence dissent \u2014 say with a divided and weak opposition, the country will likely face more attempts to bring the population to heel behind its powerful president.",

            "article_content": "Activists with the Black Lives Matter movement are figuring out how to continue pushing for more police accountability and other issues with Donald Trump in the White House.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Donald Trump's election has mobilized activists around this country, and that includes members of the Black Lives Matter movement. Some are concerned that the Trump administration will push back against their calls for more police accountability and also in other issues. NPR's Hansi Lo Wang recently checked in with some Black Lives Matter activists. This is part of our project with NPR's national desk looking at how Americans from all walks of life are moving forward from the election. And Hansi joins us on the line. Hey, Hansi. HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Hey, David. GREENE: So who exactly have you been talking to? WANG: Well, I talked to two of the women who actually came up with the name Black Lives Matter three years ago, and they've since started the Black Lives Matter network. It's more than 40 chapters in and out of the U.S., and they're calling Donald Trump a, quote, \"white supremacist.\" They think his rhetoric has been harmful to communities of color, and it's led to more reports of hate crimes since the election. And one co-founder told me that they don't plan to work with Donald Trump. This is Patrice Kahn Colors. She's based in LA, and here's what she said. PATRISSE KHAN-CULLORS: We're not going to be taking meetings with Donald Trump (laughter). We're not going to be sitting with his attorney general. What we will be doing is protesting. What we will be doing is calling for an end to white nationalism and fascism. WANG: Now, during the campaign, David, Donald Trump called the Black Lives Matter movement a, quote, \"threat.\" GREENE: Yeah. WANG: But it's really hard to say exactly what is Black Lives Matter because there is no one Black Lives Matter. They're a decentralized movement. There's no agreement in terms of tactics, strategy or priorities. For example, you know, some groups want to see more alignment with other marginalized groups, while others are committed to prioritizing issues of the black community first. So there's really a range of visions, depending on which activist you're talking to. GREENE: And this is exactly what some people who are involved in protest movements say can be the real problem - if there's no central mission or central organization, right? WANG: Well, the co-founders of the movement that I talked to see decentralization as a strength of the movement. It allows local activists to really run with the ball and focus on local issues. And I spent time with two different groups that have a better understanding of that. The first one was in New Jersey at Rutgers University, and this is a group that, this summer, they've organized a march against a police shooting of a black man in New Jersey. They've protested for a black professor to get tenure on their campus. And they recently held a post-election strategy meeting they let me sit in on it. And, David, we were in a conference room at Rutgers' black cultural center. There are about a handful of mostly students in their early 20s, and there was an intense discussion about what it means now that Trump is president-elect with Republicans still in control of Congress. EMONY JOHNSON: Now that Trump has a majority in everything, I don't know how, if you are not a white American, you are not scared at night. WANG: That was 20 year old Emony Johnson. The meeting was led by Taqwa Brookins. She's 20 and the chairperson of Black Lives Matter Rutgers. And she was especially worried about Trump's nominee for U.S. attorney general, Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions, because he was once denied a federal judge position after lawyers testified that he made racist comments. TAQWA BROOKINS: If the local police departments decide that it's justified when it's really not, who do we go to? We go to the federal government, and we ask that the attorney general opens up an investigation. And so for me, personally, I think it's probably going to be more of an issue going forward simply because he's just not on our side. WANG: The group is trying to do more outreach to the community by inviting older members, like Roseanne Thomas, who's 63. ROSEANNE THOMAS: I brought with me tonight a book which I purchased just for Black Lives Matter. It's \"Organizing For Social Change.\" And the chapter that I Xeroxed for everyone is recruiting. WANG: Thomas is a Rutgers alum with a lot of community organizing experience, and she sees Trump's election as an opportunity because it's been so divisive. THOMAS: I feel that the time has now come for all of these different minorities to gather together and to do something. There is a lot of groups who refused to unite with black people in the past. They will all come to you now. WANG: But Thomas says organizing is still key. THOMAS: Going out, knocking on doors, talking to people, pumping palms. You know, it's not all social media. You have to get people interested to get to the social media. We need more people from the community to be involved with the students so that we can maintain continuity of Black Lives Matter Rutgers. WANG: So that's a snapshot from one group that's an official chapter of the Black Lives Matter network. And again, it's important to remember that there are other activist groups using the same label, Black Lives Matter, but they're not necessarily coordinated in their messaging and strategies. I met up with an independent group called Black Lives Matter Greater New York. They recently worked with high school students to organize a march in Manhattan. (SOUNDBITE OF DEMONSTRATION) WALTER NEWSOME: When I say black lives, y'all say matter. Black lives. UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: Matter. NEWSOME: Black lives. UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: Matter. NEWSOME: Word. (CHEERING, APPLAUSE) WANG: This was a protest in honor of black and Latino men and women killed at the hands of police. But the main organizer - his name is Walter Hawk Newsome - he was calling for support not just for more police accountability, but also for protests by Native American groups against the oil pipeline at Standing Rock in North Dakota and for immigrants who may be facing deportation once Trump is in the White House. NEWSOME: We stand, and we say, no more injustices to our native people, no more injustices to immigrants. WANG: But before the election, Newsome organized a campaign calling for African-American voters to not vote. It was supposed to be a protest of both Democrats and Republicans for not prioritizing criminal justice reform, but now his group is focusing on local elections. NEWSOME: We taking over New York City politics. I guarantee you nobody will become mayor of New York City unless Black Lives Matter says so. WANG: So this campaign in New York comes after another independent Black Lives Matter activists in Baltimore, DeRay Mckesson, lost a primary race for mayor. So we may see more Black Lives Matter groups moving beyond street protests next year. And another possible shift is more groups partnering more prominently with other activists based in the immigrant and Muslim communities, for example. GREENE: Hansi, it's safe to say, I mean, it sounds like this is a group that is still very angry, sort of finding its next step, open to different partnerships, as you just said, maybe with immigrant, Muslim communities, but not totally settled on one mission yet. WANG: They're not because it's a very, again, decentralized, disparate group of activists that are under this umbrella called Black Lives Matter. But if you talk to the co-founders of the movement, they're really aiming for a coalition of activists to help drive the Black Lives Matter movement. I talked to Alicia Garza through Skype. She's based in Oakland, and here's what she said. ALICIA GARZA: It has to be a multiracial movement that understands the role that anti-blackness plays in dividing us, in keeping us separate and in making sure that we don't all have the things that we need to survive. WANG: You know, David, Garza told me she sees a potential for a - essentially, a wider Black Lives Matter tent. But how that happens is going to be complicated because different groups may have to compromise on their priorities if they're going to move forward together. GREENE: OK, talking to my colleague, Hansi Lo Wang, about the future of the Black Lives Matter movement under Donald Trump. Hansi, thanks. WANG: You're welcome, David Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

            "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump is scrambling to fill a Cabinet and an administration in the next 65 days. The transition is off to a chaotic start.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: President-elect Donald Trump is busy trying to staff his government and decide which of his many campaign promises he wants to keep and which he wants to discard. We will hear from a member of his transition team in a moment. First, many Republicans are wondering exactly what Trump has done to their party. NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson reports. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Now that Donald Trump has won, he has a chance to remake the Republican Party in his own populist, protectionist, nationalist image. And no one could be happier than Virginia Congressman David Brat. Brat was kind of a proto-Trump, a leading indicator of the grassroots rebellion that Trump tapped into. Back in 2014, Brat beat Eric Cantor, the first time in history that a House majority leader had been defeated in a primary. Brat's issue was immigration, and he said Trump understood that Republicans could win without capitulating to multiculturalism. Brat remembers that after Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan lost, the party produced the so-called autopsy report. DAVID BRAT: The autopsy report said we ought to be scared of our shadow. We ought to be scared of Hispanics and African-American women, et cetera. The Republican message was just wimpy from four years ago. So what Trump has done is, he's reinvigorated us again and shown us a path forward, that if you get the middle class and the blue-collar and the people that take pride in our country, there's a - there's plenty of, you know - a huge demographic win sitting there. LIASSON: Even at their moment of great victory, there are still signs of an identity crisis in the GOP. Look no further than the emerging Trump White House. The chief of staff will be RNC Chair Reince Priebus who commissioned that autopsy report. Down the hall will be Steve Bannon, Trump's campaign chairman and former head of Breitbart News, a prominent platform for white nationalism, anti-Semitism and misogyny. Kristen Andersen is a Republican strategist. KRISTEN ANDERSEN: I think that Donald Trump showed that there is a way to bring in voters who are working-class voters who have felt like neither party has been paying attention to them. And I think the question is, can he keep those folks in the fold without as President indulging the kind of rhetoric and the kind of really unfortunate bedfellows that were a part of this presidential campaign? LIASSON: Republicans who heaved a sigh of relief at the prospect of Reince Priebus working with House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are nervous about Bannon, who's thrown as many bombs at the Republican establishment as he has at liberals. Amanda Carpenter was a former top aide for Senator Ted Cruz. AMANDA CARPENTER: Donald Trump has brought forth the question of white identity politics plainly and clearly, especially with the elevation of Steve Bannon as a White House adviser. You cannot ignore it. And so where does it go from here? It's very hard to tell. I am a little bit scared. I hope. I pray, and I encourage all the Republicans in Congress to distance themselves from that and try to put him on the right course. LIASSON: But for now, Republicans in Congress say they are on the same page as Donald Trump. And even President Obama has refused to comment on Steve Bannon's appointment, saying Trump deserves a chance to succeed. But a fresh start is not exactly the same thing as a blank slate. The campaign has left a big mark. There are anti-Trump protests in the streets and reports of racial incidents committed in Trump's name. Trump has both lashed out at the protesters, blaming them on the media, and told his supporters to stop attacking minorities. Mike Murphy is a GOP strategist who had been a prominent anti-Trumper. Like many other Republicans, Murphy is happy with Trump's results - complete control of government for the GOP. But he's still uncomfortable with Trump's methods. MIKE MURPHY: What Donald Trump means now is an open question. That could be good for the GOP if Trump evolves into something a little different than what we saw on the campaign trail, kind of a moral question of what we believe in. He would have to change for me to think it's a good thing. LIASSON: Since Election Day, Trump hasn't offered much consistency on his tone or his top priorities. Build a wall. Maybe it will be a fence. Deport 11 million people here illegally. Maybe more like 3 million. And Obamacare - Trump says it might be amended instead. As for his promise to drain the swamp, his transition team is chock full of big donors and lobbyists. Republicans are still waiting to see exactly where Trump wants to take his party. The only guide so far are a divisive campaign, a chaotic transition and conflicting signals on policy from the president-elect. Mara Liasson, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

            "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump announced two top people for his White House team. He has also given his first extended sit-down interview since being elected president. He talked to CBS's 60 Minutes.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: And we are getting our first indications of what Donald Trump's White House will look like. The president-elect has chosen Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus to serve as his chief of staff. Another key role will be filled by Steve Bannon, the provocative former executive of the right wing website Breitbart, who also served as CEO of the Trump campaign. NPR's Scott Horsley joins us to talk about this and other news from the president-elect. Scott, good morning. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: So what kind of signals are we getting from Donald Trump here with these appointments? HORSLEY: It's sort of a mixed signal, David. People always watch these early hires for a sign of what kind of White House operation the incoming president wants. And that's especially true in the case of Donald Trump, since he doesn't have a government track record we can look to. Both Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon had been talked about as possible chiefs of staff. In selecting the RNC chairman Priebus, Trump seems to be signaling an eagerness to work with the GOP establishment, even though they often tussled during the campaign. Had he chosen Bannon, who's much more of an outsider, a bomb thrower, that would have sent the opposite signal. But Bannon is not going away. The former Breitbart executive, who is associated with the controversial alt-right movement, will be chief strategist and senior counselor to the president. GREENE: So are they just going to duke it out in the White House? I mean, I had a conversation with Chris Buskirk, who is publisher of a conservative blog and website. I mean, he said that this is this is meant to frustrate everyone, which is something that is healthy in a White House. Is that healthy in a White House? HORSLEY: (Laughter) We will see. A press release announcing these picks described Priebus and Bannon's roles as equal partners in the new administration. GREENE: That tells us something. HORSLEY: In fact, Bannon's name got top billing in the release. Another Trump adviser, Kellyanne Conway, told Fox News these two men are Trump loyalists. And they worked closely together during the course of the presidential campaign. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KELLYANNE CONWAY: Well, it tells you a great deal about President Trump that both of those men are thought to have very important roles in his administration, very senior roles. And that - regardless of title, that is absolutely what's going to happen. And that is probably the case for most of his very small but loyal and, frankly, effective senior team, inner circle. HORSLEY: Prebius could be a liaison to Republicans on Capitol Hill, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, his fellow Wisconsinite. Bannon, meanwhile, might be expected to tend to the populist fires outside Washington that helped send Trump to the White House. I should say some of those outside fires are ugly. Bannon's association with white nationalism and anti-Semitism have prompted groups like the Anti-Defamation League to protest his White House appointment. GREENE: Yeah. I mean, the reaction already has been really fierce. I mean, and we should pause on Steve Bannon for a minute. I mean, Breitbart News, which he ran for a long time, I mean, has just, you know, published some very offensive things. I mean, they've said that President Obama imports hating Muslims. I mean, they've called Planned Parenthood's work - likening it to the Holocaust. I mean, does this undermine Donald Trump's message - recent message of being a uniter? HORSLEY: Well, I think, as I say, I think these are mixed signals here. And, of course, Steve Bannon played a key role in helping to sort of write the Donald Trump campaign in the latter stages. So what you get is what the American people voted for. GREENE: And I guess time will tell to see how much influence he has and Priebus in that White House. You know, so we should say, I mean, people protesting this announcement and also actual protesting on the streets continued over the weekend in cities around the country. Is Donald Trump responding to that and sending a message to the people who are out there? HORSLEY: Trump has alternated between criticizing the demonstrations and saying he admires the protesters' passion. In an interview they aired on \"60 Minutes\" last night, Trump complained about the way the protests are being covered in the news media. But he also tried to reassure the demonstrators. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"60 MINUTES\") DONALD TRUMP: Don't be afraid. We are going to bring our country back. But certainly don't be afraid. You know, we just had an election. And sort of like - you have to be given a little time. I mean. People are protesting. If Hillary had won and if my people went out and protested, everybody would say, oh, that's a terrible thing. And it would have been a much different attitude. There is a different attitude. You know, there's a double standard here. HORSLEY: Trump was also asked about complaints from some African-Americans, Latinos and Muslims who say they've been harassed by people calling themselves Trump supporters. The president-elect said he was surprised and disappointed to hear that. And he spoke bluntly to anyone carrying out such harassment, saying they should stop it. GREENE: That's got - Trump has been talking about some of his campaign promises including, I mean, he has been talking about repealing Obamacare for months and months and months like other Republicans have said they want to do. But he's also said he wants to preserve some parts of the law. Make sense of that for me. HORSLEY: He says he wants to make insurance companies keep covering people who have pre-existing medical conditions. That's one of the more popular features of Obamacare. Although that creates some problems if you do away with the requirement that individuals have health insurance, which Trump wants to do. While getting rid of Obamacare is high on the incoming president's to-do list, Trump told \"60 Minutes\" there could be a phase-out period. So that 20 million or so people getting coverage through the Affordable Care Act would not be in danger of losing it right away. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"60 MINUTES\") TRUMP: We're not going to have, like, a two-day period. And we're not going to have a two-year period where there's nothing. It will be repealed and replaced and we'll know. And it'll be great health care for much less money. So it'll be better health care, much better for less money. Not a bad combination. HORSLEY: Trump was also asked about his promise to appoint a Supreme Court justice who opposes abortion. He tried to soft pedal the effects of that on \"60 Minutes,\" saying any reconsideration of Roe v. Wade is - has a long, long way to go. GREENE: All right. Just a couple of seconds left, Scott. But what about Donald Trump's promise during the presidential campaign to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate his opponent Hillary Clinton? HORSLEY: He was noncommittal on that, said check back with me. GREENE: OK. That is NPR's Scott Horsley rounding up the news, new appointments in the future Trump White House and protests continuing around the country. Scott, thanks a lot. HORSLEY: You're welcome.

            "article_content": "United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson reflects on his time in office and shares his concerns about the incoming Trump administration and the anti-globalism movement elsewhere.  LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST: President-elect Donald Trump's victory is causing concern at the U.N. Outgoing Secretary General Ban Ki-moon steps down at the end of the year. And Trump has promised to drop out of the Paris climate change agreement, which is Ban Ki-moon's biggest legacy. That's not all U.N. diplomats are worried about these days as NPR's Michele Kelemen reports. MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Technically, the U.N. says the U.S. can't pull out of the Paris climate change agreement for four years, but Deputy Secretary General Jan Eliasson understands the U.N. can't force countries to meet their target to limit greenhouse gas emissions. And often countries take their cues from the U.S. JAN ELIASSON: So you have a four-year period where nothing can change the agreement. But, of course, we all realize that the agreement builds on voluntary action and national actions. KELEMEN: His boss, the U.N. secretary general, has spoken to Trump by phone and is planning a follow-up meeting soon in part to talk about this. Eliasson says the U.N. is appealing to Trump as a businessman. ELIASSON: Already, I see many parts of the business community already aiming for a green economy. Not only is it the right thing to do to save the environment or the planet, but it's also turning out to be good business. KELEMEN: Eliasson is no newcomer to American politics. He was Sweden's ambassador in Washington when the Bush administration took over from President Clinton. ELIASSON: What I recall was at that time when the shift Clinton-Bush took place that in fact a couple months into the new administration, the Bush administration withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol. KELEMEN: While the U.S. pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol, the climate agreement at the time, it did not leave the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, a treaty ratified by Congress in 1992. There's some speculation a Trump administration may try to do that, but Ben Cardin, a Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has a hard time believing it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BEN CARDIN: I would find it extremely difficult to understand how the United States would want to be the only major country in the world that's not part of the discussions as it relates to these issues. KELEMEN: The Maryland senator says such a move would marginalize the U.S. on the world stage and not just on the topic of climate change. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CARDIN: Look, I've gone through a lot of different administrations. They handle things differently, but we've never seen the United States sort of give up its role on international diplomacy and international engagement on all fronts. KELEMEN: Trumps victory raises other questions for the U.N. system. He ran a campaign that tapped into anger about globalism and migration at a time when the U.N. is trying to cope with a massive migration crisis with 65 million people uprooted by war. The U.N. deputy secretary general says there is a debate now in the U.S. and in Europe that pits, in his words, classical liberal internationalism against nationalism with populist undertones. ELIASSON: I would say we are at a historic stage - what kind of direction we will go, and therefore I think the elections in United States like the Brexit in Europe and even the referendum in Colombia has international ramifications. We live in a world where we are all dependent on each other. KELEMEN: That will be a challenge for the next secretary general, Antonio Guterres who spent recent years as head of the U.N.'s refugee agency overwhelmed by the fallout of the ongoing war in Syria.

But efforts in Mexico barring Central Americans from traveling north might doing the job of a wall.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: Central Americans who are running away from violence in their home countries now run into a dragnet of migration enforcement long before the United States border. They're getting caught in Mexico and being deported in record numbers, more than a quarter million in the last two years. As James Fredrick reports from Mexico City, Central Americans are scrambling to make sure they are not sent back to their violent homes. (CROSSTALK) JAMES FREDRICK, BYLINE: Twenty-year-old Brayan rarely stops joking with his fellow migrants even though he's only known them for a few days. He's finally relaxing in this quiet Mexico City neighborhood, a far cry from his home in the Honduran capital where recruitment into a brutal street gang was a constant pressure. BRAYAN: (Speaking Spanish). FREDRICK: He says there are jobs. They're just all illegal - selling drugs and all that. Brayan asked NPR not to use his full name, still fearing being targeted by gangs, and said fleeing was his only option for survival. But just getting through Mexico, he's been scammed, extorted and held at machete point by thugs. Mexico's migration agents haven't been much friendlier. BRAYAN: (Speaking Spanish). FREDRICK: He says they're all a bunch of pit bulls. They've already nabbed and deported him to Honduras twice. He says they never asked if he'd be safe back there. But he may not have to dodge migration anymore. He's actually in a cab on his way to their offices to file paperwork for a humanitarian visa, a document that allows him to be in Mexico legally. BRAYAN: (Speaking Spanish). FREDRICK: He says, \"it's something that identifies me. It means I don't have to be afraid in Mexico. They can't send me home.\" Right now home is this migrant shelter in Mexico City, one of the few in the country and the only one specifically for young migrants seeking protection. The goal is to get them humanitarian support, whether it's this one-year visa or long-term asylum in Mexico. Mario Monroy, one of the shelter's coordinators, says it's hypocritical to hear Mexicans complain about the U.S. wanting a border wall given how Mexico is treating Central Americans. MARIO MONROY: (Through interpreter) Our institutions have already built a metaphorical wall. The Americans say it's going to be the world's biggest wall, but it's already here. It's not on the U.S. border. Mexico is the wall. FREDRICK: In the last year alone, Mexico deported more than 150,000 Central Americans. Mexican authorities did not respond to NPR's request for an interview. But the U.N. High Commission on Refugees estimates that up to half of the Central Americans migrating through Mexico may be fleeing violence. The commission's head of protection in Mexico, Jose Sieber, says the country is still adjusting to this new reality and adds that migrants themselves don't know their own rights. JOSE SIEBER: They reach Mexico unaware of the fact that they can raise their hand and claim for protection in Mexico. FREDRICK: Even the migrants who know their rights are still wary of Mexican authorities. Seventeen-year-old Edgar, who's also at the shelter, didn't want to give his full name fearing reprisal from authorities. He's hanging out at the shelter where fellow migrants play music. His hair was once styled but now flops around and curls after months of migrating. He says gang violence made his Guatemala City neighborhood unlivable. EDGAR: (Speaking Spanish). FREDRICK: He says, \"every hour or two, we'd hear gunshots and then the ambulance coming.\" He's amazed he made it all the way up to Mexico City. EDGAR: (Speaking Spanish). FREDRICK: \"You either die on the journey, or you get across the U.S. border,\" he says. But if he can get this visa, some sort of protection from the Mexican government, he may not have to think in life and death terms anymore. For NPR News, I'm James Fredrick in Mexico City.

MONTAGNE: And Scott, Donald Trump has taken a beating in the polls since the release of that videotape where he boasted about groping and kissing women. And then there now have been allegations suggesting that was more than just talk from the candidate. But Trump is hitting back, right? HORSLEY: Well, at a campaign rally in Florida yesterday, Trump issued a categorical denial of those allegations that were published in The New York Times and elsewhere. He called them, quote, \"pure fiction engineered by the Clinton machine.\" He did not revisit those allegations of sexual misconduct here in Ohio. Instead, he spent much of his own rally leveling charges at Hillary Clinton. He repeatedly pointed to damaging information that's come from stolen emails, including her purported support of open borders. And Trump cast the election in really apocalyptic terms. (SOUNDBITE OF CAMPAIGN RALLY) TRUMP: Either we win this election or we lose our country. And that's what's happening - that's your choice. It's as simple as that. A Trump administration will secure and defend our borders. HORSLEY: Trump once again touted his plan to build a great wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. And the nearly full crowd in the arena joined him in saying Mexico would pay for it. MONTAGNE: And, obviously, a lot of enthusiastic supporters that come to his rallies - are any of them troubled about the allegations that have surfaced in this last week? HORSLEY: Well, certainly, some people may have changed their minds and not shown up last night. But in talking with those who did come to the rally, I heard a range of emotions, especially from women. Some dismissed the allegations, seeing them as Trump does, just as partisan noise. Some women I spoke with said they are troubled by what they've heard, but they still prefer Trump to Clinton. And then there are those like Krista Juhlman who I spoke with as she was shopping for a adorable deplorable T-shirt. KRISTA JUHLMAN: You know, I'll tell you. I work in the banking industry, and I work in a man's world. And this may sound very backwards to some women, but I will say this - you make your own way in life. If what he said 10 years - 11 years ago, I'm not looking at that today. Again, I want - I think this country should be ran as a business. I think we need change, and I think that this is the only way it's going to happen. MONTAGNE: OK. Well, some women are sticking with Donald Trump. But polls suggest he does have a serious problem with women voters. What does that mean for other Republicans? HORSLEY: Well, that's the big question. Democrats are hoping Trump's problems will rub off on down-ballot Republicans running for House and Senate. At a dinner here in Ohio last night, President Obama scoffed at Republicans who were trying to distance themselves from Trump. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: You claim the mantle of the party of family values. And this is the guy you nominate... (APPLAUSE) OBAMA: ...And stand by and endorse and campaign with until finally, at the eleventh hour, you withdraw your nomination? You don't get credit for that. HORSLEY: And I heard very much that same message from Hillary Clinton earlier this week as she was campaigning with Senate candidates in Colorado and Nevada. The challenge for Republicans is, do they try to alienate people who are repelled by Trump or the large bloc of voters who are still loyal to him? MONTAGNE: OK, Scott. Thanks very much. HORSLEY: My pleasure, Renee. MONTAGNE: That's NPR's Scott Horsley. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "It's been more than a week since Donald Trump became president elect and protests haven't let up. Some involved say they are challenging things bigger than Trump \u2014 such as the electoral college.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: We're more than a week past the moment when Trump became the president-elect, and the news is still bringing people out into the streets. NPR's Sam Sanders has been asking protesters what drives them. SAM SANDERS, BYLINE: The protests continue more than a week since Donald Trump's win. At Temple University in Philadelphia last night, dozens of students chanted... (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: (Chanting) Not my president. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Not my president, not my president. SANDERS: ...Over and over and over. Lady Torres was one of several students behind the megaphone near the bell tower at Temple. When I asked her exactly what she was protesting about Trump, she told me it was a feeling. LADY TORRES: A lot of us are in fear for our own lives. And I don't think it's an exaggeration at all. SANDERS: You fear for your life? TORRES: I do. SANDERS: How so? TORRES: I just think that it is very obvious because of the color of my skin that... SANDERS: Torres says Trump and his campaign have lots of Americans believe it's OK to harass people like her. Torres is Latina, a permanent resident of the U.S., originally from the Dominican Republic, so she couldn't even vote, but she says that doesn't diminish her right to protest. TORRES: We will watch him very closely. And we are not going to just simply sit back. SANDERS: Others involved in what people are calling the Trump resistance, they're challenging things bigger than Trump, like the Electoral College itself. DANIEL BREZENOFF: My name's Daniel Brezenoff, and I live here in Southern California. I'm a social worker and a longtime political activist. SANDERS: Brezenoff started a petition on the liberal website change.org. BREZENOFF: Well, this is a petition asking the Electoral College to cast its ballots for the popular vote winner, Secretary Hillary Clinton. SANDERS: It's got over 4 million signatures, and it got Brezenoff some threats on social media. BREZENOFF: This guy should be dragged out and shot. Let him try this in this state. Let him - you know, if this works, we're going to have a war - things like that. SANDERS: To be clear, it is highly unlikely that Brezenoff's petition will work. Even Brezenoff admits that. So there are other ways people are mobilizing. Since the election, the American Civil Liberties Union has raised a lot of money. ANTHONY DAVID ROMERO: More than 7 - 7.2 - even higher now - million dollars from folks. SANDERS: That's Anthony David Romero. He is the executive director of the ACLU. He says the outpouring of support his group has received this past week, it rivals the support they got in the direct aftermath of 9/11. That's when the group challenged many anti-terrorism policies. Romero says he expects the ACLU to be challenging the Trump administration as well. ROMERO: Revocation of the protections for the DREAMers, creation of a deportation force, the banning of Muslims, the defunding of Planned Parenthood, the stop and frisk as a national policy. SANDERS: They've got a long list. In Philadelphia last night, there were actually at least two protests. People also gathered outside of Philly's police department headquarters. Many there said the tone of Trump's campaign and his language about law and order, they said all that encouraged bad police officers to be even worse. But Megan Malachi (ph) also pointed out that black people like her have been protesting the police for a while. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) MEGAN MALACHI: For years before Trump was elected into office, many of the people that you see standing here have been fighting. We've been getting arrested. We've been getting brutalized. We've been getting targeted. You should have been out here before. SANDERS: Then she stopped and smiled and told the newcomers, quote, \"we are happy you're here now.\" Sam Sanders, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Before Donald Trump takes the oath of office in January, there are a lot of questions about how he will decide key policy issues. We've identified the top 10 issues voters care about most according to a 2016 survey from the Pew Research Center and charted what Trump has said about each of them. The issues are, in order: the economy, terrorism, foreign policy, health care, gun policy, immigration, Social Security, education, Supreme Court appointments and the treatment of racial and ethnic minorities. Where we could, we gave Trump's stances a simple \"Yes\" or \"No,\" but also used the rating \"It's Complicated\" in cases where his stance is more nuanced or has changed. (Trump has given clues on what he'll prioritize in his first 100 days, which we've posted here and fact checked here.) Trump hopes to grow the economy by significantly lowering taxes. Under his plan, he says a middle-class family with two children would get a 35 percent income tax cut. He will also reduce the number of tax brackets from seven down to three, which would largely benefit the wealthiest Americans. When it comes to business tax rates, Trump wants to go from a 35 percent rate to 15 percent. Trump is also big on infrastructure as a way to create jobs. He says he would grant the permit needed for the Keystone Pipeline despite opposition from environmental activists, as NPR's Scott Horsley outlined. He also plans to cancel all payments to U.N. climate change programs and put that money toward \"water and environmental infrastructure,\" as he wrote in his 100-day action plan. Trump would also lift restrictions on the oil, coal, shale and natural gas industries. In addition, he plans to impose tariffs to discourage companies from relocating to other countries.

In his 100-day action plan, Trump promised to \"suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting.\" During his campaign, he also condoned other extreme counter-terrorism tactics, like waterboarding. Relevant stories Here Is What Donald Trump Wants To Do In His First 100 Days Trump Calls To Ban Immigration From Countries With 'Proven History Of Terrorism' When it comes to foreign policy, Trump's main focus has been to upend U.S. trade policy. He has promised to renegotiate or withdraw from NAFTA, the United States' free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. According to NPR's Marilyn Geewax, actually doing away with NAFTA might not actually be feasible, but Trump could undermine it. He also wants to label China a currency manipulator and, per his 100-day plan, \"identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately.\" Relevant stories 3 Ways President-Elect Trump May Shake Up Trade Policy Trump Has A Chance To Pull U.S. Out Of Climate Accord Trump's Election Gives Hope To Europe's Far Right A Wary World Looks For Clues To Donald Trump's Foreign Policy What Will A Trump Presidency Mean For China?

That feat will be harder than Trump seems to think, as we reported. To completely repeal and replace the act, he would need 60 votes in the Senate, which is the number needed to overcome a filibuster. Though they'll make up a majority, there will be only 51 Republican senators come January. He recently signaled in an interview that he may be open to keeping provisions of Obamacare that expand insurance to people with pre-existing conditions and to young people. Trump has also promised to allow tax deductions for child care and elder care and to create tax-free dependent care savings accounts, with matching contributions for low-income families. As we reported earlier this year, that would cost the government $25 billion annually.

In his 100-day plan, Trump promised to cancel federal funding to \"sanctuary cities,\" though he hasn't specified which funds he would cut. There's no legal definition for this type of city; it's used to describe places with policies limiting how much local authorities can collaborate with federal authorities on immigration issues, such as detention requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to CNN. Trump has also promised to undo all of President Obama's executive actions, which include two on immigration (only one of which is in effect). Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals allows certain people brought to the country illegally as children to apply for protection against deportation for two-year periods. That protection would go away, it seems. Trump has also promised to deport immigrants in the country illegally who have committed crimes, stop immigration from \"terror-prone\" regions and begin \"extreme vetting\" of people entering the U.S. He has also mostly stood by his vow to build a wall on the country's southern border, and make Mexico pay for it. Trump and some surrogates have said recently they would be OK with certain areas of the border having fence, rather than wall.

Relevant stories Trump has been vocal about school choice, which allows parents to choose to send their child to any type of school: traditional public, private or charter. Critics say school choice leads to a gap in equitable school investment. Proponents say it increases competition between schools. In addition to school choice, Trump wants to end the Common Core standards, which are the federal guidelines created for K-12 education across the country.

            "article_content": "by Imbolo Mbue Hardcover, 382 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? In 2008, the investment bank Lehman Brothers filed for the largest bankruptcy in American history. It took just hours for the catastrophic effects of the company's failure to become apparent to ordinary people all across the world, even ones who had never before heard terms like \"subprime mortgage\" and \"collateralized debt obligation.\" Jende Jonga and his wife, Neni, two of the main characters in Imbolo Mbue's excellent debut novel, Behold the Dreamers, are among those people. Her book isn't the first work of fiction to grapple with the global financial crisis of 2007-2008, but it's surely one of the best. Jende and Neni have recently immigrated to America from the city of Limbe in Cameroon, hoping to build a better life for their young son, Liomi, a sweet and sensitive six-year-old who idolizes his father. They're barely able to make ends meet. Neni works as a home health aide while attending college \u2014 she dreams of one day enrolling in pharmacy school \u2014 while Jende drives a cab. Their luck changes suddenly, though, when Jende finds work as a personal chauffeur for a Lehman Brothers executive named Clark Edwards and his family. The hours are long, but the salary is a massive improvement over his previous job. Clark grows to trust Jende, and Neni eventually takes a temporary job cleaning and cooking at the Edwards' second home. It doesn't take long before Jende and Neni both learn that the Edwards' marriage isn't as perfect as it might seem. This becomes painfully apparent after Lehman Brothers declares bankruptcy just weeks before what would become a historic presidential election. 'Behold the Dreamers' isn't a satire, but it's frequently caustic, and Mbue can be unsparing in her depiction of the elite who didn't see their very existence threatened by the financial collapse. Meanwhile, Jende is forced to confront problems of his own. While his wife is in America on a student visa, he's in the country waiting for his asylum application to be approved. But he's not really facing persecution in his home country, and he's hoping the smooth-talking immigration lawyer he's hired can persuade a judge otherwise. He can't bear the thought of returning to Cameroon. When he talks about America, it's with rapturous joy, and an unflinching belief in the promise of his adopted country. \"America has something for everyone, sir,\" he enthuses to Clark. \"Look at Obama, sir. Who is his mother? Who is his father? They are not big people in the government. ... The man is a black man with no father or mother, trying to be president over a country!\" Those who lived through the turbulent final years of the George W. Bush administration remember that it brought out the worst in a lot of people \u2014 not just in the bankers and politicians who let the crisis occur in the first place, but in ordinary citizens brought to the edge by the threat of financial ruin. Mbue realizes this, and she does not pull punches. Behold the Dreamers is, at times, hard to read \u2014 not because of her writing, which is excellent, but because the characters keep getting hit, over and over again, by horrible circumstances beyond their control. Jende is reminded that \"bad news has a way of slithering into good days and making a mockery of complacent joys;\" Neni feels \"crushed\" by her own feelings of helplessness, \"the fact that she had traveled to America only to be reminded of how powerless she was, how unfair life could be.\" Behold the Dreamers isn't a satire, but it's frequently caustic, and Mbue can be unsparing in her depiction of the elite who didn't see their very existence threatened by the financial collapse. In one scene, Clark's wife commiserates with a wealthy friend about the crisis. Her friend's priorities are almost comically misplaced: \"But it's scary how bad this could get,\" she says, \"When people start talking about flying coach and selling vacation homes ...\" That's not to say Mbue doesn't lack compassion for her characters \u2014 while some are oblivious, they have real problems of their own, and she's never cruel or condescending. Mbue's heart is with the Jonga family, torn between their love for \u2014 and disappointment with \u2014 America. But it's also with the Edwards family, unable to cope with the thought that their days of privilege might soon be coming to an end. Behold the Dreamers is a remarkable debut. Mbue is a wonderful writer with an uncanny ear for dialogue \u2014 there are no false notes here, no narrative shortcuts, and certainly no manufactured happy endings. It's a novel that depicts a country both blessed and doomed, on top of the world, but always at risk of losing its balance. It is, in other words, quintessentially American.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump, the Republican Party's presidential nominee, said Thursday night that he had \"regret\" for choosing the wrong words that have caused \"pain\" during the 2016 campaign.\n                \n                    \n                    Gerald Herbert/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Donald Trump, the Republican Party's presidential nominee, said Thursday night that he had \"regret\" for choosing the wrong words that have caused \"pain\" during the 2016 campaign. In an effort to save his flagging presidential candidacy, and two days after shaking up his campaign, Donald Trump expressed \"regret\" for sometimes saying the wrong thing and causing \"pain.\" \"Sometimes, in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don't choose the right words or you say the wrong thing,\" Trump said, reading from a teleprompter at a campaign event Thursday night in Charlotte, N.C. \"I have done that, and I regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain. Too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues.\" Here's video: TRUMP: Sometimes speaking in the heat of debate you say the wrong thing. I've done that. I regret it.https://t.co/PT3rHl6gEJ It is a remarkable statement from a man not known for outward self-reflection or admitting fault. Quite the opposite \u2014 he has come to embody political incorrectness and the visceral emotion of an angry sect of the electorate. He said during the primary campaign, in fact, he was proud to carry the \"mantle of anger.\" As recently as four days ago, Trump tweeted, \"I am who I am.\" The failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I am-never said But he has faced withering criticism this past month \u2014 even from within his own party \u2014 for everything from picking a fight with the family of a Muslim American soldier killed in Iraq to saying that \"Second Amendment people\" might be able to do something about his opponent, Hillary Clinton, and that President Obama is the \"founder\" of ISIS. And he has suffered in the polls because of it. He has dropped precipitously in battleground states, to the point that Clinton is now leading in every competitive state, including in usually right-leaning Georgia. Party leaders and insiders have been urging Trump to shift at least his tone, and this could be the beginning of that. CNN reported that, on Friday, Trump and his vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, will visit flood-ravaged areas in Louisiana. President Obama is vacationing on Martha's Vineyard and has faced criticism from a Louisiana newspaper for not visiting. The Clinton campaign pushed back quickly to Trump's speech. \"Donald Trump literally started his campaign by insulting people,\" said Christina Reynolds, deputy communications director, in a statement. \"He has continued to do so through each of the 428 days from then until now, without shame or regret. We learned tonight that his speechwriter and teleprompter knows he has much for which he should apologize. But that apology tonight is simply a well-written phrase until he tells us which of his many offensive, bullying and divisive comments he regrets \u2014 and changes his tune altogether.\" Some, including CNN's Anderson Cooper and The Washington Post's Robert Costa, reported that Trump drove the \"regret\" line, not a speechwriter. I'm also told that Trump personally decided to express regret tonight and brought riff to Conway, Manafort as something he wanted to do... But Costa notes there's skepticism that that's the case. But calling around just now, there is skepticism in Trump's orbit that he drove this. Tonight's speech was right out of Conway's playbook. Trump began tonight to reframe and repackage his message on a host of issues. In addition to expressing \"regret,\" he also tried to express sympathy, saying he has \"no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence.\" Whether or not Trump wrote these lines, Trump adviser Jack Kingston, a GOP congressman from Georgia, saw the influence of his new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway. \"Her signature was all over it,\" Kingston told CNN. Conway is known for her work targeting female voters \u2014 with whom Trump needs to make up a lot of ground to be competitive \u2014 and her new role involves traveling with Trump and advising him in real time. Trump even tried to reach out to nonwhite voters: \"Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children are living in poverty. I will not rest until children of every color in this country are fully included in the American Dream.\" He also tried in parts to strike a hopeful tone: \"Our whole country loses when young people of limitless potential are denied the opportunity to contribute their talents because we failed to provide them the opportunities they deserved. Let our children be dreamers too.\" That stands in stark contrast to the dark tone he set for much of his campaign and in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Longtime Republicans lamented that Trump had appeared to cede hope, as a theme, to Democrats. But if it will last is very much an open question. Even on Thursday, his national campaign spokeswoman was on cable news claiming that Hillary Clinton is suffering from dysphasia, a type of brain damage. It's the kind of conspiracy theory, backed by no evidence, that Trump has touted through this campaign and since he rose to right-wing prominence by raising false questions about President Obama's place of birth. (The president was born in Hawaii.) There has been a usual pattern from Trump \u2014 to say outrageous comments that land him in hot water, followed by party leaders and his family sitting him down urging him to rein it in, then Trump getting itchy, throwing out the script and landing in more controversy. Trump may be learning that all headlines aren't good for his brand. But his hiring of Stephen Bannon \u2014 the former head of Breitbart News who subscribes to a take-no-prisoners approach to politics \u2014 as his campaign CEO does not lend to the idea of a Trump who won't be Trump. What's more, how much damage has already been done? How much of the controversies \u2014 of Trump's own creation \u2014 will be forgotten or erased? It's not possible for Trump to rewind the past three weeks, but he hopes that he can win back at least some of those supporters who propelled him into the lead in some polls after the Republican convention. There are 11 weeks to go, and it's all about to be tested. Here's a broader section of Trump's \"regret\" remarks (you can click here to read his entire prepared remarks, as released by the campaign): \"As you know, I am not a politician. I have worked in business, creating jobs and rebuilding neighborhoods my entire adult life. I've never wanted to learn the language of the insiders, and I've never been politically correct \u2014 it takes far too much time, and can often make more difficult. \"Sometimes, in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don't choose the right words or you say the wrong thing. I have done that, and I regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain. Too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues. \"But one thing I can promise you is this: I will always tell you the truth. I speak the truth for all of you, and for everyone in this country who doesn't have a voice. I speak the truth on behalf of the factory worker who lost his or her job. I speak the truth on behalf of the Veteran who has been denied the medical care they need \u2014 and so many are not making it. They are dying. I speak the truth on behalf of the family living near the border that deserves to be safe in their own country but is instead living with no security at all. \"Our campaign is about representing the great majority of Americans \u2014 Republicans, Democrats, Independents, Conservatives and Liberals \u2014 who read the newspaper, or turn on the TV, and don't hear anyone speaking for them. All they hear are insiders fighting for insiders. \"These are the forgotten men and women in our society, and they are angry at so much on so many levels. The poverty, the unemployment, the failing schools, the jobs moving to other countries. I am fighting for these forgotten Americans.\"",

The Democrats on Friday released an outline of their upcoming convention, and one of the main goals appears to be showing off the party's unity after a long primary fight. After a divisive primary season between presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the convention schedule includes a speech from Sanders on the first night, Monday, July 25. That night's theme is \"United Together\" \u2014 indeed, of the four nights' themes, three include the word \"together.\" With a sitting Democratic president and a husband who is a former president, Clinton's convention will have heavy political star power: President Obama, Vice President Biden, first lady Michelle Obama and Bill Clinton are all scheduled to speak. The DNC's plans do not include a long list of speakers like the Republicans put out on Thursday, but they do outline which issues will be highlighted: As at the Republican convention, one night will focus on the economy. Another night will feature the \"Mothers of the Movement,\" the mothers of Sandra Bland, Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin and other African-Americans who have died in high-profile incidents over the past few years. The inclusion of Astrid Silva, a DREAMer, who is also on the Democrats' speakers list, suggests Clinton will be drawing comparisons between her views on immigration \u2014 like her support for a path to citizenship \u2014 and those of Republican nominee Donald Trump, who has called for deporting 11 million immigrants who are in the country illegally. Left off the list are potential vice presidential picks Tim Kaine, Elizabeth Warren, Tom Perez and others. The Clinton campaign was sure not to tip its hand in any way or leave reporters to read into a vice presidential pick the way people did with the Republican National Convention list. Of the finalists for Trump's VP, only Mike Pence, the eventual pick, was left off the list. The Democrats' convention outline as released is below. Featuring first lady Michelle Obama, Sen. Bernie Sanders and DREAMer Astrid Silva Gavel time expected at 3:00 p.m. Monday will focus on putting the future of American families front and center and how we're stronger together when we build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top and when everyone has a chance to live up to their God-given potential. DREAMer Astrid Silva will share her story and her fight to keep families together. Featuring President Bill Clinton and Mothers of the Movement Gavel time expected at 4:00 p.m. Tuesday will feature the roll call vote and how Hillary Clinton has spent her entire career working to make a difference for children, families and our country. The Mothers of the Movement participating include Gwen Carr, mother of Eric Garner; Sybrina Fulton, mother of Trayvon Martin; Maria Hamilton, mother of Dontr\u00e9 Hamilton; Lucia McBath, mother of Jordan Davis; Lezley McSpadden, mother of Michael Brown; Cleopatra Pendleton-Cowley, mother of Hadiya Pendleton; Geneva Reed-Veal, mother of Sandra Bland. Featuring President Obama and Vice President Biden Gavel time expected at 4:30 p.m. On Wednesday speakers will take an in-depth look at just how high the stakes are in this election and how Hillary Clinton has the experience and steadiness to bring people together to tackle the big challenges and get real results. Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton Gavel time expected at 4:30 p.m. On the final day of the convention, Hillary Clinton will speak about her vision for the country \u2014 her belief that we are stronger together and that America is at its best when we work together to solve our problems. Hillary for America will announce additional speakers in the coming days.",

How has America changed after eight tumultuous years under President Obama? We put that big question to scores of people in seven states. We chose places where the president delivered speeches about his vision for America. What we collected is not the \"inside story\" of Obama's administration. It is the outside story. By design, we questioned night shift workers, food servers, business owners and sometimes people we encountered at random. What emerged is an unfiltered look at a nation after years of political and economic struggle. Many people had a wrenching personal story to share. And many spoke of Obama's presidency as personal. They did not speak of \"the government,\" but of the president himself. He hurt my business (or saved it). He stuck up for me (or is coming for my guns). \"He's too much in my life,\" one voter said. Another, who met Obama after losing a son in a mass shooting, said: \"He understood.\" Here's a look at President Obama's words \u2014 his promises and dreams \u2014 and assessment of where we are eight years later.  Jobs \"What's at stake is whether this will be a country where working people can earn enough to raise a family, build a modest savings, own a home, secure their retirement.\" \u2014 President Obama in a speech on the economy in Osawatomie, Kan., Dec. 6, 2011 Obama took office amid the worst economic crisis in generations. Banks were depending on a federal bailout to survive. The official unemployment rate had reached 7.8 percent and would soon exceed 10 percent. The numbers were even worse when the underemployed were included. Many people dropped out of the labor market entirely. Today the employment picture is drastically improved. Yet wages, when adjusted for inflation, remained steady for years and only recently have begun to climb. This continues a decades-old trend. Patrick Casica of Denver is living that trend. He has a new job in quality control for bottling firms, a tech job with benefits. But he says he's paid less than he made eight years ago as a bartender. \"This is an investment,\" he tells us. \"I knew I was going to take a hit and work up the ladder to better myself.\" (Left) Union Station in Denver. (Right) Patrick Casica in the bus depot at Denver's Union Station. Casica gave up his more lucrative bartending job to pursue a tech career at Mesa Labs in Denver.\n                \n                    \n                    NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption We met Casica at Denver's Union Station, where he's catching the train to work. The station and surrounding infrastructure were restored, partly with a grant from Obama's economic stimulus law in 2009, an $833 billion spending and tax cut package geared to jump-start the economy amid the Great Recession. But Casica is not yet feeling the benefits of a stronger economy. In Aurora, Colo., John Hoody works as a server at a Red Robin restaurant. He says he's doing better than eight years ago, having moved up from a job at McDonald's. He's even bought his own home \u2014 and in Denver's rising real estate market, it's likely worth more than he paid. But to make ends meet, the 29-year-old says he's working at two different restaurants. And he does not have health care coverage. \"With Obamacare, from my understanding of it, I can't get insurance unless it's astronomically priced,\" he says. He pays a tax penalty instead. Hoody is not alone \u2014 millions are still without insurance \u2014 though the rate of those uninsured has dropped sharply for every income group.  Energy \"I'll invest $150 billion over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy \u2014 wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels \u2014 an investment that will lead to new industries and 5 million new jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced.\" \u2014 Obama's acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Denver on Aug. 28, 2008 The president argued that the nation could improve the economy while also helping to save the planet. Republicans scorned his interest in subsidizing solar panels and windmills. They said their view was vindicated when Solyndra, a California solar company, went bankrupt in 2011 after receiving federal money. But in 2016, much has changed. The use of every kind of renewable energy, including solar, has increased. The most dramatic increase is in wind, which has increased fivefold since 2007. Matt Gilhousen, founder of Tradewind Energy, at Caney River Windfarm located 75 miles southeast of Wichita, Kan. Gilhousen's business benefited from Obama's $833 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.\n                \n                    \n                    NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Matt Gilhousen, founder of Tradewind Energy, at Caney River Windfarm located 75 miles southeast of Wichita, Kan. Gilhousen's business benefited from Obama's $833 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The windy state of Kansas now gets about 20 percent of its electricity from renewable sources, even though the Republican-led state Legislature recently removed a requirement that utilities make use of such energy. One wind company owner, Matt Gilhousen, believes that Obama saved his business. Standing amid 111 wind turbines that he developed on a hilltop in Elk County, he says the Great Recession nearly killed his company, Tradewind Energy. The 2009 stimulus law provided cash grants that helped the company endure three years with no new business. Gilhousen has gone from laying off 30 employees to hiring 70. \"We're lucky to be here,\" Gilhousen says. But it was a very different story for Matthew Anderson, who runs a small company in Denver that develops properties to drill for oil. His company, Acoma Energy, boomed with expanding domestic production. But the price of oil has crashed, and Anderson has laid off some employees. Anderson knows Obama leans toward renewable energy. What has the president done for him? \"Not one single thing.\" Immigration Jose Luis Valdez (left) at his restaurant Paleterias Tropicana in Kansas City, Kan. Valdez is disappointed that Obama did not make the path to citizenship easier during his presidency.

Urged by some advisers to seek comprehensive immigration reform when he had a Democratic Congress in 2009, Obama sought his health care law instead. Later, he used executive action to give legal status to \"dreamers,\" the children of immigrants who had entered illegally, a program he later expanded. But the courts blocked Obama's wider executive action. It would have allowed parents of American citizens and immigrants brought to the U.S. as children to be eligible to live and work in the U.S. without fear of deportation. Federal courts also stopped Obama's expansion of the \"dreamers\" executive action. The two blocked programs would have covered an estimated 3.9 million people. The court defeats dismay Jose Luis Valdez, a native of Mexico and recently naturalized U.S. citizen who is a restaurant owner in Kansas City, Kan. Obama's administration deported many people \u2014 2 million in his first six years, at a rate higher than any of his predecessors. Because Obama did not find some way for more people to remain, Valdez feels the president never delivered on a basic promise. \"He used us,\" Valdez says. \"He used our votes.\" We heard a profoundly different view from Paul Czarzasty of Marion County, Fla. \"These illegal immigrants coming over, and receiving benefits, when our own veterans are having to wait to receive theirs,\" he says. \"That bothers me a lot.\" In the same conversation, Christiane Lemke said she was a naturalized citizen from the former East Germany. She had come to the U.S. legally and felt others must do the same. Same-Sex Marriage \"I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in a hospital and to live lives free of discrimination.\" \u2014 Obama's acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Denver on Aug. 28, 2008 At the time he won his party's nomination in 2008, Obama only endorsed civil unions; he did not overtly support the right for gays and lesbians to marry. The president's position did not change until 2012, as public opinion shifted strongly in favor of marriage. Later, in 2015, the U.S Supreme Court ruled that the right to same-sex marriage would be accepted across the country. Francine Robin Simon (left) and Anna Simon with their son, Jeremy, in their home in Denver. Anna and Francine were one of the first same-sex couples in Colorado to obtain a civil union.\n                \n                    \n                    NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Francine Robin Simon (left) and Anna Simon with their son, Jeremy, in their home in Denver. Anna and Francine were one of the first same-sex couples in Colorado to obtain a civil union. Fran and Anna Simon spent years as marriage activists; now, they say, they are able to live a \"normal\" family life, spending time volunteering at their son's school. At their home in Colorado, the family debated the president's role in that change. \"The president barely did anything,\" their 8-year-old son, Jeremy, told us. But his mom, Anna, says Obama changed the tone. \"It was so exciting to have a president finally, who could even say the words gay and lesbian in a respectful way.\"  A More Racially Diverse America \"The anger [in the black community] is real; it is powerful; and to simply wish it away, to condemn it without understanding its roots, only serves to widen the chasm of misunderstanding that exists between the races. In fact, a similar anger exists within segments of the white community.\" \u2014 Sen. Barack Obama in Philadelphia, March 18, 2008 Every presidency for generations has featured a debate about race \u2014 but none quite like Obama's years. This era has seen a nation becoming more diverse; a number of incidents of police killings of black citizens, which sparked the Black Lives Matter movement; a rise in white identity politics; and the first black president presiding over it all. As Obama approaches his final months, a Pew Research Center survey finds a narrow majority of African-Americans today believes Obama \"made progress\" toward improving race relations. But a majority of white respondents found Obama \"tried but failed to make progress\" or even \"made race relations worse.\" In Florida, Paul Czarzasty has come to see President Obama as a divisive force. The Marion County deputy sheriff cited the president's public statements about some high-profile incidents in which African-Americans have been killed by white officers. Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross, shown at department headquarters, says the Obama presidency has brought out \"the best and worst in people.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Steve Inskeep/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross, shown at department headquarters, says the Obama presidency has brought out \"the best and worst in people.\" \"We have concerns with the way that the president's been dividing the country,\" says Czarzasty, who's white. \"In any profession you're going to have good and bad. ... It's made our job harder for the president with his lack of support.\" Kwame Rose had virtually the opposite assessment. He didn't find Obama to be supportive of protesters. Rose was a prominent African-American protester in Baltimore in 2015, amid the unrest after the death of Freddie Gray, a black man who died after being placed in a police van. President Obama said most protesters were peaceful, but also criticized \"criminals and thugs\" who looted a number of stores. \"You don't know the story behind each one of those individuals,\" Rose says, insisting that demonstrators were simply trying to survive. \"I don't think President Obama at that moment looked inside the mirror and saw that there were people who looked like him who weren't as fortunate as he was. And he chastised them.\" Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross had more sympathy for Obama's position. It was Philadelphia where Obama delivered his famous 2008 speech on race. Like Obama, Ross faces the challenge of being an African-American leader in a diverse community. \"This is going to get me in trouble,\" Ross says, \"but you asked it and I'm going to answer it. I think there are some people who believe that because they have an African-American president, he was supposed to be an African-American president only. He's the president of the United States.\" Ross offers his own assessment of Obama's presidency, which, he says, has brought out \"the best and worst in people.\" Millions of Americans of all races proved they could vote for a black man for president, whatever his policies might be. At the same time, Ross asserted that the first black president faced unprecedented attacks. \"I have not told you whether I'm a Republican or Democrat and I won't,\" he says. But I do believe this nation will miss this president. I really do. Like it or not, he brought us through a recession. Like it or not, he bailed out an auto industry. Like it or not, he found and dealt with one of the biggest terrorists that we've ever seen ... in our history. And the list could go on and on. And yet they call him a weak president, and I'll never understand that.\" -- Morning Edition associate editor Reena Advani contributed to this report.",

NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith joins us to discuss the impact of Justice Antonin Scalia's death on the Democratic side of the race. Welcome back. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Thank you, Ari. SHAPIRO: Remind us first what Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have said about the high court.

And so she's been talking about that more yesterday. She met with a group of dreamers. These are the young people who came to the country illegally as children but are now here with a legal status because of executive actions President Obama has taken. SHAPIRO: And the Supreme Court has said it's going to review those executive. KEITH: The Supreme Court is reviewing executive actions on immigration that president Obama took in 2014. Those actions likely affect many of these young people's parents more than the young people themselves. And Hillary Clinton said that case pending before the court is yet another reason why she believes a Democrat needs to replace President Obama. SHAPIRO: OK, so this court opening is throwing into sharp relief some other issues besides the court, from campaign finance to immigration to clean energy and things like that. Generally, Hillary Clinton is often described as the more pragmatic candidate while Bernie Sanders is described as more idealistic. Do you see that playing out in this debate over the future of the court? KEITH: Well, presidents have always had to balance idealism versus pragmatism when making Supreme Court nominations because they have to make it through the Senate, those nominees. And often, the Senate is divided, as it is now. It's narrowly divided in favor of Republicans. President Obama, in the past, has chosen judges with inspiring life stories and relatively moderate records. We don't know what he'll do this time, but the first question that Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders will get about that is, would you have made the same choice and questions like, who would you choose; what would your nominee look like? SHAPIRO: And do you have a sense that Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, based on their public statements, would nominate different kinds of people? You've said they have the same litmus test of overturning Citizens United. KEITH: A litmus test that President Obama has not expressed any support for, necessarily (laughter). You know, it - I guess I don't know the answer to that question. I think it depends, you know, once they're in office, what the dynamics are at the time. I think that this nomination will be yet another chance for Hillary Clinton to hug closer to President Obama, as she has done in the past. And a very interesting dynamic here is Bernie Sanders is a current senator. He is a member of the United States Senate. If the Senate actually does take up this nominee, he'll get a vote. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Tamara Keith. Thanks, Tam. KEITH: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Hillary Clinton dismissed a report that emails she sent on her private email server contained a high level of classified material. Speaking to NPR's Ari Shapiro in San Antonio on Wednesday, the Democratic presidential candidate continued to maintain that she \"never sent or received any material marked classified\" while at the State Department \"and that hasn't changed in all of these months.\" According to a Fox News report Tuesday, more emails that went through Clinton's private email server than previously reported were classified beyond the \"Top Secret\" classification level, according to a letter sent to lawmakers from the Intelligence Community inspector general. The former secretary of state said the claim was a \"continuation of an interagency dispute that has been going on now for some months.\" \"As the State Department has confirmed, I never sent or received any material marked classified, and that hasn't changed in all of these months,\" she maintained. \"This, seems to me, to be, you know, another effort to inject this into the campaign. It's another leak.\" In response to the earlier Fox News report, the Republican National Committee said Clinton's email server issue \"has taken on an entirely new level of recklessness.\" \"The revelation that Clinton exposed intelligence from our most secretive and highly classified programs raises serious legal questions given the fact she signed non-disclosure agreements obligating her to protect classified information regardless of whether it was marked,\" said RNC spokesman Michael Short. Clinton added, \"I'm just going to leave it up to the professionals at the Justice Department, because nothing that this says changes the fact that I never sent or received material marked classified.\" She said \"the best we can determine\" is that the emails in question were a forward of a New York Times article on a classified drone program and that they had likely been retroactively classified. \"How a New York Times public article that goes around the world could be in any way viewed as classified, or the fact that it would be sent to other people off of the New York Times site, I think, is one of the difficulties that people have in understanding what this is about,\" Clinton said. Though the drone program was classified at the time, it was being written about publicly, which Clinton said, \"strikes me as somewhat strange that there would be a \u2014 an effort by those who are leaking this \u2014 and obviously that's what's happening \u2014 to try to raise concerns and doubts about information in the public sector.\" She added, \"But even if they have retroactive concerns and doubts, that doesn't change the fact that these were not marked classified at the time they were sent or received.\"",

The original program, implemented by President Obama in 2012, has come under fire from many Republican presidential candidates \u2014 many of whom have promised to end it if elected to the White House. Back in 2012, President Obama took executive action to create a program for unauthorized immigrants who entered the U.S. as children before June of 2007, and who are currently younger than 34. That program has come to be known as DACA \u2014 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \u2014 and since it was instituted, it has temporarily protected almost 700,000 people from deportation. How long the original DACA program lasts, though, will depend on who wins the 2016 presidential race. (There's also a lawsuit against an expansion Obama planned to make to the DACA program that has been appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.) By now, almost all of the Republicans running to replace Obama have been asked how they would handle the program as the next president. And just about all of them \u2014 including Gov. Chris Christie, Donald Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio \u2014 have said they would get rid of DACA. That's a scenario that immigrants like Valentina Garcia, a sophomore at Dartmouth College, are preparing for. \"I'm still trying to figure out if my major's going to work out, if my plan to go to medical school is going to work out. It all really depends on DACA,\" she says. Garcia was 6 years old when she and her family left Uruguay by plane on tourist visas. After those expired, they stayed in the U.S. In 2014, Garcia received DACA \u2014 and with it, a Social Security number. A Georgia resident, she was also able to apply for a driver's license. \"We've moved about four times in the past two years, and I've been the one that's been looking for houses. I've been the one that's transferring the utilities,\" Garcia says. \"I'm like the second dad, the second mom with my family.\" Roberto Gonzales, a sociologist at Harvard University, has studied the lives of young immigrants without legal status. And according to his studies, Garcia is by no means the only one who has taken on more responsibility in the family since DACA. \"They're playing greater roles within their family, within their community. And so an elimination of DACA would have ripple effects that extend far beyond these individuals,\" Gonzales says. He notes that the temporary work permits they receive through DACA have allowed many to stop working under the table. \"These young people have taken giant steps towards the American Dream,\" he adds. \"They now have new jobs. They're getting healthcare. They're building credit.\" But they're not on the path to citizenship \u2014 and their long-term future in the U.S. is still a big question mark. The Obama administration has put DACA recipients at the bottom of its priority list for deportation, but Victor Nieblas of the American Immigration Lawyers Association says that could change under a new administration. \"We have to be honest here,\" Nieblas says, \"and we have to indicate that it really all depends on who wins the presidency and the immigration policies of this new president\" \u2014 policies that could directly impact Jin Park, a 19-year-old Harvard student who was one of the first to receive DACA in 2012. \"Somebody can drag me out of my chemistry class at 10 a.m. and deport me,\" Park says. \"That is a real possibility, and it's scary, you know.\" Born in South Korea, Park was 7 when he took a plane to the U.S. with his parents. Like Garcia, Park and his family overstayed their tourist visas. Now, he says he's paying close attention to the presidential race \u2014 \"All the debates, all the Republican debates, I really try to watch.\" \"For me, surviving as a single mother with a child \u2014 you know, a 3-year-old \u2014 I definitely have to start thinking about savings,\" says Antonia Rivera of Des Moines, Iowa, a 33-year-old mother who is also preparing for the possible end to DACA. She walked across the border from Mexico illegally with her mother and younger sister when she was 6. \"I'm a survivor,\" Rivera says. \"I know how to survive without any source of legal document that allows me to work and drive legally in this country. But I know it's really, really hard to do.\" It's a challenge that more than a half-million DACA recipients may have to face when Obama leaves the White House.",

Reid tells Morning Edition's Rachel Martin that he \u2014 and many other Americans \u2014 are still anxious about the incoming Trump administration, but he sees reasons for optimism as well. \"I've learned to accept the Trump election,\" he says. On Americans' dreadful approval rating for Congress I agree with the American people. I don't have a real high regard for Congress either, because we're not getting things done. On Republicans' assessments that Reid was, in the words of party leader Sen. Mitch McConnell, \"the worst leader here ever\" Sometimes when people lose they strike out and say things they probably shouldn't. Sen. McConnell was at that time saying that because they'd held up scores of judges \u2014 98 to be exact. We had a National Labor Relations Board they were going to put out of business. And he lost that. We changed the rules of the Senate so they couldn't do that anymore. ... They tried over 70 times to repeal Obamacare; they couldn't get it done. I'd consider that a kind of a loss, wouldn't you? On why he thinks the Affordable Care Act might not go away If they repeal Obamacare, they are in for a rude awakening. I don't think they want to get rid of health care for 21 million Americans. I don't think they want to be those who say that if you have a disability, you can't get insurance \u2014 the way it used to be before Obamacare. ... They repeal Obamacare at their peril. On how his assessment of President-elect Donald Trump has changed I have to say this \u2014 he's not as bad as I thought he would be. ... We heard from Trump that one of the first things he was going to do is repeal [the Dreamers] executive order. In an interview he had with Time magazine in the last day or two, he said, \"Nah, I'm not going to do that\" \u2014 those young people deserve to stay here. He's not going to prosecute Hillary Clinton criminally, as he said he would do. Obviously he didn't believe in all of the stuff he said \u2014 which is a step in the right direction. ... You know, it's not as if Donald Trump and I have been enemies our whole lives \u2014 he's done fundraisers for me. When I was elected last time he sent me a letter saying \"you're awesome\" \u2014 a handwritten note. ... It's not as if I have hate in my soul for Donald Trump. I hope, beyond all, that he does well. It's important to the stability of this great nation we have. And I'm hopeful \u2014 I keep using that word, but that's what it is \u2014 hopeful that he will lessen his rhetoric and work toward a safer, more productive America.",

Carlos Curbelo prepares to speak at a Miami-Dade County school board meeting. Curbelo began his political career on the school board. Some congressional Republicans won their districts this year by distancing themselves from Donald Trump. So when the new Congress convenes in January, they'll have to figure out how to work with a president they didn't support. Miami Rep. Carlos Curbelo is in that group. He's a Republican who won big in a district that also went for Hillary Clinton. Now he faces some challenges in balancing the interests of his constituents while working with a Trump administration. Curbelo was elected to Congress two years ago. His district includes part of Miami-Dade County and the Florida Keys, and he won re-election by a double-digit margin. His win came despite significant headwinds. Redistricting a year ago added more Democratic voters. And Curbelo was struggling to overcome not just his Democratic opponent, but also a candidate at the top of the ticket who was decidedly unpopular in this largely Hispanic district \u2014 Donald Trump. \"It was a very ugly campaign,\" Curbelo says. \"I heard some of the things that were [being said]. And I instinctively said, 'I'm not going to support this person.' \" As part of his re-election campaign, Curbelo ran an ad that showed a clip from the Access Hollywood video in which Trump brags about forcing himself on women. In the end, Curbelo didn't vote for Trump. He cast his presidential ballot for a third-party candidate, but he won't say who. Now that the election is over, he's ready to work with the new Republican president. But Curbelo says Trump has a challenge. \"It's up to the president-elect, Mr. Trump, to earn the trust not just of the 47 percent of people who voted for him in this country, but of everyone,\" Curbelo says. That includes the more than 60 percent of voters in Miami who voted against Trump and for Hillary Clinton. In a district that's nearly 70 percent Hispanic, there's a lot of concern about the president-elect, particularly on the issue of immigration. Curbelo's most immediate concern is Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA, an executive order signed by President Obama that Trump promised he would undo. It protects hundreds of thousands of young people from deportation who were brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents as children. \"Many of them went to our schools,\" Curbelo says. \"They speak perfect English. A lot of them don't even speak another language such as Spanish or any other foreign language. These kids are Americans. Let's give them the full benefits of American citizenship.\" It's up to the president-elect, Mr. Trump, to earn the trust not just of the 47 percent of people who voted for him in this country, but of everyone. Rep. Carlos Curbelo Curbelo is also concerned about Trump's stance on climate change. In the past, Trump called it a \"hoax,\" but this week he softened that position, saying there may be \"some connectivity\" between human activity and climate change. Curbelo says he's ready to fight the president on this issue if necessary. \"When it comes to climate change and specifically sea level rise, which is a direct consequence, we are the tip of the spear,\" he says. \"Most people in my district live near sea level and near the sea. So we cannot backtrack on any of this.\" On these issues, there's little question that Curbelo is in step with voters in his Miami district. But opposing the president of your own party always carries a risk. Fernand Amandi of the polling firm Bendixen & Amandi says while it helped him win re-election, Curbelo's independent position could hurt him down the road. \"If you think about the long-term play here,\" Amandi says, \"especially if Donald Trump continues to grow in popularity amongst Republican Party circles and grows in popularity with the American people, it may come back to bite Carlos Curbelo, that position.\" As he prepares to begin his second term in Congress, Curbelo says he won't be either a cheerleader for President-elect Trump or a permanent critic. He says Congress' role is to work with the president and hold him accountable \u2014 even if he's a member of the same party.",

In Texas that has frightened hundreds of thousands of so-called \"dreamers.\"  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Donald Trump vows that his administration will deport millions of immigrants who are in this country illegally. In Texas, that has frightened tens of thousands of so-called dreamers. They're young immigrants who were brought to this country by their parents illegally and have grown up here, essentially as Americans. Here's NPR's Wade Goodwyn. WADE GOODWYN, BYLINE: Melissa Alfaro sits in the center of her prestigious Dallas law firm's conference room encircled by earnest young 20-somethings dressed in their best business attire. MELISSA ALFARO: When you're doing a cover letter, as with anything else, you're selling yourself. So this is your time to say, this is why I'm awesome. GOODWYN: Alfaro is a director at the Latino Center for Leadership Development, and she's teaching these soon-to-be or new college graduates the best strategies to get their first professional J-O-B. ALFARO: This is not the time to be humble. I've noticed that a lot of things that you guys have done you haven't put on your resumes, right? GOODWYN: Normally, the training focuses on job interviews, resumes that pop and the best strategies to research your prospective company's corporate culture. But after the presidential election upset by Donald Trump, there's now the unexpected issue of their suddenly vulnerable legal status. MONICA LIRA BRAVO: If some directive comes out basically saying that he's nullifying DACA, well, then I would not advise you to travel - right? - because your advanced parole is based on you having deferred action. GOODWYN: Dallas immigration attorney Monica Lira Bravo takes the young attendees through the legal niceties of DACA. It stands for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, and every student here has been under its temporary legal protection since President Obama's 2012 executive action. ITZEL RUIZ: I did mention I was 4, but I feel like those were, like, my earliest memories. Like, I can perfectly recall my early life here in Dallas when we used to live in this really small apartment. GOODWYN: Itzel Ruiz was brought to Texas from Mexico City by her parents nearly two decades ago. She's the oldest child. Her siblings were all born here in Texas. Ruiz is a senior at the University of North Texas majoring in marketing and psychology. But her undocumented status has haunted her. She remembers when President Obama held a press conference and lifted that burden like it was yesterday. RUIZ: Yes, I cried (laughter). That was a very special day. GOODWYN: The president's executive action gave Ruiz temporary legal status, freeing her from the threat of deportation. She could also get a driver's license, a work permit, a social security number. With those, she was able to open a bank account, establish credit, drive to school and work - in short, live her life like her younger siblings and American friends did. RUIZ: Before DACA, like, I had no idea of where my future was headed. Obviously, I kind of knew what I didn't have. But with DACA, like, big doors just opened. Endless opportunities just opened, so I knew, like, I had hope. GOODWYN: But what one president grants with the stroke of a pen, another president can take away just as easily. RUIZ: I try not to think about it. But, yeah (laughter)... GOODWYN: Ruiz is on the cusp of graduating from college and starting her adult life in earnest. The prospect that her future could be snatched away at this very moment is difficult. RUIZ: You're just not guaranteed, you know, another day with your family simply because you don't have a nine-digit number to your name (sobbing) - I'm so sorry (sobbing). GOODWYN: In exchange for DACA's protections, more than three-quarters of a million undocumented young immigrants have, thus far, submitted to federal investigation to verify they are who they say and have committed no felony or serious misdemeanors. But these dreamers and their advocates now worry this information will be used to round them up. REBECCA ACUNA: We are nervous that President-elect Trump will do what he has said he would do. GOODWYN: Rebecca Acuna is the executive director of the Latino Center for Leadership Development, the group that's providing this job training. ACUNA: The President Trump administration now has the names, addresses, family information of people who have said they were in the country illegally. There are fears that somebody will take a look at that information and deport them. GOODWYN: Since winning the election, President-elect Trump has hinted he might be flexible about his approach on some issues. On immigration, Trump's indicated he will begin his deportation endeavors with undocumented convicted criminals. But he's not specified where the expulsions will end. Dreamers are praying it's before the new president gets 'round to them. Wade Goodwyn, NPR News, Dallas. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

How? Russo built his latest novel, Everybody's Fool, on that tale. It centers on a middle-aged police chief with questions about his late wife and, indeed, about his whole life. It's a sequel to 1993's Nobody's Fool, which became a movie starring Paul Newman and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Both books are about blue-collar guys in a blue-collar town \u2014 an old city in upstate New York that used to have mills and factories; the kind of place where Russo himself grew up. Russo won a Pulitzer Prize in 2002 for his novel Empire Falls, which is set in another fictional mill town. Everybody's Fool is his eighth novel. On where the characters are in their lives Rather like their author, I suppose, they have reached a point in life where they are looking ahead at an uncertain future, but more importantly looking backwards and trying to, I don't know, figure out ... what has all of this added up to? On how different his life is from that of his blue-collar grandfather My own life has changed so dramatically in ways that I never would have predicted, coming from a small mill town in upstate New York, from parents and grandparents who didn't think of themselves as poor, but didn't have any money. I find myself now, at 66, having lived the American dream to a point at which I think would have completely mystified my maternal grandfather. ... The life that I'm living \u2014 which is of course the life that he would have dreamed for me had he been that ambitious a dreamer \u2014 is pretty astonishing. ... It would have seemed like arrogance, I think, to my grandfather to assume that he was ever going to be living a hugely different life from the life that he lived. On who the characters of Everybody's Fool would vote for in this election I think it's pretty clear that so many of the people that I know and love and have been writing about for a long time, alas, have lined up ... with Mr. Trump. ... I'm heartbroken. ... I think America is changing. It's changing before their eyes and I think that a lot of the angry white men who support Donald Trump have a belief that America has passed them by. And that people who don't look like them are getting ahead in the new America. And I think they all understand in some ways that Donald Trump is speaking in a less coded way than some others in the Republican Party, but he's saying Make America white again, not Make America great again. And I think, unfortunately, working class people have bought that. And that's why my heart is broken.",

Something tells me that 300 or maybe even 3,000 years from now \u2014 if we still have breathable air and if we haven't relocated to Mars, and if super-intelligent robots haven't colonized us Matrix-style \u2014 we'll still be trying our best to dissect and parse out the \u00fcberfunky, hyper-synaptic, wildly eccentric, crazy-magical boho black genius of Prince Rogers Nelson. The Minneapolis maestro died at age 57 on Thursday from causes that have yet to be clarified at this time. Prince's oeuvre since the late 1970s remains so profoundly voluminous (even just the news of it being in kept in a vault has always sounded impressive), and so musically and sonically ambitious, that it immediately turns any attempt to summarize its legacy succinctly into a half-hearted and incomplete gesture. I doubt that anybody could write the ultimate, wrapped-in-a-bow thinkpiece on Prince: there is no read long enough, no format collaborative enough, to do justice to his prolific life and work in one fell swoop. To the degree that nobody blinks an eye when we talk about Mozart or Beethoven studies, it's not a stretch to say that we need more Prince scholars writing Prince tomes teaching Prince classes in schools where his legacy emerges as a matter of priority. Prince's death feels like a sucker punch, in part because he was such a powerhouse force in mainstream pop that he sometimes seemed to stand in for creativity itself. In the mid-'90s \u2014 during the period in which he demanded to be referred to as a symbol (or The Artist Formerly Known As Prince) given his legal struggle with record label Warner over the use of his name \u2014 many of us resorted to shorthand and called him, simply, The Artist. Which emerging pop star today would, or could, deserve that sort of expansive title? I look at 1978-1988 as Prince's golden age of commercial and critical success (which is not to diminish any of the glorious work he did before or after). No recording artist during the '80s delivered as many sophisticated musical ideas as Prince over the course of successive albums within a ten-year period. No artist in that decade showed more willingness or more ability to engage with avant-garde, risky musical ideas in the context of MTV-ready pop. And no artist in the '80s demonstrated more outright talent as a singer, guitar shredder, multi-instrumentalist, songwriter, composer, producer and visual innovator all rolled into one. What some of us may be experiencing in this moment of collective grief is the fear that we will never again experience that kind of monumental excellence in pop, especially given today's fractured, atomized and low-stakes music business. A tremendously shrewd industry player, Prince came to emblematize 35 years of changes in the making and distribution of music \u2014 from the \"time-capsule\" approach to marketing pop stars and pop albums that emerged in the '80s; to the increasing synergy between music and films demonstrated by the success of Purple Rain; to the development of the Internet in the '90s and the concomitant debates about musicians' rights in an economic value chain; to the return of live music in the '00s social media era as a primary source of profitability for touring musicians. Prince was at the forefront of all these changes. More than three decades after his debut, he still had the greatest live act on the planet, bolstered by a sprawling, impressive catalog of hits. And so Prince's passing (in tandem with that of Michael Jackson, Donna Summer, Whitney Houston, David Bowie, Maurice White and so many other defining icons of the '70s and '80s that we've lost in the last seven years) feels like merely the latest reminder that we may have hit the terminal end of the traditional recorded music era. The times, they have definitely a-changed. Prince may have been the greatest self-contained musical genius to emerge since the late '70s, but we should consider how he followed in the footsteps of performer-songwriter-producer hybrids like Brian Wilson, Todd Rundgren and Stevie Wonder. Prince would have been between eight and ten years old in 1966-1968, that crucial two-year stretch in which the Beatles released audacious game-changer concept albums Revolver, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Magical Mystery Tour and The White Album. In 1967, James Brown further changed the game by introducing the rhythmic funk innovation of \"Cold Sweat,\" and in 1968 Hendrix redefined rock-guitar-god-heroism and the idea of the recording studio as a laboratory with Electric Ladyland. Those tectonic shifts, along with other musical developments, opened up even more space for ambitious musicians into the early and mid-'70s, when artists as wide-ranging as Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Roxy Music, Queen, Jeff Lynne, David Bowie and Paul Simon (to name just a few) ventured into a diversity of experimental pop modes. And a spate of black and Latino singer-songwriters with profound musical gifts and socio-political messages to boot, such as Sly Stone, Maurice White, George Clinton, Isaac Hayes, Marvin Gaye, Carlos Santana and Curtis Mayfield, delivered some of the most transcendent records of the era. This musical context is the world of prodigiousness out of which Prince was formed; despite persistent myths, he did not spring into success out of some cultural vacuum nor did he jump out of the womb as a fully-formed rock star. Born to musician parents of southern extraction, the young prodigy knew he wanted to pursue a music career by age 12 \u2014 that is to say, around 1970 \u2014 and he could not have made that decision at a more opportune time, since all he had to do was tune into black radio stations like KUXL to hear R&B and prog soul and then switch the dial to a white rock station like KQRS to hear prog rock and singer-songwriter pop. His listening habits were formed in a moment of unprecedented access to musical diversity. If geniuses are made rather than born, it's important to note that as part of his Gladwellian 10,000 hours of practice, teenage Prince recorded with and formed his own Minneapolis high school bands (Grand Central, Champagne, 94 East), shopped around failed demo tapes and clocked in endless hours jamming with like-minded musicians including Andr\u00e9 Cymone and Morris Day. The twin city Minneapolis / St. Paul environs that gave forth artists like the Andrews Sisters and Bob Dylan to this day remains a racially divided one; it's no surprise that by the '80s Prince's crossover, genre-busting music positioned him as a kind of pre-Obama racial reconciler, bringing together whites and non-whites. He also grew up in a broken home (his parents divorced when he was eight), and so it's not a stretch to imagine that Prince, who came of musical age in the gender-bending glam era, might have also seen himself as a bridge between men and women not only in his music and life but maybe even in his own physical body \u2014 one possible explanation for the transcendently androgynous image he came to embody in the late '70s and beyond. By 1977, Stevie Wonder had racked up three Album of the Year Grammys in four years, and major labels were insistent on finding the \"next Stevie\" \u2014 that self-contained black artist who could write, produce, perform and, most importantly, generate profitable hits. Warner bet its money on teenage Prince; and along with manager Owen Husney, the kid genius fought for and received unprecedented artistic control over his debut album, 1978's For You. He ended up playing more than 20 instruments on the record; and though accomplished, For You still sounds tentative \u2014 groover \"Soft and Wet\" made only a modest splash on the R&B charts. Prince's next five records, however \u2014 Prince (1979), Dirty Mind (1980), Controversy (1981), 1999 (1982) and Purple Rain (1984) \u2014 raised the bar, setting a possibly unmatched standard of artistic accomplishment within a five-year period. Those of us fortunate enough to come of age in these formative years are prone to deify Prince's cool, pimp-informed swagger, his practiced enigma and his audacious musical heroism. Those qualities were in full display on his eponymous album, brimming over with authoritative disco-funk grenades like \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\" and \"Sexy Dancer\" and intimate ballads like \"With You,\" as breezy as the singer's blowout on the album cover. Appearing on shows like American Bandstand, Prince began his lifelong practice of giving terminally weird, pseudo-camera shy interviews (my late father once referred to Prince as a \"worm.\") Prince was diminished by some as nothing more than a Rick James clone; but in truth he was, at that time, an alternative, risqu\u00e9 soul music dynamo who had supplanted The Jacksons on the covers of the sort of teenybopper magazines that endlessly speculated about his romantic affiliation with peer multi-instrumentalist Patrice Rushen (for whom \"I Wanna be Your Lover\" and \"I Feel For You\" were originally intended). With a piercing falsetto, a lush romantic baritone and a lethal gospel squall that sounded like 1,000 seagulls being guillotined at once, Prince had willed himself into a great singer. He'd also become a masterful songwriter. Dirty Mind was a phenomenal attempt to fuse the then-trendy New Wave sound (think Blondie, Devo) with post-disco synth-funk in the strategic effort to cross over to a wider pop audience. It worked. Who could have minded the calculation, given Prince's stellar songwriting and minimalist production on tunes like wistful \"When You Were Mine\" and groovy \"Do It All Night\"? Controversy followed suit with the swaggering title track (which Meshell Ndegeocello once praised as the slick sound of a musical \"fashion runway\"), hard-rocking \"Sexuality,\" bustling \"Let's Work\" and dreamy Quiet Storm radio mainstay \"Do Me Baby.\" 1999 helped Prince reach an even wider audience, as it crested on popular tunes like synth-rockabilly \"Delirious,\" automobile-meets-oral-sex classic \"Little Red Corvette\" and galvanizing \"Let's Pretend We're Married.\" Prince emerged as the most valuable contributor to the burgeoning Minneapolis sound, a diverse fusion of synth pop, new wave, funk and rock sounds featuring heavily gated, programmed drums and analog synths replacing traditional funk horns. But no one sound has ever defined Prince. Even by the early '80s it was evident that there was no real end to his grab bag of musical ideas or sounds, even on the course of a single album. For 1984's Purple Rain, Prince attempted to do what his closest artistic rival Michael Jackson could not: establish himself as a bona fide film star. Drawing on the business model Robert Stigwood created for 1977 box office bonanza Saturday Night Fever, Prince mythologized his own ascension to stardom in a loosely autobiographical film that rode to glory on a phenomenal soundtrack with long-legged pop-rock hits like \"When Doves Cry\" and \"Let's Go Crazy.\" Purple Rain, like Thriller before it, was the recorded music album as blockbuster, pop as mass cultural moment. At the height of MTV's newfound '80s success, the soundtrack set entirely new standards for the degree to which a black artist could cross over to the mainstream. Enjoying his global superstardom, Prince had already settled into a curious penchant for all things purple, and his supercool fashion choices included skin-tight pants with royal court blazers with over-the-top ruffles and heels. An aloof but freaky-deaky lothario, Prince became the people's guitar hero but not the kind celebrity you imagine hanging out with at parties or sitting on your living room couch throwing back beers. (Well, depending on who you are and what kind of living room you have.) Prince staked his claim as the musical royalty that his birthname had always already suggested. In the process, he racked up enormous multi-platinum sales, and took home multiple Grammys and an Oscar. Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential election marked a new conservative era in American life and politics. It's important to remember, especially for those of us who were young then, that the '80s were something of a frightening time, defined by frightful news stories about nuclear brinkmanship and the onslaught of acid rain. In films like 1982's First Blood and 1984's Red Dawn, we saw the disturbing trend of a toughened, hardbodied machismo and a political cynicism to match. That decade, generally speaking, also saw a burgeoning celebrity culture tied to the rise of a greed-driven secular materialism and an increasingly inward turn (after Tom Wolfe's me-decade description of the '70s) to focus on the physical body (Olivia Newton John's 1982 \"Physical\" and Jane Fonda's highly-popular aerobics videos come to mind here). Black poor and working-class communities in the U.S. were economically devastated by the Reagan administration's massive cuts in spending on social services and on urban development; conditions in inner cities suffered blight due to the social devastation of crack cocaine, well-documented by topical rap songs like 1982's \"The Message.\" In some ways, Prince's '80s \"Dance Music Sex Romance\" mantra offered a thrilling counter-representation, and even a direct critique, to the foreclosure of liberal, ethical, spiritual and erotic possibility that Reaganism proffered. On his classic Oberheim-synth-driven hit \"1999,\" which still doesn't seem dated some 16 years after Y2K, Prince encouraged us to party hard like it was the end of the world \u2014 and given how imminent many of us thought nuclear escalation was in 1982, the end sometimes did feel nigh. Prince also courted politics on songs like 1981's \"Ronnie, Talk to Russia\" and \"Annie Christian,\" on political party jams like 1980's \"Partyup\" as well as later on the magnificent 1987 Sign O' The Times title track, of course (to name just a few of his powerful political moments on record). He remained deeply engaged with topical social issues his entire career, as demonstrated by last year's \"Baltimore\" written to memorialize Freddie Gray's violent death while in police custody. Though Prince didn't necessarily have a coherent political program in the '80s, what crucially distinguished him was his willingness to break cultural taboos. Borrowing and transmuting ideas from a long line of shock R&B stars ranging from Screamin' Jay Hawkins to Millie Jackson to Blowfly and Rick James, Prince was the '80s greatest provocateur, not only cursing on songs but singing explicitly about subjects like giving head (\"Head\"), fantasizing about sex with his sister (\"Sister\") and masturbation (\"Darling Nikki\"). To say his music was intensely sexual is a massive understatement: this is the man who brought us such classics as \"Irresistible B****,\" \"Jack U Off,\" \"Scarlet P****,\" \"Feel U Up\" and my personal favorite, 1984's \"Erotic City\" (I distinctly remember having to turn down the volume on my boombox in the presence of my mother every time the word \"f***\" came through the loudspeakers). Given that his synth-driven, boho-new-wave inspired pop fusion often sounded akin to a black robot trying its hand at funk with awesome results, and given that he frequently penned impressionistic, dreamlike lyrical images of the future, Prince in some ways prefigured and anticipated the mainstreaming of the Afro-Futurism and Afropunk movements. Prince also deserves recognition for creating multi-gender, multi-racial bands like the Revolution and the New Power Generation; in so doing, he offered us a nonconformist ideal that could serve as reprieve from neo-conservatism's racial homogenization and from the persistent threat of social marginalization. In that context, Prince himself came to revolutionize the presentation of expressive black masculinity. Physically beautiful, racially ambiguous and frequently androgynous, Prince was openly fond of paisley and lace, and he spoke in a lithe voice that was more than a little femme. He was slight, and short, but always seemed to be surrounded by beautiful women he either worked with or dated, or both, from Sheila E. to Sheena Easton to Vanity and Apollonia. Prince's macho-fey rebel persona owes a huge debt to queer camp pioneers like Little Richard, Tony Washington of the Dynamic Superiors, Freddie Mercury, Jobriath, David Bowie, Elton John and Sylvester, all of whom helped paved the way for Prince to be free to be himself in the public arena. As did Bowie, Prince showed us that you could self-fashion \u2014 you could live a life not strictly determined by how others defined you, but more often by how you defined yourself. The impact of that message of transformative self-liberation, especially as it became mainstreamed through Prince's enormous success in the '80s, instigated incalculable effects on successive generations of LGBQ and trans folks, freedom seeking libertarians, antiracist dreamers, nudist exhibitionists, anarchist revolutionaries, and multitudes of others around the planet. No black artist who came before Prince aggregated so many diverse people in the service of anti-normativity and polymorphous perversity; the world is a better and richer place for it. Indeed, the introduction of the perverse into mainstream Top 40 pop was core to Prince's cultural power in his golden period. Madonna followed suit, as did others. And by the late '00s, Lady Gaga drew from the Madonna and Prince playbook, taking it further even, to redefine provocation through performance art traditions and the visual grotesque. Those hoping to recreate Prince's enigma-wrapped path to glory in 2016 should beware: it's no longer clear what perversity looks and feels like anymore in an age of Xtube.com and casual teen sexting. We now live at a time when strategically-leaked sex tapes might actually be your quickest path to reality television success. Good luck with that. Prince followed Purple Rain with movie flops like 1986's Under the Cherry Moon and 1990's Graffiti Bridge as well as mixed-bag, still-fascinating albums like Around the World in a Day and Parade. But he delivered his career masterpiece with 1987's Sign of the Times, in which electro-funk tunes like \"U Got the Look\" sit on the same double album as the Joni Mitchell inspired avant-poetry of \"The Ballad of Dorothy Parker\" and psychosexual mini-dramas (\"If I Was Your Girlfriend,\" \"Strange Relationship\"), religious joints (\"The Cross\") and party bangers (\"Housequake\"). I'm intentionally sidestepping the massive and amazing body of work he released after SOTT, in the late '80s, '90s and '00s, only because there's no way to cover it all here. As if Prince's musical ventures weren't enough, he was also an entrepreneur who eagerly developed other artists, including Sheila E., The Time and The Bangles, by writing and producing classic tracks for them. His Paisley Park label and recording studio complex served as a major part of his business operations, and by the '90s he began actively fighting with Warner for control over his copyrights by declaring himself a slave and carving the word into his beard in controversial manner. Years later, the anti-corporate struggle resulted in Prince getting back some ownership of his masters, though it arguably drained him of artistic energy, given that the records kept coming but the hits did not. Prince never failed to provide unwavering support for other serious musicians, especially women like Mavis Staples and Chaka Khan, and more recently Esperanza Spalding, Lianne Le Havas, Judith Hill and his all female band 3rdeyegirl. Prince wanted you to know that he did not usually suffer musical foolishness (though his porno-chic proclivities sometimes meant he was quite business-minded about promoting mediocre singers who looked like they could have stepped out of a Victoria Secret's catalog). If he showed up on stage to perform with an artist, it's generally because he thought that artist had a gift to offer the world. Prince also emerged as a public advocate for the labor rights of other musicians, and he was an active if under-the-radar philanthropist, donating millions to causes and projects that he felt mattered, including Van Jones' Yes We Code initiative to give underserved young people training. Prince's lifelong support of the black community both in his music and his personal life meant that he was known to put his considerable money where his mouth was, in ways that also served to put to rest charges of colorism that plagued his earlier career. Let's face it, though: Prince had his shady moments too. He was a copyright maximalist who could be incredibly inflexible around the application of his own musical assets. Though by the late '90s he had emerged as a revolutionary with respect to various sorts of musical distribution on the Internet, he relentlessly disallowed his own music to circulate freely (not that he should have) and even allegedly sued fans who uploaded his content illegally. He could also be hypocritical in that he was hostile and dismissive and even ungenerous if other artists wanted to cover his music, but he regularly covered other artists' songs live and on record. His maximalist approach to these matters was often underwritten by the argument that he was merely attempting to control the distribution of his own music in a free-for-all Internet economy which has reduced the perceptual value of music to nil \u2014 and he might have been right. But given his commitment to the creative process, his approach ran afoul of the generative DIY creativity and opportunities for \"copyleft\" sharing that the Internet itself technologically makes possible. Ironically, though a whole host of millenials are not intimately familiar with the Prince catalog because it has been stripped from the Internet (with the exception of Tidal), he has re-emerged as a viral Internet meme, like in the wildly popular video series \"Got 2B Real,\" where his image has been manipulated to make him appear as a shady judge in rivalry with fellow musicians ranging from Aretha Franklin to Beyonc\u00e9. When comedian Dave Chappelle humorously parodied Prince in a sketch on The Chappelle Show, Prince cheekily fired back by using an image of Chappelle in Prince drag on the cover of his 2013 single \"Breakfast Can Wait.\" In his later years, Prince managed to gleefully and winkingly undercut his imposing presence as the era's reigning musical sovereign and Internet disciplinarian \u2014 and endear himself to younger generations \u2014 with such impulsive, \"I'm in on the joke too\" gestures. One other point: No image anywhere in Michael Jackson's entire creative output is as violent, pugilistic and misogynistically repulsive as the scene in Purple Rain where Prince's character punches Apollonia in the face, though some have argued the film is a subversive text about masculinity, gender and domestic abuse. Even as a child, I found the image ugly: I've never been able to forget it. Ironically, despite the way Prince's libertarian ethos acted as a powerful retort to Republican-era repression, Prince himself eventually came to represent a certain strain of social conservatism. In the early '00s, he converted to the Jehovah's Witness faith and became a bit of a public Bible thumper, even railing against the mainstreaming of trans identity on 2013's \"Da Bourgeoisie\" (a new millennium update of his early anti-lesbian track \"Bambi\"). Middle-aged Prince refused to revisit some of the more explicit tracks and albums from his golden years, and this remains, for me, an unfortunate disappointment. That refusal separates Prince from his Afropunk peer Grace Jones, who seems to have largely sustained her pursuit of polymorphic pleasure well into her 60s. We'd do well to remember that there can be no revolution, no collective utopia, without the pursuit of total sexual and erotic freedom (insofar as people treat each other with mutual respect). That freedom includes the kink Prince willfully purveyed at the start of his career, but then abandoned. Still, none of this is to take away from Prince's stunning legacy. By some accounts, a rainbow appeared over Prince's Paisley Park home in Minneapolis in the hours after his death. The song that immediately came to mind, for me, when I heard the news of his passing, given the month that we're in, was 1986's eerily melancholy \"Sometimes it Snows in April\" \u2014 a ballad featuring a poignant lyric that now seems quaint in the age of climate change. But it strikes me that, in Bowie fashion, Prince may have been a prophet of even his own demise. What Prince always managed to do throughout his career was operate in an antiracist, multigender, polysexual funky boho avant-garde space of freedom that infused his image, sound/music and sometimes his lyrics. That free space doesn't yet exist in our increasingly xenophobic, privatized, divided world \u2014 but we can get there, and Prince illuminated it for us. In that sense, Prince was not only ahead of his time, but we can think of him as a clairvoyant whose prophecies are yet to be realized. One way to honor Prince in our grief is to remind ourselves how good and how important is to be, well, a weirdo, to let your freak flag fly, to live life out loud and proud, to shock the bourgeoisie, to cultivate a social conscience, to make ethical art that is connected to a spiritual purpose, to own your work and to own your name in a culture of commodification, to stay rooted to your beginnings and to practice and master your craft. We're here to get through this thing called Life, and through the example of his music, Prince has left us the richest possible blueprint with which to do so.",

            "article_content": "President Obama is seen on a television inside the U.S. Capitol delivering his last State of the Union address in 2015.\n                \n                    \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Obama is seen on a television inside the U.S. Capitol delivering his last State of the Union address in 2015. On Tuesday night, President Obama will give his final State of the Union address. It's the last big speech many Americans will watch him deliver, and he wants to leave a good impression. Here are five things to watch for. 1. How different will this speech be from his past State of the Union addresses? White House aides are promising that this speech will be different. Instead of the usual laundry list of legislative proposals, the speech will be thematic and future-oriented. President Obama described what he wants the speech to focus on in a video the White House sent out previewing the speech. \"Not just the remarkable progress we've made, not just what I want to get done in the year ahead, but what we all need to do together in the years to come, the big things that will guarantee an even stronger, better, more prosperous America for our kids \u2014 the America we believe in. That's what's on my mind.\" This makes sense. With attention turning to the race to succeed him, the window for passing major pieces of legislation through an oppositional Congress is closing fast. But there are still things the president wants Congress to do. 2. What are Obama's legislative priorities? The president will probably reiterate his call for a hike in the minimum wage, as well as tax reform that frees up money for infrastructure investment. But those are big reaches. More realistically, the White House is hopeful they can get Congress to approve the big trans-Pacific trade agreement and a bill overhauling the criminal justice system. Expect to hear Obama offer an olive branch to the Republicans on those potentially bipartisan issues. 3. How will the president try to shape his legacy? This is a valedictory speech, and Obama will try to frame his accomplishments in the most positive light. He'll talk about the dramatic recovery of the auto industry, the improving employment situation and the initiatives he's taken on his own to combat climate change, enact tougher gun background checks and reopen relations with Cuba. The White House announced over the weekend the guests who will join first lady Michelle Obama in the House chamber. Those selections nod to the arc of Obama's presidency, and the president will no doubt nod to them on Tuesday night. They include Edith Childs, the South Carolina woman who inspired the \"Fired up! Ready to go!\" chant during Obama's first campaign, one of the first women to graduate from Army Ranger School, a DREAMer, the lead plaintiff in the historic Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage, an empty chair for victims of gun violence, a criminal justice reform advocate, an Affordable Care Act \"navigator\" and many others. Of course, the best way for President Obama to cement his legacy is to help elect a successor from his own party. 4. How will Obama use the speech to help Hillary Clinton's campaign? In his last State of the Union address, the president framed the coming election in terms of the economic debate. He talked about widely shared prosperity and focused on inclusive growth, not just redistribution. And that's the frame Hillary Clinton has chosen for her campaign. Expect to hear more about that on Tuesday night. Also listen for how often the president touches on hot-button issues that play well with the Democratic base, like climate change, gun control, immigration reform or gay rights. The White House promises this won't be a \"political\" speech, but the subtext will be clear: We've come a long way. We have a long way to go, so let's not let the Republicans take us backward. 5. What effect will the speech have? Most State of the Union addresses have a very short shelf life. But a well-received SOTU can deliver a political boost. President Obama is hoping this one does. The best way a president can help elect a successor from his own party is to get his approval ratings up \u2014 above 50 percent, if possible. Obama has been stuck in the mid-40s for months, below the 50 percent that President Reagan enjoyed at this point in his second term or the 60 percent Bill Clinton had. If he can improve his standing, he could help Hillary Clinton and his own legacy.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump told CBS he plans to build a barrier on the U.S.-Mexico border. Adding he's not going to round up all unauthorized immigrants as he vowed during the campaign \u2014 just the law breakers.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: During the campaign, Donald Trump talked tough about immigration wherever he went. And judging from an interview the other night on the CBS program \"60 Minutes,\" no reason to think he won't follow through with at least some action. Trump said he definitely plans to build a barrier on the U.S.-Mexican border. He said he is not going to round up all 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. as he vowed during the campaign. He just wants to round up the criminals. Here's more from NPR's John Burnett. JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: Immigration was a potent issue for voters like Casey Boyd. She's a mobile phone salesperson who voted a straight GOP ticket at her polling place in Bigfoot, Texas, and she expects action. CASEY BOYD: Illegal people of all types, not just Hispanics, but, you know, the Syrians and Cubans and - whoever doesn't belong here, I really hope that that gets under control. BURNETT: Never mind that most Cubans and Syrians are here legally. Trump has made clear he will decide who doesn't belong here. Here's what he told Leslie Stahl of CBS. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and - have criminal records - gang members, drug dealers. We have a lot of these people, probably 2 million. It could even be 3 million. We are getting them out of our country or we're going to incarcerate. But we're getting them out of our country. They're here illegally. BURNETT: Immigration and Customs Enforcement estimates there are about 2 million so-called removeable criminal aliens in the United States. But most of them are not drug dealers and gang members or murderers and rapists as Trump says. The majority of offenses by noncitizens are nonviolent, such as shoplifting or driving under the influence. JESSICA VAUGHAN: Most people who get arrested are arrested for lesser crimes. BURNETT: Jessica Vaughan blogs about deportation policy at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank in favor of less immigration and tighter borders. Even though these may be lesser crimes, Trump is indicating he wants his deportation force to round them all up and send them home, a position Vaughan favors. VAUGHAN: Fewer of the criminal aliens who are discovered will be falling through the cracks. BURNETT: In contrast, as a matter of priority, Obama's immigration agents have focused their efforts on only the most serious criminals. A lot of people are asking whether Trump's immigration police will also target the so-called dreamers. That's the name given to the more than 700,000 unauthorized immigrants who were brought to this country as children. Under one of Obama's executive orders, he gave them temporary work permits and protection from deportation. Trump has vowed to cancel every one of these presidential orders. Juan Belman is a 23-year-old dreamer studying anthropology at the University of Texas. He wonders when his work permit expires in June if he'll be deported back to Mexico, which he left when he was 10. JUAN BELMAN: I think a lot of us were getting used to having this work permit, used to having driver's license. And now that those are going to be done I think we're going to have to rethink everything from bottom up. BURNETT: Belman lives in Austin, Texas, a city that may be on Trump's blacklist. Trump has vowed to cancel federal law enforcement grants to so-called sanctuary cities. Police in Austin and about 150 other jurisdictions around the country refuse to turn over unauthorized immigrants to federal authorities. UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Chanting in Spanish). BURNETT: At an immigrant solidarity rally on Sunday, Mayor Steve Adler struck a defiant tone. He said, regardless who the next president is, Austin will remain a city that offers sanctuary to unauthorized immigrants... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STEVE ADLER: Where everyone living in Austin deserves to feel safe and to be welcome. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Speaking Spanish). (APPLAUSE) BURNETT: For proof that Trump's America will be harder for immigrants to enter, look no further than the chief of his new transition team for immigration policy. Kris Kobach is Kansas secretary of state. He's best known for offering harsh anti-immigrant bills around the country and for giving Trump the idea to seize remittances sent home by immigrants as a way to force Mexico to bankroll the border wall. Kobach spoke to KWCH TV the day after the election. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KRIS KOBACH: There's no question the wall is going to get built. The only question is how quickly will it get done, and who else pay for it. BURNETT: Immigrant advocates who found the Obama White House willing to listen to them expect a different reception over the next four years. MICHELLE BRANE: Our concern is that we will be shut out from discussions. BURNETT: Michelle Brane of the Women's Refugee Commission is among progressive activists who are trying to figure out how they can be effective and protect immigrants going forward. BRANE: For undocumented immigrants, there will be a pretty intense focus on deportation and I assume detention. BURNETT: Now, listen to the other side - Roy Beck, at NumbersUSA, which shares Donald Trump's aspirations for stricter immigration. ROY BECK: We've been in the wilderness for 20 years under the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations - doesn't matter the party. And yes, now we are in the room. BURNETT: As the parable in the Bible says, the last shall first and the first shall be last. John Burnett, NPR News, Austin. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Steve Bannon, the Trump campaign's CEO and the former executive chairman of Breitbart News, will serve as chief strategist and senior counselor in the Trump White House.\n                \n                    \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Steve Bannon, the Trump campaign's CEO and the former executive chairman of Breitbart News, will serve as chief strategist and senior counselor in the Trump White House. Steve Bannon, the newly named chief strategist for the nascent Trump White House, boasts a resume packed with a series of seeming non sequiturs. He had a stint in the U.S. Navy, worked for a stretch at Goldman Sachs, became a Hollywood investor who made a fortune off Seinfeld reruns, and ran the secretive experimental community Biosphere 2 outside Tucson, Ariz. Then there's the line on the resume drawing all the controversy: Bannon's time as executive chairman of Breitbart, turning the right-wing news site into the platform of the so-called alt-right, as he once told Mother Jones magazine. That online community coalesced around the conviction that the Republican Party and establishment conservatives have turned their backs on a vision of America deeply influenced by nationalist thought, some of which is overtly racist. Certain alt-right adherents have unleashed a wave of anti-Semitic, racist and misogynist vitriol online against supporters of Trump's rival Republicans, Clinton voters and journalists during this campaign. In recent days, critics from the left and the right have charged that Trump has invited a modern face of racism into the White House. Consider these tweets from John Weaver, the former chief campaign strategist for Ohio Gov. John Kasich during this year's Republican primaries, and Mark Salter, the longtime adviser and speechwriter for Republican Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential bid: An avowed racist in a powerful WH staff job. But let's give our new Pres a chance. He might be totally different than the prick he ran as https://t.co/rCrnV2ZVxJ Sen. Bernie Sanders, who challenged Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, urged Trump to reconsider Bannon in an interview with NPR for All Things Considered Monday. \"I hope that he understands that in the year 2016, we are not going back to a society rampant with racism and sexism and homophobia and xenophobia,\" Sanders told NPR's Robert Siegel. Bannon's appointment has been cheered by leaders of the Ku Klux Klan, the American Nazi Party and other white nationalist groups. Under Bannon, Breitbart spoke increasingly to that alt-right audience with headlines and stories seemingly designed to offend African-Americans, Latinos, Muslims, women, gays, transgender people and others. The site already had built a following among the more conservative wing of Republicans for its gleeful stunts and the outrageous rhetoric of its founder, the late Andrew Breitbart. Bannon pushed the boundaries further, according to Kurt Bardella, the site's top public relations consultant for three years until his resignation earlier this year. I asked Bardella what he made of the criticism that the site published racist stories. \"I thought [the criticisms] were all completely valid and all true,\" he responded. Bardella argued that Bannon sought to incite Breitbart's more bigoted readers to generate more clicks and shares, more controversy and more pressure on Republicans to take nationalist and anti-immigration stands. Calls for corrections of fact or apologies for their rhetoric led Bannon to urge his writers to hold firm on their outrages, Bardella says. \"You look to the top for direction, for boundaries,\" Bardella says. \"And when there aren't any, it empowers everybody beneath you to double down and do that to the nth degree. And that's what really happened.\" (Bardella is far from a liberal critic; he was previously the spokesman for the Republican-led House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that launched investigations of the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton.) One Breitbart headline declared: \"Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive And Crazy.\" Another called former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords, who suffered near-fatal wounds during an assassination attempt in which six others died, \"The Gun Control Movement's Human Shield.\" Some stories carried the designation \"Black Crime\" as though criminality were racial. Another headline proclaimed \"Hoist It High And Proud: The Confederate Flag Proclaims A Glorious Heritage\" less than two weeks after a racist white allegedly killed nine people at a historically black church in Charleston, S.C., in hopes of igniting a race war. South Carolina's Republican governor instead removed the Confederate battle flag from state Capitol grounds. Transgender people are referred to with the dated slur Trannies. William Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard, was called a \"Renegade Jew\" for opposing Trump's march to the Republican nomination. Former Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Joel Pollak says that Bannon built on Andrew Breitbart's already extant plans to unify a series of interlocking Breitbart blogs into a single news site. The presidency of Barack Obama served as a rallying cry for the right. But Republican nominee Mitt Romney's loss in 2012 became a pivot for the site. While Andrew Breitbart reveled in the Tea Party, he tended to urge coalescing around Republican nominees. Pollak says Bannon disdained the party's conclusions that it needed to reach out more to Latinos and ease its stance on illegal immigration. Fox News pundits had become too cozy with the establishment, Bannon concluded. He became Breitbart's executive chairman in 2012 after the death of Andrew Breitbart and he moved the site's headquarters from Southern California to Washington, D.C. Bannon's own rhetoric could be severe as well. \"What we need to do is bitch-slap the Republican Party, and get those guys heeding, too,\" Bannon told the conservative talk show Political Vindication Radio in 2010. \"And if we have to, we'll take it over.\" On the same program a year later, Bannon denigrated liberal feminists with an anti-lesbian slur and praised instead conservatives such as Michele Bachmann and Sarah Palin. It was a rebuke to the women's liberation movement, Bannon said, that \"the women that would lead this country would be feminists, they would be pro-family, they would have husbands, they would love their children. You know, they wouldn't be a bunch of dykes that came from the Seven Sisters schools up in New England.\" The new Breitbart under Bannon took flight from the primary defeat of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in 2014 by an economist who opposed easing the path to immigration, and the subsequent resignation of House Speaker John Boehner. According to Pollak, Bannon emphasized original reporting and expanded the site's staff. \"Breitbart News is a conservative website. And we are not racist, we're not anti-Semitic, we're not anti-gay, we're not anti-woman,\" Pollak tells NPR. \"We're not any of those things.\" Pollak is now the site's senior editor at large and general counsel. In an interview, Pollak sought to counter the accusations of offensive material piecemeal. The \"Black Crime\" designation was an error, placed on a relatively small number of articles, he said. Pollak noted the \"Renegade Jew\" headline was written by the incendiary Jewish conservative author David Horowitz, who this week blasted Bannon's critics as \"the losers of the left.\" And Pollak says the site should not be held responsible for the words or slurs or attacks of people citing, sharing or commenting on its articles \u2014 no more than NPR or the New York Times should be blamed for insulting words from their respective audiences. Breitbart columnist Milo Yiannopoulos, a gay right-wing provocateur who has called feminists \"a cancer\" and explicitly written against Muslim immigration, has lionized the alt-right while saying he is not a part of it. Yet that misses how energizing Yiannopoulos has proven to young and gay conservatives, Pollak says. \"Conservatives are used to having that kind of open debate and we are confronted all the time about our beliefs but we don't riot in the streets about it,\" Pollak says. \"You have to develop a sense of humor.\" Pollak says Bannon is inclusive, pointing to his own status as an observant Orthodox Jew. \"I have Saturdays off, Jewish holidays off and Steve Bannon always wishes me a 'Shabbat shalom' on Friday afternoon \u2014 just in case you were concerned about that,\" Pollak says. The accusation of anti-Semitism is a sensitive one. During a custody battle, Bannon's former wife accused him of making of a series of anti-Semitic remarks in arguing over their daughters' schooling. He has denied making those comments. Police records show that in 1996, before the divorce, Bannon's then-wife accused him of physically attacking her. Bannon pleaded not guilty and the case was dismissed. The moment had an echo earlier this year when then-Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski forcibly grabbed former Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields to prevent her from approaching Trump after a rally. Breitbart essentially backed Lewandowski's denials over its own reporter \u2014 despite eyewitness accounts and videotape showing those denials were untrue. Fields soon quit the site, as did Bardella, who called Trump a demagogue. \"Breitbart evolved to become the propaganda arm, a de facto superPAC of the Trump campaign,\" Bardella told NPR. \"And I think that was very evident if you looked at the home page every day.\" Breitbart has been a sharp critic of House Speaker Paul Ryan, a conservative who has been trying to drive the party's policy positions and who has close ties to Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman. Priebus is a consummate establishment figure who has in the past promoted a more inclusive notion of the Republican Party; he has been named Trump's White House chief of staff. Former Breitbart writer Ben Shapiro, who quit the site in March, has written he has no reason to believe that Bannon shares the beliefs of racists or anti-Semites. But, Shapiro writes, Bannon is \"happy to pander to those people and make common cause with them in order to transform conservatism into European far-right nationalist populism.\" Bannon is to be Priebus' equal in the Trump administration. Outsider no more, Breitbart News can now serve as a voice reflecting the Bannon wing of the new Trump coalition. If desired, Breitbart can serve as its enforcer too.",

He says Clinton's comments were probably \"unwise\" but \"honest.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ahmed Bedier, a Muslim community activist, stands outside the Fort Pierce mosque, damaged in arson attack this week. He says Clinton's comments were probably \"unwise\" but \"honest.\" Hillary Clinton's \"basket of deplorables\" remark has echoed through the political interwebs and produced many rounds of cable TV analysis. Sure, conservatives pounced. And some liberals laughed in agreement. But does it matter in the real world? Perhaps what's most interesting about this remark is that out in places like the diverse region of central Florida \u2014 and particularly among Clinton's natural base of young, black and brown voters \u2014 her \"basket of deplorables\" comment barely seemed to register. Some folks thought she could have been more sensible, others laughed; but more often than not, voters said they had never heard of Clinton's so-called political blunder. These black, brown, and young voters increasingly make up the Democratic base in this key swing region of a swing state, so their turnout this November is crucial for Clinton. And it seems they're relatively unfazed by a comment that was making heads spin in DC. First, a quick back story if you're unfamiliar with the incident. On Friday at a New York fundraiser, Clinton said this: \"You could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic \u2014 you name it.\" Phillip Arroyo, a local Puerto Rican activist and periodic Clinton volunteer, says in his opinion Trump is clearly \"deplorable.\" But his supporters are more \"ignorant\" than \"deplorable.\" \"There are a lot of voters who support Donald Trump who I personally believe are not bad people; they're just ignorant ... they don't know better,\" said Arroyo. \"Many of them were raised with that mentality, with that philosophy of division and racism.\" And while \"deplorable\" isn't necessarily the adjective Arroyo would have used, he thinks many minority voters in Central Florida agree with Clinton. He also points out that Clinton realized she may have crossed a political boundary and quickly apologized. (Note: Clinton admitted that she \"generalized\" and said she regrets using the word \"half,\" but she never apologized for using the description \"deplorable.\") \"The facts speak for themselves. We've seen the rallies, we've seen the people that have been there. There are people who tend to be racist ... Is the number half, not half, how much of it, you know \u2013 who knows what that amount is.\" Ahmed Bedier \"Donald Trump has still \u2014 to this very day \u2014 not apologized for calling Mexicans and Latinos rapists and criminals,\" said Arroyo, a staunch Democrat. Arroyo does a lot of Hispanic media interviews and says Clinton's comment isn't gaining traction in the local Latino community, in part because the word \"deplorable\" isn't everyday English. And among some in circles of well-informed minority activists, there's a sense that maybe Clinton was just being authentic. \"I think she was honest,\" said Ahmed Bedier, a 42-year-old Muslim community activist, as he weaved around yellow police tape and pointed out the damaged fa\u00e7ade of the Fort Pierce mosque. The mosque where the Orlando nightclub shooter periodically worshipped had been set on fire the day before a big Muslim holiday and Bedier was in town to help. Bedier points to incidents in which minorities have been physically accosted at Trump rallies as proof that a subset of Trump supporters are \"racist.\" \"The facts speak for themselves,\" he said. \"We've seen the rallies, we've seen the people that have been there. There are people who tend to be racist ... Is the number half, not half, how much of it, you know \u2014 who knows what that amount is.\" Bedier was a Bernie Sanders delegate at the Democratic convention and says he's now going to vote for Clinton in November because he wants to stop Trump from getting near the White House. He says Clinton's comment was probably \"unwise\" and a \"lapse of judgement\" because she opened herself to attack. But for him personally, it was no big deal. For many minorities like Bedier, Clinton's comments were merely a recognition of a pre-existing condition. It's a condition Bedier, a diehard Democrat, insists isn't limited to the Republican party but is more indicative of America itself in 2016. \"I'm sure even within Hillary Clinton's base of supporters, there may be some people that share some of these same views,\" said Bedier. \"They may also have some racism or xenophobia or Islamophobia, you know, I see it sometimes from Democrats as well.\" Central Florida is home to a diverse mix of Democratic voters and among some black and brown folks, Clinton's comments don't seem to cause the same consternation they do among pundits. \"You have definitely seen an increase in the hate towards [minorities] because of, I feel, Trump's influence,\" said 22-year-old health sciences student Kristina Singh. \"If I'm being completely honest, I feel like that's what he's kind of promoting.\" The big question after Clinton's fundraising quip was whether it would actually alienate anyone who's already dead-set against her or convince someone in her camp to stay home on Election Day. There were some theories that, perhaps, Clinton had purposefully chastised Trump supporters in the hopes that her tough talk would energize key constituencies in the Democratic base \u2014 particularly millennials, who might have been lukewarm on her candidacy. But in about a dozen interviews with college students at the University of Central Florida, hardly anyone even knew about the incident. Valerie Barrantes, a 21-year-old media management student, said she had never heard of the \"basket of deplorables comment.\" \"That just doesn't sound like her vocabulary or language,\" she said. \"She's not really aggressive like that. That sounds more like Trump.\" Mathew Coalson, a 37-year-old returning student studying mechanical engineering, said he had also \"never heard\" the remark. And he said it didn't change his opinion. If anything, it impressed him. \"It's kind of interesting to hear Hillary, the always on-point politician, saying something that doesn't sound like as much of a political statement to me. It almost sounds like her doing what Trump does, which is just shooting from the hip a little bit.\" Coalson says he doesn't know the context of Clinton's quote but his gut reaction was \"Eh, good for you, Hillary. Shoot from the hip.\" And so maybe the real lesson in the \"basket of deplorables\" saga is a reminder that what makes the rounds on cable news might not really matter to busy voters in swing states.",

            "article_content": "Questions surrounding the Clinton Foundation and possible conflicts of interest while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state have intensified, while Donald Trump continues a pitch to minority voters.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: And to talk more about where the campaign is headed, NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is here. Hi, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Robert. SIEGEL: What do you make of Trump's strategy in recent days to focus on outreach to minority voters? LIASSON: Well, he has been talking a lot about minorities, as you just heard. But in the past, when Republican candidates looked like they were reaching out to minorities or made a visit to an inner-city community, it was usually because they weren't actually targeting minority voters, but they were trying to make themselves more appealing to moderate suburban voters, particularly women who can be turned off by divisiveness and xenophobia. And if that's the case with this new move by Trump, then he is doing something very unusual for him in that he's acting like a typical Republican presidential candidate. And his new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, is an expert at helping conservative candidates reach out to women in ways that aren't off-putting. So it is possible that Trump has come to the conclusion he can't win with his base only - white, non-college voters - that he has to expand his coalition or at least try. Now, the Clinton campaign is very interested in making sure this doesn't work. And in a speech tomorrow, Hillary Clinton is going to be focusing on the link between Trump's appeals and the alt-right or white supremacist movement. SIEGEL: Clinton's support among minorities of course, especially among black voters, is very strong. Apart from his appeal to whites (laughter), does his appeal to minorities actually look at all possible? LIASSON: Well, that's a good question, but there are only 70 odd days left in the campaign. And one long-standing theory about presidential races is that by this time, the dynamics of a campaign are pretty well set. It's hard to change, barring some blowup in a debate or a big October surprise. Usually at this point the candidates' messages are set. People have formed impressions. And usually the campaigns at this point are focusing on the ground game, getting up the vote, really granular efforts to target and reach individual voters. So this flies in the face of all of that. SIEGEL: Now, one thing that could conceivably change the dynamics of the race are the continuing problems plaguing Hillary Clinton involving emails. And this week we've heard about the Clinton Foundation and how much access donors had to Clinton when she was secretary of state. How much of a problem do you think this is for Hillary Clinton? LIASSON: Well, I think this is a problem - a big problem. And of course up until now, many of her problems have been overshadowed by Trump's problems, but this week is a week when the spotlight really has been on her. And the issue - it seems very familiar when it comes to the Clintons - lots of smoke but no fire. In other words, there was a lot of overlap between the foundation and people Hillary Clinton interacted with at the State Department. Certainly, the foundation created a lot of potential conflicts of interest even if there wasn't a quid pro quo, which hasn't been proven yet - no actual favors done even though things look bad. And the question now is, is there someone she met with that any other secretary of state wouldn't have or a favor she did that was contrary to U.S. foreign policy? Appearances do matter, but we don't have any hard evidence of corruption. Now, that being said, she has made things worse by saying things that have proven not to be true about her emails, like she turned them all over - not true - or that FBI Director Comey said she was truthful in everything she said turned out not to be true or that Colin Powell blessed her private server arrangement. But all of this is why she is distrusted by so many voters. SIEGEL: Well, how much room is there for all of this to move the needle in the race? LIASSON: I think the Clinton campaign feels it's too late for this to cost her in a big way. They are pushing back against a lot of the stories about the foundations, but she's not holding a press conference. She's not going on a Sunday show for a long interview about this. They could have avoided the whole thing if they'd shut down the foundation before she ran for president or even when she was secretary of state. But remember. This is Bill Clinton's legacy project. And unlike other presidents who have similar foundations, he had a spouse who was not only Secretary of State but then a presidential candidate. And the obvious question that this raises is, what if Trump had been as disciplined as he's been this week on focusing on Hillary Clinton's problems all along instead of spending weeks accumulating self-inflicted wounds?

Several prominent Republicans announced this week that they plan to vote for Hillary Clinton and at least one high-profile Democrat has backed Donald Trump. Crossing over isn't new \u2014 there have been Obama Republicans, Reagan Democrats and a number of other defectors across the years. Here's a list of some notable Republicans and Democrats who have endorsed the other party's candidate this election and in the recent past. Richard Hanna The New York representative became the first Republican in Congress to cross party lines and formally back Hillary Clinton on Tuesday. In an op-ed Hanna wrote and published on syracuse.com, he said: \"While I disagree with her on many issues, I will vote for Mrs. Clinton. I will be hopeful and resolute in my belief that being a good American who loves his country is far more important than parties or winning and losing.\" Meg Whitman Meg Whitman, CEO of Hewlett-Packard, attends the annual Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho in July.

Whitman announced this week that she'll be voting for Hillary Clinton. The Hewlett-Packard CEO also endorsed Hillary Clinton this week in an interview with the New York Times. \"I will vote for Hillary, I will talk to my Republican friends about helping her, and I will donate to her campaign and try to raise money for her,\" Whitman said. In a statement expanding on what she told the Times, Whitman said, \"To vote Republican out of party loyalty alone would be to endorse a candidacy that I believe has exploited anger, grievance, xenophobia and racial division.\" Regarding Clinton, she said in the statement \"It is clear to me that Secretary Clinton's temperament, global experience and commitment to America's bedrock national values make her the far better choice in 2016 for President of the United States.\" Whitman said Clinton has reached out to her, a sign that the Democratic nominee may be targeting prominent Republicans who might not have decided where to put their loyalties this year.

Bush administration \u2014 he served as deputy secretary of state, and also as an assistant secretary of defense during the Reagan years. In a June interview with Politico, Armitage said, \"If Donald Trump is the nominee, I would vote for Hillary Clinton ... He doesn't appear to be a Republican, he doesn't appear to want to learn about issues. So, I'm going to vote for Mrs. Clinton.\" Brent Scowcroft Scowcroft was the national security adviser for Presidents Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush. He endorsed Hillary Clinton in a June statement. Scowcroft wrote that he believes \"Hillary Clinton has the wisdom and experience to lead our country at this critical time.\" He also said Clinton's experience as First Lady, a senator and secretary of state give her \"truly unique experience and perspective.\" Doug Elmets Former Reagan staffer Doug Elmets endorses Hillary Clinton on the final day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 28.\n                \n                    \n                    J.

He called the GOP platform the \"most alarming\" he'd ever seen: \"It's laced with anti-immigrant, anti-gay, anti-women positions that do not represent the views of most Americans. That is why this year, I will vote for a Democrat for the first time.\" Jim Cicconi Cicconi worked as deputy chief of staff to George H.W. Bush, as well as a special assistant to Reagan.

In 2008, Powell told Meet The Press that Obama was reaching out in a \"more diverse and inclusive way across our society.\" And in a 2012 CBS interview, Powell endorsed Obama again. He cited Mitt Romney's changing foreign policy positions as one reason he couldn't support him as the GOP nominee. He also praised how Obama handled the recession: \"I saw over the next several years, stabilization come back in the financial community, housing is now starting to pick up after four years, it's starting to pick up. Consumer confidence is rising.\" Charles Fried Fried served as solicitor general during the Reagan administration and is a professor at Harvard Law School. He voted for Obama, citing John McCain's 2008 running mate, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, as one of the main reasons why he could not support McCain's bid.

Lincoln Chafee Chafee, former governor and senator of Rhode Island, launched a short-lived presidential bid during this year's Democratic primaries. But earlier in his career, he was a Republican. In an October CNN Democratic debate, Chafee said he switched allegiances (with a stint as an Independent in between) because \"the party left me.\" In 2008, Chafee endorsed Obama while he was an independent. Chafee said he believed Obama was \"the best candidate to restore American credibility, to restore our confidence to be moral and just, and to bring people together.\" A.

Clinton waves in the background. Republican Donald Trump has built his presidential campaign around the idea that he is an enormously successful billionaire with a long track record of making money \u2014 and that given the chance he can use his business smarts to revive the American economy. Tech entrepreneur and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban wants people to know he's not so impressed. \"I can tell you as an entrepreneur and investor with absolute certainty that companies and jobs, they won't be created by terrifying people,\" Cuban said at a Clinton rally in Pittsburgh last week. \"No, Donald Trump, they'll be created by inspiring people like Hillary Clinton does.\" Trump may be one of the world's best-known members of the club of the super-rich, but some of his fellow billionaires have been turning on him. Cuban, for example, used some choice \u2014 even vulgar \u2014 language to describe his disdain for Trump. Former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg blasted him last week at the Democratic National Convention. Legendary investor Warren Buffett, at an event with Clinton, questioned if Trump had any \"decency.\" And the latest came from Hewlett-Packard executive Meg Whitman, a longtime Republican who made a fortune as the co-founder of eBay, who said she will be supporting Clinton. \"To vote Republican out of party loyalty would be to endorse a candidacy that I believe has exploited anger, grievance, xenophobia and racial division,\" Whitman said in a statement released Wednesday. \"Donald Trump's demagoguery has undermined the fabric of our national character.\" She went on: \"Trump's reckless and uninformed positions on critical issues --from immigration to our economy to foreign policy \u2014 have made it abundantly clear that he lacks both the depth and sound judgment required as president. Trump's unsteady hand would endanger our prosperity and national security. His authoritarian character could threaten much more.\" The Clinton campaign has seized on comments like that to undermine Trump's image as a business wizard and, perhaps, to get under his skin a little. The support of billionaires, however, could also have the affect of alienating more liberal voters, like those who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders in the primary. It's a group Clinton also needs on board in the fall election. Still, the campaign hopes having high-profile business supporters can peel off disaffected independents and some Republicans. \"Most of us who have our names on the door know that we're only as good as our word,\" said Bloomberg, a former Republican, at last week's DNC. \"But not Donald Trump. Trump has left behind a well-documented record of bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits, angry shareholders, and contractors who feel cheated, and disillusioned customers who feel ripped off. Trump says he wants to run the nation like he's run his business. God help us.\" Trump has his own billionaire supporters as well, such as Bakken oil developer Harold Hamm and investor Carl Icahn, but they lack the star power of Cuban, Bloomberg, Whitman and Buffett. On Monday, Clinton sat on an Omaha, Neb., stage behind Buffett, grinning widely as he attacked Trump for not releasing his tax returns. \"How many of you would be afraid to have your tax return made public?\" Buffett asked the cheering crowd. \"You're only afraid if you've got something to be afraid about.\" Buffett even offered a kind of deal, saying he'd release his tax returns if Trump did. For the Clinton campaign, appearances by figures such as Buffett and Cuban can subtly help erode Trump's reputation for wealth and success, Democratic consultant Hank Sheinkopf said. \"The kind of endorsements from Cuban and Warren Buffett and Mike Bloomberg and other like that are ways of saying, 'Donald Trump is not the businessman he says, 'cause if he was, real businessmen would be endorsing him,' \" Sheinkopf said. It's also a way of scaring off potential donors, at a time when Trump appeared to be starting to finally gain some ground in fundraising, though major contributors have been holding back. \"If the Koch brothers have already said in public that they're not necessarily going to do a lot for Trump, the Republican businessmen, Chamber of Commerce types, are going to look at the names Buffett, Cuban, Bloomberg and others and say, 'Wait a minute, what am I investing my money in?' \" Sheinkopf said. For Clinton, who has battled the perception that she is too close to Wall Street and has been criticized for her past support of trade agreements, the strategy is not without some risk, said former GOP Congressman Tom Davis of Virginia. As the candidacies of Trump and Sanders have made clear, this is a change election, when many voters are tired of the status quo. While Trump campaigns as a populist, Clinton increasingly seems like the candidate of the establishment, and appearing alongside the super-wealthy could hurt her. \"In an election where people think the country's going in the wrong direction,\" Davis said, \"marching out the wealthiest of the wealthy, I don't think that's how you do the message.\"",

The global economy is \"here\" and \"done,\" President Obama said Wednesday \u2014 the question now is under what terms it will be shaped. Obama spoke at a news conference that was dominated by questions about global trade, the effects of Brexit, and Donald Trump. It followed a summit meeting with the leaders of Canada and Mexico in Ottawa. \"Integration of national economies into a global economy, that's here, that's done,\" Obama said. Speaking on the second day of a stock market rally, which came after sharp drops following Great Britain's vote to leave the European Union, Obama said it was important not to draw analogies to what happened with Brexit with trade relations between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. Obama said ordinary people with concerns about global trade \"have a legitimate gripe with globalization.\" But he cautioned that withdrawing from trade deals such as NAFTA, as Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee has threatened, \"is the wrong medicine for dealing with inequality.\" Addressing protectionist sentiments, Obama acknowledged what he said was \"nostalgia\" for a time when everyone was working in manufacturing jobs and belonged to the middle class, even though they lacked college degrees. He said that era has been outmoded \"far more by automation than by trade,\" adding that the U.S. steel industry was producing just as much as it ever was, but now only needs one-tenth of the workers. On another issue that has been central to the Trump campaign, immigration, Obama said anti-immigration sentiments have been encouraged by demagogues \"back to the 1800's.\" \"You shouldn't think that is representative of how the American people think,\" Obama said, adding that illegal immigration from Mexico to the U.S. is at it's lowest level since the 1970s. Obama also took a thinly veiled swipe at Trump, saying someone doesn't suddenly become a populist be cause they say something controversial to win votes. \"That's not a measure of populism,\" he said. \"That's nativism or xenophobia, or it's just cynicism.\" Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto was asked to explain a comment he made in March, in which he compared Trump's \"strident tone\" to Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. Pena Nieto responded, \"Hitler, Mussolini, we all know the result. It was only a call for reflection and for recognition, so that we bear in mind what we have achieved and the great deal still to achieve.\" Obama also said the U.S. has offered \"all assistance available\" to Turkey, following the terrorist attack Tuesday at Istanbul's main airport. He said \"we're still learning all the facts, but we know this is part of our broader shared fight against terrorist networks.\"",

Obama describes the parallels differently, however. Trump described Britons \"taking their country back.\" Obama says the Brexit vote and Trump's campaign both are marked by \"xenophobia\" and a fear of \"funny-looking people.\" Obama spoke during a wide-ranging interview with NPR in which he critiqued Trump several times. In other parts of the conversation, he said Trump \"embodies global elites\" and is not a \"legitimate spokesperson for a populist surge from working-class people, on either side of the Atlantic.\" His additional remarks, as seen in this video, were even more scathing. \"I think that some of the concerns around immigration, some of the concerns around a loss of control or a loss of national identity, those are similar,\" Obama said. \"I think there is a xenophobia and anti-immigrant sentiment that is splashing up not just in Great Britain but throughout Europe, that has some parallels with what Mr. Trump has been trying to stir up here.\" Obama went on to express confidence that the U.S. election would not have the same results as in the U.K. and Europe. For one thing, he said, the American economy is stronger. \"Overall, I think that the differences are greater than the similarities. But what is absolutely true is that the ability to tap into a fear that people may have about losing control, and it offers some sort of vague, nostalgic feelings about how, you know, we'll make Britain great again or will make America great again. And the subtext for that is somehow that a bunch of foreigners, funny-looking people are coming in here and changing the basic character of the nation \u2014 I think that some of that is out there, both in Europe and the United States.\" NPR has several times invited Trump to respond to Obama's attack.

On this day of giving thanks, I've put together a list of animal-related things for which I'm grateful. Here they are in no particular order: 10. This half-minute duck-chases-dog video. It brings a smile every time I watch. Don't miss the moment when the chase reverses direction! 9. Elephant compassion caught on film. Just look at how these wild elephants in China, through their nearness and their touch, comfort their companions who are trapped in a human-made pond. A happy ending ensues, thanks to the local forestry police. 8. Human compassion for elephants. Kudos also to the Air Shepherds team for this rescue of a drowning elephant caught in a water trough in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. 7. The voters of Massachusetts. In the Nov. 8 election, they voted by a wide margin to ensure better lives for farmed chickens, pigs and calves. The new law, to take effect in 2022, not only ensures more spacious enclosures for farmed animals inside the state, it also means that anyone who adopts illegal confinement practices for these animals will not be able to sell eggs, pork or veal in Massachusetts. 6. Regional nature centers. At places like the Virginia Living Museum, where I sometimes walk the nature trails, and the Vermont Institute of Natural Science in Quechee, where a family friend works as a raptor biologist, scientists rescue animals and connect visitors in informed ways with the natural world. 5 Anthropologists who write books that urge us to think in new ways about animal-human relationships. The ethnographer Marianne Elisabeth Lien's book Becoming Salmon is a good example. Aquaculture, in this case the industrial raising of salmon in Norway, is an ever-increasing endeavor with an impact on wildlife, the ocean and human health. It's getting much less attention than is factory farming, so Lien is a pioneer in this regard. 4. The movie Arrival. Making first communicative contact with space aliens is a part of this film, sure; that aspect is well-advertised. But it's also a film beautifully steeped in the principles of my discipline, anthropology; wrestling head on with xenophobia is also a big part of the story. Those ink-jetting space heptapods Abbott and Costello are just fascinating in their own right, too. (I'm counting them as animals; humans are animals, too, after all.) 3. Increasing awareness that our closest living relatives, the monkeys and apes, may grieve when their mates, friends and relatives die. This is a topic I've been working on for about five years, and the new scientific information coming in this year shows protection of, and distress at, the body of a loved one, by survivors. This awareness helps situate us as part of a web of animals who may experience keen emotions like love and grief. 2. And the increasing awareness that it's not just primates. This year, also, a study revealed new information on mourning in seven species of whales and dolphins. The topic itself is a sad one but, just as with primates, the cetacean evidence attests to how much we share with other intelligent life right around us on this planet \u2014 never mind waiting for heptapod contact! 1. Flapjack octopuses. Octopuses are on my mind lately, so I'll conclude with a calming and rather fascinating short video of this flapjack octopus filmed by Nautilus researchers deep off the coast of California. That's my way of saying thanks to all the wildlife researchers, film-makers and photographers who bring alive \u2014 and also often fight for \u2014 the lives of animals all around the world.

On our post-election episode of the Code Switch podcast, Shereen Marisol Meraji and I interviewed Negin Farsad, a comedian and filmmaker, and Gustavo Arellano, the editor of the OC Weekly and the author of the satirical \u00a1Ask A Mexican! column. Our guests suggested that, in the wake of Donald Trump's election-night victory, racial animus in America \u2014 or at least, Americans' boundless capacity to countenance it \u2014 could be combated if people of color more actively engaged white people, assuaging their anxieties. Farsad and Arellano presented that idea humorously, but the ask was a serious one. Farsad pointed to her film, The Muslims are Coming!, in which she traveled across the country on a comedy tour with other Muslim-American comedians, as an example of outreach. \"The goal was to meet people where they were, and I feel like if they do that, they will come around,\" she said. In other words, people of color need to be \"ambassadors\" to the larger, skeptical, anxious white world. If respectability politics is predicated on the performance of public uprightness \u2014 or at least agreeability\u2014 being an ambassador is the strain that concerns itself with the hand-to-hand, interpersonal engagement. Say, explaining why black people can say nigger and white people should not. (It's a little trickier than that.) Or calmly explaining to a person on Twitter who asks if \"nappy\" is an offensive word. (Short answer: it depends, but she probably shouldn't say it.) My inbox has been full of questions like this from strangers since the election. If you'll allow me to indulge in a bit of understatement here: listeners had opinions about this idea. To crudely characterize the many responses we got, there was an obvious, vocal split between black folks and other people of color. Many black listeners suggested that having to make the argument for your humanity was itself an indignity. A letter from one black listener captures a sentiment we heard over and over: \"When Negin Farsad says that we need to get out to the other side and show a different image of ourselves, what does she mean? Black people for better or worse have been in American media since that media began. We have shown many many sides of ourselves through media, what else were we supposed to show? Just images palatable to people who are not convinced of our humanity? When Gustavo Arellano says it's our responsibility to move to swing states, what are we being asked to sacrifice for that, job and education opportunities, our happiness, our safety?\" Another was more pointed: \"[I] think it's misguided of [Farsad] to a) assume that's enough for people who benefit from white supremacy to see a POCs humanity and b) to even think that she should have to prove her humanity in the first place. It's going to hurt so much more when she realizes that no amount of shucking and jiving on behalf of white people will ever prove to them the fullness of her humanity. [...] But then again, Negin might be right. Maybe if enough brown people infiltrate mostly-white communities, white people will fight against the forces of xenophobia and racism to protect them when the time comes. Because even then, when they consider the fullness of Muslim and Asian and Mexican-American citizens' lives, we'll still have Black people around as a scapegoat. We are here for those groups who are allowed assimilation into whiteness to look down upon.\" My first response to our guests was not terribly dissimilar: Um, nah. \"Ambassadorship\" struck me as a strain of respectability politics, the idea that people in marginalized groups can sway people who have negative opinions of them by being beyond moral reproach, or at least, actively endeavoring to make the people with those opinions less uncomfortable. It's a polarizing notion, even as it has long been a critical, controversial component of rights movements for people of color and for queer people. But on Twitter, Shereen added some important nuance to this conversation: this might not be a crazy idea to the many, many first-generation immigrants of color have been thrust into this role of ambassadors in their lives for practical reasons. \"This idea ... is one that comes very natural to many [first-generation people of color] who are often interpreters/ambassadors,\" she wrote. \"I'm not saying it's right and I'm not saying it's not exhausting, but it is how we've learned to navigate life in the U.S.\" There are also some big questions about whether the ambassador approach might work. On Tuesday, Vox's German Lopez surveyed some of the research about how white people respond to difficult conversations about race, and concluded, as did Farsad and Arellano, that there are plenty of people whose prejudices can be undone with nonjudgmental engagement on their feelings. \"The key to these conversations, though, is empathy,\" Lopez wrote. \"And it will take a lot of empathy \u2014 not just for one conversation but many, many conversations in several settings over possibly many years.\" And therein lies the rub: even the folks who favor ambassadorship have to concede that it's labor-intensive and requires tremendous patience from the people doing it. While many of us have certainly served as ambassadors in informal, impromptu ways \u2014 maybe a friend gingerly asks you a question about some issue that affects a community you belong to, and you can discuss it candidly with them because you've established some trust and goodwill \u2014 that seems qualitatively different from serving that role for strangers in whom you might not be particularly invested. \"I think that no one should be asked to do this kind of work because it's exhausting and because [people of color] have enough problems,\" one person wrote on Twitter. \"On the other hand, if segregation is the central obstacle (and I think it is), then it also seems necessary for someone to do it.\" He went on: \"Another thing that occurs to me is that ambassadorship can't just be from people of color toward white people. Because different people or groups are often also blind to each other's experiences. I know I've often been guilty of this.\" Shereen, Gustavo and Negin probably have a point. And it's very likely that ambassadorship, as a strategy, might be more effective for some people of color. We're pulling on different histories and understandings, and pushing up against often similar but often very distinct skepticisms. Shereen says it's just what we do \u2014 in some ways, this is part of our actual jobs at Code Switch. But I'd really rather not. We'd love to hear your thoughts on this at @nprcodeswitch and at codeswitch@npr.org.",

During the campaign, Donald Trump characterized himself as a champion of working-class voters who felt left behind and disconnected from more prosperous parts of the country. And Trump's historic upset victory last week was fueled by working-class voters in the Rust Belt and elsewhere who believed in this promise. Many of the counties that flipped from voting for Barack Obama in 2012 to Donald Trump in 2016 were in the Rust Belt swing states of Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan. In his victory speech he reached out to those voters again, saying, \"The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.\" The Trump transition team is reaching out to economists to serve as policy advisers. NPR did a little fishing, and found one of them. We called up labor economist Richard Burkhauser of Cornell, who signed a petition against Hillary Clinton's economic plan during the campaign. He tells NPR that Trump's team just reached out to him and asked him \"if I was interested in applying for a job.\" So will he take a job with the new administration? \"It's a very exciting possibility,\" Burkhauser says. Burkhauser is a free market economist who tends to vote Republican. He says with Republicans controlling the White House, Congress and the Senate, after years of frustrating gridlock, he thinks the new administration could actually get important things done to boost economic growth. \"I think it would be extraordinarily exciting to be part of an administration that uses Republican ideas to do something for workers in the middle who have not enjoyed the benefits of economic growth for the last 20 or 30 years,\" he says. But could you do that just with Republican ideas? \"I don't think so,\" says David Autor, an economist at MIT who is known for his influential work on international trade with the U.S. and China \u2014 both its benefits and its devastating impact on some Americans. Autor says Trump won with a fiery, populist, kick-the-bums-out-of-Washington campaign that promised to help working- and middle-class voters. But Autor says, \"I think the Republican Party has done extremely little for them.\" Autor says he is not registered with any political party. But he says if Trump really wants to help people left behind, this task is not easy. He says President Obama was working on it, too, and made some progress. And Autor says Trump needs to reach out beyond traditional Republican economists, because they mostly focus on cutting taxes and regulation. \"Yes, the irony is that if the Trump administration were looking for expertise in policy to improve the living conditions and working conditions of less affluent Americans, they would look to a lot of Democratic and left-of-center scholars who have devoted their political and academic careers to trying to improve exactly on those fronts,\" Autor says. He says it might be a moonshot, but if Trump can draw from the best ideas on the left and the right, then we might see a really effective mix of policies: tax credits for the working class that conservatives support; and help with education and health care costs, which are traditionally liberal ideas. In his victory speech, Trump appeared to be casting a wide net for advisers. \"For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people,\" Trump said to some chuckles, \"I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country.\" And he added, \"We will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all.\" Still, nobody from the Trump campaign has called Autor. And even if they did, he says he is among many economists who would have a hard time forgetting Trump's campaign, which he saw as marked by race-baiting, misogyny and xenophobia. \"I think many of us who would be happy to support a sensible policy mission would still be extremely hesitant to be a part of that team knowing the moral depths it doesn't hesitate to sink to,\" Autor says. Meanwhile, as Trump builds his team, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren will be watching. She fired a letter at Trump this week criticizing his transition team picks so far as too tied to Wall Street and big business. Warren wrote that those picks and the people rumored to be in the running for Cabinet positions are \"a slew of Wall Street bankers, industry insiders, and special interest lobbyists.\" She says these ties to Wall Street and big business show Trump putting the interests of the rich and powerful above those of the working-class families. Trump, she says, \"already appear[s] to be failing\" on his promise to help working families rather than the rich and powerful. And if he doesn't change course, she warns: \"Let me be clear. Should you refuse, I will oppose you, every step of the way, for the next four years. I will champion the millions of Americans you will fail to protect. I will track your every move, and I will remind Americans, every day, of the actions you take that fail them. And I will not be the only one watching. The millions of Americans who voted for you \u2014 and the millions who didn't \u2014 will all be watching you.\" At the same time, Warren offered to help Trump find qualified advisers.",

In Bernie Sanders' new book, Our Revolution, the Vermont senator tells the story of his life, his career and his run for the Democratic presidential nomination. He also spells out the programs he believes the country should adopt to combat such ills as inequality, discrimination and lack of opportunity, not to mention the burdens of college and health care costs. Sanders says he was not shocked by Donald Trump's victory. But he says the election results show it is time for the Democratic Party to undergo a fundamental reassessment. \"I think it's time for a fundamental reassessment,\" Sanders tells NPR's Robert Siegel, \"and I think what that reassessment has got to entail is to understand that we cannot have a party that will win, if we continue to become dependent on big money interests and campaign fundraisers all over this country.\" On his message to the people who are refusing to accept a Trump presidency It's not a question of whether you refuse to accept it or you accept it. It's a reality. But what I say to those young people is we have got to stand together by the many millions and not allow this country to descend back into racism and sexism and xenophobia, to make sure that Trump is not successful in pushing an agenda which divides us up by race or the country that we were born into. A Future to Believe in by Bernie Sanders Hardcover, 450 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? On the other hand, Trump ran his campaign talking about he was going to be a champion of the working class. He was going to stand up to the establishment. Well, let me tell you, we are gonna hold him accountable to that. On Trump's appointment of Breitbart executive Stephen Bannon to a senior White House role It is a very, very bad appointment. I hope he rethinks it, and I hope that he understands that in the year 2016, we are not going back to a society rampant with racism and sexism and homophobia and xenophobia. On how to proceed with advocacy of free higher education Well, what we do now is rally millions of young Americans who are sick and tired of leaving school $30-, $50-, $100,000 in debt, and those who simply cannot afford to go to college, and say that in a competitive global economy, it is absolutely imperative that we make public colleges and universities' tuition free. And no matter how you fund it, it should be funded by progressive taxation, making clear that billionaires like Mr. Trump and his friends start paying their fair share of taxes, that large corporations start paying their fair share of taxes. ... How you deal with that issue is how you deal with all issues. We are gonna have to raise public consciousness, we're gonna have to, and what the political revolution is about \u2014 we've had some really good successes. Yeah, maybe a march on Washington. It may be bombarding your congressman and your senator with emails, with phone calls to say, \"You know what, in America people have the right to get a higher education regardless of their income. And by the way, maybe there's something wrong when we are the only country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all people as a right. \"Oh yeah, and while we're on the subject, how come we're the only major country not to provide paid family and medical leave? Oh yeah, and maybe we should deal with climate change because the scientific community tells us if we're not gonna deal with that, then the future of this planet is a very sorry future indeed.\" On how to understand Hillary Clinton's defeat I'll tell you how I understand it. I understand it because there are a lot of people in this country, including people in the Democratic Party, who do not fully appreciate the kind of suffering and pain that millions of working people in this country are feeling. You've got working mothers out there who cannot afford to pay $10-, $15,000 a year for child care. You got working couples who desperately want to be able to send their kids to college; they can't do that. You got half of the older workers in this country \u2014 do you know how much money they have set aside for retirement? Nothing. They've got nothing. They're scared to death. And then you got a guy named Mr. Trump, who goes around saying, \"I'm gonna champion you! I'm a friend of the working class! I'm gonna take on the establishment!\" And the Democrats have not been as clear as they should be, which is why I think we need fundamental reform of the Democratic Party. And saying, \"Yeah, no, sorry, we are the champion of working families and low-income people and the elderly and the sick and the poor. We are gonna take on the billionaire class. We want you to participate.\" That's what we need. And I think a lot of people who voted for Barack Obama in 2008, voted for Barack Obama in 2012, and who like Barack Obama, said, \"You know what, I'm going to go for Trump because he has been clear about feeling the pain of working families.\"",

From his studio in the battleground state of Wisconsin, talk-radio host Charlie Sykes \u2014 like other influential conservative talk-radio hosts across the country \u2014 has held the mantle of modern conservatism for more than two decades. Every day, he goes on the air for three straight hours, vetting rising stars and inviting Republican leaders and listeners to hash out the issues of the day. \"I think it's fair to say that there's been no conservative leader in Wisconsin who hasn't been a regular guest on my show,\" Sykes said. \"If you wanted to be introduced, you needed to go through conservative talk radio.\" Sykes, 62, views himself as one of the gatekeepers for the conservative movement \u2014 but, in recent months, he has found himself increasingly on the margins. That's because he has refused to get behind Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Sykes has emerged as one of the leading voices against Donald Trump's bid for president. He is bothered by the nominee's record of donations to various Democrats over the years, as well as his past positions on issues like abortion or universal healthcare, which he says don't square with traditional conservative values. Most of all, he's afraid that the Republican nominee's rhetoric will hinder the party's efforts to reach new demographics. \"We have spent years ... trying to refute the stereotypes of what conservatives were about,\" Sykes said. \"Trump then comes along, and he represents every stereotype the left has ever had of conservatives, whether it's his misogyny, whether it's his xenophobia. \"It's going to be very, very difficult after this is over to come back and to say to women, to minorities, to young people, 'That wasn't us. No, that whole thing that just happened? That's not us. We are something else. We, in fact, are open and we are inclusive.' \" Sykes finds himself wondering how the conservative movement he belonged to could have chosen Trump as its leader. In part, he blames himself for not recognizing signs from his own audience, which he says has grown \"more intolerant of views outside of their particular world view\" over the last decade. It's a reality that has, on occasion, played out live on air: Sykes said he's noticed listeners becoming increasingly dogmatic in their rejection of mainstream sources of information and simple facts. They've increasingly cited sources like InfoWars, a show launched by radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Listeners have quickly dismissed any attempt to correct misinformation, especially if his source for those challenges are sources like The New York Times or The Washington Post. \"Rather than ... saying 'Well, thank you for correcting that,' many people actually pushed back, and said, 'Well, no, the source you're citing comes from the mainstream media,\" Sykes said. \"We've been conditioned over the years not to take anything the mainstream is saying seriously, at all.'\" This leaves Sykes wondering whether he and others in conservative media helped created an environment in which a Trump nomination was possible. \"Maybe we have been undone by our success a little bit,\" Sykes says. \"At some point, we went from being the counterweight to creating our own alternative reality.\" Looking back, Sykes regrets the way he spoke about certain issues on his program, including immigration and Islam. He says that, after this election, he wants to do a thorough self-examination. \"I want to spend some time going back to see: were there things I said, thinking they meant one thing, that were heard in a different way?\" Sykes said. \"I may have made points that I don't think were racialized, but which may have been internalized by people in a very, very different way.\" One example, he says, is to a music video he ran on his show back in 2011. It depicted a young African-American woman using her food stamp card, or EBT card, at various fast food and liquor stores in Los Angeles. \"While I thought of that as a light parody, I don't think that it was necessarily received that way,\" Sykes said. \"Knowing what I know now about the divisions in society, I don't think I would do that again. I think it certainly could have been perceived as a racial stereotype of a welfare mother.\" In 1992, when Sykes began his show, Rush Limbaugh was paving the way for a surge of conservative radio programs with a collective mission to provide an alternative to the mainstream media. Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham reached a national audience while Sykes did his piece as the most influential conservative on radio in Wisconsin. \"We have a lot of people who, I think, turn to us as trusted voices,\" he said. But, Sykes said, too many of these media personalities seem to have decided that their ratings are more important than their conservative values. \"I think among the things that have been the most the disheartening is to watch other people who do what I do decide that they are merely entertainers,\" he said, \"or willing to surrender some of the principles, willing to go from being gatekeepers to being cheerleaders to being outright flacks.\" Some listeners would agree with Sykes, like this recent caller to The Rush Limbaugh Show: Sykes looks at these moments as a sign of what's to come. \"I think there's going to be a reckoning in conservative talk radio,\" he said. \"The illusion that conservative media was about ideas has been shattered. The idea that there was a unified message in conservative media, I think, has been broken. I think that the trust that a lot of people put in conservative media over the years is going to be very, very hard to restore.\" Regardless of the outcome of this election, Sykes says it will be important for conservative media to do as he plans to next year: reflect on whether there's still a line that divides information from entertainment.",

DAVID GREENE, HOST: And let's turn now to Germany. Chancellor Angela Merkel's political party suffered an historic defeat in elections in Berlin yesterday. This is the second time this month where voters have lashed out against her. And in an unusually emotional exchange with reporters this morning, she called this outcome bitter. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL: (Speaking German). GREENE: Let's turn now to NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson, who's in the German capital, Berlin. She's been covering these elections. Soraya, good morning. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: So why is this such a bitter moment for Chancellor Merkel? NELSON: Well, these elections - they're only state elections, so technically it doesn't affect her federal government. But this is sort of her home turf. I mean, this is the capital of Germany. And the previous loss was in her political home base, up in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, as they call it in German. And so she really feels like it's a slap in the face to what she's doing. And certainly the people or the party that has really done well in these elections that have been going on, Alternative for Germany, have made a point of saying that, Germans, you are no longer safe; you are no longer secure because the chancellor isn't providing that for you. So this was something that she was really reacting to because, again, this was an historic loss today. And they no longer will be ruling here in the city of Berlin - her party, the Christian Democrats. GREENE: OK, so Alternative for Germany, a party that you say has emerged here and done pretty well, they're telling voters that they're not safe with Angela Merkel. Have they been speaking about their good performance here? NELSON: They held a press conference this morning and talked about their agenda. They said they were going to be a vocal opposition. They were going to be sensible, wanted to work with everyone - but then launched into the things that have really worked for them - you know, stirring up the xenophobia, talking about no-go zones in Berlin, which - I have yet to come across any. But these are areas - the areas they mentioned are very immigrant-rife. And they're saying it's no longer safe to, you know, take the public transit at night, that they were going to be in every agency and in every place to try and make this a better place. GREENE: They're literally telling people, don't go to neighborhoods where there are immigrants. NELSON: Well, they're calling them - no-go zones was the way they referred to them. So they're saying people just don't - the voters are telling them that they don't feel safe. They say they represent the little man, that a lot of the people who voted for them were, in fact, workers and people on pensions, that sort of thing. And so - and they prided themselves on the fact that they were able to raise the voter turnout - that - they claim 11 percent increase in voter turnout was because of them. GREENE: So how big is the rise of this party? I mean, if there are federal elections coming, could we see some of the members of this party in Parliament? Could Angela Merkel and her job as chancellor be really at stake here? NELSON: Well, I think that Chancellor Merkel will be around for a while. And I think this speech, which was long in coming, long overdue, will go a long way to hopefully appeasing some people, at least in her party. Or that's what she's hoping for anyway, I should say. But there's no doubt that this party is gaining a lot of strength. I mean, the fact that they would get almost or more than 14 percent of the vote here in Berlin, in the capital, which is a pretty liberal or left-leaning city, is pretty amazing. And they're already talking about being in the Parliament, about being a vocal opposition there and holding the parties' that were the established parties feet to the fire. GREENE: We just have a few seconds left, Soraya. But is there a broader lesson about what's happening in Europe, to see a party like this gaining power and, you know, a real backlash against a leader who has had, you know, a refugee policy and has been so central in European politics? NELSON: Well, she admitted she waited too long to try and work out the details of this refugee policy and that she's come to even hate - or hate to say the phrase, we can do it or, we can manage, which of course has been thrown back at her face by her opponents. So I think she really wants to step up efforts to make the refugee policy more comprehensive and more transparent to voters here. GREENE: OK, we've been speaking to NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson in Berlin this morning. Soraya, thanks a lot. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

On Thursday night, the votes poured in: After months of debate, the United Kingdom officially voted to leave the European Union in a referendum nicknamed \"Brexit.\" Shortly after the results were made public, Prime Minister David Cameron announced that he would leave office in October. Global stocks tanked, and the British pound crashed to a 31-year low. World leaders from the U.S. to Japan to Germany spoke out about the far-reaching effects the referendum would have. The scale of this reaction was predictable \u2014 after all, the U.K. joined the EU's predecessor, the EEC (European Economic Community), back in 1973 and has been one of its most influential members for decades. As the (now formerly!) fifth-largest economy in the world, even moderate changes in Britain's political stance affect global markets. So why did the U.K. vote for something so politically and economically disruptive? Some say race has a lot to do with it \u2014 specifically, the racial tension that has resulted from the U.K.'s recently welcoming in record numbers of immigrants. In 2015, 630,000 foreign national migrants came to the U.K. from both inside and outside the EU. This year, the U.K. has ushered in an additional 333,000. The campaign to get the U.K. to leave the EU (also known as the \"Leave\" campaign) was spearheaded by the right-wing, populist UK Independence Party, or UKIP. The party, led by Member in the European Parliament Nigel Farage, says that the EU \"means the end of the UK as an independent, self-governing nation with its own government and its own borders.\" For months, UKIP has fought for the United Kingdom's independence from the EU \u2014 some say by capitalizing on racially charged animus toward immigrants. In the Washington Post, writer Anyusha Rose points to the Leave campaign as evidence that in the U.K., \"racism is no longer racism \u2014 it's legitimate opinion.\" Areeq Chowdhury, a British writer and the founder of WebRoots Democracy, said last week that it's \"important we remember that this is a referendum that has only been made possible due to a long, hard-fought campaign by those on the far-right and political movements ridden with allegations of bigotry, xenophobia, and racism.\" He continues: \"Nigel Farage \u2014 the UKIP leader who once said that his party 'would never win the nigger vote,' refers to Chinese takeaways as 'a chinky,' and said people would feel 'concerned' to live next to Romanians \u2014 is the man who should take a significant chunk of the credit for us having this referendum. It was his party's success in the European Parliament elections, as well as defections which he brokered from the Conservative Party, which has led us to this point today.\" Zack Beauchamp over at Vox writes that the UKIP has spent the past 10 years \"focusing, obsessively, on the threat from immigrants, from both inside the EU and out.\" That work seems to have been fruitful. Beauchamp says, \"Over the course of the past 20 years, the percentage of Britons ranking 'immigration/race relations' as among the country's most important issues has gone from near zero percent to about 45 percent. Seventy-seven percent of Brits today believe that immigration levels should be reduced.\" Many politicians say anti-immigration sentiment shouldn't necessarily be cast as racism \u2014 they argue that immigrants take jobs from native-born British citizens, that immigration drives down wages for everyone, and that the desire to keep jobs abundant and wages high is a goal that millions share, across racial and political lines. And Timothy B. Lee, at Vox, argues that there are compelling reasons that British voters might have decided to leave the EU besides immigration \u2014 including the weakness of the euro and the EU's entrenched corporate interests. Still, concern about the rate of immigration is central to Lee's list. But James Bloodworth, writing for International Business Times, says the issue can't be explained in purely economic terms. Even as the number of migrants arriving in the U.K. rose to a record 333,000 in May of this year, immigrants have been an overall boon to the British economy. Bloodworth explains: \"Hostility to immigration \u2014 and by extension hostility to Europe \u2014 is driven by cultural concerns as much as by economic worries. That's certainly what the University of Oxford's Migration Observatory has been saying in recent years. It has pointed out on a number of occasions that cultural concerns better explain negative attitudes towards migration than a person's economic position. In essence it is about whether England feels like England.\" J.K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series, cautions against casting everyone who backed the Leave movement as a bigot but also writes about the danger of painting immigrants as monsters and villains: \"Leave has been busy threatening us with another monster: a tsunami of faceless foreigners heading for our shores, among them rapists and terrorists. \"It is dishonourable to suggest, as many have, that Leavers are all racists and bigots: they aren't and it is shameful to suggest that they are. Nevertheless, it is equally nonsensical to pretend that racists and bigots aren't flocking to the 'Leave' cause, or that they aren't, in some instances, directing it. For some of us, that fact alone is enough to give us pause. The picture of Nigel Farage standing in front of a poster showing a winding line of Syrian refugees captioned 'Breaking Point' is, as countless people have already pointed out, an almost exact duplicate of propaganda used by the Nazis.\" Some British politicians are trying to soften the blow. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, wrote a message on his Facebook page telling EU residents living in London that they are welcome and that the city is grateful for them. Lauren Hansen, a writer at The Week, wrote, \"Mayor Khan's comments are especially poignant in this post-Brexit world as the continent's largest city grapples with the tension between an anti-immigration sentiment and the diversity that makes London, and cities like it, thrive both economically and culturally.\" Of course, it would be remiss not to mention the parallels that many are drawing between the Brexit movement and Donald Trump's campaign rhetoric. Trump has publicly supported Britain's vote to leave the EU, and folks told NPR's Frank Langfitt that \"similar issues \u2014 globalization and economics \u2014 are driving the Brexit and U.S. presidential campaigns.\" In an article called \"What Do The Brexit Movement And Donald Trump Have In Common?\" the New Yorker's John Cassidy wrote: \"Certainly, a parallel factor in both men's rise is racism, or, more specifically, nativism. Trump has presented a nightmarish vision of America overrun by Mexican felons and Muslim terrorists. UKIP printed up campaign posters that showed thousands of dark-colored refugees lining up to enter Slovenia, which is part of the E.U., next to the words 'breaking point: The EU has failed us all.' \" In the months to come, the U.S. will have the advantage of seeing how this vote plays out in the U.K. before voting in its own presidential elections in November.",

In the wake of a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando that left at least 49 people dead and more than 50 wounded, queer Latino folks around the country are reflecting on the horror of the attack. Many are speaking up about what clubs like Pulse, the site of the shooting, mean for queer and Latino communities. Others warn against the temptation to blame Islam for the violence, pointing out that there are many Latino Muslims. (The Pew Research Center estimates that Latinos make up four percent of the 3.3 million Muslims in America.) We rounded up some of the sharpest, most poignant reactions to Sunday's mass shooting \u2014 the deadliest in American history. Over at Colorlines, writer Miriam Zoila P\u00e9rez says places like Pulse, where queer people of color can gather and feel comfortable, are exceedingly rare. In her essay, titled \"When the One Place That Feels Like Home is Invaded,\" P\u00e9rez writes about what happens when tragedy crashes into a \"rare moment of queer joy and Latino belonging\": When bars, clubs, restaurants, swimming pools, parks, theaters, buses and subways, streets and sidewalks aren't for you, you hold on for dear life to the spaces that are. Only a few times a year do we claim enough space to unapologetically play our people's music, dance to the rhythms of our childhoods, and be in a space where all of our identities are seen ... Being queer and Latinx in the U.S. sometimes feels like it can be impossible to find our people. And now tragedy has found us. At Philadelphia Magazine, writer Sabrina Vourvoulias says the shooting should be viewed against the backdrop of anti-queer and racist sentiments that have been a hallmark of this presidential election, calling the gun debate only a \"partial answer\" to the issues the shooting has raised: This was a slaughter of LGBTQIA folks, many of them Latinos and people of color, during Pride month. We cannot, and should not, hide from these facts. It seems no coincidence that this massacre takes place as the nation engages in an increasingly vitriolic argument about gender-neutral bathrooms which portrays trans people as predators; or during an electoral season in which one of the presidential candidates has shamelessly characterized Latinos as rapists and criminals. In fact, expressions of hate toward these two (overlapping) groups have become so normalized they're commonplace in tweets, Facebook posts and elementary school bully refrains. Vourvoulias also quotes Louie A. Ortiz-Fonseca, founder of a storytelling project on Latino and Afro-Latino gay, queer and trans men known as The Gran Varones, on the role of dancing in the lives of both Latinos and queer folks: We find community and sanctuary on the dance floor. As Latino gay men, we teach ourselves to break tradition so that we can take the hand of another man and dance. We do this to keep traditional. This alone continues to provide us space, even if the spaces are borrowed, for us to be and feel safe. This massacre was another reminder that we can be robbed of these spaces, robbed of our humanity and our lives. Over at Fusion, Alan Pelaez Lopez, who identifies as an Afro-Latino gender-non-conforming immigrant, writes, \"We are not all Orlando,\" referring to the ways in that different layers of identity can complicate one's reaction to Sunday's shooting: As a Black body in Mexico, my worth and value as a human being has always been questioned. I cannot detach my Blackness, my femininity, my queerness, or my mental health from an analysis on what happened in Orlando. Sunday's shooting cannot be blamed solely on Omar Mateen. In fact \u2014 and this is the critical, and risky part \u2014 we have to hold each other accountable in the ways in which we may participate in the oppression of people of color, the oppression of the LGBTQIA+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, Asexual +) community, the oppression of religious communities, and more. We have to push the media and understand that blaming the Muslim community is perpetuating the fact that xenophobia teaches us to only celebrate and empathize with white immigrants. In fact, we need to remember that Latinidad is a diverse culture and that many Latinxs are also Muslim \u2014 we cannot talk about them as separate identities.",

            "article_content": "by Lavie Tidhar Hardcover, 288 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? Books that imagine a different version of the World War II era are as old as Philip K. Dick's The Man in the High Castle and as new as Philip Roth's 2005 novel The Plot Against America. But few of these alternate histories are as bold and unnerving as Lavie Tidhar's A Man Lies Dreaming. First published in the UK in 2014, the novel is now out in the U.S., and it couldn't appear at a more unnerving time: As if mirroring our current election cycle, it depicts a right-wing politician successfully stoking the fires of xenophobia and bigotry. But in the case of Dreaming, the setting is London in 1939 \u2014 in a world where the Nazis never rose to power in Germany, and the British Fascist leader Oswald Mosley is leading the race to become the new Prime Minister. Oswald, however, is not the main character in Dreaming. Tidhar's choice is far more audacious: The book centers around Wolf, a down-and-out private eye in London who escaped Germany in 1933 when the communists \u2014 not the National Socialists \u2014 took over. It becomes clear very early on that Wolf is, in fact, Adolf Hitler. Tidhar has handled reviled, real-life figures in his fiction before, most notably in 2011's Osama, and at first Dreaming feels like a reprise. Tidhar has other plans, though. The plot of Dreaming unfolds like a hardboiled detective yarn, with Wolf being hired by a mysterious \u2014 and Jewish \u2014 femme fatale to find her missing sister. At the same time, he takes on a second case for Oswald, whom he both admires and resents for capitalizing on the same anti-Semitic, nationalistic ideas that Wolf himself once spread. Wolf, at heart, is still the Hitler of our world, with the same virulent beliefs and lust for power: \"Give me a large enough lever and I would move the very world,\" he snarls in frustration, a would-be despot who was never given the chance to twist the world into his own image. If that kind of alt-history speculation comprised the entirety of Dreaming, it'd be an intriguing read. But it's only the tip of Tidhar's iceberg. In a story that intersects Wolf's, a Jew named Shomer \u2014 hailing from our version of reality \u2014 is a prisoner at Auschwitz. He's also a writer of pulp detective stories. The interplay between the two storylines grows profound as they progress. Wolf's investigations take bizarre, grotesque, blackly comedic turns while Shomer's horrific existence grows symbolic \u2014 and then something magically more than symbolic \u2014 when the SS assigns him the task of making doors. 'Dreaming' is a book of big ideas, from the pathological origins of racist ideology to the way humanizing and dehumanizing those we love or loathe are flip sides of the same coin. Like any good alt-history, Dreaming is exhaustively researched. A multitude of historical figures pop up in its pages, including many literary ones \u2014 among them A. A. Milne, J. R. R. Tolkien, Ian Fleming, and Evelyn Waugh. Some feel gratuitous and even distracting; others, like G. K. Chesterton and his notions of law and anarchy from The Man Who Was Thursday, feed into the thematic fabric that Tidhar weaves. Dreaming is a book of big ideas, from the pathological origins of racist ideology to the way humanizing and dehumanizing those we love or loathe are flip sides of the same coin. Functionally, Hitler is the hero of Dreaming. Tidhar evokes a flesh-crawling sympathy for the most hated man in modern history while degrading him physically, emotionally, and sexually. He also paints a bloodcurdling picture of Auschwitz, where \"men die like smoke\" and \"women die like air.\" Holocaust survivor Yehiel De-Nur \u2014 author of the infamously lurid House of Dolls \u2014 appears briefly as a character in the book, observing that \"this is an alien planet [...]. This is Planet Auschwitz.\" A few pages earlier, Wolf is absurdly, hilariously envisioning how he might have brutally subjugated Oz if he'd been its dictator, all while grudgingly admitting to himself how much he loves \"Over the Rainbow.\" Tidhar tightropes between fantasy, farce, and historical fiction, all while grounding things in brisk, gritty noir. Parallels to our current state of affairs abound, but if anything, they're simply symptoms of how the past can recycle itself in frightening new ways \u2014 a process that Dreaming compellingly picks apart and rewires. History isn't written by the winners or the losers, Tidhar illustrates, but by those who know how to shroud it and spin it the most entertainingly. Which only makes Dreaming all the more chilling.

            "article_content": "Migrants are again heading to Italy on a dangerous sea-crossing from Libya. The surge comes as Austria prepares to shut its border leaving Italy in crisis over what to do with the new arrivals.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: President Obama is in Germany discussing European problems, but it's hard to miss his references to politics here. LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: Here's the president at a press conference yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: In this globalized world, it is very difficult for us to simply build walls. INSKEEP: And here's the president again in a talk today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OBAMA: An us versus them mentality that tries to blame our problems on the other, somebody who doesn't look like us or doesn't pray like us, whether it's immigrants or Muslims... INSKEEP: Europeans, like Americans, are debating the global movements of people and the threats some may pose. GARCIA-NAVARRO: We're about to visit the latest European flashpoint. Some migrants cross the Mediterranean to Italy then try to keep moving north. But Italy's neighbor Austria plans to introduce controls on their common border. INSKEEP: NPR's Sylvia Poggioli is near that border, the Brenner Pass, which sounds scenic, Sylvia. What's it look like? SYLVIA POGGIOLI, BYLINE: Oh, it's very beautiful. We're in the middle of the Dolomite mountains, snowcapped mountains, 4,500 feet, lots of beautiful slopes with pine trees all along them. It's very nice here. INSKEEP: Well, how are people reacting to the idea of border controls in that pass? POGGIOLI: Well, most of the people I talked to are very much opposed. When I got here, I couldn't even find the border. This is an area that's dotted by large, designer outlets. Many Austrians and Germans come to shop here. It was outside an outlet I met Rosalia Sbacchi who showed me exactly where the invisible borderline is. She moved here from Sicily two years ago to work at an outlet. She's dismayed by news of a new barrier. ROSALIA SBACCHI: (Through interpreter) It's a disaster, a tragedy. We depend on tourists who come weekends to shop here. This barrier will create lots of problems. POGGIOLI: But at the Olympia Cafe on the Italian side of the border, employee Christina Borella (ph) thinks the new Austrian barrier is a good idea. CHRISTINA BORELLA: (Foreign language spoken). POGGIOLI: I think we should build one too, she says. The woman next to her asks, where? In the Mediterranean Sea? Why not? Christina replies. We should be much stricter. We can't live here with all these people piling up on top of us. But behind the counter, at the espresso machine, Hushon Shams (ph) shakes his head. He himself is a migrant. He left his native Iran in 1972. HUSHON SHAMS: (Through interpreter) I am totally against it, and not just for economic reasons. A few years ago, they eliminated borders. Now they want to impose them again. It's not fair. They cannot call it the European Union anymore. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: No border. No nation. Stop deportation. POGGIOLI: On Sunday, several hundred demonstrators from many parts of Italy braved subfreezing temperatures and snow flurries to protest the barrier. One of the march organizers, Borellino Preioni (ph), said they came in defense of freedom of movement and for a Europe open to people. BORELLINO PREIONI: The injuries to transform Italy as Greece in a big and almost refugees camp where migrants - they wait for expulsion. Why do we think that another kind of policy or migration is needed in Europe? We diffuse the death in the Mediterranean Sea. POGGIOLI: Marchers wore orange life jackets, a sign of solidarity, with the thousands of nameless migrants who drowned trying to reach Europe. Italian police lined the roadway on the Italian side, while a phalanx of Austrian police, in full anti-riot gear, formed a blockade across the secondary road leading into Austria. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Speaking in foreign language). POGGIOLI: When the demonstrators came up close, the Austrian officers used batons and pepper spray to push them back. No one was injured, but one demonstrator was arrested, prompting the others to stage a sit-in until he was released. One of the marchers came from Poland. Evelina Kevmeskia (ph) is working with migrants in the city of Bolzano on an art project. She's outraged by the wave of xenophobia and fear of migrants sweeping many parts of Europe and the loss of memory. EVELINA KEVMESKIA: Polish people and Eastern Europeans were in this situation, like, not so long ago. And now people already forgot about this. And the politicians are, like, putting oil to the fire. They know that this is something that can win the election for them. POGGIOLI: In fact, by late evening, right-wing politicians across Europe were cheering the results in Austria's presidential election Sunday. The right-wing, anti-immigrant freedom party swept in the first round with some 36 percent of votes cast. The parties best showing since its creation after World War II. INSKEEP: We're listening to NPR's Sylvia Poggioli. She is at the Brenner Pass, the border between Italy and Austria. And, Sylvia, you mentioned the malls and so forth in that area on that border that may have tighter controls. What are the economic repercussions of this? POGGIOLI: Well, they could be huge. This province, South Tyrol, hosts around 6 million tourists a year. The great majority are Germans. The local hotel and restaurant industry fears delays at the new checkpoint will keep them away. And along with 10 million cars, 2 million trucks pass through the Brenner Pass every year. It's a major crossways for Italian exports to Germany. The Italian Agricultural Union said reintroduction of border controls would threaten the annual movement of more than $11 billion worth of Italian foodstuffs alone. Italy is very worried. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Sylvia Poggioli. She's speaking with us from the Italy-Austria border. Sylvia, thanks. POGGIOLI: Thank You, Steve. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "The NPR newsroom during election coverage on November 8, 2016, in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Stephen Voss/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The NPR newsroom during election coverage on November 8, 2016, in Washington, D.C. A week after the election, the Ombudsman inbox is still fielding a heavy influx of emails with audience opinions about NPR's presidential campaign journalism. Many of the emails have been vitriolic, a reflection of hard-felt voter emotions, no doubt. People in NPR's newsroom and elsewhere within the public radio system have been thinking hard about NPR's coverage, too. We will post some audience mail in our next column (more on that later), but for now here are some preliminary thoughts from me, taking into account input from others in the newsroom. I suspect these issues will eventually consume more than a couple columns of reflection. As others have already written, many in the media and the pundit class were blindsided by the outcome of the election, failing to understand the forces that led to the victory of President-elect Donald J. Trump over Hillary Clinton. There were multiple reasons for that, including polling that was simply off. But much of the post-election criticism of \"the media\" has focused on the missing voices, the supporters of Trump who were not heard. This is one issue (there are others) that seems to be at the heart of many listener and reader criticisms of NPR's election coverage. Trump supporters argue that they and their concerns were not heard. Those opposed to Trump argue that his supporters were heard too often, and not challenged enough. My office listened to all of NPR's campaign coverage. In my opinion, it did not take particular effort to hear the voices of many of those in demographic groups that supported the Republican candidate, in all their complexity. They were heard in \"Divided States,\" for one, a prominently positioned Morning Edition series of interviews with supporters of both of the major candidates. Those interviews, while equally balanced between the two major candidates, upset many, many listeners. I had concerns about the voter interviews, too, because on some occasions the speakers were not called out on their incorrect facts, as I wrote previously. But I didn't object to hearing from the voters themselves; voters often make their decisions based on complicated reasoning, or for reasons that others will find objectionable. As Edith Chapin, NPR's executive editor, told me, \"We put them on because they are real people and they have real views.\" That said, it is clear that some in NPR's audience believe that respectful listening to folks, which is how the NPR newsroom refers to these interviews, is unacceptable. More specifically, they are concerned that when NPR airs interviews with people who hold what they believe are racist or misogynistic or xenophobic views, it is \"normalizing\" those opinions. This isn't an issue that will go away, nor will everyone find common ground. Perhaps NPR could frame the interviews differently, with an acknowledgment that they are just individual voices in the wide spectrum of voices. But I believe it's possible to listen to someone with whom you disagree and not hear the interview or news report as an endorsement of his or her views. NPR's stated purpose in its campaign journalism is to give listeners and readers the information that they need to make civic decisions and to understand the broad forces at work in society \u2014 not simply to confirm what they've already decided. In my opinion, NPR did a good job reflecting many of the concerns from Trump country, in the vox pop interviews and in reported pieces, including interviews with Trump voters in Pennsylvania, Colorado and Ohio (among many others). There were also interviews with prominent supporters such as Ralph Reed, who seemed to speak for many in explaining why they would not be deterred from voting for Trump despite reports about his past bragging about behavior that would equate to sexual assault (which he later denied he had actually done). As the general election campaign geared up, my office started tracking all of NPR's election coverage. With input from the newsroom, we agreed on some criteria for the reporting. One of those was avoiding over-reliance on reporting on polls. Polling is a murky art these days (see the pre-Election Day prognostications), and my office's analysis of NPR's coverage of the Democratic and Republican primary campaigns showed poll results creeping into the reporting and newscasts regularly. Happily, that was not the case during the general election campaign. Another \"best practice\" was in-depth exploration of the candidates' platforms and proposed policies. Here, we found the newsroom's performance was mixed. Our tracking showed that such reports were indeed sparse in the late summer, but picked up markedly by September and October. We found no major issue that did not get examined. A detailed chart published Oct. 18 summed up the stands of four candidates (Trump and Clinton, plus Libertarian Gary Johnson and the Green Party's Jill Stein) on many issues. But in contrast to the voter interviews, the policy stories sometimes got lost. Yes, they were all there \u2014 we linked to pretty much most of them in our biweekly tracking reports \u2014 but they were easy to miss. By contrast, NPR put much more emphasis on the story of the day, the scandals, the lines of attack and the just silly (such as the multiple reports on Trump's release of medical information on The Dr. Oz Show), as well as news analysis and Monday morning and Friday evening commentary. I've already expressed my concerns (shared by listeners) about how NPR did commentary this election cycle. But here's another thought. What if NPR's newsmagazines had given similar prominent treatment each week to looking at the candidates' platforms and proposed policies, in a dedicated slot that listeners would know when to tune into? Just one example: I've gotten quite a bit of feedback to this very good in-depth online piece fact-checking Trump's first 100 days action plan, along with laments along the lines of \"why didn't NPR report this earlier?\" It did, in several pieces. Two of them were more of the campaign trail variety of story. One covered more policy, with a clear web presentation, but, because it dealt with both Trump's and Clinton's plans, had nowhere near the detail of the later piece. Each of his points (and Clinton's, since at that point we didn't know who would win) could have supported a separate story. As one public radio journalist pointed out to me, this story about the candidates' plans epitomized the challenge, not just for NPR but for all media: \"There's a problem Trump continues to create for himself: These policy proposals are often lost in the headlines created when Trump dwells on grievances against his perceived enemies in the media, government and other \"elite\" power structures. Take Trump's recent speech in Gettysburg, Pa., which was billed as the rollout of his agenda for the first 100 days of a Trump administration. Trump began the speech by promising to bring legal action against women who have accused him of sexual assault and harassment. This new threat \u2014 and not the repackaged proposals he had spoken about before \u2014 became the day's news.\" But it's only the day's news for NPR if NPR lets it be. Which brings me to one other point. One sure way for a newsroom to break free from the \"story of the day\" is to set the agenda itself, through enterprise reporting. The Washington Post did that brilliantly this election cycle, with David Fahrenthold's dogged investigation into Trump's charitable contributions. NPR did interview Fahrenthold on the air, and reported on other organizations' reporting, including the Trump tax documents that were leaked to The New York Times. But it did relatively little of its own enterprise reporting (one exception was David Folkenflik's examination of Clinton's media strategy). I've asked a number of people within NPR for an explanation and got conflicting answers. Among them: NPR has a lean staff and extra money was not put into the politics budget when it was being assembled. Michael Oreskes, NPR's head of news, said a decision was made to focus energies and resources elsewhere (see his comments below). Whether there was an appetite at NPR for such original campaign reporting is unclear to me. Whatever the reason, I wish NPR had done more of it. So what did NPR get right this time around? So much! I think it's important to acknowledge just what a massive undertaking NPR's coverage was, and how much of a radical change that meant for the newsroom. Overall, from the point the primaries ended through last Monday (June 12 through Nov. 7, and excluding the two convention weeks), NPR turned out 1,351 campaign-related stories for the weekday and weekend Morning Edition and All Things Considered newsmagazines and online. Those numbers do not even include the newscasts, conversations on the midday Here & Now, all the NPR Politics Podcasts, or social media, including Facebook Live reports and reporters' Twitter updates. (It also does not include On Point, Fresh Air, Latino USA or The Diane Rehm Show, which NPR distributes but does not produce). Reporters were out and about far more than in the past, veterans tell me, covering the story from the ground and not just the campaign planes. Christopher Turpin, vice president of news programming and operations and a 16-year NPR veteran, said it was by far NPR's biggest-ever campaign effort, particularly on the digital side. As a portion of the audience migrates away from radio to podcasts and online, two digital initiatives stand out, the resource-intensive initiatives to which Oreskes referred earlier. The NPR Politics Podcast brought together veteran reporters, such as Ron Elving, with the \"next generation of politics reporters and a diverse team,\" Chapin said. In my opinion, they looked at the campaign through some insightful windows, such as Asma Khalid's demographic reporting. In a sea of political podcasts, NPR's stood out, and listeners responded; the podcast had 9.3 million downloads during October. On top of filing reports for the newsmagazines and special live coverage, the team was also putting out the podcasts nightly for the last two weeks leading up to the election. The other innovation was fact-checking, which, as I've said before, NPR's audience was demanding. NPR got a slow start on the fact-checking in the primaries, Turpin said, and we, too, found it a somewhat scattered approach initially. But fact-checking came into its own during the four presidential and vice presidential debates, when newsroom teams of 30 or so people fact-checked and annotated debate transcripts and did it in close to real time. It was both a strong journalistic service and an innovative technical approach, and the NPR audience responded. A recurring complaint, from radio listeners in particular (as opposed to users of NPR.org), is that they heard from and about Trump far more often than Clinton. This is despite the fact that Trump never gave an interview to NPR. That is not unprecedented but it's rare; according to the NPR Research, Archives, and Data Strategy department, since NPR went on the air in 1971, the only two previous candidates that NPR did not interview specifically during their candidacy (and who weren't incumbent presidents) were Bob Dole in 1996 and Mitt Romney in 2012. Both had been interviewed by NPR before undertaking their campaigns, however, unlike Trump, who has never been interviewed by NPR. There's nothing like a direct interview, of course, and I'm told that NPR was persistent in its requests to interview Trump and never got a clear answer as to why an interview was denied. Barring that, NPR turned to sound bites from the campaign trail, and interviews with campaign surrogates and with supporters. Based on the tracking my office did, listeners are right: They heard and read far more coverage devoted to Trump than to Clinton (although they are incorrect that most newscasts led with Trump over Clinton; the split was closer to a toss-up, according to our limited tracking of this). The final story totals were 461 pieces with Trump as the main focus to 262 focused on Clinton. There were also nine focused on Johnson, three each on the Green Party's Stein and independent conservative candidate Evan McMullin, and eight on Bernie Sanders (who by the mid-June starting point of our counts had essentially lost the Democratic nomination to Clinton). Another six stories focused largely on the third party candidates. The largest number of stories, 599, looked at more than one candidate or addressed wider election issues. Are these numbers appropriate? Some listeners complained that NPR gave too much free publicity to Trump and he was certainly a master at generating attention for himself. But the stories about him were a mix: interviews with supporters, critics, and analysts. Given that Trump was largely unknown and unscrutinized as a political figure (unlike Clinton), it seems appropriate to me that he got more attention. Too much? I'm not sure. I do feel that there were some stories \u2014 such as the coverage of the leaked Access Hollywood tape where Trump is heard bragging about groping women without their consent, and the aftermath when other women made accusations of inappropriate behavior \u2014 that perhaps NPR lingered on too long (close to four dozen different takes). This led some of his supporters to see a bias against him. (I'd also note that bias charges against NPR during an election are not new; previous ombudsmen have dealt with them, as well. See here and here.) This summer, when we started tracking the campaign coverage in earnest, Michael Oreskes articulated NPR's goal for me: \"Are we getting across to you the material you need about both candidates? That's the challenge. That's what we should be judged by. We may actually give you more about one than the other, but as long as we've given you enough about both then I think our job is getting done.\" A day before the election, I asked Oreskes for his thoughts looking back. He cited many of the same things I have in this column, saying he was proud of the team that had been assembled, the podcast, the fact-checking and a series called \"A Nation Engaged,\" in which NPR and member stations came together to foster conversations around major campaign issues, including trade. (Many of those discussions took place only at the local level, so listeners elsewhere did not hear them, but the ones I heard were substantive.) He also said he believed NPR had brought more diverse voices from all over the country into the conversation. He argued that, while some listeners did not like these interviews, \"I think it's incredibly valuable for people to hear other people with views different from theirs,\" adding that the interviews were \"quite helpful in understanding what voters thought and why they had come to whatever conclusions they had come to.\" And, he said, \"I'd like to figure out ways to do more of that going forward.\" Asked what could have been done better, Oreskes cited the critiques of the joint NPR/PBS convention coverage, which did not translate well for radio. But he defended the effort, saying it \"moved public media forward\" by ending duplication of efforts, and that must continue. His most important critique \u2014 and one I agree with wholeheartedly \u2014 is that NPR, as with all of media, was \"slow to recognize the power of this angry outsider feeling that gripped a lot of the country this year.\" He added, \"It took awhile for us to fully grasp what it was.\" Khalid's demographic reporting was incredibly valuable, he said, but, \"I only wish we had started sooner.\" He added, \"If I had it all to over again, I would have started her two years earlier,\" after the 2014 mid-term elections. Likewise, he said he wished NPR had begun working more collaboratively with member station reporters much earlier, as it did later in the campaign, which generated some strong on-the-ground reporting (120 reports in total, some that ran nationally and some locally or regionally only). I heard similar sentiments from others in the newsroom. Turpin, for one, said NPR was \"a little slow to spot the two mass movements in this campaign,\" the ones behind Trump and Sanders. He added, \"As an organization, if the election has taught us one thing it is to really think about how broad the political spectrum is in this country.\" That may be small consolation to those who wrote the Ombudsman office for months with concerns about the Sanders and third party coverage, but it is honest, and I would hope and expect that it would inform coverage going forward. Oreskes said it would. NPR has made a commitment to what is being called the Statehouse Project, through which NPR and member station reporters will work together to expand coverage of state government and political coverage state by state. In theory, this should also give NPR more insight into what is happening outside the major cities where its journalists are concentrated (like many major news organizations). For more thoughts from Oreskes, read or listen to his commentary from Saturday's Weekend All Things Considered. These are some of the issues I've been thinking about. While it's not possible to respond in detail to all the letters we have received about the campaign coverage, this column covers some of the major concerns we have heard. That leads to a final point. Only those with concerns tend to write my office; by and large we do not hear from those who appreciate the coverage that NPR provides, even though we know there are many more fans than detractors out there. (NPR's on-air and online audience has soared this election season, so it must be doing something right.) We want to hear that other side, too, with thoughts about what NPR did right and why you liked it. Write us, please!

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., takes the stage during the first day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia , Monday, July 25, 2016.\n                \n                    \n                    John Locher/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former Democratic Presidential candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., takes the stage during the first day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia , Monday, July 25, 2016. As America continues to absorb the results of a truly contentious and historic presidential election, one group of voters may be particularly upset: Bernie Sanders supporters. For months over the course of the campaign, many in Sanders' ranks said he was the only candidate with a sure shot at beating Trump, that he could reach working class voters better than Hillary Clinton could, and that he offered a true progressive agenda that Clinton could not. But these supporters never got the chance to be proven right \u2014 or wrong. So now, some of them vent. \"Schadenfreude,\" said Philip Werlau, a Bernie Sanders supporter, when asked his feelings about this week's election results. \"That is the German word for taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune. ... Because I don't want Trump to be president. But I'm happy that what I perceived as unfair tactics lost.\" Werlau, a 26-year-old computer science student from Florida, voted for Libertarian Gary Johnson in this week's presidential election, after supporting Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primaries. After Sanders lost the Democratic nomination, Werlau said there was no chance he'd support Clinton. \"I kind of lost hope in the election,\" he says. And Werlau says his vote for Johnson wasn't a spoiler, because he \"wasn't going to vote for Hillary in the first place.\" Werlau said he is still angry about what he thinks was unfair treatment of Sanders and his supporters by the Democratic National Committee. He and many others felt the nominating process for the party favored Clinton and that the DNC actively fought to make her the nominee. An email dump from WikiLeaks during the week of the Democratic National Convention this past July, which Sanders supporters say showed proof of the DNC tipping the scales in Clinton's favor, only confirmed those fears for many Sanders supporters. \"It's far behind perception at this point, it's factual that the party leadership definitely put its hands on the scale for Secretary Clinton,\" said Dallas Fowler, a Sanders delegate turned Clinton voter from Los Angeles. \"And I think post-primary not dealing with that effectively as a party drove a number of people [away from Clinton].\" Fowler, like most Sanders supporters, eventually ended up backing Clinton in the general election. The conventional wisdom was that Clinton could get most disaffected Sanders voters back if she moved further to the left after the convention. And she did, most notably with a college affordability plan Clinton announced after clinching the nomination, which borrowed heavily from Sanders' agenda and was critical in securing the Vermont senator's endorsement. But for some Sanders supporters, and maybe enough of them to swing the election, nothing Clinton could do would win them over. Zach Exley was a senior adviser to the Sanders campaign and the author of the upcoming book, Rules For Revolutionaries. He says Clinton's problems were bigger than policy, or any sense of betrayal from core Sanders supporters. For him, it was about tone. \"Americans are so angry about their incomes going down for the past 40 years, they wanted to see that anger reflected in a leader,\" said Exley. \"And Trump had that and Bernie had that, and Clinton seemed not to know what the rest of us are going through.\" Dallas Fowler says that because Sanders proved he could tap into that emotion, he could have won several states Clinton did not. Listing states like Michigan, Florida and Pennsylvania, Fowler said, \"The polls that were right about this outcome [Trump's win] in May and June of this year, those same polls had Sanders winning by a ten percent margin.\" Of course, those polls could not take into account any attack ads that might have been run against Sanders in a general election campaign; during the primaries only a few opposition ads were run against him. Sanders himself issued a statement soon after Donald Trump's victory, saying, \"Donald Trump tapped into the anger of a declining middle class that is sick and tired of establishment economics, establishment politics and the establishment media.\" But Sanders also said he would be open to working with the new president, \"To the degree that Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country.\" But he concluded, \"To the degree that he pursues racist, sexist, xenophobic and anti-environment policies, we will vigorously oppose him.\" The question for Sanders' supporters is what they do next. Winnie Wong, organizer of the online group People for Bernie, told NPR that most of them will take their activism to other causes, and future elections. (Wong swapped votes with a friend in a competitive state: she voted for Jill Stein in Massachusetts on that friend's behalf while the friend, a North Carolina resident, voted for Clinton.) \"I'm not even thinking about Donald Trump at this point, candidly,\" she said. Instead she's looking forward. \"The 2018 midterm races are winnable,\" Wong said. \"We can win it all in 2018. And I think that's what we have to look forward to. We can't just dig in and think that it's all over, because it isn't.\"",

Expressing political beliefs with a yard sign is common. But business owners can hurt their bottom lines by advertising an opinion. Political scientists and marketing experts generally advise against doing that, as we first reported during the 2012 election. Despite the advice, some business owners are willing to risk a financial hit, depending on whether their customers agree with them. The Philadelphia suburbs are swing territory during elections, so you won't find many signs in shop windows there. Owners don't want to risk alienating up to half their customer base. But in Republican-dominated rural Pennsylvania? No problem. \"Our country's headed in a bad direction. We need to get it turned around and I think Trump's going do that for us,\" says 28-year-old Adam Miller. His family owns Miller's Auto Sales and Service in Dillsburg, Pa. The Millers agreed to have a 4-foot-by-8-foot red, white and blue Trump sign outside where thousands of drivers see it on Route 15 every day. Putting the sign there isn't just about supporting Trump, though. Miller says he feels like an increasingly diverse country is telling him his views no longer matter.

Asked to say more about that, at first he has trouble explaining exactly why he feels this way. But talk with him more and the Colin Kaepernick issue comes up. Kaepernick is the professional football player who refused to stand for the national anthem as a protest over how the country treats people of color. Miller's older brother Robert says President Obama's defense of Kaepernick's right to protest really upset both of them. \"Our president shouldn't be talking about a sports star. Our president should be talking about real issues,\" Robert Miller says. Those are views that might lose them business elsewhere \u2014 but the brothers say not here, where voters chose Mitt Romney in 2012 over Barack Obama by nearly a 2-to-1 margin.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump spoke to supporters in Asheville, N.C., Monday night, where he criticized Hillary Clinton's comments about his supporters but largely stayed away from her recent health issues.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Donald Trump spent today working with fresh material to make his case against Hillary Clinton. He was largely quiet about Clinton's recent health issues but is pressing his opponent over these comments from a fundraiser Clinton held on Friday night. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: You could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. (LAUGHTER) CLINTON: Right? (CHEERING, APPLAUSE) CLINTON: The racist, sexists, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic - you name it. CORNISH: NPR's Scott Detrow is in Asheville, N.C., where Donald Trump spoke to reporters this evening. And Scott, what else did you hear from Donald Trump today? SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Well, Trump has really taken this and made it fit into the message of his campaign, and that's the basic argument that Hillary Clinton looks down on all of Trump's supporters. Trump - and he's been saying this for a while - says he's the one in the race standing with average people. He calls them the voiceless. And he's arguing Clinton really despises these voters and that the candidate's for the establishment and the elite. This evening Trump actually invited about a half dozen supporters on stage with him to respond to what Clinton said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: We are going to make America great again, and Hillary needs to take a nap. (CHEERING, APPLAUSE) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Do I look deplorable? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: No. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: What? UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: No. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: I'm a wife, a mother. I work full-time, and I am voting for Donald Trump. And Mrs. Clinton, you can go home. (CHEERING, APPLAUSE) DETROW: That was one supporter whose name we haven't been able to catch yet. But Trump basically is arguing that Clinton is the elite candidate. He's there for the people. CORNISH: Now, Hillary Clinton has said over the weekend that she shouldn't have quantified this statement by using the term half, but her campaign is fundamentally standing by the basic characterization of some Trump supporters, right? DETROW: Absolutely. And in fact they seem to be happy to have this conversation. They responded to an ad that Trump put out about this today by saying, well, here's several different examples of Trump talking about black communities, about Muslim communities, talking about Mexican immigrants all in ways that have caused controversy and offended a lot of people. And in fact they were using Hillary Clinton's Twitter account today to circulate video of Governor Mike Pence on CNN. He was asked whether he called David Duke - that's the former Ku Klux Klan member who's endorsed Donald Trump - deplorable. Pence says he doesn't want Duke's support, but he's not in the name-calling business. That was a clip the Clinton campaign was sending around. So all in all, they seem happy to have this conversation even if it seems to have played directly into Trump's hand in terms of the line that he's been talking about for months now. CORNISH: Now, there's been a lot of discussion over the candidate's health since Hillary Clinton fell ill at that 9/11 commemoration in New York yesterday, and her campaign is promising to release more detailed health records. I mentioned at the beginning that Donald Trump has been quiet about this, but has he been asked about it today? DETROW: He was asked a couple times during cable news appearances this morning. He said that basically he wants Hillary Clinton to get better. He wished her well. But you know, he's been raising questions about Clinton's health for months now. Here he was on CNN in March. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: I think she doesn't have the stamina. You watch her life. You watch how she'll go away for three, four days. She'll come back. She'll go. I just don't think she has the stamina. DETROW: You know, and this has been a drum beat from the Trump campaign for months. And they weren't talking about pneumonia there. They were talking about broader health problems or insinuating to them at least. CORNISH: Lastly, Donald Trump's health records - has he said anything more about his own? DETROW: Nothing yet - he says more will come out later this week, that he just had a physical. But it looks like he may release that information on \"The Dr. Oz Show,\" and Dr. Oz of course has had a lot of questions raised about his credibility as well.

CORNISH: NPR's Scott Detrow is in Asheville, N.C., where Donald Trump is campaigning this evening. And Scott, what more can you tell us about what Trump is saying on the stump today? SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Well, Trump has really taken this and made it fit into the message of his campaign - the basic argument that Hillary Clinton looks down on all Trump supporters. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: Our support comes from every part of America and every walk of life. We have the support of cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, the young and the old and millions of working-class families who just want a better future and a good job. These were the people Hillary Clinton so viciously demonized. DETROW: You know, Trump says he's the one in the race standing with average people. He calls them the voiceless. And he's arguing that Hillary Clinton, you know, despises these voters and is the candidate for the establishment and the elite. CORNISH: You know, after the comment went viral, Hillary Clinton said over the weekend that she shouldn't have quantified this by saying half, but her campaign is standing by the basic characterization of what she said, right? DETROW: That's right. They responded to Donald Trump's new ad on this saying, well, here are several examples of Donald Trump talking about black communities, talking about Muslim communities, talking about Mexican immigrants all in ways that cause controversy and offended a lot of people. You could also point out Trump's role in the effort to question whether President Obama was born in the United States. They point to support that Trump has gotten from people like David Duke. So while this statement on Friday by Clinton does give Trump ammunition, the Clinton campaign seems happy to make the conversation about how Trump has alienated all these minority groups throughout his campaign. CORNISH: We're losing you a little bit, Scott. Let's see if we can hold on for the next minute it's - because there's been a lot of discussion over the candidates' health since Hillary Clinton fell ill at the 9/11 commemoration in New York yesterday, her campaign's promising to release more detailed health records. And I mentioned at the beginning that he's been relatively quiet about this. When has he said about it today? DETROW: So far nothing. When he was asked about this during some cable news appearances, he said that he wishes Hillary Clinton well. But Trump has been raising questions about Clinton's health for months. Here he was on CNN back in March. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: I think she doesn't have the stamina. You watch her life. You watch how she'll go away for three, four days. She'll come back. She'll go. I just don't think she has the stamina. DETROW: You know, this has been a drumbeat from the Trump campaign. Rudy Giuliani was on Fox News telling people to basically Google conspiracy theories about it. And his questions weren't hinting at pneumonia. They were clearly hinting at a broader health problem for Hillary Clinton. CORNISH: And meanwhile, Donald Trump's health records - we know he's released a very short letter from his doctor. Anything else? DETROW: That's it so far - that short letter that many people dismissed as being hyperbole saying that Trump would be the healthiest person ever elected president. Trump does say there's more to come later in the week, that he recently took a physical and he'll share that information. He is scheduled to appear on \"The Dr. Oz Show\" on Thursday. But of course Dr. Oz has a lot of questions about his credibility as well. CORNISH: That's NPR's Scott Detrow traveling with the Trump campaign in North Carolina. Scott, thank you.

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton's efforts to humanize herself and make an affirmative case for her candidacy has been complicated by a case of pneumonia and her comments about Donald Trump's supporters.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: Hillary Clinton's campaign says it will release additional medical information about Clinton later this week. Campaign officials also acknowledge they could have done a better job communicating about her health scare over the weekend. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: The campaign said the Democratic nominee for president was diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday, but that announcement didn't come until yesterday after Clinton's legs seemed to buckle after she left a September 11 ceremony in New York before it was over. She needed help getting into the van that was waiting for her. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson reports that wasn't the only problem for Clinton this weekend. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: This was not the way the fall campaign was supposed to start for Hillary Clinton. After spending weeks off the trail raising money, her campaign planned to start showcasing Clinton opening up to voters and says her top strategist, Joel Benenson, making a more affirmative case for herself instead of just driving an anti-Trump message. JOEL BENENSON: We look at the post-Labor Day period as an opportunity to also drive her positive message, her vision to this country that she is tenacious, fighting on behalf of people, you know? She is putting people first, and Donald Trump puts himself first. LIASSON: She got a good start, explaining why she's sometimes perceived as aloof or cold or unemotional on a blog called Humans of New York. She spoke to the National Baptist Convention about her faith. And after many months without a press conference, last week she started talking to the reporters who travel with her around the country. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: I am so happy to have all of you with me. I was just waiting for this moment. LIASSON: But then two things happened that threaten to undermine those efforts. On Friday night at a fundraiser, Clinton said this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: Would just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorable. (LAUGHTER) CLINTON: Right? (CHEERING, APPLAUSE) CLINTON: The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic - you name it. LIASSON: Clinton later apologized but only for using the word half, and her campaign points to what she went on to say on Friday night about the rest of Trump's supporters. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: That other basket of people are people who feel the government has let them down, the economy has let them down, nobody cares about them. LIASSON: Those are people we have to understand and empathize with as well, she said. It wasn't long before the Trump campaign made the first part of her comments into an attack ad. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: You know what's deplorable - Hillary Clinton viciously demonizing people like you. LIASSON: Clinton's comments created a problem, but few Democrats thought it was a race-changing one. Much more worrisome for her supporters was the pneumonia which took the de-bunked health conspiracy theories about Clinton turned them into a legitimate campaign issue. Even worse, the way the Clinton campaign handled the event erased some of the good will she'd started to build with the media and reinforced her reputation as secretive and dishonest. For Clinton, it's been one step forward, two steps back. Pollster Peter Hart says she has some catching up to do because she squandered the post-convention period. PETER HART: We didn't have any personalization of Hillary Clinton. Our problem has always been that we don't get to see sort of the internal of what's driving her and what she's about. She has made a thousand speeches, but I don't think the voters can repeat and tell you what her administration would be about. LIASSON: Without information from Clinton about what drives her and how her vision is connected to her programs, Hart says, voters have filled in the blanks with the headlines. And for the last several weeks, those headlines were all about emails and the foundation. Now, says Hart, it's even more urgent that Clinton help people understand how she'll fight to improve their lives and not just to win the election but to make sure she has a mandate if she does. Recent polls show the race is tightening nationally and in some battleground states and that Clinton's likely voters are less enthusiastic than Trump's. When confronted with Clinton's dismal numbers on likability, honesty or trustworthiness, Clinton supporters often point to the fact that when she's in office, her approval ratings are strong. Ed Rendell is the former governor of Pennsylvania. ED RENDELL: She has terrible internals and terrible unfavorable. And yet when she was secretary of state and in office, she almost had 60-percent-plus favorable rating. When in office, Hillary Clinton shows what she can do, and she rebuilds that trust, and she rebuilds that bond with the people that she governs. And I believe she'll do that as president. LIASSON: But first she has to get elected. The gaffe about Trump's supporters and her less-than-forthcoming approach to her health problems have made that goal more difficult to reach.

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speaks during the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) and National Association of Hispanic Journalists (NAHJ) joint convention in Washington, D.C., on Friday.\n                \n                    \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speaks during the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) and National Association of Hispanic Journalists (NAHJ) joint convention in Washington, D.C., on Friday. Addressing a joint convention of black and Hispanic journalists Friday, Hillary Clinton found herself wading through a Q&A session \u2014 a format that has become a rarity for her. She mostly gave prepared remarks at the event, but when it was time for journalists in the audience to ask questions, her discomfort with press conferences emerged \u2014 with one question in particular. Kevin Merida, editor-in-chief of ESPN's The Undefeated, asked Clinton: \"What is the most meaningful conversation you've had with an African-American friend?\" Clinton at first exclaimed, amid a burst of chatter, \"Oh my gosh.\" Then she responded: \"Can I tell you that I am blessed to have a crew of great friends, and I've had two chiefs-of-staff who were my African-American women friends, Maggie Williams and Cheryl Mills.\" She listed off other African-American staff who have worked with her \u2014 and for her \u2014 and said she's had a \"lifetime of friendship\" with black people. \"They've supported me. They've chastised me. They've raised issues with me. They've tried to expand my musical tastes,\" Clinton said. \"We've have a lot of great, great times because of our friendships. So, I can't really pick one conversation out of, you know, 50 years of conversation.\" She added that she wants to respect the \"cone of silence\" among her friends. The comments came as the Democratic nominee addressed a joint convention of the National Associations of Black Journalists and Hispanic Journalists in Washington, D.C. Clinton rarely gives press conferences (and even this was a moderated Q&A, not a press conference), a point Donald Trump was quick to highlight to a group of reporters last week, saying, \"It's been 235 days since crooked Hillary Clinton has had a press conference.\" The two associations represent the largest minority journalist groups in the country. And although these audience members remained mostly impartial (the journalists' careers demanded it, though there were some public relations people in the audience who cheered) they also represent two key demographics that any candidate will need to woo in order to win the White House in November. In another question, Clinton toed the line between condemnation of Trump's sometimes inflammatory language toward immigrants and minorities and risking alienation of his support base. A political reporter for the New York Times asked \"You've accused Donald Trump of using racist and sexist language, what does it say about the electorate that so many are supporting him?\" Clinton responded that she thinks \"the core of his support really centers on the disappointment in the economy that so many Americans feel.\" \"So many of them are looking for an explanation as to why they lost the job they had for 18 years when the factory closed and nobody cared about them.\" She added, \"We have to recognize that of course some of the appeal is xenophobic and racist and misogynistic and offensive. We have to acknowledge that, but let's not lose sight of the real pain that many Americans are feeling.\" When the questions veered back to familiar topics for the Democratic candidate, Clinton's answers were more polished. On immigration reform, Clinton said she hoped Democrats would pick up more seats in the House: \"We lost a lot of leverage because we lost the House of Representatives.\" On the controversy over her private email server, Clinton also struggled but doubled down on what she's previously said \u2014 that her answers to FBI Director James Comey were truthful and she regrets ever having the second server in the first place. Clinton had been called out in several fact checks this week, including NPR's, for saying \"Director Comey said my answers were truthful.\" In her prepared remarks, Clinton spoke of her commitment to black and Hispanic communities in general, citing plans to reinvigorate the U.S. economy and pass comprehensive immigration and criminal justice reform. She attacked Trump on his remarks toward Muslims and other immigrants. She highlighted her Spanish language Twitter account. She also spoke of the importance of journalism in our society and thanked the journalists in the room. \"I think journalists have a special responsibility to our democracy in a time like this,\" Clinton said. \"I want you to hold me accountable, press and citizens alike, because the stakes are as high as they've ever been in our lifetimes, and we all have to do our part.\" Before asking his question, Ed O'Keefe of the Washington Post encouraged Clinton to take questions from the press more often.",

            "article_content": "The general election unofficially began on Wednesday as Donald Trump became the de facto GOP nominee. And, boy, is it going to be ugly. Likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton premiered an unsurprising line of attack in an online ad against her probable November opponent \u2014 throwing back some of the choice words from his now-vanquished Republican rivals just as the real estate mogul now has the daunting task of trying to unite the GOP behind him. \"President Trump\" is a dangerous proposition.Mitt Romney, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio agree.https://t.co/fUkISvgaXC \"Con artist,\" said Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. \"The most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidency.\" \"He's a race-baiting, xenophobic religious bigot,\" said South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham. \"A narcissist at a level I don't think this country has ever seen,\" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said about Trump on Tuesday, just hours before he dropped his own bid. \"He needs therapy,\" former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said exasperatedly in the ad's final kicker. Even as Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus telegraphed that the party should let bygones be bygones and unite behind Trump, there were plenty of signs Wednesday that would not be an easy task. Many GOP leaders remain firmly in the #NeverTrump camp, and Trump trails Clinton badly in general election polls. Those anti-Trump forces had tried a similar tack earlier this year with a blistering ad aimed at women voters \u2014 especially crucial for any candidate in the general election. In the spot from Our Principles PAC, women read verbatim vulgar insults and slurs Trump has hurled at women throughout his career \u2014 \"Bimbo. Dog. Fat pig.\" This came from a GOP group, but expect similar spots from Democrats to use this tactic against Trump repeatedly during the general election, too. Republicans also worry that Trump's likely nomination will put more Senate seats in play even as they're already facing a daunting map and playing defense in several places. One longer-shot Senate candidate, Arkansas Democrat Conner Eldridge, tried a similar tack this week with his own online spot. Shots of Trump's demeaning comments toward women and remarks about one of his ex-wives play as Republican Sen. John Boozman is labeled a \"Trump enabler\" for his support of the now-certain GOP presidential nominee. Expect Trump to fight back hard, as he already proved to do in the successful primary campaign where he beat 16 rivals. Instagram videos were a favorite of Trump's in hitting his fellow Republicans, and he's already used the platform to go after Clinton. In one such brief March video, he shows clips of Russian President Vladimir Putin and an ISIS fighter and argues that Clinton would be a \"punchline\" on the national stage as he shows a clip of her imitating a dog barking. Is this what we want for a President? A video posted by Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on Mar 16, 2016 at 9:15am PDT Trump has also signaled he won't be afraid to flash back to the '90s and dredge up scandals from the Clinton administration, including former President Bill Clinton's affairs and subsequent impeachment, Whitewater and other controversies. In fact, earlier this week he was spotted having lunch with author Edward Klein, who wrote many gossip and rumor-peddling books about the Clintons (much of their content has been discredited). National Republicans have already given peeks at the overall playbook they intend to use against Clinton if she is the Democratic nominee. They've spent years hitting her over the Benghazi attacks and the controversial private email server she used while at the State Department. Here's a Republican National Committee online ad from earlier this year that hits her over those subjects.",

As Europe reels from the effects of the United Kingdom's Brexit vote, there's fresh anxiety about another referendum coming up in a major EU country. It won't be a vote on whether to remain or to leave the European Union, but on Italy's constitutional reform package. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi says the reforms \u2014 which would simplify and accelerate the passage of laws \u2014 are long overdue and will finally bring an end to decades of his country's notorious revolving-door governments. But Italian analysts say the October vote could turn into a referendum on the Italian government itself \u2014 and could prove as much of a boomerang for Renzi, who has been prime minister for 2 1/2 years, as the U.K. referendum has been for David Cameron. Complicating matters further are Italy's banking problems. Italy's banks are burdened by $400 billion in bad loans, one-third the eurozone total. These problems predate the arrival of Renzi's center-left government, but they have become a politically explosive issue after thousands of small depositors were wiped out at four regional banks over the last year and several savers who lost all their money committed suicide. Many analysts warn that with its shaky banking system, lackluster growth, high unemployment and a growing wave of anti-establishment public sentiment, Italy is on the brink of a major crisis. The trigger could be Renzi's constitutional reforms referendum. Beppe Grillo (left) arrives at a party in Rome on June 27 after his anti-establishment 5 Star Movement triumphed in Italian mayoral runoff elections in 19 cities.\n                \n                    \n                    Fabio Frustaci/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Beppe Grillo (left) arrives at a party in Rome on June 27 after his anti-establishment 5 Star Movement triumphed in Italian mayoral runoff elections in 19 cities. Current opinion polls show a small lead for a \"yes\" vote approving the reforms, but polls have shown themselves to be unreliable in several recent European ballots. Renzi has repeatedly said that if the referendum fails, he will step down, raising the prospect of early elections in 2017. The destabilizing potential of such an outcome causes deep anxiety in European capitals, because the party likely to benefit most from early elections is the anti-establishment 5 Star Movement. Founded seven years ago, it sprang from a satirical blog started by comedian Beppe Grillo. The party won 19 out of 20 cities \u2014 including Turin and Rome \u2014 in local elections held on June 20. Analysts attributed the 5 Star Movement's success to a wave of popular anger with entrenched political elites and insecurity over economic stagnation and the growing presence of migrants. Unlike the overtly right-wing, xenophobic parties gaining ground in other parts of Europe, the 5 Star Movement won votes in these local elections across the political spectrum, appealing to voters on the right, center and left. In the European Parliament, however, the 5 Star Movement is allied with the right \u2014 including the U.K. Independence Party, one of the major Brexit sponsors. Grillo, 67, described the Brexit vote as \"a lesson in democracy,\" and last Tuesday, the two parties voted alongside Marine Le Pen's National Front from France, and other right-wing groupings, against a motion calling on Britain to speed up its EU departure. Grillo has repeatedly criticized what he sees as excessive restrictions imposed on eurozone member states and has vowed to push for an Italian referendum on whether to remain in the eurozone. Should that ever come to pass and a \"no\" vote win \u2014 returning Italy to the lira as its currency \u2014 German economist Wolfgang Munchau, writing in the Financial Times, predicts a devastating outcome: \"An Italian exit from the single currency would trigger the total collapse of the Eurozone within a very short period.\" He also warns: \"It would probably lead to the most violent economic shock in history, dwarfing the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in 2008 and the 1929 Wall Street crash.\" To prevent this worst-case scenario, Munchau writes, EU leaders should finally tackle the underlying causes of the bloc's numerous crises and radically transform the EU, including a blueprint for more \u2014 not less \u2014 political union of the eurozone countries and more equitable burden-sharing among the entire bloc. But many Europeans are wondering whether EU officials in Brussels have really heard the Brexit wake-up call.",

Elizabeth Warren at a news conference earlier this year urging Senate Republicans to confirm President Obama's Supreme Court nominee.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Elizabeth Warren at a news conference earlier this year urging Senate Republicans to confirm President Obama's Supreme Court nominee. One of the most talked about politicians this election year is a woman who is not even on the ballot \u2014 Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. As her name is being thrown around as a possible VP pick for Hillary Clinton, there's an argument to be made that Warren doesn't even need the job. Plenty of her colleagues say she already exerts enormous influence from her perch in the Senate. Warren may not be running for president, but right now there's probably no one in the Democratic Party who takes more delight in publicly ripping into Donald Trump. And Trump has ripped right back into her, calling her \"Pocahontas\" and saying she's an ineffective senator with a \"big mouth.\" At a gala for the Center for Popular Democracy this week, she summed up the billionaire with words that instantly went viral: \"A small, insecure money grubber who doesn't care who gets hurts so long as he makes a profit.\" Warren hammered Trump for saying in 2007 that he was excited for the housing market to collapse so he could make a lot of money. \"What kind of man does that?\" Warren exclaimed. \"What kind of man roots for people to get thrown out of their house? What kind of man roots for people to get thrown out of their jobs? To root for people to lose their pensions? ... It is a man that cares about no one but himself.\" If it sounds like it's getting personal, check out Warren's Twitter feed \u2014 where she's already called Trump a sexist, racist, xenophobic \"bully.\" All this has clearly gotten under Trump's skin \u2014 he couldn't resist hitting back in Anaheim on Wednesday. \"I call her goofy. She is ... goofy,\" Trump said. \"She gets less done than anybody in the United States Senate. She gets nothing done, nothing passed. She's got a big mouth, and that's about it. But they use her because Hillary's trying to be very presidential.\" An Outspoken Messenger Who 'Doesn't Talk Very Much' Warren has become one of the most aggressive anti-Trump voices in her party. But inside the Senate hallways, she doesn't behave like a woman who wants to be heard. She doesn't talk very much. But when she talks, people listen. Democratic Leader Harry Reid She's famous for avoiding reporters in the Capitol. She dashes through the building avoiding eye contact with them. Most of the Capitol Hill reporters have fallen in line and don't even try asking her questions in the hallways anymore. The ones who do dare venture up to her often find a Warren aide suddenly wedging in and explaining that the senator isn't available to talk at the moment. Because Warren is a woman who holds the press at arm's length, it might have seemed a touch ironic when Democratic Leader Harry Reid chose her to be the messenger for the progressive wing of the party. Warren stepped into that leadership position barely two years into her first term. Reid said Warren is simply strategic about when to speak. \"She's an effective messenger because, No. 1, she doesn't talk very much,\" said Reid. \"I find \u2014 maybe I'm being judgmental \u2014 but I think when people talk too much, their message is lost. She doesn't talk very much. But when she talks, people listen.\" Launching Causes Reid says even during internal caucus meetings, Warren is very quiet. She speaks up with her colleagues only in deliberate moments. \"People think she's a big talker. She isn't,\" said Reid. \"In our caucus, I have some people who raise their hands all the time. They want to be recognized. But not Elizabeth.\" And her supporters say that strategic use of her influence has made her a powerful validator in the caucus \u2014 someone who can breathe new life into a cause simply by jumping on, whether it's Wall Street reform, expanding Social Security or reducing student debt. Senate Democratic leaders say Warren took a lead role on the issue of student debt especially. \"She can take an issue and launch it into the stratosphere,\" said Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, who crafted a student loan bill with her. \"You can be working on it and it can be important and you can be right. But when Elizabeth comes to the table, you know it's about to be ready for takeoff.\" Influence As A Fundraiser She doesn't just launch issues. Democrats say she can also launch candidates. Warren is one of the top fundraisers in her caucus. During the 2014 midterms, she raked in more than $6 million for Democratic Senate, House and gubernatorial candidates and party committees. This election cycle, Warren's Leadership PAC has given away about a quarter-million dollars; her office says that amount represents just a small portion of her overall fundraising efforts so far, which include fundraising events, campaign appearances and \u2014 most important \u2014 emails. Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said unlike many senators, Warren can instantly activate a vast national network every time she hits send on an email. \"It doesn't take much of her time to send out an email that raises $25,000 each for three U.S. Senate candidates, something that would take those candidates weeks to do,\" said Green. Democrats say they have a shot at taking back control of the Senate this year, and their candidates hope Warren's light will make them shine. They invoke her name in emails, want her on the campaign trail and run ads featuring her singing their praises. There's no question, Warren has emerged as one of 2016's biggest influencers. And now she is perceived as the person who can best unify Clinton's supporters with those of Bernie Sanders. But there's one big question she never quite answers. What is Elizabeth Warren's endgame? \"I think her main goal is to be a good senator from Massachusetts. I don't think she has aspirations beyond that,\" Reid said. I wonder what Elizabeth Warren would say to that \u2014 if she ever talked to me.",

            "article_content": "Sunil Puri arrived from Mumbai in 1979 with $150 and a high school diploma to his name. He worked his way through college and now he is a real estate developer who contributes heavily to charities and political campaigns.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: We're going to meet a man now, a real estate developer from Rockford, Ill. He came to this country with $150 in his pocket. He's now one of the most influential businessmen in northern Illinois. The path he took in the U.S. helps explain his view of what it means to be an American. And we're hearing his story as part of our election year series A Nation Engaged. Here's Susan Stephens of member station WNIJ. SUSAN STEPHENS, BYLINE: When you step into Sunil Puri's corner office on the top floor of one of his buildings on the east side of Rockford, Ill., the first thing you notice is not the wall-to-wall view of the rolling golf course. It's the pictures on the walls. SUNIL PURI: I mean everything from Fidel up there to when the president was visiting my mom back in Bombay. STEPHENS: Every inch of wall space is covered with framed 8-by-10s of familiar faces, mostly recent presidents smiling alongside Puri and his family. PURI: This is us at the Y2K night when the kids were so little, and they've got their little tuxedoes on. STEPHENS: They're the trophies of a fortune earned over three decades as a developer here and a testament to a fortune spent backing his favorite politicians and local charities. The 56-year-old with the brushed-back black hair looks the part of the successful businessman dressed in a dark conservative suit with a slightly less conservative tie, smiling and talking a mile a minute. He's come a long way since 1979 when he left Mumbai right after high school to visit family here in the Rockford area. PURI: I just was one of those rebels who believed in the promise called America. And not with much permission from my parents, with very limited funds and resources, ended up coming to America. STEPHENS: Puri stayed and he worked every job he could from pouring concrete to cleaning nursing home bedpans to put himself through the accounting program at Rockford University. He says he was warmly embraced here by elderly Swedes who helped him with his English, by families who included him in their holiday celebrations, by fellow students who wanted to learn more about his culture. PURI: These were people who opened up their homes and their arms and their hearts to immigrants. And what has happened? Why are we so xenophobic all of a sudden? That's what made America great. That welcoming is what has built bridges far greater than any money, power or weapons can ever buy. It's people. STEPHENS: Puri we won't talk about his preferences in this presidential election. A glance at the office photos shows him posing with Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. Campaign contribution records show donations to Democrats, Republicans and independents. Sunil Puri wants America's next president to focus on bolstering the middle class by investing in what he calls the country's biggest strength. It's young people. He says being an American is about doing your part for your own community. For the wealthy, that means being compassionate. PURI: You're not going to be taking this money to the Moon or to the Mars. You're still going to be sharing the same Earth with the same people that also deserve to have a decent lifestyle. STEPHENS: Puri believes strongly in investing in the middle, the middle class, the middle of the country, the political middle with the hopes more people will get the same chance he got as an immigrant here 37 years ago.

            "article_content": "As expected, Hillary Clinton won the Mississippi primary. Michigan was the bigger prize and polls leading into the primary had Clinton up by double digits, but that's not how it turned out.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Voters delivered a surprise last night. Michigan gave a Democratic primary win to Bernie Sanders. DAVID GREENE, HOST: He narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton despite polls that showed him far behind. That was just one result on a night when Clinton also won Mississippi, not to mention Republican wins for Donald Trump and also Ted Cruz. INSKEEP: Let's focus on the Democratic results now with NPR's national political correspondent, Mara Liasson, who's been covering all of this for many months. Mara, good morning. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: Can you put last night's Democratic results into one sentence? LIASSON: Yes. Bernie Sanders once again exposes Hillary Clinton's potential weaknesses as a general election candidate. GREENE: OK, there's the summary. We're going to talk much more about that, Mara. But - and we'll expand on that. Let's hear a little bit from the candidates and also from some of their advisers first. NPR's Tamara Keith has been covering the campaign. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: If elections are about expectations and momentum, then Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders won the night last night. Hillary Clinton won the primary as expected in Mississippi by an overwhelming margin. But Michigan was the biggest prize. And polls leading into the primary had Clinton up by double digits. That's not how it turned out, not even close. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BERNIE SANDERS: I just want to take this opportunity to thank the people of Michigan, who kind of repudiated the polls that had us 20, 25 points down a few days ago. KEITH: That was Bernie Sanders at almost 11 o'clock last night. He had given a speech hours earlier. But he was back to make a statement after it was clear voters in Michigan were making a statement of their own. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SANDERS: What tonight means is that the Bernie Sanders campaign, the people's - the revolution - the people's revolution that we are talking about, the political revolution that we are talking about is strong in every part of the country. KEITH: In the final tally, Sanders won Michigan by 2 percentage points, a margin of about 20,000 votes out of a million cast. Exit polls indicate Sanders' message about international trade deals hurting American workers resonated with Michigan voters. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SANDERS: And frankly, we believe that our strongest areas are yet to happen. KEITH: Sanders' campaign sent out a fundraising email celebrating the win and asking his supporters to pitch in just a little bit more. If history is a guide, this win will help Sanders raise millions of dollars in a matter of hours. And that money will help him compete and run TV ads in the next states on the election calendar - Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, Missouri and Ohio. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: Thank you so much. Hello, Cleveland. Hello, Ohio. KEITH: Long before the results were in, Hillary Clinton, her campaign sensing Michigan wasn't going their way, spoke to supporters in Cleveland. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: This will be a busy week here in Ohio. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: And this campaign is about building a future where every American can live up to his or her full potential. KEITH: For the Clinton campaign, losing to Sanders in Michigan is a speed bump, one they certainly would rather have avoided. But as Clinton's team sees it, this race isn't about momentum or expectations or even about wins. It's about delegates. And in that respect, Clinton didn't actually lose last night. She pulled further ahead. With her 66-point win in Mississippi and her close second in Michigan, she ended the night winning more pledged delegates than Sanders. As she spoke last night, it was clear that Clinton has one eye on Sanders but the other on Donald Trump. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: Now, running for president shouldn't be about delivering insults. It should be about delivering results for the American people. KEITH: The delegate math remains in Clinton's favor. But Sanders' campaign adviser, Tad Devine, says this is a marathon not a sprint. He described the campaign strategy over the weekend to Politico reporter Glenn Thrush in his podcast called \"Off Message.\" (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"OFF MESSAGE\") TAD DEVINE: We're going to try to beat her in pledged delegates. We think we've got until the end of the process to do that. We think we have - it's going to be hard. It's going to be tough. We know we have to win to get it done. But we think we can. KEITH: And after their stunning come-from-behind win in Michigan, it's a whole lot harder to tell them they can't. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Tamara Keith on the Democratic results from the primaries last night. GREENE: And we were listening to that with NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson, who's still on the line. And Mara, Tamara just suggested the Clinton campaign is hoping that Michigan is just a speed bump. But you said a few moments ago that you see that state and Bernie Sanders' win exposing some potential weaknesses for Hillary Clinton. What are the weaknesses? LIASSON: Well, I think that what it says is if she loses to a Democratic populist in Michigan, why wouldn't she lose to a Republican populist in Michigan in November? I mean, that's the whole Donald Trump argument. I can scramble the map. I can win in places that he says no, quote, \"normal Republican\" can win in. I can carry Michigan in the fall. I can do the same in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, et cetera. And I think it does expose her weaknesses. Populism is a very, very strong sentiment in the electorate in both parties. INSKEEP: Now, in order to get to that general election for either candidate of course, they've got to win their party's nomination. And we just heard something interesting from a Sanders adviser that I want to translate. He said we're going to try to beat Hillary in pledged delegates. He's saying he wants to disregard these superdelegates, who have nearly all gone for Hillary Clinton and given her a huge advantage in the total number of delegates. Is it even mathematically possible, at this point, for Sanders' side to get a majority just of the pledged delegates and make some kind of a case at the convention that he ought to be the nominee? LIASSON: Well, he has to win a very, very big percentage of the pledged delegates, over 50 percent, going forward if he's going to do that. And if he starts beating her in pledged delegates by large amounts, superdelegates will switch. We saw this happen in 2008, when Hillary Clinton was also ahead in superdelegates. But when Barack Obama started winning primaries, the superdelegates moved over. GREENE: Mara, if you can, let's turn to one issue. I want to play you a bit of tape from a Democratic pollster, Margie Omero, who spoke to us a little bit earlier on the program this morning. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) MARGIE OMERO: I was surprised to see trade be so salient, frankly. It's something that's pretty complicated and dense and different for every voter and how they experience it. But it may be important, particularly in the Midwest. And the results from last night may portend what we are going to see next week in some of the other contests. GREENE: Bernie Sanders' message - sort of talking about the downside of free trade seemed to really resonate with Democrats in the state of Michigan. Is that something that Sanders can try and capitalize on in other states in the Midwest and elsewhere? LIASSON: Well, absolutely. I think this sets him up very nicely for Ohio. What he's saying is, now I proved that I can win in a diverse state. Michigan is a state where the Democratic primary electorate is more like the national electorate. In other words, it has a lot of white voters but not a hugely disproportionate number of African-American voters. He can say that the Michigan electorate is more representative than the Democratic electorate in, say, Mississippi or South Carolina or any of the Southern states where she wins by huge amounts. So I think this really sets him up well for Ohio. And I think it would give the Clinton campaign some pause. INSKEEP: Now, let's bring in another factor here and also talk a little bit about the Republicans because you mentioned Donald Trump appealing to a certain kind of voter, Sanders perhaps appealing to the same kind of voter. Does Hillary Clinton have the same power was the question you raised. We're told that Sanders won white working-class voters in Michigan. We're told that Trump appeals to white working-class voters. The question is, who are those people really? Let's listen from earlier today to Republican consultant John Feehery as well as Democrat Margi Omero again. JOHN FEEHERY: Interesting that both Bernie and Trump are going for those same voters. And I think that they're doing better than expected in both parties. OMERO: You know, I cringe when I hear comparisons between Trump and Sanders. I mean, Trump is using just hateful language. I think it's something that Republicans should worry about. I think we should all be worrying about him becoming a nominee and what that means for our political process. Meanwhile, I don't think the same is true. Obviously, the same is not true for Sanders. INSKEEP: What do the numbers suggest about whether Trump and Sanders really are appealing to the same kinds of people? LIASSON: Well, I think there is some overlap. And I think this is what Donald Trump is saying he can do in the fall. He can say he can bring in white working-class voters who either have never voted before, have voted for Democrats or they're independents. And that's why he's saying that he can win in November using these same issues. Now, he is certainly not - doesn't have the same message as Bernie Sanders, is much more nativist, much more xenophobic. But he is trying to temper it. Every so often, Donald Trump tries to sound more unifying, note, less belligerent and, you know, with varying degrees of success. But that's clearly his general election strategy. GREENE: Mara, heading into this night, I mean, we had - the stop Trump campaign in full force, led by Mitt Romney and others, seemed on its face to backfire. But if you are a Republican and you do not want Donald Trump to be the nominee, is there anything you can look to last night that would give you some sort of hope? LIASSON: Not much. I think there were some glimmers of hope over the weekend. But the only thing I think a Never Trump person could look to is that now even more money - many, many millions of dollars - are going to be spent against him next week in Ohio and Illinois and Florida. And maybe that will be kind of the last experiment of the Never Trump movement, to see if this negative advertising actually does slow him down. But I think if you're a Never Trump person, you have to be looking pretty hard at Ted Cruz. INSKEEP: Just one - just about 10 seconds here. And this is just one poll, but there was an NBC poll finding that all of Trump's challengers would beat him if it were a head-to-head race. Is there still a large ambivalence among the Republican electorate, not the leaders - in about 10 seconds - about Trump? LIASSON: Well, sure because for every new white working-class voter he brings in, he turns off a suburban college-educated woman and energizes 15 Hispanics. INSKEEP: OK. LIASSON: And that's why there's doubts. INSKEEP: Mara, thanks as always. LIASSON: Thank you. INSKEEP: That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson, talking through the Democratic results primarily last night. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump and running mate Mike Pence both addressed the Values Voter Summit in Washington, D.C. Attendees say they are hesitant about supporting Trump but say they strongly oppose Hillary Clinton.  RAY SUAREZ, HOST: Now to another big story of the day here in Washington. Social conservatives are gathering for the 2016 Values Voter Summit. Many conservative Christian leaders were slow to endorse Donald Trump or publicly struggled with the idea of Trump at the top of the GOP ticket. But social conservatives look to be rallying around the nominee and perhaps even more so against Hillary Clinton. NPR's Sarah McCammon has been traveling with the Trump campaign this week and covered him at the summit. Sarah, thanks for joining us. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: You're welcome. SUAREZ: Donald Trump addressed the summit Friday. And we'll get to his remarks a little later, but I want to begin with his running mate's comments today because Indiana Governor Mike Pence used his address to the Values Voters Summit to swing back at some controversial comments by Hillary Clinton. MCCAMMON: That's right. And Hillary Clinton is getting some flak for something. She's actually been saying something like this for a couple of weeks, talking about separating Trump voters into categories, into baskets - one of them being deplorables - what she describes as racists, homophobes, xenophobes, among other things. But last night at a fundraiser in New York City, she said half are in the basket called deplorables. She said that she regrets it, but the Trump campaign is jumping on it, sending out multiple statements and tweets about this. And here's what Mike Pence said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MIKE PENCE: So let me just say from the bottom of my heart. Hillary, they are not a basket of anything. They are Americans, and they deserve your respect. (APPLAUSE) MCCAMMON: So, as you can hear, he got on a lot of applause for that line, and he linked that comment to a famous gaffe by President Obama when Obama was running in 2008, when he talked about small-town voters clinging to guns and religion. The Trump campaign is characterizing Clinton's comments as evidence of what they say is her disdain for average Americans. SUAREZ: Mike Pence is a social conservative himself. His presence at the gathering, the Values Voters Summit makes perfect sense. How was Donald Trump received? MCCAMMON: Well, like you said, at the beginning a lot of religious conservatives struggled with Trump's tone, his multiple marriages and also his policies, like his past support for abortion rights. But now, you know, evangelicals are overwhelmingly Republican voting bloc, and Hillary Clinton is very unpopular with them. So there's been a lot of talk at this summit about how elections are choices, and many people here see Trump as the best choice. Peter Wypynszinski came to the summit from New Orleans, and here's how he put it to me. PETER WYPYNSZINSKI: I think Trump is a clear and distinct alternative to Hillary Clinton, and while I don't necessarily line up philosophically with everything that he stands for, Hillary Clinton lines up philosophically with everything that I stand against. MCCAMMON: So that's the kind of thing I've been hearing. SUAREZ: In Trump's remarks Friday night, he criticized the Johnson Amendment. Now more than 60 years old, a provision of the tax code prohibiting tax exempt organizations like churches from getting too far into electoral politics. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: If they want to talk about Christianity, if they want to preach, if they want to talk about politics, they're unable to do so. If they want to do it, they take a tremendous risk that they lose their tax-exempt status. SUAREZ: Well, that might not be exactly right. They don't take a tremendous risk if they want to preach and talk about Christianity. But they do put their tax-exempt status in jeopardy if they campaign from the pulpit. Donald Trump wants to do away with the Johnson Amendment, doesn't he? MCCAMMON: Right. He wants to get rid of it altogether, and this is something he's been stressing for months in front of evangelical audiences. But, you know, it's not clear what it would mean to actually get rid of that. He'd have to get it through Congress, which might be a challenge. But the rule is actually rarely enforced. The IRS does occasionally enforce it and certainly has the power to enforce it. And it also - as you say - it doesn't prevent pastors from speaking from the pulpit or about issues, about morality and even from endorsing candidates as individuals. So it wouldn't change what pastors can do on their own time, though, it would give them more latitude to talk explicitly about politics and political candidates from the pulpit of their church. SUAREZ: Hillary Clinton has called herself for a long time an old-fashioned Methodist then has written and spoken about the impact of church teachings on her life and her profession as a public servant politician. How does her faith identity compare to Donald Trump's and do the people at something like the Values Voters Summit accept her Christian bona fides? MCCAMMON: You know, neither Clinton nor Trump come from the evangelical tradition which a lot of people at the Values Voter Summit do. It tends to be a bit more open and expressive and emotional about publicly talking about faith. Faith is often described as a relationship with God in the evangelical tradition, whereas mainline Protestant churches like Methodists, like Hillary Clinton, Presbyterians, like Donald Trump's tradition, tend to be a bit more restrained, a little more private about the way they talk about faith and spirituality. So it's kind of a cultural difference and really neither Trump nor Clinton are entirely fluent in the language and culture of evangelical Christianity. But Trump needs to reach out to these conservative Christian voters because they are such an important part of his party's base. SUAREZ: That's NPR's Sarah McCammon who's been traveling with the Trump campaign. Sarah, thanks. MCCAMMON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks Monday at a rally at Valdosta State University in Valdosta, Ga.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Harnik/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks Monday at a rally at Valdosta State University in Valdosta, Ga. Last year, The Huffington Post assigned stories on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to the entertainment section, seeing him as a buffoonish diversion. It now appears to view Trump as a threat, attaching an editor's note to the end of every article about him to inform readers he \"is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully.\" The website's lurching approach is just one of the more visible ways in which journalists are wrestling with how to characterize Donald Trump's rhetoric. A growing chorus of critics contend that the outspoken billionaire has relied on an undercurrent of racism to propel him to front-runner status in the Republican presidential primaries. Prominent Republicans have added their voices to the fray in recent days, including 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who tweeted that Trump was \"coddling bigotry,\" and House Speaker Paul Ryan, who warned his party did not tolerate prejudice. It is harder for journalists to employ such cutting terms. \"I am not one, especially in news stories, to advocate using loaded language,\" says Jill Abramson, the former executive editor of The New York Times. \"Certainly labeling a candidate a racist or a demagogue \u2014 those are loaded terms.\" Abramson says Trump's words often contain evidence of both racism and demagoguery. Instead of applying labels to Trump, however, Abramson advocates that reporters pursue context unrelentingly: \"When he says something that is clearly bigoted or racially tinged, it's important to ... press the Trump campaign on what evidence he bases the sometimes outrageous things he has said.\" Abramson also argues reporters should convey how Trump's speeches and remarks often echo earlier, ugly eras in American politics \u2014 such as the 1976 presidential campaign of former Alabama Gov. George Wallace, which Abramson says she covered as a young reporter. Journalists readily have committed themselves to shining light on the times when Trump makes blatantly false statements; indeed, fact-checkers have had a field day. In November, for example, CBS's Nancy Cordes pointed out he tweeted a statistic that most whites who are murdered were killed by blacks. \"Actually, the opposite is true,\" she told viewers. When Trump advocated that all Muslims be barred from entering the United States because of the deadly intentions of Muslim terrorists, it generated days of coverage, but proved a more complicated topic. Many critics pointed to that position as bigotry because it singled people out for their faith. Journalists often ask Trump about his beliefs, but many journalists resist the urge to make explicit characterizations about his statements themselves, no doubt informed by a tradition that reporters are not supposed to take sides. \"I am the least racist person that you have ever met,\" Trump told CNN's Don Lemon in December, after being asked whether he was a racist, a bigot or an Islamophobe. \"I am a person who happens to be very smart. I happen to have a certain street sense. And I know where things are going.\" Trump's critics point to a long list of outrages in making the case he is a bigot. For example, Trump was the nation's most prominent birther, questioning President Obama's citizenship and eligibility for the White House. In announcing his campaign, Trump declared Mexico is sending drugs and crime and rapists across the border into this country. Trump praised the internment of Japanese-Americans in camps during World War II. And the Trump campaign seems to flirt with extremist groups. In one recent instance, it granted full press credentials to radio talk show host James Edwards, a white supremacist, who then claimed he had conducted an interview with Donald Trump Jr. for broadcast. The campaign told reporters the younger Trump believed he had not done so. \"Look at how he responds to criticism,\" says Michelle Jaconi, a former senior news executive at CNN who is now executive editor of the conservative social media site Independent Journal. \"He says, 'I'm comfortable being associated with controversial quotes.' ... Shock is part of his M.O.\" Jaconi says Trump is a master of using political language as code to appeal to an audience that the news media often approaches with condescension. \"He's stripped that apart just to say, 'Are you more sick of media and voices and pundits labeling me \u2014 and aren't you refreshed to hear somebody just calling it like it is?' \" Jaconi says. \" 'Are you more sick of political correctness, or bad language?' \" Distrust of elite media and political figures runs so deep among the voters Trump is targeting, Jaconi says, that journalists who do call him a racist or demagogue are dismissed. Last week, Trump disavowed public statements of support from former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. On Sunday, however, CNN's Jake Tapper raised the question once more. Trump hedged: \"I don't know anything about David Duke, OK? I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists.\" After the show Trump again disavowed Duke, but liberal HBO satirist John Oliver said the public had learned something about Trump. \"With an answer like that, you are either racist, or you are pretending to be,\" Oliver said. \"And at some point, there is no difference there.\" Of course, as Oliver takes great pains to say, he's no journalist \u2014 just a comedian.",

            "article_content": "Michel Martin talks with NPR's Mike Oreskes, Huffington Post's Ryan Grim and Christian Broadcasting Network's David Brody about Donald Trump and how he's leading politics to increasingly bypass media as gatekeepers.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: We want to spend a few more minutes on Politics. And you cannot have missed, unless you were seriously committed to not paying attention, that the big political and journalism story of the last week was that Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner, bypassed the last debate before the Iowa caucuses because he objected to the participation of moderator Megyn Kelly as well a press release defending her, apparently authored by Fox president Roger Ailes. Beyond the Trump tantrum, we wondered if this had something bigger to say about the state of the media and politics and how politics is practiced today. So to talk about all this, we've called our media panel back together. With us today is Ryan Grim, Washington bureau chief for The Huffington Post. Welcome back, thanks for coming. RYAN GRIM: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: And NPR's own editorial director Michael Oreskes. He's the senior vice president of news. Thanks so much for walking down the hall, Michael. MICHAEL ORESKES, BYLINE: Great to be here in your studio. MARTIN: Also back with us, David Brody. He's the chief political correspondent for CBN News. That's the Christian Broadcasting Network. He joins us from Iowa Public Radio in Des Moines. David Brody, good to talk with you again. DAVID BRODY: Michel, always a pleasure. MARTIN: So let me start off by getting your take on just the whole question from the media standpoint. Why was Donald Trump's decision not to participate in the Fox debate such a big deal? GRIM: Well, it's not done. You know, these are party-sanctioned debates. This is a presidential election, you show up at the debates. These are the rules. We have a series of unwritten rules of how campaigns are run, and everybody has followed those rules consistently over the decades. And no one has really even seriously thought about breaking them. MARTIN: David, what about you? Was it a big story for you as well? BRODY: Well, it was. Ryan makes an interesting point. He calls it unwritten rules, and that's exactly right. I mean, Donald Trump is rewriting those rules. And I think that's what's frustrating a lot of folks, not just in the media but, you know, Donald Trump marches to the beat of his own drum. Is it a risk? Yes. But you know what? At this point, he's undefeated. MARTIN: Mike, let me ask you about - there was a two-part issue to Trump's decision that he said. One was he said he didn't think Megyn Kelly had been fair to him. But he also talked about Fox's response to this. And multiple sources have said that this was authored by Roger Ailes himself. He said, we learned from a secret back channel that the ayatollah and Putin both intend to treat Donald Trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president. A nefarious source tells us that Trump has his own secret plan to replace the cabinet with his Twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings. Was that an appropriate response? Because for a lot of people, this is a serious issue for a candidate to decide who is allowed to ask him questions. ORESKES: I would separate it into two things. It is absolutely appropriate for the news organization to stand up for their journalist. And in that, Roger and I would be indivisible. In that sense, that response was totally appropriate. It used a lot of language that sounded more like a political consultant then a head of a news organization. And that's a judgment that I would not recommend that tone if you're representing a news organization. MARTIN: So back to you, Ryan Grim. This past week, The Huffington Post made a new change in the way you cover Trump. You just started including a note at the bottom of every political story on Trump that reads, \"note to our readers - Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who was repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims - 1.6 million members of an entire religion - from entering the U.S.,\" unquote. What's that about? GRIM: Well, the thinking there is that we write an awful lot of stories about Donald Trump. And you can't pack everything into every single story. And so we settled on this. We said well, let's have some boilerplate language that accurately describes the candidate that we're talking about. If readers are unfamiliar, here are the descriptions of his behavior and here are the links to that behavior that is described. MARTIN: I mean, I see - you see it as context. GRIM: Right. MARTIN: Because I think other people would see it is editorializing... GRIM: Sure. MARTIN: ...Or name-calling. GRIM: Sure. I - it is describing a phenomenon. But then we link to the evidence to back up why we think it is this. But I do think there is a strange idea that the media has that if you tell the public what you think, they can no longer think for themselves. MARTIN: Let me bring David Brody back here. David Brody, you've interviewed Donald Trump a number of times. Can I ask you a tough question, though? BRODY: Sure. MARTIN: I mean, one of the reasons I think that Donald Trump has been a popular figure, he's very available to the media. But he also has a reputation for and has a history of attacking people when he thinks they're not sufficiently deferential to him. I think that's clear. So do you feel that you have to be somewhat deferential to him in order to maintain that access? BRODY: No, not at all. I would say though that my philosophy and why we've scored a lot of big interviews is because I think you get more with honey than vinegar. And so, you know, a lot of people have this mentality where you have to ask the really, really tough questions. And - but what happens is they actually tighten up, and they don't give you what you want. Instead, I'll ask the same question that others will ask of candidates. The difference is I'll do it in a bless-your-heart sort of way. You know, in the South when they say, you know, you look horrible in that dress, bless your heart. And it sounds nice, but actually it's trying to get the same result. MARTIN: So let's talk to the whole question of what the result is of this last week and what your assessment of this is. Did Trump win this one or not? GRIM: I think he did. And you have to also put in context that we're a couple days out from Iowa. So the debates that this one is competing against are much earlier in the season, when you presume that tension would be much dimmer. MARTIN: David Brody, do you have an opinion about that? BRODY: Yeah, I 100 percent agree. I would just add also it played to Donald Trump's brand, which is, you know, strength. I'm going to do things on my terms. And, you know, I think a lot of this - and this has a media component to it for sure - is that they've tried to control Donald Trump. And he hasn't been able - you know, he's not going to play that game. MARTIN: Mike Oreskes, I too want to ask about the bigger question here that this really speaks to the weakness of the media and really the political organizations... ORESKES: Right. MARTIN: ...At this moment in history. ORESKES: Right. MARTIN: Do you feel that way, and if so why? ORESKES: I do. I mean, I think you see both CNN and Fox commercializing these events and using them to drive their own audiences, which is fine from their business point of view. But I don't know that that's the best thing for either journalism or for the country. I actually would like to see debates in the primaries treated the way the presidential debates are treated, which is take them out of the hands of the journalists. I don't really think we need to be running those things. MARTIN: So how should they hear from the candidates? I want to note at this point that Ted Cruz is trying to have a one-on-one debate with Donald Trump. ORESKES: Yeah. MARTIN: I don't know that journalists would be even involved in that. Does this signal kind of the beginning of the end of journalistic influence over these debates? Ryan. GRIM: I do think whatever the short-term gain for Trump might've been by skipping the Fox debate, it was also kind of - it could become a landmark moment. He has now showed the media that he doesn't need them and that he has the people behind him. You know, if that evolves in certain ways, it could be quite dangerous. MARTIN: That was Ryan Grim, Washington bureau chief for The Huffington Post. David Brody is chief political correspondent for Christian Broadcasting Network. He joined us from Iowa Public Radio in Des Moines and NPR's own editorial director Michael Oreskes, who's here with us. He's also senior vice president of news. Thank you all so much for speaking with us. ORESKES: Thank you, Michel. GRIM: Thanks for having me. BRODY: Michel, a pleasure. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.
