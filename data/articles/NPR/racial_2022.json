ISTANBUL \u2014 A Turkish court decision this month to sentence Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu to prison and bar him from politics for more than two years is proving unpopular. Critics say the ruling, handed down last Wednesday after the court convicted Imamoglu of insulting public officials, clearly favors President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his ruling Justice and Development Party, known by the acronym AKP. The decision came as Erdogan's popularity remains low ahead of next year's presidential contest. It signals a potentially intense campaign season ahead, with Erdogan playing to his conservative, religious base of supporters. Elections must take place by June 23. Hundreds of people took to the streets to protest Imamoglu's prison sentence and political ban. Former Erdogan ally and former Turkish President Abdullah Gul said, \"The court's decision is a great injustice not only against Ekrem Imamoglu but also against Turkey. The will of the people is above all. I believe that the higher courts will correct this mistake.\" Analysts say Imamoglu would clearly be among the strongest challengers to Erdogan's bid for another term in office, even though the mayor has never announced his candidacy for the presidency. Imamoglu called the court's decision a \"disgrace for the Turkish judiciary,\" saying it was \"the firmest expression of the fact that the judiciary has been transformed into an instrument to punish dissidents.\" As a politician from Turkey's main secular party, the Republican People's Party, Imamoglu's surprise victory in the 2019 Istanbul mayoral race was seen as the biggest blow to the AKP since Erdogan rose to power, first as Turkey's prime minister, and then as its first president with strong executive powers. The charges against Imamoglu stemmed from comments he made to the media in 2019, in which he described those responsible for canceling the first round of municipal elections, which he won, as \"fools.\" He went on to win the next round decisively. The mayor's supporters say he has been a favorite target of Erdogan and the AKP ever since he shocked some in the establishment with his 2019 mayoral victory. Critics allege that Turkey's judiciary over the years has been refashioned into a frequently pro-Erdogan body. The government insists the judiciary has been and will remain independent.

Some 62% of respondents called the ruling a political decision, rather than legal one. The Biden administration deplored the ruling, with State Department spokesperson Ned Price saying in a statement that the conviction \"is inconsistent with respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law.\" Price's statement went on to say that the administration remains \"gravely concerned by the continued judicial harassment of civil society, media, political and business leaders in Turkey, including through prolonged pretrial detention, overly broad claims of support for terrorism, and criminal insult cases.\" The head of TUSIAD, Turkey's largest business association, also criticized the sentence, saying political bans \"have no place in a democratic society.\" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attends a Justice and Development Party event in Mardin, Turkey, on Saturday.\n                \n                    \n                    Mustafa Kamaci/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attends a Justice and Development Party event in Mardin, Turkey, on Saturday.

JERUSALEM \u2014 Voting ended Tuesday night after Israelis went to the polls in their fifth election in 3 1/2 years. Initial exit polls are projecting a slim parliamentary majority for former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right and religious allies. But as the votes are counted, Netanyahu could lose that advantage and a stalemate may emerge between Netanyahu's allies and parties opposed to Netanyahu \u2014 especially if Balad, a small nationalist Arab party, manages to get enough votes to enter parliament and tip the scales away from Netanyahu's bloc. \"It's not over. It depends on whether Balad will make it,\" Likud lawmaker Miki Zohar told Israeli Channel 13. Israeli television exit polls projected Netanyahu and his allies winning a one- or two-seat majority in the 120-seat parliament, which would unseat centrist Prime Minister Yair Lapid. Israeli election officials said voter turnout was 71.3%. People cast their votes for the 2022 Israeli legislative election at a polling station in Tel Aviv on Tuesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Nir Keidar / Anadolu Agency / Getty Images)\n                    \n                \nhide caption People cast their votes for the 2022 Israeli legislative election at a polling station in Tel Aviv on Tuesday. Israel's political map is split down the middle between parties that want populist nationalist icon Netanyahu in power, and parties that say the polarizing figure on trial for corruption is unfit to serve. A diverse coalition unseated Netanyahu last year, but it broke up this year over ideological differences. If no candidate can form a 61-lawmaker majority in the 120-member parliament, Lapid will remain a caretaker leader and elections will be held yet again. Polls show no easy path to victory for Lapid or other anti-Netanyahu candidates. Lapid campaigned with center-left allies, arguing he would keep right-wing extremism at bay. Netanyahu promised to bring Israelis a sense of security, after Palestinians killed 25 Israeli civilians and soldiers this year. Israeli troops have killed more than 130 Palestinian militants and civilians during the same period, the deadliest toll in several years. If Netanyahu wins, he could form a government with religious and far-right partners, including parties that promote hostile policies against Palestinian Arab citizens, anti-LGBTQ sentiment and proposals to weaken the independence of the judiciary \u2014 which could help Netanyahu escape conviction in his corruption trial. \"The right side don't like gay people, don't like Arabs,\" says Liron Gur, a gay Israeli voter. \"I believe if they will be the power, my life will be very bad.\" At a polling station in Jerusalem where Netanyahu cast his ballot, some right-wing voters said they were abandoning support this time for Netanyahu and his right-wing allies. \"We don't believe him,\" says cab driver Udi Avni, who for the first time is not voting for Netanyahu and says he'll cast his vote for the center-left Labor Party instead. \"He just care[s] about himself. About his trial ... to be free.\" \"It's too right-wing at the moment,\" says Reuben Rotenberg about the main religious party running for election. It's a tight race. It could take weeks before there is a clear winner, as parties negotiate to form a parliamentary majority. Natan Odenheimer contributed to this story from Jerusalem.",

Accused assailant David Wayne DePape faces felony charges \u2014 assault and attempted kidnapping of an immediate family member of a U.S. official \u2014 which could land him in prison for a maximum of 50 years. The Justice Department has filed federal felony charges against the man who broke into House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's San Francisco home and allegedly attacked her husband with a hammer. The accused could face a maximum of 50 years in prison in last Friday's attack. David Wayne DePape faces two felony charges after allegedly breaking into the Pelosi home: one count of assault of an immediate family member of a United States official with the intent to retaliate against the official on account of the performance of official duties, which could bring a maximum prison sentence of 30 years; and one count of attempted kidnapping of a U.S. official on account of the performance of official duties, which could bring a maximum of 20 years. Police responded to a 911 call from Paul Pelosi last Friday, according to the Department of Justice, after the 82-year-old woke to an intruder in his bedroom. DePape, a 42-year-old from the San Francisco Bay Area, and Paul Pelosi were mid-struggle over a hammer when officers arrived. Officers said the suspect gained control of the weapon, striking Paul Pelosi in the head, knocking him unconscious. Police recovered a roll of tape, white rope, a second hammer, a pair of rubber and cloth gloves and zip ties from the crime scene, according to the DOJ. DePape allegedly broke into the home in search of the congresswoman, who was in Washington, D.C., at the time of the attack. \"Where's Nancy?\" DePape asked Paul Pelosi. After learning about the attack, the speaker raced back to California to be with her husband, who was treated for a skull fracture and serious injuries to his right arm and hands. President Biden condemned the assault as \"despicable,\" tying it to the spread of misinformation and the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. \"What makes us think that one party can talk about 'stolen elections,' 'COVID being a hoax,' 'this is all a bunch of lies' \u2014 and it not affect people who may not be so well-balanced? What makes us think that it's not going to corrode the political climate?\" Biden said last Friday. A range of U.S. law enforcement agencies warned of an increase in potential attacks against political figures, election workers and religious minorities the same day as the attack. Conspiracy theories surrounding a fraudulent election have contributed to several attacks and violent plots since 2021, the bulletin warned, and many attackers would likely do so for ideological reasons.",

Who counts as Black? The thorny question has quietly found its way before the U.S. Supreme Court again, ensnared in a major legal battle over the Voting Rights Act that could further gut the landmark law and make it harder to protect the political power of voters of color. The battle is playing out over new maps of congressional voting districts created by Republican-led legislatures in Alabama and Louisiana after the 2020 census. The fate of the maps rests on how the Supreme Court rules first in the case out of Alabama \u2014 Merrill v. Milligan \u2014 which the high court heard this month and may set a precedent for lawsuits about Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. In both cases out of the Deep South states, lower courts have separately found that the maps were drawn in a way that likely dilutes Black voters' strength at the polls. That would violate the Voting Rights Act by giving a minority group, as spelled out in Section 2, \"less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.\" GOP state officials have pushed back against the analyses that led to those findings, partly by questioning a definition of Blackness that, for close to two decades, has been the standard in cases focused on the voting power of Black people and no other racial or ethnic group whom the federal government classifies as a protected minority population. Since a 2003 ruling by the Supreme Court, that definition of \"Black\" has included every person who identifies as Black on census forms \u2014 including people who check off the boxes for Black and any other racial or ethnic category such as white, Asian and Hispanic or Latino, which the federal government considers to be an ethnicity that can be of any race. Republican state officials, however, have called for narrower definitions of Blackness that do not include people who also identify with another minority group. Citing no evidence, GOP officials in Alabama argued in lower court filings that limiting the definition to people who mark just the \"Black\" box and do not identify as Latino for the census would be \"most defensible.\" And in the Louisiana case \u2014 Ardoin v. Robinson \u2014 officials have been arguing for the definition to only include people who check off either just the \"Black\" box or both \"Black\" and \"White\" and do not identify as Latino. Before appealing their redistricting case to the Supreme Court, Alabama officials dropped their push to redefine Blackness. But the state of Louisiana and its Republican secretary of state, Kyle Ardoin, have asked the country's highest court to weigh in with a final word on which definition should be used in Section 2 cases. Lower courts have already found that even when using more limited definitions of \"Black\" as proposed by the Republican officials, the premise of the courts' analyses of the voting maps does not change. Still, in one filing to the high court, Louisiana officials say using the more expansive definition of Blackness, which includes all people who identify themselves as Black, to analyze the state's new map of congressional districts is an \"independent legal error warranting this Court's intervention.\" A narrower definition of \"Black\" could end up allowing other redistricting plans to minimize Black voting strength. How the Supreme Court decides the case over Alabama's congressional map, however, could have broader implications on the political power of all voters of color. Many voting rights advocates are watching to see if enough of the court's conservative majority adopts one of Alabama's more extreme arguments \u2014 that race cannot be taken into account when drawing voting districts unless there's evidence of intentional racial discrimination. A ruling along those lines could make it virtually impossible to use Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act to challenge voting maps in the future, turning how \"Black\" is defined in redistricting into a less urgent question. Still, the challenges Republican state officials have already made on who counts as Black have raised uneasy questions about the complicated history of defining Blackness and the future of Black voting power in a country where growing numbers of people identify with more than one race. There was no substantial debate about how to define Blackness for redistricting after the Supreme Court's 1986 ruling in Thornburg v. Gingles, a North Carolina redistricting case that established a way of using census data to test whether the racial or ethnic makeup of an election district, among other factors, resulted in the dilution of a minority group's voting power. For the 1980 and 1990 census data, there was only one way people could identify their race as Black on census forms \u2014 filling in the circle for \"Black\" and nothing else. But the turn of the century came with a major change in the 2000 data released by the Census Bureau. \"2000 was really a watershed moment for the U.S. census because it was the first time in American history that all Americans got the opportunity to identify themselves with more than one race,\" explains Ann Morning, a professor of sociology at New York University who studies racial classification and has served as an outside adviser to the bureau. That shift brought a new layer of complication for enforcing voting and other civil rights laws. After decades of federal agencies relying on census data sorted into single-race categories, the White House's Office of Management and Budget put out new guidance on how to sort data released in 2001 about people who identified themselves as multiracial. Based on that guidance, census responses from people who marked both the \"Black\" and \"White\" boxes should be counted with the Black population. And when focused on discrimination specifically against Black people, responses marking boxes for two or more minority races including \"Black\" should also be counted as Black. That approach was echoed in a footnote of the 2003 Supreme Court ruling in a redistricting case known as Georgia v. Ashcroft, which set the current standard for who counts as Black when calculating what is called in Voting Rights Act cases an election district's \"Black voting age population.\" For the high court's majority opinion, former Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote that limiting the definition of \"Black\" to non-Hispanic people who identify themselves as Black and those who identify as both Black and white \u2014 as the Justice Department under former President George W. Bush's administration had advocated for in this case \u2014 \"may have more relevance if the case involves a comparison of different minority groups.\" But noting that the Georgia case was examining \"only one minority group's effective exercise of the electoral franchise,\" O'Connor concluded: \"In such circumstances, we believe it is proper to look at all individuals who identify themselves as black.\" For many redistricting experts, who counts as Black in voting maps has not been up for debate since the Supreme Court's ruling in the Georgia case. \"It was thought to be settled,\" says Morgan Kousser, a professor emeritus of history and social science at the California Institute of Technology who wrote Colorblind Injustice: Minority Voting Rights and the Undoing of the Second Reconstruction and joined a friend-of-the-court brief with other historians supporting the groups challenging Alabama's map. In Louisiana, however, Republican state officials claim that the ruling in Georgia v. Ashcroft \u2014 a case about Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act \u2014 should not be applied to their Section 2 case, noting in a court filing that \"no court has ever conclusively settled the question of what degree persons who self-identify with more than one racial or ethnic identity should be categorized for the purposes of the Voting Rights Act.\" They also argue that a more limited definition of \"Black\" would \"prevent state actors from artificially inflating the minority counts of their redistricting plans.\" That argument, though, carried no weight with the lower court judges who have heard Louisiana's case. In a trial court ruling, U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick pointed out that, when reviewing another lower court's ruling for the Alabama case that also used the more expansive definition of \"Black,\" Chief Justice John Roberts concluded that there were \"no apparent errors\" for the Supreme Court to correct based on the court's past decisions. Kareem Crayton \u2014 a former law professor and redistricting consultant who advised Alabama's Democratic state House minority leader during the drawing of the state's new congressional map \u2014 says he did not expect Alabama GOP lawmakers to challenge the definition of Blackness in court given that they've publicly emphasized they drew congressional districts \"race-blind.\" \"It was a mild surprise that a group that had in many places tried their best not to talk about race, at least in the formal proceedings, all of a sudden took a very, let's just say, staunch and, I'd say, retrograde understanding of race and decided to say that in court,\" Crayton adds. \"It also made me wonder how much the Republican lawmakers were willing to just take their chances in court. That is, maybe this legislature looked at the U.S. Supreme Court and said, 'You know, we're going to try our hand at revisiting what most people thought about both racial definitions and, frankly, the state of the law on race and how race is used.' \" Adopting a more limited definition of Blackness for redistricting would cut against the Voting Rights Act's goal of allowing racial and ethnic minority groups to \"determine for themselves who they wish to vote for and how they wish to participate in the political process,\" says Atiba Ellis, a professor at Marquette University Law School whose research focuses on voting rights law. \"Drawing lines around identity based on what might come off as an arbitrary distinction on a census form would undercut that opportunity for self-determination,\" Ellis adds. \"And certainly in other contexts throughout American history, having the majority dictate to a racial minority who belongs in that racial minority has been seen as discriminatory.\" The push by Louisiana GOP officials for a narrower definition of Blackness in redistricting has resurfaced the state's history with the \"one-drop rule,\" which governments around the U.S. once used to define a Black person as anyone with ancestors who were considered Black. \"It would be paradoxical, to say the least, to turn a blind eye to Louisiana's long and well-documented expansive view of 'Blackness' in favor of a definition on the opposite end of the spectrum,\" Dick, the trial court judge who heard the Louisiana case, wrote in a ruling that rejected the proposal for a narrower definition of \"Black.\" In fact, state lawmakers passed Act 46 of 1970, which, until its repeal in 1983, codified that \"a person having one-thirty second or less of Negro blood shall not be deemed, described or designated by any public official in the state of Louisiana as 'colored,' a 'mulatto,' a 'black,' a 'negro,' a 'griffe,' an 'Afro-American,' a 'quardroon,' a 'mestizo,' a 'colored person' or a 'person of color.' \" That formula was put into place after decades of Louisiana state courts using a \"traceable amount\" test to determine whether a person was Black under law. Wendy Gaudin, a historian at Xavier University of Louisiana whose research focuses on race and racial mixture in the Americas, says there was a \"very specific purpose for using this blood math\" \u2014 to define \"racially ambiguous\" people as Black and ultimately preserve white wealth and white political power when anti-miscegenation and other racial segregation laws helped enforce a color line. Gaudin says it's important to keep in mind that definitions of Blackness have shifted over time in Louisiana, where its Indigenous history, its pasts as a French and Spanish colony and ties to the circum-Caribbean region have often defied the kind of Black-white binary that has been more pervasive in other parts of the United States. \"Blackness as an idea, as a concept, came out of a very specific history of exploitation. Over time, historians have shown us that it changes into a source of strength, a source of resistance, a source of connection,\" Gaudin adds. The way Gaudin sees it, though, this current legal fight over who counts as Black in redistricting \"has nothing to do with people's identity.\" \"It has to do with power and how different populations \u2014 whether it's their inclusion or their exclusion or their carefully curated inclusion \u2014 how all of that works to promote the political power of a person or a party,\" Gaudin says. Ellis, the Marquette University Law School professor, warns that justices on the Supreme Court who may be inclined to dismantle Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act might see the highlighting of alternative definitions of \"Black\" for redistricting as a \"kind of manipulation of race that would reinforce their view that the Voting Rights Act ought to be held unconstitutional.\" \"That could be the worst case of the outcomes here,\" Ellis says. Whatever the court decides, efforts to redefine what \"Black\" or any other race means in politics are not likely to go away. \"This is a set of games that Americans have been engaged in and practiced throughout our history,\" says Kousser, the Caltech professor emeritus of history and social science. \"This is just the most recent iteration of things.\"",

The U.S. Supreme Court, which twice in the last decade has struck down or neutered provisions of the the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act, may well be poised to do it again. On Tuesday the conservative court heard arguments  in a case that could further decimate the law, passed in 1965, and twice renewed by Congress to protect racial minorities from discrimination in voting. At issue in Tuesday's case was Alabama's congressional redistricting plan, adopted by the Republican state legislature after the 2020 Census. More than a quarter of the state's population is African American, but in only 1 of 7 districts do minority voters have a realistic chance of electing the candidate of their choice. In January, a three-judge federal court panel that included two Trump appointees ruled unanimously that under the Voting Rights Act, Alabama should create not just one, but two compact congressional districts with a majority or close to a majority of Black voters. The state appealed to the Supreme Court, where on Tuesday Alabama Solicitor General Edmund LaCour Jr. contended that unless there is evidence of intentional race discrimination, congressional districts must be drawn without considerations of race. Justice Elena Kagan interrupted this line of argument, observing, \"We once long ago said that intent was required ... and Congress immediately slapped us down and said no, we didn't mean that.\" Indeed Congress amended the Voting Rights Act in 1982 to make clear that the voting rights law was aimed at eliminating discriminatory results, whether or not there was intentional discrimination. In short, for example, the law is aimed at preventing practices that have the effect of diluting the political power of minority voters by lumping them into a single district with a super-majority of Black voters and then spreading the remaining minority voters out over the other districts. It's known as packing and cracking, and it is what the lower court found had occurred in Alabama. Kagan noted that Tuesday's case is the third in a trilogy of cases in which the conservative court majority has all but gutted the Voting Rights Act. The Alabama redistricting plan, she said, is a \"classic voter dilution claim,\" and, she told Alabama's lawyer, \"You're asking us essentially to cut back substantially on our 40 years of precedent and to make this too extremely difficult to prevail on. So, what's left?\" Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pointed to the history of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments enacted after the Civil War to guarantee political power to formerly enslaved people. \"When I drilled down to that level of analysis, it became clear to me that the framers themselves adopted the Equal Protection Clause ... in a race conscious way,\" she said. \"I don't think that the historical record establishes that the founders believed that race neutrality or race blindness was required.\" But Alabama's LaCour stuck to his guns, arguing that the lower court decision requiring the creation of a second majority black district is unconstitutional because race was the predominant factor in its creation. In contrast, he argued,  the state legislature's original map, with only one majority black district, is \"race-neutral.\" Rebutting that argument was Deuel Ross, senior counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, who cited the factual findings of the lower court. \"There is nothing race-neutral about Alabama's map,\" he said. \"The Black Belt is a historic and extremely poor community of substantial significance. Yet Alabama's map cracks that community and allows white block voting to deny Black voters the opportunity to elect representation responsive to their needs.\" Where Alabama's LaCour argued that the creation of the second district would break up the Gulf Coast part of the state into two dissimilar districts, the NAACP's lawyer countered that the legislature had no difficulty in simultaneously creating essentially the same two districts for the state school board. For the most part, the court's three liberals dominated Tuesday's argument. The six conservatives didn't tip their hands, though they likely do have a hand to play. They probably won't adopt the state's relatively extreme position that provisions of the Voting Rights Act require racial neutrality \u2014 provisions which, after all, were written to ensure greater political power for long-suppressed racial minorities. But as election expert Rick Hasen observes, Alabama may well get something \"almost as good.\" Namely, \"a new legal framework that makes it much harder for minority plaintiffs to get full representation in congressional and other legislative districts.\" A decision in the case is expected later in the term.",

But that had us wondering: What exactly can therapy accomplish? Can it mitigate the effects of racism? Help us undo how we internalize racial trauma?

Vickie and Ammad will assume their new roles on July 25th. Vickie is one of the most talented and experienced journalists in our newsroom.\u00a0NPR's Chief National Editor since 2014, she is a skilled leader who brings insight, empathy and curiosity to the job. Ammad, most recently, has been the Deputy National Editor for the West, based in Culver City. In addition to overseeing coverage of the American West, Ammad has expertly edited two of our busiest and most consequential beats\u2014immigration and reproductive rights. In her new\u00a0role, Vickie will\u00a0help manage the daily news report alongside Managing Editor Gerry Holmes. She will\u00a0report to Executive Editor Terence Samuel.\u00a0During this assignment she will take over day-to-day supervision of several of our newsgathering desks from Terry \u2014 National, Washington and Culture. As National Editor, Vickie has overseen a team of more than 50 reporters, editors and producers based in Washington and in bureaus across the country, in a\u00a0tenure marked by outstanding, award-winning coverage. She has ably guided our coverage through times of intense\u00a0tumult and change. That has included the 2016 election;\u00a0a movement for racial justice spurred by the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor\u00a0and\u00a0the upheaval of\u00a0January\u00a06th.\u00a0The desk deftly pivoted to cover the COVID-19 pandemic and the ways it reached into every facet of our lives. As the\u00a0criminal justice team expanded to meet the moment, so too, did coverage of addiction;\u00a0reproductive rights; race and identity; and national security, including the addition of correspondents dedicated to\u00a0domestic extremism and\u00a0cybersecurity coverage.\u00a0And the desk\u00a0created signature work with deeply experienced reporters and editors telling the regional stories others often miss. Vickie joined NPR in 2008 after an impressive newspaper career. Her last job in that industry was as Senior Washington Editor for Tribune Publishing, where she coordinated the convergence of print, digital and television coverage. Before that, she was the Washington Bureau Chief for the Chicago Tribune, a post she assumed days after 9/11.\u00a0 Vickie began her journalism career reporting and editing at the Kansas City Star. Anyone who knows Vickie knows one of the great joys of her life, after her family, is basketball, particularly when played by her beloved University of Kansas Jayhawks, the\u00a0reigning NCAA Men's champions. If you don't know how to \"wave the wheat,\" KU-style, Vickie will gladly demonstrate. From Vickie:\u00a0\"For the past 14 years, I've been a part of the National Desk, an incredibly talented and dedicated group of reporters, producers, correspondents and editors who work hard to tell the stories of this nation. I'm excited about the opportunity to work with more journalists across our newsroom in the days ahead.\" Ammad Omar Promoted to Chief National Editor Ammad got his start in public radio at WBEZ in Chicago, where he worked as an intern, freelance reporter, host, producer, and editor, eventually overseeing the station's daily news coverage. \u00a0 During his time in Chicago, Ammad covered or witnessed no fewer than one senator reaching the White House, two governors being sent to prison, and countless passionate repudiations of putting ketchup on a hot dog. His first assignment at NPR was as an editor for\u00a0Tell Me More with Michel Martin, before working at\u00a0Morning Edition, and then\u00a0All Things Considered, Weekends. He has worked on the National Desk for the last three and a half years - starting as a Supervising Editor, and then moving to Southern California to serve as Deputy National Editor for the West, and the network's editorial lead at NPR West in Culver City. Over the years, Ammad has developed a reputation as a thoughtful mentor for newer staffers and a sounding board for veterans. From Ammad: \"I couldn't be more honored to continue working with the great journalists who make up the National Desk, and the hundreds of member stations journalists across the country who help us cover an unbelievably wide range of important issues. I'm excited to look for new ways to serve our audience, working hand-in-hand with NPR's legendary shows and powerhouse podcasts.\" \"I wouldn't be here if it weren't for the mentorship of people like Vickie Walton-James and Michel Martin, or the brilliance of the reporters, producers, and editors who make me look good on a regular basis!\" The changes mean that in our ongoing effort to listen to and sound like America, a diehard Michigan fan replaces a diehard Kansas fan as NPR's top editor on national news: We will continue to have the Midwest solidly covered. Please join us in congratulating Vickie and Ammad.",

In 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. organized low-income Americans of different backgrounds in a march on Washington known as the \"Poor People's Campaign.\" Over 50 years later, thousands of protesters gathered Saturday to deliver that same message at the Poor People's and Low-Wage Workers' Assembly and Moral March on Washington and to the Polls. The rally urged low-income voters to participate in the upcoming midterm elections and featured religious organizations, pro-democracy groups, labor unions and climate activists from across the country. \"As long as there are 140 million poor and low-income people in this country, and we know it doesn't have to be this way, we won't be silent anymore,\" said the Rev. William Barber, co-chair of the Poor People's Campaign. Protesters rallied together for a broad range of issues: an end to poverty, voter suppression, systemic racism, environmental damage and limited access to health care and education. The Poor People's Campaign also demands what advocates call a Third Reconstruction \u2014 a large federal effort to end poverty and make other large scale changes. It follows the first Reconstruction after the Civil War and the Second Reconstruction during the civil rights movement. Barber also spoke on the disproportionate impacts of the COVID pandemic for low-income people. The Poor People's Campaign released a study in April it said showed that Americans in poor counties died at nearly twice the rate of those in richer counties. \"We know that prior to the pandemic, poor people died at a rate of 700 people a day \u2014 250,000 a year,\" Barber said. \"Poor people have been 2 to 5 times more likely to die from COVID during this pandemic so far, and we know this can't simply be explained by way of vaccination results; it's related to the discrimination in our policy toward poor and low-wealth people,\" he said. Demonstrators traveled from all over the U.S. to protest inequality. \"It's kind of sickening to me that we've come to the capital of the richest country on the planet and we see homeless people in tunnels and living on the streets,\" said Kevin Queen, 43, who traveled to the rally from Nebraska. \"And so just to be able to be here and participate is an honor as well as something that's very upsetting, because here we are, what, 60 years later, and we're still marching for the poor \u2014 we still haven't fixed this problem,\" he said.

Although there were fewer women than men in leadership roles at NPR in the early days, now over half of NPR's Executive Team is made up of women. To close Women's History Month, I'd like to highlight some of the women in leadership at NPR. I wanted to understand how their experiences lead them where they are, how NPR's culture is with this dynamic and what advice they would reach back and give. Here are their answers: What was crucial to your success? Selyn Hong, who was just promoted to Chief People Officer, underlines the importance of believing in the mission of the company and the people you work with. Selyn Hong, Chief People Officer\n                \n                    \n                    Selyn Hong\n                    \n                \nhide caption Selyn Hong, Chief People Officer Selyn Hong: I think doing work that aligns with my values for an organization whose mission I believe in has been crucial. It's instilled in me a passion and drive to try to do my best work and to persevere, even when the road has been bumpy and uncertain. I've been incredibly lucky in that NPR is full of people who inspire me to keep trying my best and to not give up, people who care deeply about others, the world we live in, the workplace we work in and our commitment to the public. Every time I've met and gotten to know someone at NPR, it's turned out to be an opportunity to learn, to laugh, to be moved or to grow. I also credit my support system, both inside and outside of NPR, for any successes I've had to date and any I may have in the future. They're essential \u2013 those people you inherently trust, those people who believe in you, who champion and mentor you, those people full of integrity who model the behaviors you want to have, those people who will tell you the truth when it's easier to avoid it because the truth will help you or others. I don't think I could have succeeded without those people. They make me better every day, and I'm so grateful for them. Edith Chapin, VP and Executive Editor, speaks to the opportunities she was given at NPR and how crucial it is to experience many roles to develop your skills. Edith Chapin: I was very fortunate to be able to alternate jobs that had me working in the office and in the field, so I learned quickly to appreciate the needs of people in both roles. I also made sure I was good at balancing out the skills of whatever team I worked with on a given job or assignment. I said yes to most opportunities and made sure I was as well rounded as possible with assignments covering national stories, living and reporting overseas and then in Washington. It is unusual to get all three of those experiences, but I did and it has made me a much stronger journalist. I also made sure to learn something from colleagues with more experience than me \u2013 sometimes what to do and sometimes what not to do. Unfortunately you only get experience by getting it, so you have to be moderately patient but learn a lot as you go along. At NPR, our leaders are humble and modest, so I wanted to provide an opportunity for these women to promote their work and toot their own horn. Only Nancy Barnes, SVP for News & Editorial Director, decided to respond to this question, although in true NPR fashion, she tooted NPR's horn instead of her own. How do you feel about the impact of your contribution to NPR? Edith Chapin, VP and Executive Editor\n                \n                    \n                    Stephen Voss/Stephen Voss\n                    \n                \nhide caption Edith Chapin, VP and Executive Editor Nancy Barnes: I am incredibly proud of all the tremendous journalism the newsroom has contributed to the world, and to our audiences, in these most recent years of a pandemic, a renewed racial justice movement, natural disasters, an election, the Jan. 6 insurrection, a new administration, the Supreme Court, Afghanistan, Ukraine. The list goes on. This is a team sport, and all credit goes to the entire NPR village who pulled together during the most difficult of circumstances. Chief Financial Officer Debbie Cowan and Chief Communications Officer Isabel Lara gave us more insight on their roles and how they help shape NPR. Why is your job important to NPR? Nancy Barnes, SVP News and Editorial Director\n                \n                    \n                    Wanyu Zhang/Wanyu Zhang\n                    \n                \nhide caption Nancy Barnes, SVP News and Editorial Director Debbie Cowan: As a non-profit, we are not beholden to the financial goals of for-profit companies like earnings or stock prices for example, but we still are a business and have to be able to financially support our mission. As such, it is the finance team that outlooks our revenue picture and ensures we prudently manage our spending and prioritize and allocate resources within our means to generate revenue. That entails planning exercises such as developing annual budgets and periodic re-forecasts to predict our financial results, as well as projecting long-term financial scenarios. Additionally, the finance teams are responsible for many other business processes, such as payroll, purchasing and accounts payable, accounts receivable and collections, fixed assets, debt management, gift & grants management, treasury and investments, insurance and risk management, taxes, financial statement preparation and audits. The finance team is also liaison to three committees of the board and assists with their financial diligence and oversight. Those committees are Finance, Investments and Audit. Isabel Lara: My job supports NPR's mission to inform the American public. The Communications team does this in three key ways: by increasing the reach of our journalism through media placements so as many people as possible have access to \u2013 and know about! \u2013 the amazing work our news and programming teams are doing; by engaging with NPR's listeners and readers wherever they are through social media or email, answering their questions in a timely manner, or meeting them in person at conferences and events; and by providing transparent internal communications to our staff and stakeholders so we can all work together better.\u00a0Public radio is the most trusted and widely available free source of news and entertainment. It is so important to let everyone know about this and ensure that everyone feels welcome and seen/heard/represented in our programs. One of my favorite things about my job is helping listeners get to know the hosts and reporters who work so hard to bring them the human stories behind the headlines \u2013 like our teams risking their lives right now so we can hear voices from the conflict in Ukraine.

We are on a journey as an organization to do an exceptional job, while creating a culture of care. This is a work in progress, but we have an incredible group of committed people who are helping make this happen. It is an honor and a journey for me. Gina then talked more about her direct impact at NPR, and Selyn amplified NPR's North Star. What is your goal for NPR and how are you doing that through your position? Gina Garrubbo, President and CEO of National Public Media (NPM)\n                \n                    \n                    Gina Garrubbo\n                    \n                \nhide caption Gina Garrubbo, President and CEO of National Public Media (NPM) Gina Garrubbo: My goal as head of NPM is to help my team bring as much sponsorship revenue to NPR and the Member stations as possible. We are proud to take the story of NPR's quality journalism and programming out to the biggest brands in the U.S. and create ways for these brands to deliver their messages in a way that fits the style and tone of NPR. We work closely with NPR to continuously evolve the many ways for brands to message their support of NPR across platforms. Selyn Hong: My goal is for NPR to rise towards a culture that moves us closer to our North Star. I would love to see NPR free of systemic barriers to equity and inclusion, and full of respectful, healthy, productive, honest dialogue where we're empowered to do our best work. We've been through devastating challenges over the past two years \u2013 a relentless pandemic, reckoning with systemic racism, economic crisis, threats to our democracy, and violence all over the world. I think we need some time to heal and to build more trusting relationships throughout the organization. I believe we can get there if we work together and start from a place of openness, empathy, mutual respect and eagerness to learn from one another. As Chief People Officer, I plan to keep building upon the work we already started in HR, which I believe should move us in the right direction \u2013 defining and implementing practices and programs for a more inclusive workplace; continuing to build more equitable and transparent core practices for compensation and promotion (including adding additional market data and surveys to assist in compensation decisions); implementing programs and policies to support employees with physical, mental and emotional well-being; continuing to evaluate and refine our HR processes to be more efficient and effective; and providing centralized support for external training and development resources, among other things. As Chief People Officer, I also hope to consistently model the change I wish to see in my interactions with the people who are NPR and to act in a way that instills faith and trust. Finally, I asked what advice they had to share with young women. Sarah Gilbert, VP of News Programming, kept it fun. Edith Chapin reminds us that there can be joy in work. And Isabel Lara suggests we stay open to all opportunities and where they may lead us. What advice would you give to young women reading this? Sarah Gilbert: I can only speak from my own perspective at this point in my life, but if I met my 25-year-old self, I'd say \u2013 Spend less time worrying about whether or not you can do it, or how crushing it would be to fail...and just give it a go. Ask for help. People are always much more willing to give it than you might imagine, and you're going to make some great friends in the process. Be kinder to yourself, and try to live in the moment. Sit down and try this \u2013 it's a martini and you're going to like it. Edith Chapin: A career in journalism can be fun, rewarding and challenging if you are ready to embrace unpredictability every day. Embrace opportunities even when they are unexpected. Some of the best career moments are ones I didn't see coming. Witnessing history and trying to make sense of it in real time is fun. If you remember the audience at all times you will make sure they are well served. I still can't believe I get paid to know what is going on in the world every day. Isabel Lara: To be open to the unexpected and unplanned. Yes, you can plan ahead and stress out about where you'll be in five years, but life is full of surprises and things never turn out as you thought they would. So stay curious and always be open to new opportunities. I studied literature because I knew I wanted to read as many books as I could before grown up life got complicated and busy. When I graduated I knew my only \"marketable\" skills were writing and being bilingual, so I was really humble about my aspirations and open to working pretty much anywhere that would hire me. My first job was in advertising and I met so many interesting people. There's a lot of waiting when you're filming and producing commercials and a lot of time to ask questions and hear people's stories and experiences. Since then, each job has led me to the next opportunity. I always try to approach projects with curiosity and humility: There's so much to learn, even when you've been in the same field for a long time. Happy Women's History Month!

            "article_content": "At the start of the pandemic, Grisell Valencia was living in Atlanta and working in human resources. She worked for a retail company that was determined to remain open, so she spent a fair amount of her time advocating for employees' safety to the company higher ups. Later that year, when George Floyd was killed and people took to the streets, Valencia's concerns about safety only grew. Suddenly, she wasn't just worrying about staying safe from COVID; she was also worrying about the safety of her family and friends. She was terrified that one of her loved ones might be harassed or harmed by the police. \"I felt sad and I remember feeling hopeless,\" says Valencia. \"I [was] just praying and hoping that my loved ones [weren't] killed on their way home driving.\" Valencia, 35, is a first-generation Colombian American and identifies as Afro-Latina. In the summer of 2020, she was also one of the few people of color in HR at her company. At the time, many employees started calling her department to demand the company release a statement about Black Lives Matter. Valencia was asked to educate colleagues and approve the company's statement \u2013 in large part because of her identity. So when her coworkers approached her, \"It wasn't like 'Let's chat, how are you feeling?'\" says Valencia. \"It really got to me.\" By later that summer, she was struggling to make it throughout the day without fixating on her worries. So she decided to turn to therapy. And she wasn't alone. Twenty percent of American adults sought out therapy in 2020, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. Compared to the year before, that was an increase of 2.8 million people. Like Valencia, many of the people in therapy were looking to process some of the big, painful events they were living through, including the pandemic, a contentious election cycle, and of course, the summer's racial reckoning. But Grisell Valencia faced a particular challenge; she wanted to find a culturally competent therapist who could respond directly to some of the questions and experiences she was dealing with as an Afro-Latina. That provided a bit of a demographic obstacle. As of 2019, only 17% of licensed therapists were people of color, and an even smaller percentage of those people were Afro-Latina. \"There's grieving, loss, and mourning happening for the Afro-Latino community,\" says Luisa Bonifacio, a New York licensed psychologist. \"It's more surfaced and alive in conversations...What I think the 2020 uprisings did was uncover a seething. There was an urgency around social justice that spilled out into all parts of people's lives.\" Bonifacio identifies racially as Black, and ethnically Dominican-American. Her clients are mostly people of color; a quarter are Afro-Latino. Since the summer of 2020, she has noticed her clients seem much more willing to discuss their experiences of being marginalized in all parts of their lives. Many are re-evaluating friendships and social support networks where they no longer feel safe or understood. \"We get to [anti-Blackness] as we talk about family issues, or as we talk about relationship issues,\" she says. \"It'll come in the form of, 'My mom keeps making these comments,' or 'Somebody at work keeps talking about my hair.'\" Bonifacio says these conversations help her see her clients in their fuller contexts. Adriana Alejandre, the founder of Latinx Therapy, a directory and bilingual mental health podcast, has seen a shift in her conversations, too. During the summer of 2020, she received many messages on social media from community members wanting to learn how to be anti-racist. \"They've grown up with racist grandparents or parents and have a lot of things that they need to unlearn,\" says Alejandre. \"I grew up with those narratives, too, and don't want to pass them on to the younger generation.\" In her private practice, Alejandre approaches anti-Blackness with clients by asking questions: \"As their therapist, I want to understand where this learned narrative comes from and how much of them is associated and tied with it.\" If and when someone finds a therapist who is a good fit, the next hurdle may be establishing parameters of what therapy can and can't do. Mariel Buqu\u00e9, a New York-based holistic psychologist, believes therapy can serve many functions. One of them is to explore racial trauma. \"I think the purpose of therapy is to bring people to a place where they feel good in their own skin and feel like their own mind, body and spirit is a safe place to land,\" says Buqu\u00e9. Luisa Bonifacio agrees. She says therapy is a powerful tool that can allow people to put their guard down. \"We know that a lot of mental health issues come about because of shame, guilt, and being silenced,\" she says. \"Once [you] have the words for describing what's happening to [you], then [you] can connect to other people, find community, and feel empowered.\" Other therapists mentioned that therapy can help people sort through the pain of experiencing racism. It can provide methods for communicating better with friends and family members. And it can also give people strategies for unlearning internalized white supremacy. But Daniel Olavarria says it won't fix everything. \"Therapy cannot go back in history and change what people may have said or done to you,\" says Olavarr\u00eda, who is a licensed clinical social worker with a practice in New York. \"Therapy can't erase what you will experience today and what you will experience tomorrow. Therapy will not change what your parents said or did to you when you were younger.\" What it can do, he says, is help us reconsider the meaning that we draw from those experiences. It can have a tremendous impact on the stories people tell about themselves. And it can shift feelings of inadequacy to an understanding that, \"There are some broken parts about the world as it exists today, and that has nothing to do with me.\" After weeks of sorting through directories and reaching out to therapists, Grisell Valencia finally found a therapist who seemed like a good fit \u2013 someone she could speak Spanglish with, who is in her age range, and understands her lived experience. Growing up, Valencia was told she had \"pelo malo.\" On trips home to Cali, Colombia, she often heard dark-skinned Colombians be called \"negra\" or \"negro,\" which is often used as a term of endearment. But Valencia always wondered how much of these norms were actually rooted in colonization. Since starting therapy in October 2021, she's been unpacking these experiences. Right now, she is working with her therapist on \"healing her inner child.\" Valencia also resigned from her human resources job and now works as the Director of Diversity Equity and Inclusion for a non-profit aiming to end food insecurity. She says she's grateful for her new role and for having a therapist to support her transition. Valencia's therapy sessions have become pivotal for unpacking her workplace triggers. They've also helped her take conversations back to her family where racial dynamics weren't discussed. \"I [want to be] able to identify these things as unhealthy, as not normal or actions that we should not enable,\" she says. \"I want to be that person...where I'm like, the buck stops here.\"",

A divided North Carolina Supreme Court struck down the state's new maps for congressional and General Assembly seats on Friday. RALEIGH, N.C. \u2014 A divided North Carolina Supreme Court struck down the state's new maps for congressional and General Assembly seats Friday, declaring that state courts had authority to throw out lines engineered to secure a long-term Republican advantage in an otherwise closely divided state. By a 4-3 decision \u2014 with the justices who are registered Democrats making up the majority \u2014 the state's highest court directed the GOP-controlled legislature to redraw the plans by Feb. 18 and provide an explanation of how they calculated the partisan fairness of the new boundaries. Any replacement maps would still be used for the May 17 primaries. The court's decision reversed a ruling last month from a panel of three trial judges that let the maps stand, and declared partisan gerrymandering found in the redistricting approved by the legislature in November violated several provisions in the North Carolina Constitution. They include the right to free elections, freedom of speech and equal protections of citizens. The legislature violates the constitution \"when it deprives a voter of his or her right to substantially equal voting power on the basis of partisan affiliation,\" read the order of the court's majority, signed by senior Associate Justice Robin Hudson. \"Achieving partisan advantage incommensurate with a political party's level of statewide voter support is neither a compelling nor a legitimate governmental interest.\" The trial judges had found ample evidence that the legislature approved maps that were \"a result of intentional, pro-Republican partisan redistricting.\" But they declared it wasn't the judiciary's place to intervene in mapmaking \u2014 a duty left to the legislature \u2014 when partisan fairness in those plans was challenged. Friday's ruling is a major victory for state and national Democrats and their allies who had invested greatly in overturning the maps. It could also make it harder for Republicans to retake control of the U.S. House this fall. A group associated with the National Democratic Redistricting Committee \u2014 led by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder \u2014 supported a bloc of voters who sued. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper can't use his veto stamp to block redistricting plans, but he filed a brief urging the Supreme Court to throw out the maps. The lawsuits were bolstered by mathematicians and electoral researchers who presented evidence of their analysis of trillions of map simulations. They testified the new lines were likely to give the GOP 10 of the state's 14 U.S. House seats as well as state House and Senate majorities in almost any political environment. Republicans currently hold an 8-5 seat advantage. The state gets a 14th seat this year because of population growth reported in the census. \"This is the justice we sought when we filed this lawsuit,\" said Carrie Clark, executive director of the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters, which was another plaintiff. \"With new, constitutional maps, North Carolinians will have a fighting chance to elect a government that fulfills their desire for environmental justice and climate action.\" Chief Justice Paul Newby, a Republican writing a dissent, said the court's majority \"tosses judicial restraint aside, seizing the opportunity to advance its agenda\" with a partisan bias. \"By choosing to hold that partisan gerrymandering violates the North Carolina Constitution and by devising its own remedies, there appears to be no limit to this court's power,\" Newby wrote. The court's other two Republicans \u2014 Associate Justices Phil Berger Jr. and Tamara Barringer \u2014 joined with Newby. Republican legislators who were sued wanted the trial judges' ruling to stand, saying a state Supreme Court decision from the early 2000s said partisan advantage can be considered in mapmaking. They said the redistricting process had been transparent and prohibited the use of racial and political data. GOP legislators criticized Friday's ruling, with Senate redistricting committee co-chair Ralph Hise calling it a \"perverse precedent\" that \"once set, will be nearly impossible to unwind.\" The plaintiffs argued that the enacted maps thwarted the will of the people, and that the boundaries should produce political outcomes more in line with competitive statewide elections over the past decade. They were particularly unhappy with GOP efforts to carve up Democratic anchors of Guilford and Mecklenburg counties into three U.S. House districts apiece. Five of those six districts were considered Republican-leaning as the urban voters were attached to conservative, rural voters. Friday's majority order also directed lawmakers to use election and population figures to determine whether racially polarized voting is sufficient in areas to require the drawing of districts that protect Black voting strength. State Democratic Party Chair Bobbie Richardson, who is not a plaintiff, called the ruling \"a critical and momentous step towards maps that protect the fundamental right to vote.\" It was a North Carolina U.S. House map approved in 2016 that became the subject of a landmark 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision on partisan gerrymandering. A majority of justices declared that while federal courts aren't the place to settle partisan gerrymandering disputes, state courts could adjudicate these matters.",

The Puerto Rican superstar's wordplay was front-of-mind for Alt.Latino co-host Anamaria Sayre this year. When the words in a song hit you in just the right way, they can stay with you. We're asking the folks at NPR Music: What lyrics did you hear in 2022 that you just couldn't shake? In the short segments below, they explain their choices. Are we actually looking out for each other? In this song, Straw Man Army is addressing the \"spiritual debt\" of humankind; it's a bearing witness to what the last couple of years have done to us. Listen to the Viking's Choice playlist; subscribe to the newsletter. This lyric \u2014 \"T\u00fa no ere' bebecita / T\u00fa ere' bebesota\" \u2014 was one of those lines that exploded this year, especially in Latin America. It's hard to describe what it means, exactly \u2013 he's talking to a woman, basically calling her a babe, but in two different ways. Through that device, he's expressing a desire for a strong woman, a boss, someone who's empowered. For someone as visible as he is to carry a message like that \u2013 and so clearly \u2013 is indicative, I think, of a new openness in Latin America around women being able to embody their own power and sexuality. Hear more from Anamaria Sayre and Felix Contreras on Alt.Latino. The lyric that keeps haunting me comes from an unlikely source: a curious little song from the 1950s that was never commercially recorded and was written by an enigmatic figure who never cut an album and who, at age 50 in 1974, disappeared and was never heard from again. Thirty-five years after her disappearance a trove of home recordings were discovered and released. Her name is/was Connie Converse, and her song is \"One by One,\" which was recently covered in a most profoundly beautiful way by soprano Julia Bullock. Find Tom Huizenga's work and the rest of NPR's classical music coverage on Deceptive Cadence. This lyric \u2013 \"It's so embarrassing / all of the things I need, living inside of me / I can't see it\" \u2013 is SZA saying, basically, \"I need to learn how to love myself.\" Many of us have been through relationships, situationships, dysfunctional, functional, whatever \u2013 in love, there's always some sort of push-and-pull.",

Progressive groups are taking a leaf out of their playbook. A lot of people who run for school board are parents or teachers; 19-year-old Maryam Zafar is neither. \"I have a lot of like, really close experience to a big chunk of the people that we are supposed to be serving as a school board,\" she said. \"And just because of my age, people automatically know that I have a unique perspective, whether they've heard it or not.\" Zafar is a student at the University of Texas-Austin, and also a 2020 graduate of McNeil High School, in the Austin, Texas, suburb of Round Rock. \"I am really privileged to have gone here; it gave me a lot of opportunities, but it wasn't always a healthy or safe space for me and my friends, especially in regards to sexual harassment and assault,\" she said in the courtyard of Round Rock High School on a recent spring afternoon, as students left school for the day. \"I was in ROTC, which was the Air Force program in my high school. And so one big part of my job that I kind of undertook as my responsibility, was in trying to handle any sort of harassment case that came up.\" That experience, she says, made her want to be a school board member in that district. To prepare for her run, Zafar has done trainings with the progressive group Run for Something. The group has for years recruited people to run for many different offices, but cofounder Amanda Litman says they are putting new effort into school boards. \"One of the things we realized after 2020 was we have to focus in on these local positions like school boards,\" Litman said. \"There is such a need for broad progressive focusing on these local positions. There are more than 80,000 elected school board positions across the country. About 21,000 of them are up this year.\" Interest in running for school board is up nationwide. Only 25% of school board races are unopposed this year, down from 35% last year and 40% in 2018, according to Ballotpedia. Because school board elections are overwhelmingly nonpartisan, it's hard to quantify who or what is behind all that energy. But then, there has been an undeniable groundswell of conservative enthusiasm around school politics in the last few years, most notably around national issues like race, LGBTQ issues, and COVID. Groups like Moms for Liberty and No Left Turn in Education are among the groups working to harness parents' frustration. Progressives like Litman, at Run for Something, are hoping to make sure they have their own source of organization \u2014 not to mention funding \u2014 to counter the enthusiasm from the right. \"The far right is investing a ton in outside PAC spending. We have seen that the Leadership Institute, which is the Koch Brothers-funded nonprofit that does conservative training for operatives and activists, has been running for programming on school boards all year long,\" Litman said. \"Moms for Liberty is focusing hard on school board positions and candidate support. So they're doubling and tripling down. Here we have to as well.\" It's not totally new for national-level politics to become a part of school board elections \u2014 in the '90s, conservative parents targeted the teaching of sex education and evolution. Likewise, opposition to the No Child Left Behind policy galvanized some parents during the George W. Bush presidency. But the political landscape has vastly changed. \"What's different this time is the coordination, the financing and then social media really being able to spread a very consistent message to so many school districts so quickly,\" said Rebecca Jacobsen, professor of educational policy at Michigan State University, \"whereas in previous eras, before internet and social media, these things happened, but at much slower paces. And in some ways, that slower pace gave rise to alternative voices, voices that maybe moderated the discussion.\" And she says she fears that that kind of polarization at the local level could have worrying long-term effects for the public school system. \"Schools really are sort of the last holdout in our support for a big public institution, \"Jacobsen said. \"And so I think that that is maybe the more important impact of this than anything else, whether the policy becomes X or Y. I think whether we continue to believe that our local schools are good for all kids and that I want to continue sending my children there and supporting taxes. That, to me, is the bigger question.\" Round Rock has seen national-level tensions play out locally \u2013 one turbulent September meeting, where parents and board members clashed over masking, culminated in two arrests. Zafar says that she's worried about meetings having been politicized. \"I have definitely seen that here,\" she said. \"We've had a lot of disruption in our school board around mask mandates, and it's there has been a lot of legal action taken about that, and it's been a disruption to focusing on student outcomes and on the health and wellness of students.\" At a Board of Trustees meeting this spring, Christy Slape said that social media and YouTube have helped galvanize area parents like her. She came to the meeting to speak about books she thought were, in her words, too sexual. She had first heard about the books when a fellow parent complained to the school. \"That just launched a whole basically like a snowball of parents wanting to know more about what books were in the classroom, and then other books being available in the libraries,\" she said. \"And so across the country, there has been just a snowball effect of parents wanting to check their libraries and see what books are available in their libraries.\" Slape did speak, but books were not on the agenda that night. Overwhelmingly, this board meeting was not about cultural flashpoints but instead, district concerns like student recognition and staff pay increases. That's a point that can be obscured by viral video clips of rowdy school board meetings: local school-board politics are very often not about national cultural conversations but instead, more mundane yet vital local topics, like bond issues. Along those lines, Litman says she advises candidates to stick to concrete local fixes, as opposed to debates over things like critical race theory. \"You want to, like, really get to the heart of the matter, which is people are anxious about the quality of the school. What can you do to solve for that?\" she said. \"And usually it's quite boring. But it's also the things that are very specific and tangible that you can fix.\" But then, school board members may confront problems they can't fix. The school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, has put gun violence top of mind for Zafar, who grew up in the era of school lockdowns. \"It's been a really important issue to me since I was a kid \u2013 I used to have nightmares about being shot,\" she said. But she's also realistic about how much a school board member can do about shootings. \"I don't think we can do much about guns themselves,\" she said. \"I think all we do is safety policies and locking people down and making sure people have the education to know what to do in a lockdown.\" Meanwhile, Litman says she hopes members can have influence beyond their schools. \"I really think in many cases, the place for school board members is what can they do to push state legislators? How can school board members use their political platform and their bully pulpit to help advocate for broader statewide change?\" she said. While national politics have filtered down to school boards, in other words, her hope is that some members' political views will filter upward.",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court heard arguments Tuesday on whether a congressional map drawn by Alabama lawmakers violated the Voting Rights Act.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments today in a case that could further decimate the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act. It was passed and twice renewed by Congress. It protects racial minorities from discrimination in voting. In the last decade, the court's conservative majority has struck down or neutered key provisions of the law. And today, the question was whether to deliver another blow. NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: At issue was Alabama's congressional redistricting plan adopted by the Republican state legislature after the 2020 census. More than a quarter of the state's population is African American, but in only 1 out of 7 districts do minority voters have a realistic chance of electing the candidate of their choice. In January, a three-judge federal court panel, including two Trump appointees, ruled unanimously that under the Voting Rights Act, Alabama should create not just one, but two compact congressional districts with a majority or close to a majority of Black voters. The state appealed to the Supreme Court, where today, Solicitor General Edmund LaCour contended that unless there is evidence of intentional race discrimination, congressional districts must be drawn without considerations of race. Justice Kagan interrupted. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ELENA KAGAN: We once, long ago, said that intent was required, and Congress immediately slapped us down and said, no, we didn't mean that. TOTENBERG: Indeed, Congress amended the Voting Rights Act in 1982 to make clear that the voting rights law was aimed at eliminating discriminatory results. Here, the lower court ruled that Alabama's original map had the effect of diluting the political power of minority voters by lumping a supermajority of them into a single district and spreading the remaining minority voters out over the other districts. It's known as packing and cracking. Kagan said today's case is a classic voter dilution claim. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAGAN: And you're asking us, essentially, to cut back substantially on our 40 years of precedent and to make this too extremely difficult to prevail on. So what's left? TOTENBERG: Justice Jackson pointed to the history of the 14th and 15th Amendments enacted after the Civil War to guarantee political power to formerly enslaved people. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KETANJI BROWN JACKSON: When I drilled down to that level of analysis, it became clear to me that the framers themselves adopted the Equal Protection Clause, the 14th Amendment, the 15th Amendment in a race-conscious way. I don't think that the historical record establishes that the founders believed that race neutrality or race blindness was required. TOTENBERG: But Alabama's LaCour stuck to his guns, arguing that the lower court decision requiring the creation of a second majority-Black district is unconstitutional because race was the predominant factor in its creation. In contrast, he argued, the state legislature's original map with only one majority-Black district is race neutral. Rebutting that argument was Deuel Ross, senior counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, who cited the factual findings of the lower court. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DEUEL ROSS: There is nothing race neutral about Alabama's map. The Black Belt is a historic and extremely poor community of substantial significance, yet Alabama's map cracks that community and allows white-Black voting to deny Black voters the opportunity to elect representation responsive to their needs. TOTENBERG: Where Alabama's LaCour argued that the creation of the second district would break up the Gulf part of the state into two dissimilar districts, the NAACP's lawyer countered that the legislature had no difficulty in simultaneously creating essentially the same two districts but for the state school board. For the most part, the court's three liberals dominated today's arguments. The six conservatives didn't tip their hands, though their records indicate they likely do have a hand to play. They probably won't adopt the state's relatively extreme position of racial neutrality in provisions of the Voting Rights Act, provisions which, after all, were written to ensure greater political power for long-suppressed racial minorities. But as election law expert Rick Hasen observes, Alabama may well get something almost as good; namely, a new legal framework that makes it much harder for minority plaintiffs to get full representation in congressional and other legislative districts.

WELLINGTON, New Zealand \u2014 Fijian police on Thursday said they were calling in the military to help maintain security following a close election last week that is now being disputed. It was an alarming development in a Pacific nation where democracy remains fragile and there have been four military coups in the past 35 years. The two main contenders for prime minister this year were former coup leaders themselves. Police Commissioner Brig. Gen. Sitiveni Qiliho said in a statement that after police and military leaders met with Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama they collectively decided to call in army and navy personnel to assist. The commissioner said there had been threats made against minority groups who were \"now living in fear following recent political developments.\" Reporters in the capital, Suva, said there were no immediate signs of any military presence on city streets. The military move came after Bainimarama's Fiji First party refused to concede the election, despite rival Sitiveni Rabuka's party and two other parties announcing they had the numbers to form a majority coalition and would serve as the next government. Fiji First Gen. Sec. Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum told media Wednesday that under the nation's constitution, Bainimarama would remain prime minister until lawmakers returned to Parliament within two weeks to vote on the next leader. Sayed-Khaiyum questioned the validity of the internal voting which had led to one of the parties joining Rabuka's coalition. And he lashed out at Rabuka, accusing him of sowing division in Fiji. \"The entire rationale of this man has been to divide Fiji to gain political supremacy,\" Sayed-Khaiyum said. \"And we can see that simmering through again. In fact it's not simmering, it's boiling.\" A day earlier, Rabuka and two other party leaders announced they were forming a coalition with a total of 29 seats against Fiji First's 26 and would form the next government. \"A government we hope that will bring the change that people had been calling out for over the last few years,\" Rabuka said at a news conference. \"It's going to be an onerous task. It will not be easy, and it was never easy to try and dislodge an incumbent government. We have done that, collectively.\" Rabuka's announcement prompted New Zealand Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta to send her congratulations on Twitter, saying New Zealand \"looks forward to working together to continue strengthening our warm relationship.\" But New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern took a more cautious approach, saying she was waiting until the dust settled. Bainimarama has been in power for 16 years. He led a 2006 military coup and later refashioned himself as a democratic leader by introducing a new constitution and winning elections in 2014 and 2018. Rabuka, meanwhile, led Fiji's first military takeover in 1987 and later served seven years as an elected prime minister in the 1990s. Bainimarama and Rabuka were initially deadlocked after the election. Rabuka's People's Alliance Party won 21 seats and the affiliated National Federation Party won five seats, while Bainimarama's Fiji First party secured 26 seats. That left the Social Democratic Liberal Party, which won three seats, holding the balance of power. The party decided Tuesday in a close 16-14 internal vote to go with Rabuka \u2014 a vote that Fiji First is now questioning.",

A Democratic committee on Friday approved a proposal, pushed by President Biden, that would upend the party's presidential primary calendar, elevating South Carolina to the first spot, moving the swing states of Georgia and Michigan up to the early slate, and putting Iowa back in the pack. The president is calling for South Carolina \u2014 a state with a sizable Black population, which notably turned around his fortunes in the 2020 race \u2014 to go first, followed in the early window by New Hampshire and Nevada, then Georgia and Michigan. The plan was first reported by The Washington Post Thursday evening and then confirmed by NPR. It was formally approved Friday by a voice vote of members of the Democratic National Committee's Rules and Bylaws Committee. \"We feel strongly that this window reflects our values, paints a vibrant picture of our nation, and creates a strong process that will result in the best Democratic nominee,\" said committee member Minyon Moore of Washington, D.C. The proposal now goes to the full DNC for ratification early next year. For decades, presidential hopefuls have faced their first tests with voters in the heavily white states of Iowa and New Hampshire. In a letter to the committee endorsing an overhaul of the calendar, Biden stressed the party's diversity. \"We must ensure that voters of color have a voice in choosing our nominee much earlier in the process and throughout the entire early window,\" Biden wrote. \"For decades, Black voters in particular have been the backbone of the Democratic Party but have been pushed to the back of the early primary process,\" he wrote. \"We rely on these voters in elections but have not recognized their importance in our nominating calendar. It is time to stop taking these votes for granted, and time to give them a louder and earlier voice in the process.\" Biden added Democrats should \"no longer allow caucuses as part of our nominating process,\" a foundational principle that the Rules and Bylaws Committee had set in weighing which states to elevate to the early window. Iowa holds caucuses, and Nevada recently moved away from them. Biden also called on the committee to review the calendar every four years in order to \"ensure that it continues to reflect the values and diversity of our party and country.\" Iowa's Scott Brennan and New Hampshire's Joanne Dowdell were the only two committee members to vote against the early window plan. \"While I support the guiding principles established by this committee and reinforced by the president, I cannot support the proposal before us,\" Brennan said. \"We are now faced with a situation in which no state situated in the Central or Mountain time zone is represented in the pre-window.\" He warned: \"Small rural states like Iowa must have a voice in our presidential nominating process. Democrats cannot forget about entire groups of voters in the heart of the Midwest, without doing significant damage to the party for a generation.\" Dowdell of New Hampshire added she agrees with Biden's \"bold statement about his vision for this country [and] the importance of diversity.\" \"I will, however, say that New Hampshire does have a statute. We do have a law and we will not be breaking our law,\" she said. New Hampshire state law gives its secretary of state the power to move up the date of the primary to protect its first-in-the-nation status. Dowdell's pledge echoes the New Hampshire Democratic Party's vow on Thursday, after news of Biden's preferences broke: \"We will be holding our primary first.\" \"The DNC did not give New Hampshire the first-in-the-nation primary and it is not theirs to take away,\" NHDP Chair Ray Buckley said in a statement. \"We have survived past attempts over the decades and we will survive this.\" New Hampshire's Democratic U.S. senators also opposed Biden's proposal, with Sen. Maggie Hassan writing on Twitter: \"Because of our state's small size, candidates from all walks of life \u2014 not just the ones with the largest war chests \u2014 are able to compete and engage in the unique retail politics that are a hallmark of our state. This ensures that candidates are battle-tested and ready to compete for our nation's highest office.\" Hassan also said \"New Hampshire's law is clear and our primary will continue to be First in the Nation.\" This sets off an interesting dynamic. The committee approved waivers to allow South Carolina, Nevada, New Hampshire, Georgia and Michigan to hold their primaries in the early window. The waivers specify the date that each state needs to hold its primary, and are issued on a contingent basis, meaning states must meet the requirements of the waiver in order for them to be able to hold their primary in the early window. The committee detailed actions the DNC is prepared to take to enforce the waivers and the early state order. If states don't comply with their waivers, then they are obligated to go in the later primary window. If a state were to hold its primary early anyway, the state would automatically lose half its delegates. Presidential candidates would also be precluded from campaigning in any state that goes outside the DNC-approved window. The committee noted that in this context, campaigning includes putting a candidate's name on the ballot in that state. Tom Perez, a former DNC chair, anticipated such a move in an interview with NPR prior to the release of Biden's proposal. \"If the state decides, to heck with what the DNC said, they do that at their peril,\" he said. \"[Not seating delegates is] a pretty blunt instrument,\" Perez underscored. \"If your delegates don't matter in a convention, you're not going to be very happy as a state.\" Chaos erupted in Des Moines, Iowa, on Feb. 3, 2020, as reporters pressed election officials on why the Democratic caucus results were so delayed.\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Chaos erupted in Des Moines, Iowa, on Feb. 3, 2020, as reporters pressed election officials on why the Democratic caucus results were so delayed. Criticism of Iowa and New Hampshire's grip on the top two spots of the presidential nominating calendar has been brewing for years. Many Democrats have long argued the pair don't reflect the party's racial diversity. Technical issues in the 2020 Iowa caucuses that made it difficult to announce a winner only intensified the momentum to adjust the calendar. In the spring, the DNC approved a resolution that upended the traditional presidential nominating calendar, which places the Iowa caucuses first, followed by primaries in New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. The DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee invited states and territories to apply to be considered for the early window of states, and 16 states plus Puerto Rico made formal pitches to the committee over the summer. The committee was transparent about what it's looking for: demographic diversity, states that have primaries rather than caucuses, election administration, and how competitive a state will be in the general election. \"In the case of the Democratic Party, there is a template that the first four states will represent for the four principal regions of the country,\" Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told NPR ahead of the DNC's meeting. \"And so if Iowa is displaced, then the replacement will have to be another state from the Midwest.\" Michigan is fresh off of big election wins for Democrats, with a more diverse population than Iowa. At Friday's meeting, committee member Ray Curry of Michigan touted what the state's new calendar slot would mean for labor. \"Michigan is the home to more than 500,000 union members,\" he said. \"That's more union members than we had in the early window previously, and it's a game changer for working Americans.\" Though as a red state it's not competitive in the general election, South Carolina also had a strong argument to remain in the early window. \"South Carolina was the first opportunity for Black voters who are really the backbone of the Democratic Party to have a meaningful say,\" Perez said. \"So I think one thing that needs to happen is we shouldn't be waiting for until the fourth primary or caucus to have Black voters have their opportunity to be heard.\" Nevada was also angling for first place. Advocates point to its growing AAPI and Latino populations, a heavy union presence and a mix of urban and rural areas. DNC member Yvanna Cancela was part of the team that pitched Nevada to the committee over the summer. \"Nevada has a 24-hour economy, and Democrats over the last decade have done the work to ensure our 24-hour economy doesn't hold people back from having as much access to the ballot box as possible,\" Cancela previously told NPR, pointing to the state's early voting period, mail-in balloting and same-day voter registration. \"It's also a two-media-market state, which makes it affordable to campaign on airwaves,\" Cancela said. \"We are big enough to truly test a nominee, but we are also small enough for candidates who are more of a long shot to be able to compete.\" Perez praised Nevada for passing a law last year establishing it will use a primary in 2024 and not a caucus, which he said guarantees higher participation rates. \"Nevada should be in that early mix,\" he said. \"They should be rewarded for doing that because they are embodying a critical principle of maximizing participation.\" Committee member David McDonald of Washington raised a concern about having Nevada and New Hampshire on the same day. \"I think we ought to have some kind of flexibility in the calendar to make those separate days,\" he said. \"I think it's a confusing message to have them on the same day, frankly, and it may dilute the importance of each of the states because they will be in a constant comparison with the other side and getting divided press.\" Opening states not only get outsized attention from presidential candidates but also get millions of dollars injected into their economy. \"If you're in an early primary or caucus state and you happen to own a hotel, that's really good news for you,\" Galston said. \"Owning a restaurant is a good thing, if you have a rental car company \u2014 you've hit the jackpot. It's not just a week, we're talking about months and months.\" Candidates and their campaign staff spend a disproportionate amount of time in early states, which means residents not only benefit economically, they also get to spend more time vetting presidential hopefuls. Generations of voters in New Hampshire have treated the ability to kick the tires of presidential candidates as their political birthright. \"There's a famous story about a new New Hampshire voter who was asked what he thought of a particular candidate,\" Galston said. \"The voter replied, 'Well, it's too early to say yet, I've only met him three times.' \"",

But Democrats are shaking up the calendar with states like Nevada angling to go first.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: For decades, presidential hopefuls have faced their first tests with voters in Iowa and New Hampshire. Now, as NPR's Barbara Spunt reports, Democrats are shaking up the calendar with states like Nevada angling to go first. BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: On Friday, the Democratic National Committee will begin the process of selecting which handful of states will hold their primaries first in 2024. ARTIE BLANCO: I get a little giddy and definitely little butterflies. SPRUNT: That's Artie Blanco, an activist in Nevada who sits on the committee. Blanco thinks her state has the goods to move from third on the calendar to first. BLANCO: It really is a microcosm of the entire country. SPRUNT: Criticism of Iowa and New Hampshire's grip on the top two spots of the presidential nominating calendar has been brewing for years. Many Democrats argue the pair doesn't reflect the party's racial diversity. The DNC invited states and territories to apply for the early window. Seventeen made formal pitches over the summer. The committee is weighing a few factors - demographic diversity, competitiveness and election administration. That has Blanco feeling confident. BLANCO: Nevada checks every single box - our diversity, our economy, union members. We have rural areas. We have urban areas. SPRUNT: Outside groups are praising its diversity, too. Mi Familia Vota, a Latino civic engagement organization, has endorsed Nevada, a state with growing populations of AAPI and Latino voters. Here's the group's CEO, Hector Sanchez Barba. HECTOR SANCHEZ BARBA: The states that go first at the moment are not reflective of the diversity and the composition of the nation. So Nevada represents an opportunity for the Democratic Party to evolve. SPRUNT: And the state has a new arrow in its quiver. It was a Nevada Democrat who clinched Senate control last month. DNC member Yvanna Cancela was part of the team that pitched Nevada to the committee. A big part of the argument - voter access. YVANNA CANCELA: Democrats have done the work to ensure that our 24-hour economy doesn't hold people back. We have over two weeks of early voting, mail-in ballots, same-day voter registration. SPRUNT: Nevada passed a law last year establishing it will use a primary in 2024, not a caucus. That's another thing the committee prefers. Lastly, Cancela says Nevada is a state where candidates can campaign without breaking the bank. CANCELA: It's also a two-media market state, which makes it affordable to campaign on airwaves. And we are big enough to truly test a nominee but small enough for candidates who are more of a longshot to be able to compete. SPRUNT: But Nevada is just one state aggressively jockeying to be among the first to hold contests. Iowa and New Hampshire want to hold on to their top spots. There's South Carolina, whose Black voters played a crucial role in the 2020 election. And Michigan and Minnesota, fresh off of big election wins for Democrats, are vying to be the new voice of the Midwest. There's complications to the calendar, too. New Hampshire, for instance, a critical purple state, has a law that gives the secretary of state the power to move up the date of the contest to protect its first-in-the-nation status. TOM PEREZ: Now, I've heard from a few states that, oh, we have a state law that says we must go first. A state can't pass a law telling the Democratic Party who has to go first. SPRUNT: That's former DNC chair Tom Perez. PEREZ: If they want to insist on continuing to go first in contravention of whatever rules and procedures the Democratic National Committee puts in place, well, there is a remedy. SPRUNT: That remedy is the DNC not seating delegates at the nominating convention - a major blow to a state party. Perez adds that reimagining the calendar could also mean multiple states hold their primaries on the same day. PEREZ: As long as they're small enough so that it doesn't simply reward somebody who has all the money. SPRUNT: Once the rules committee votes on the new slate of states, it will go to the full DNC for its approval. Barbara Sprunt, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Kate Sosin, LGBTQ+ reporter for The 19th News, to discuss how voters responded to anti-trans rhetoric in this years midterm elections.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: We want to say again that as we are speaking now, authorities in Colorado haven't yet determined what motivated the person connected to the shooting at Club Q, but there is no question that attacks like these on places that members of the LGBTQ community considered safe provoke terror among people who use them. And it is also the case that this attack took place against the backdrop of a wave of anti-gay and anti-trans rhetoric espoused by some candidates and officials in the course of the most recent midterm elections. That strategy turned out to be a mixed bag. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who championed what critics call the state's \"Don't Say Gay\" bill, won reelection by nearly 20 points, while Michigan Republican gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon, one of the candidates who used some of the harshest rhetoric against the transgender community, lost the race for governor by sweeping margins. But there are signs that this won't end with the midterms. Former President Donald Trump used similar rhetoric last week during his 2024 campaign announcement. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: We will not let men, as an example, participate in women's sports. Is that OK? No men. No men. MARTIN: We thought it would be useful to consider how anti-gay and anti-trans rhetoric is being used on the campaign trail and why it seems to work in some races, but not others. For that, we call Kate Sosin. They are the LGBTQ+ reporter for The 19th. That's a nonprofit news outlet that focuses on gender policy and politics. And they are with us now. Kate Sosin, welcome. Thanks so much for joining us. KATE SOSIN: Thank you for having me, Michel. MARTIN: Could you start with an explanation, for people who don't necessarily follow these issues, of how would you define anti-trans rhetoric? SOSIN: There's really been two kinds of, I guess, bills or topics that we've seen come up, and this is since the advent of marriage equality in 2015. One, yes, is that sports issue of - we don't want to see men in women's sports, which is really just a way of basically misgendering transgender women and girls and saying that we don't want them to play sports. And then the other big issue that we see is this confusion around what is gender-affirming medical care. So for many, many years now, all of the medical associations have come together and agreed that if a person has gender dysphoria, which basically means that if you don't identify with the gender that you were assigned at birth and you maybe need a medical intervention or change, counseling, anything like that, then here's the care that we all agree on, right? Doctors, scientists - everyone came together years ago and agreed on the care. In recent years, politicians have come together and opposed that care, especially for minors. MARTIN: So is this mainly a Republican campaign issue? And is there a particular reason that you've identified why it seemed to take off this year? SOSIN: From everything we can tell, it is a Republican issue and it's part of getting at that extreme, religious right base in the Republican Party. The reality is most people are not actually anti-trans or anti-LGBTQ. MARTIN: And how do you know that? SOSIN: So poll after poll shows that the vast majority of Americans support LGBTQ nondiscrimination protections, same-sex marriage, and that the more that people actually have LGBTQ people in their lives, the more likely they are to support trans issues. So we have data, and there's quite a bit of it, from the HRC that says, you know, less than 5% of people identified gender-affirming care for transgender youth or participation in sports as a motivating issue for why they voted. What we found, though, is that this is an issue in which people can sort of put it in this bucket of wokeism (ph), right? And that is something that appeals really heavily to the Republican base. MARTIN: Why do you think it worked in some places and not others? SOSIN: Well, I think the question is not, you know, why did it work or not, but to what extent did it work, right? MARTIN: OK. I see. SOSIN: I don't think that it's the top thing that comes to mind for a lot of voters. I do think that this issue is what is used to make a lot of noise. So I think that Donald Trump gave us the template for, you know, the loud, brash, sort of anti-woke candidate who can make a lot of news and get a lot of attention by saying things that are really outlandish, and it is really outlandish to misgender people. It is really outlandish to try to one-up each other in the media and to get attention. And the more we give these candidates attention for this, there's a reward, there's a payoff. And so I think that we'll see a lot more of this in primaries, but in the general, I don't know that it will fly. MARTIN: Kate, beyond the rhetoric, there is a real legislative battle taking place around trans rights at the state level. Can you tell us about that? SOSIN: So this year, legislatures and statehouses introduced 344 anti-LGBTQ+ bills in this session. Twenty-five of them did pass. We have to acknowledge this - it's a backlash, right? There's more LGBTQ people in media than ever before. And in 2018 midterms, they called it a rainbow wave. More than 400 queer candidates were on the ballot. In - this year, four years later, there were 1,065 queer candidates on the ballot, and 340 were elected. So there's just an explosion of representation of queer people. The world is changing, and this is the backlash against it. MARTIN: So, Kate, before we let you go, you covered the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Florida. I was wondering if there are any takeaways that you have from that experience as you consider the impact of the shooting last night and what impact that might have on political discourse going forward. SOSIN: We've seen attack after attack on LGBTQ+ people. The Human Rights Campaign is reporting that nearly 1 in 5 types of hate crimes are motivated by anti-LGBTQ bias. And, you know, it's really hard to separate this incident in the minds of folks from this rhetoric. Whether or not this was a hate-motivated incident, we don't know, but it is a really hard moment, I think, for a lot of us to sit in. MARTIN: That was Kate Sosin. They are the LGBTQ+ reporter for The 19th. That's a nonprofit newsroom that reports on gender politics and policy. Kate Sosin, thanks so much for talking to us on this difficult day. SOSIN: Thank you so much. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "Gas prices got a lot of attention in the midterms, but high housing costs are a bigger chunk of people's budgets. In cities around the country, voters approved more spending on affordable housing.  ELISSA NADWORNY, HOST: Affordable housing measures were on midterm election ballots in dozens of localities across the country. It's a sign of the pain people have been feeling as a historic housing shortage has pushed rents and home prices to record highs. And a number of cities just approved hundreds of millions of dollars in new spending to do something about it - potentially billions of dollars once the final ballots are counted in some places. NPR's Jennifer Ludden is here to tell us more. Hi, Jennifer. JENNIFER LUDDEN, BYLINE: Hi there. NADWORNY: So what kinds of things will cities be able to do now that they have this new spending? LUDDEN: Lots of different things, but generally, they'll be able to build or subsidize more affordable housing, repair existing housing, buy land for more housing. Some measures are for workforce housing - you know, police officers or firefighters who can't afford to live where their job is. And some will help keep people out of homelessness. Tara Raghuveer is with KC Tenants, which helped pass the Kansas City measure to require deeply affordable housing. That's rent around 5- to $700. She's been frustrated the gas prices get all the attention these midterms, and she says housing is a much bigger chunk of people's budgets. And unlike gas, it doesn't go back down - only up. TARA RAGHUVEER: There is not a county in the country where a worker earning minimum wage and working full time can afford a two-bedroom apartment. And that's been true now for years. And also, this is no longer a city issue, but it's one that's expanding out to the suburbs and even rural communities. LUDDEN: I should add two measures elsewhere that appear close to passing. Colorado would designate nearly 2% of state income tax revenues for affordable housing, and Los Angeles could raise an enormous amount by taxing property sales over $5 million. NADWORNY: Can you step back and remind us how did we get to this point? Why can so many people not afford rent or find a house that they can afford to buy? LUDDEN: So many reasons, but just a couple big ones. You know, after the last housing crash in 2008, U.S. construction dropped off for a good decade. We're millions of units in the hole. And federal spending on affordable housing has really declined in recent decades. All this has big consequences for the country's racial gap in homeownership. It's actually widened. And now, higher mortgage rates don't help. Last week, the National Association of Realtors said the share of first-time homebuyers had dropped to a record low. It found those who can buy are older, whiter, wealthier and a lot are getting help, like, from their parents or even dipping into their own retirement or other savings for a down payment. NADWORNY: So is all this going to help make a difference for renters or people trying to buy a house? LUDDEN: You know, I put that to Yonah Freemark at the Urban Institute - who, by the way, thinks it's pretty remarkable so many voters approve this spending even as they struggle with inflation. But his answer was a bit of a downer. YONAH FREEMARK: You know, affordable housing is going to be a struggle that I think we're all going to face for the rest of our lifetimes, no matter our age. And these measures will certainly open up thousands of units across the country that will become permanently affordable for low- and moderate-income people. But it will not solve our housing crisis. LUDDEN: So yeah, Freemark says everyone at every level just needs to keep at it, finding new ways to create housing people can actually afford. NADWORNY: NPR's Jennifer Ludden, thank you. LUDDEN: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

Follow live updates and election results here. Democrat Wes Moore has made history in Maryland as the state's first Black governor, according to a race call by the Associated Press. He is only the third Black governor elected in the country. Loading... Moore's win puts the governorship back in Democrats' hands after two terms of Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, one of the country's most popular governors. Polling before the election showed Moore with a double-digit lead over his Republican opponent, Maryland Del. Dan Cox. Cox, a far-right lawmaker, had received a coveted \u2013 if polarizing \u2013 endorsement from former President Donald Trump. But a nod from the anti-establishment standard-bearer was not enough to overcome steep odds in the state, where Democrats and moderate Republicans typically win the most votes. Moore, a political newcomer is a longtime businessman and philanthropist who ran on a platform of eliminating childhood poverty and ensuring Maryland remains a state dedicated to reproductive rights. Despite having never held public office, Moore has quickly emerged as a rising star among Democrats, garnering the endorsement of national Democrats and celebrities, including Oprah Winfrey, President Biden and former President Barack Obama. While Moore has not shied away from the historic aspect of his win, which includes the lieutenant governor-elect Aruna Miller \u2014 an Indian-American woman who will become the first immigrant to hold statewide office in Maryland \u2014 he has made it clear that his primary concern is to make history in his governance. \"We're not in this race to make history. We're in this race because we have a unique opportunity to make child poverty history [...] We have a unique opportunity to make the racial wealth gap history,\" the Rhodes scholar and Army combat veteran told supporters last month. \"Now is our time.\"More Election 2022 coverage:",

            "article_content": "As voters go to the polls, we check in with reporters in three battleground states: Georgia, Arizona and Wisconsin.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Let's look now at three states where voter turnout could make all the difference and help determine the balance of power in Washington. Georgia, Arizona and Wisconsin are all swing states, and we've got reporters in each of them, starting with NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben in Oconomowoc, Wis. Danielle, what's on the minds of voters that you've been talking with today? DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Well, let's start with Democrats here. And for them, a lot of them will tell you that democracy is on the ballot. And, of course, you'll hear that everywhere from a lot of people. But it seems to mean something at least a little different for each voter. Let me start with a woman named Georgann Dockery (ph). I met her at a rally for the incumbent Democratic governor, Tony Evers. She said democracy is her top issue. And I asked her, OK, what does that mean? And here's how she responded. GEORGANN DOCKERY: Well, it's important for women's health. It's important for Social Security. It's important for everything that we need to do - our religious rights, everything. And I want to make sure that I was out here to support. KURTZLEBEN: So voters see this as a - a lot of them will tell you, as the most important election of their lifetimes. We've been hearing that in a lot of elections recently. And - but Democrats will tell you that democracy is their top issue and that it safeguards all of the other issues that they care about. Here in Wisconsin specifically, one of the things that that means to Democrats is that the Republican-led legislature has been trying to pass laws in recent years to tighten voting laws, for example, around absentee voting. Now, Governor Tony Evers has vetoed those. So one question tonight is whether Evers will win the governorship. But even if he does, it's possible that Republicans could win a veto-proof majority in the state legislature. So there is a lot that Democrats are thinking about, gaming out. And one other thing is, of course, abortion, like Georgann mentioned there. It's a really huge issue here. After the Dobbs ruling this year, an 1800s-era law - at least one that originated then - went into effect here that has very few exceptions banning abortions. So, yes, voters here see this as a hugely important election. SHAPIRO: And what about the importance of inflation to voters in Wisconsin, which we're hearing a lot about how important this is to voters? KURTZLEBEN: Yeah. Once again, if you ask some Republican voters, they will tell you this is the most important election because inflation. That was certainly true for Diane Koop (ph). I met her at a rally in Madison for incumbent Republican Senator Ron Johnson. Here's what she said. DIANE KOOP: Every year, they say this is the biggest and most important election. This is really big. If we can't stop the Democrats and their out-of-control spending, our dollar means nothing any more because they keep printing more and more and more. So this is really important to try and put a check on their power. KURTZLEBEN: And, of course, this is something that you often hear from the party that is out of power, out of, for example, the White House during midterms, which is we need to put a check on the other party's power. So you hear a lot of that from Republicans. SHAPIRO: All right. Let's turn to Arizona now, where NPR's Ximena Bustillo is in Phoenix. And, Ximena, what have you been hearing from voters on the subject of inflation? XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Yes. I mean, definitely agree that inflation and rising gas and food prices definitely continue to be on the minds of voters across the political spectrum unprompted when asked what it is that they care about. And that's why some analysts are saying that Arizona in this election is sort of a referendum on the Biden administration and a referendum on the America First movement. The results could be telling of which direction the state wants to go and what it sees as solutions to larger issues like the rising prices. I talked to voters who blame Biden for inflation and want to reject the Democrats, not necessarily vote for the Republicans. JASON CHIN: It was kind of more of a I'm not voting for Mark Kelly than voting for Blake Masters. That's more of what it is with that race. BUSTILLO: And that was Jason Chin (ph). I met him during a GOP rally yesterday where he was dead set on voting on some of the GOP candidates but not on all the others. But he definitely didn't want to continue voting in the Democrats. However, at the same time, I've also talked to voters who are voting for Democrats despite high inflation because they fear some of the GOP talking points about democracy and election security, particularly in Arizona, which we know was the center of a lot of election conspiracy theories after 2020. SHAPIRO: What about President Biden's message that democracy is on the ballot? Does that seem to be resonating with the voters you're talking to? BUSTILLO: There are quite a few candidates on the GOP side of the ballot, including Secretary of State candidate Mark Finchem and the governor candidate, Kari Lake, that throughout the campaign have either denied the 2020 election results or hedged on whether or not they will accept defeat if that happens later. However, many voters still believe that it's their civic duty to vote, whether it's by mail or in person. I went to a couple locations earlier this morning, Chandler Gilbert Community College and the Gilbert Public Works Department, both in areas that are traditionally more Republican leaning, and both had steady turnout. And almost everyone - Republicans, independents and Democrats - when I first asked them why it is that they were there and what brought them out, instead of some policy proposals, they said that it was because it's their responsibility, and it's their job as American citizens to vote. So whether or not that's the whole idea of democracy being on the ballot, that depends on how the elections kind of turn out. SHAPIRO: All right. Finally, let's get the view from Georgia, where Stephen Fowler of Georgia Public Broadcasting is in Atlanta. And, Stephen, the Republican candidates for governor and secretary of state there have both defended the 2020 election results. How is that democracy message we've been talking about playing with voters in Georgia? STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: So, Ari, it's a really interesting situation here. Voters, by and large, are over false claims of election fraud. In the Republican primary this year, they overwhelmingly supported incumbents like Governor Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who pushed back heavily on those claims. That means some of these candidates might get more bipartisan support than usual. And it's really harder to say that the fight for democracy is on the ballot when everybody from both major parties agrees about elections and election results. But Democrats say that not committing treason and not overturning the election is a very low bar and is a bare minimum, not the maximum those people should do. And they argue voting for Democratic candidates is better for democracy in the bigger national picture, especially considering states like Arizona we just heard about where election deniers have a chance of winning. SHAPIRO: Georgia is also one of a handful of states that could determine whether Republicans control the Senate. Is the national importance of Georgia's Senate race something that voters are aware of, is important to them? FOWLER: Absolutely. You know, in many ways, it kind of feels like \"Groundhog Day\" because just like in 2020 and 2021 runoffs, Georgia here is a place where there's close races, national attention, the potential to decide who controls the chamber of Congress. I mean, I've heard from voters on both sides of the aisle who say their choice, especially in the Senate race, is absolutely more about what they think is right for the direction of our country and not just the Peach State. SHAPIRO: That is Stephen Fowler of Georgia Public Broadcasting in Atlanta, NPR's Ximena Bustillo in Phoenix, Ariz., and NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben in Oconomowoc, Wis. Thanks to all three of you. KURTZLEBEN: No problem. FOWLER: Thank you. BUSTILLO: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

But the reality is more complicated.\n                \n                    \n                    Tillsonburg/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Americans are being inundated with messaging about a surge in crime rates. But the reality is more complicated. The specter of rising crime has become a central point of the 2022 midterm elections. It's been on heavy rotation in Republican campaign ads, and nightly it's the topic de jour on Fox News. Even much of the mainstream media is covering crime as though the country is in the middle of some kind of crisis, defacto accepting the political narrative \u2014 especially, but not exclusively, the Republican narrative. But is there actually a crime wave? Turns out the answer is deeply complicated. So is the question. Start with the FBI crime stats from 2021, \"the big takeaways were crime is up on some measures and it's down on others,\" says Insha Rahman of the Vera Institute of Justice. In broad strokes \u2014 up on homicides, down on property crimes \u2014 similar to 2020. But those numbers come with a giant asterisk. Because of a long-planned change in reporting standards, most cities did not report their 2021 crime numbers to the FBI. \"It's turned our crime data into this sort of giant black hole I don't think we'll ever actually be able to undo,\" according to John Pfaff, a law professor at Fordham University. \"I think 2021 will always just be a giant gap in our narrative.\" Even when we have more complete data, the stories we tell about crime are filled with holes that misinformation can crawl into and take up residence. \"A big mistake we make with crime narratives is the effort to tell a narrative,\" Pfaff says. \"Crime is deeply local.\" Telling a single story of crime will always result in a Frankenstein, he says, because it requires grafting together multiple stories, often with very different arcs. Pfaff points to 2020, when there was an \"unambiguous nationwide increase in homicides.\" \"There's no denying that, but what's interesting is that if you look at it sort of city by city, the patterns by which it happens vary,\" Pfaff says. Another problem? Too often we base the story of rising crime on increments of time that are statistically meaningless. \"Both journalists and elected officials have a habit of comparing crime today to crime last year,\" says Robert Vargas, a sociologist at the University of Chicago. Even looking across a few years only gives us a hastily taken snapshot that's out of focus and badly framed. \"There's absolutely no systemic or scientifically informed way of thinking about crime trends\" in this short term way, Vargas says. Which is why, when it comes to crime, it's imperative to take the long view, says Rena Karefa-Johnson, with the advocacy group Fwd.Us. \"It is often lost that there are certain crimes like property crimes that are actually at historic lows,\" she says. \"For the crimes like gun homicide that have increased and spiked and that we really need to focus on, we're still not talking about rates anywhere near the historic highs of the nineties.\" \"People were 80% less likely to be a victim of violent crime in 2021 compared to 1993,\" she says. What is rising, unhinged from the complex facts on the ground, is the frenzied narrative around rising crime. What we mean when we talk about crime To really understand how we count crime, it is imperative to understand what crimes count. \"We generally talk about, 'crime is up' or 'crime is down,'\" Pfaff says. \"It's referring to sort of this small core set of what the FBI calls index one crimes.\" That's murder, robbery, rape, aggravated assault, larceny, burglary, auto theft, and arson. Over a century ago, those crimes were selected by a group of police chiefs to develop a system of uniform crime statistics. Other than the addition of arson in 1979, the list remains unchanged. \"I don't think crime data tells you all that much,\" says Vargas. \"It tells you how police behave as an organization.\" In this system, shoplifting tampons or diapers counts as crime, but tax evasion, environmental crimes, and wage theft do not. Police aren't even responsible for investigating those crimes. \"Wage theft is a problem about five times the magnitude of shoplifting,\" says Alec Karakatsanis, an activist, lawyer and executive director of Civil Rights Corps. \"Wage theft is when companies steal money from usually low-income workers,\" he explains. Estimates are that this kind of theft costs workers $50 billion a year. In the past decade the estimated cost of tax fraud has risen to $1 trillion a year \u2014 most of it stolen by the wealthy and corporations. The way the system is set up perpetrators of what we call crime are more likely to be poor people, because that's how crime is defined. The data is biased in another way too, Vargas says, by who police choose to target as criminals. \"They're going after people selling drugs, people committing traffic violations, oftentimes in poor neighborhoods, poor Black and brown neighborhoods and not other neighborhoods.\" Numerous studies have shown that Black and brown people are policed and arrested at much higher levels than white people. \"If you are a teenager who gets in a physical fight and you're Black in a public school in New York, that's crime,\" says Karefa-Johnson. \"You get arrested by the police, you get taken into criminal court and you're charged with assault,\" she says. But when white teenagers get into a fight, \"specifically white children who go to private schools or go to schools in more affluent areas where there are no police in the classroom, it's not something that we see thought about as a crime.\" Karefa-Johnson says our understanding of crime is constructed by choices - choices to not include white collar crime, choices to target poor people of color - made by those in power. \"Crime is very much a social construct,\" she says. \"I know it can be made to feel like something that is more objective or something that is more long-standing, a category that has its own gravitas. But it's very much a reflection of who's in power, of the way that society is ordered and that the way we want to keep it ordered.\" Crime is a story that we are told, and the people who write the first draft of that story, down to defining the language, are the police. The politics of police \"A lot of the big police departments have really big media departments,\" Pfaff says. \"They have press information officers that are out there really trying to structure the narrative.\" Police are political actors, not reliable narrators. \"When people talk about a crime wave, they're basing that on a very distorted set of data the police themselves are manipulating and curating for their own political reasons.\" Karakatsanis points out another set of crimes that doesn't make it into police stats: \"crimes committed by police themselves.\" Police unions are deeply political entities, most often found lobbying against criminal justice reform, progressive prosecutors and for Republicans, like their support for former President Donald Trump. That's playing out across the country right now. In the Wisconsin senate race the Fraternal Order of Police, alongside a majority of Sheriffs and other law enforcement agencies, have thrown their political weight behind the incumbent, \"tough-on-crime\" Republican Ron Johnson. Johnson has also called the criminal Jan. 6th attack on the Capitol \"a peaceful protest.\" In 2021, he told conservative talk show host Joe Pag, \"I knew those were people that love this country, that truly respect law enforcement, would never do anything to break the law.\" He added that had they been \"Black Lives Matter and Antifa protesters, I might have been a little concerned.\" Unlike the insurrection, the Black Lives Matter racial justice protests of the summer of 2020 were mostly peaceful. The response to them by police was not. The ad game That same brand of thinly veiled racism in Johnson's comments about Black Lives Matter was on display in campaign ads against his Democratic challenger, Mandela Barnes. In one, paid for by the Senate Leadership Fund, a narrator asks the viewer, \"do you feel safe?' while ominous music thumps in the background. \"Mandela Barnes would eliminate cash bail, setting accused criminals free into the community before trial, even with shootings, robberies, carjackings, violent attacks on our police. More than 300 murders last year alone. Yet Barnes has even supported defunding the police. Mandela Barnes, he stands with them, not us.\" The not so subtle suggestion being that Barnes, who is Black, stands with the images of the alleged criminals in the ad, all of whom are also Black. The ad not only attacks Barnes, but also bail reform. It's been a popular target of the right, in lockstep with police, claiming that it will let violent suspects \u2014 almost always depicted as Black and brown \u2014 out onto the street. That's despite a lack of evidence that shows a connection between bail reform and increased crime. \"This is like climate science denial, right?\" Karakatsanis says. \"We know from the actual evidence the things that determine the level of crime or violence or harm in a society are bigger structural factors.\" He lists off some examples \u2014 poverty and inequality, early childhood education, and access to mental health care. Still in places such as Wisconsin, ads that push the narrative of a crime wave have been working, says the Vera Institute for Justice's Insha Rahman. \"When those narratives go unchecked, because there's huge amounts of money and private interests behind these ads, they are incredibly potent and powerful,\" she says. \"They have a real impact on what happens in our elections because they play to people's emotions and perceptions and fears.\" Crime is, for many people, a metaphor for deeper fears, says law professor John Pfaff. \"We use crime as a shorthand for fear of other people, especially people of color,\" he says. \"We use it as a proxy for deeper racial fears that white people don't feel comfortable expressing.\" Republicans continue to be seen by many voters as better on crime, Rahman says, even when people know their \"tough on crime\" solutions have repeatedly proven unsuccessful. \"When it's the only option on offer, it's what people go to because in the absence of a proactive, affirmative vision for safety, you pick the thing that you know, even if you know it doesn't really work.\" Democrats, she says, have failed to give any alternative for what safety could look like. Just examine the accusation \u2014 like the one falsely made against Mandela Barnes \u2014 that Democrats want to \"defund the police.\" Rahman says most Democrats go on the defensive by saying, \"No, no, I wanna fund the police.\" \"Turns out, at least from the polling, that's not a very effective tactic. But that's the only response that we are seeing to those attacks.\" People are looking for a different, more complex vision for safety, Rahman says, they just aren't finding it. Perhaps the groups most desperate for real policies that lead to safety are those who are most impacted by violent crime, especially homicide \u2014 which spiked in 2020 and has remained high in some places, says Rena Karefa-Johnson. The largest increase in murders in 2020 were actually in Republican-led states and cities. But all this messaging around crime is not meant for those who bare its brunt, Karefa-Johnson says. \"The communities that are most uniquely harmed by gun violence,\" she says, \"are also the communities that are most uniquely harmed by long sentences, by pretrial detention, by draconian approaches to criminal justice reform.\" Backlash We've seen these crime wave narratives crest before. In the mid-1960s and '70s we saw the emergence of the \"tough on crime\" lexicon, the language that accompanies the politics of \"law and order\" \u2014 describing a surge of crime, riots and lawlessness rampant in \"dangerous\" cities \u2014 especially, of course, presumed lawlessness in Black neighborhoods. That was the dawn of a certain kind of American war: The war on crime, the war on drugs, the revival of the death penalty, felon disenfranchisement statutes, and the start of a still ongoing project of mass incarceration. What was going on in those \"lawless\" cities across the United States? Riots that, like Watts in 1965, have come to be understood by many scholars and activists as uprisings against police violence, racism, and oppression. In the South there were nonviolent protests led by Black freedom fighters, although there was violence there too, coming from the police's side. It was \"the largest civil rights protests this country had ever seen,\" says Rahman. Until the protests that swept across the country in the summer of 2020. \"We are seeing that same kind of backlash of weaponizing issues of crime and safety today,\" she says. \"It's very important for powerful people, especially in moments of uprising and moments of social unrest, to attempt to create a moral panic around crime,\" says Karakatsanis. Moral panics are a way of pushing back against change or reform, a way of preserving the status quo. But this time it isn't about keeping things the way they have been, Karakatsanis says, because while the Republican Party is running on a moral panic about crime, they are also openly anti-democratic. \"The reactionary backlash against the protests of 2020 is coming at a time when this country is hurtling fast toward fascist and authoritarian life,\" he says. And in response to the rising threat of fascism, both Republicans and Democrats are calling for more police.",

            "article_content": "Michigan's only current Black member of Congress, Democrat Brenda Lawrence, is retiring, leaving an open seat to represent much of Detroit.\n                \n                    \n                    Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Michigan's only current Black member of Congress, Democrat Brenda Lawrence, is retiring, leaving an open seat to represent much of Detroit. DETROIT \u2014 For the first time in almost 70 years, this traditionally blue city, home to one of the largest African American populations in the nation, will not have a Black Democrat in Congress. Detroiters could elect a Black Republican to the U.S. House. But GOP candidates face a skeptical voting bloc in this Democratic stronghold. It's the first general election since an independent commission redrew Michigan's legislative boundaries, breaking the district covering Detroit into two pieces and adding several suburban areas, split between blue-collar and more affluent communities. Shortly after redistricting, Michigan's only Black member of Congress, Democrat Brenda Lawrence, decided to retire. That left an open seat to represent much of the Motor City. And the candidate who emerged from the district's crowded Democratic primary in August as Lawrence's possible successor is not an African American. At a recent get-out-the-vote rally inside a Detroit high school, Lawrence worried that the city could pay a price if no Black Democrat replaced her. \"I'm the vice chair of the Congressional Black Caucus,\" she said. \"And I know there are often issues that directly impact us left off the table. If you don't have the Black representation, you don't get a voice.\" Lawrence said some GOP colleagues on Capitol Hill simply avoid her concerns. She noted one recent argument in particular over student debt and income inequality with a U.S. House member who is both Republican and Black. \"And he dismissed it all,\" she said. \"He said, 'Oh that's not an issue. I made it. If anybody wants it they can make it in America.' Just ignoring the fact that there are inherent barriers that the Black community experiences. And as a Black man he just foo-fooed it and walked away.\" Democrats hope to get Black voters, often a backbone of the party, especially in urban areas, engaged in those issues \u2014 and headed to the polls on Election Day. The party has in recent days deployed former President Barack Obama to headline rallies in several cities with significant African American populations. His event in Detroit attracted thousands of people. But Detroit's city clerk predicts only about one-third of the Motor City electorate will actually turn out to vote this year. That would be about 6 percentage points less than in the 2018 midterm election. The Republican running to represent Detroit in Congress says he can overcome apathy among Black voters because, as an African American himself, he walks in their shoes. Martell Bivings is offering a GOP agenda targeting crime and taxes that he maintains Detroiters respond to. He says they just have to overcome being raised in a politically blue city. \"Growing up in a Black family it's kind of like you grow into it, you're born into it,\" he said. \"'You're a Democrat. Shut up.' \" Bivings said it's a different story when he hears Detroiters' concerns over gun violence or rising inflation. \"And some of the things that they would say, I'd say, 'You're saying that and you're a Black man or a Black woman.' And I'd say, 'You're a Republican.' And they'd say, 'Maybe I am.' \" But Bivings likely faces a steep climb translating that into support at the ballot box. More than 90% of Detroit voters cast ballots for Democratic candidates for Congress in 2020 alone. And the Democrat now seeking Detroit's open congressional seat says he, too, connects with the economic fears pervading the community. In this 2018 file photo, state Rep. Shri Thanedar gestures during a debate in Grand Rapids, Mich. Thanedar won Michigan's 13th Congressional Democratic primary on Aug. 2, topping a field of nine candidates in a district that covers most of Detroit and potentially leaving the city next term without Black representation in Congress for the first time since the early 1950s.\n                \n                    \n                    Michael Buck/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption In this 2018 file photo, state Rep. Shri Thanedar gestures during a debate in Grand Rapids, Mich. Thanedar won Michigan's 13th Congressional Democratic primary on Aug. 2, topping a field of nine candidates in a district that covers most of Detroit and potentially leaving the city next term without Black representation in Congress for the first time since the early 1950s. State Rep. Shri Thanedar has been a ubiquitous presence along the campaign trail, appearing at everything from political fundraisers to modest events at city parks. Thanedar was a poor Indian immigrant who became wealthy by starting a chemical business. He spent millions of dollars of his own money on the primary campaign and defeated eight other contenders, all of them African Americans. Thanedar has a backstory he claims resonates with Detroit voters. \"I grew up in dire poverty,\" he said. \"My district is 20 to 30% at or below poverty level. Economic prosperity is very, very key. We need to bring in good-paying jobs.\" Thanedar's message had traction among some waiting in line at the Detroit high school rally. The idea of economic empowerment attracts voters like Carmen Lewis far more than Bivings' assertion that it takes a Black candidate to understand Detroit. \"We gonna vote for him because he's Black? That ain't got nothing to do with it,\" Lewis said. \"We want people that are gonna work for our city, that's gonna help us grow. Because we're already struggling. We're already hurting. Stuff is high. Children are failing because of the school system. We need help. So, bring somebody in here that's gonna help us, whether they're Black, White, Chinese, Puerto Rican, it doesn't matter.\" That sentiment echoes with Detroit voter Willie Wyatt, who says the colors he's mostly concerned about are red versus blue. The 83-year-old said he felt eternally disenfranchised growing up in the Deep South. That is, Wyatt said, until he watched the Voting Rights Act of 1965 signed into law by a Democratic president. \"I don't vote for Republicans. Period,\" Wyatt said. \"And I shouldn't be that hard on people but that's the way I feel. I don't know anything the Republicans ever done for a Black person. Or for that matter anybody else [who's] poor.\" An analysis by the Pew Research Center found about a quarter of the members of Congress identify as an ethnic or racial minority. And the overwhelming majority of them are Democrats. But some African Americans fear Democrats simply take the Black vote for granted. The GOP is investing in Black candidates nationwide \u2014 including three running for the U.S. House in Michigan. When all the votes are counted after this midterm election, Michigan's only Black representation in Congress could come solely from the Republican Party.",

After graduating high school in Georgia in 1969, Herbert Ruffin was drafted into the military to serve as an infantryman in Vietnam. A year later, he was badly wounded in a firefight. He was awarded the Purple Heart and went on to serve his country for more than two decades. But when it came time to retire, Ruffin chose to continue living abroad. \"The quality of life for me, as a person of color \u2014 there was better opportunities for me to live in Germany,\" he says. \"I was born in the 1950s, so I came through some very challenging years being raised in the South.\" Ruffin, 72, remains a registered voter in Maryland, where he typically votes for Democrats. He says he still feels a deep sense of patriotism and takes voting as an American overseas seriously. \"Where I grew up, opportunities to vote were restricted,\" he says. \"I have a voice and I can encourage others to vote and let them know they can vote from abroad.\" Political power of overseas Americans is latent; it's waiting to be realized. Jay Sexton, University of Missouri Ruffin is one of at least 3 million American expatriates of voting age, a voting bloc that organizers and researchers are still trying to understand in an era of data-driven political targeting. It's a group with the potential to wield substantial power, if fully activated. \"It can be significant, because the margins in our polarized electoral climate are so tight,\" says Jay Sexton, director of the Kinder Institute on Constitutional Democracy at the University of Missouri. \"Political power of overseas Americans is latent; it's waiting to be realized.\" There are a couple reasons for that. Unlike the military, the exact number of civilian Americans living abroad isn't known. It's a diverse group that includes dual citizens, college students spending a semester abroad, retirees who've opted to spend their golden years in southern Spain and digital nomads who've taken their work abroad with a strong Wi-Fi connection and the blessing of their U.S. employer. The Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP), the program established to administer the law that enables overseas citizens to vote, estimates that in 2018, there were 4.8 million U.S. citizens living abroad, 3 million of whom were of voting age. Loading... \"One of the reasons why it's so difficult to get a really good estimate of how many American citizens actually live abroad is that the U.S. government doesn't gather much data on it,\" explains Tara Ginnane, a political scientist who studies the engagement of American citizens abroad. \"There are no surveys of people who are emigrating, there is no census category for people who live abroad, they aren't included in the census.\" Researchers can look at the numbers of expatriates who come into contact with consulates or embassies to help extrapolate data, but even then, it's a self-selecting group that doesn't tell the full story. According to the FVAP, Americans abroad are scattered across 186 countries, with the largest populations in Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, France and Israel. \"It's just really difficult to make generalizations about this extremely diverse, heterogeneous group of people,\" Ginnane says. One thing that unites this disparate group? Voter turnout. It's low \u2014 incredibly low. In the 2020 general election, the FVAP estimates 224,139 votes were cast by citizens abroad who aren't in the military, the equivalent to a voting rate of 7.8%. That compares to an overall turnout rate of 66.8%. But this elusive group holds a shimmering promise for political organizers who could crack the code to unlocking the bloc's potential. \"What we're looking at here is a large number of people that could swing elections if they turned out,\" says Sexton, of the University of Missouri. \"But despite efforts by both parties, it's been a really tough nut to crack.\" A common trap when thinking about the overseas vote is to conflate it with those serving in the military. The active-duty military has a much higher voter participation rate \u2014 47% voted in 2020. \"Military personnel are very much plugged into American institutions that are able to provide the logistical support, the reminders to vote and all the information on how to vote,\" Ginnane says. \"That's part of why overseas citizens' turnout is so low, because they don't have that logistical support, and they're on their own with figuring out how and when to vote.\" Common obstacles for overseas voters include: \"There's varying levels of interest and levels of people feeling themselves to be American enough and invested enough in the country's future to go get a ballot and bother to return it,\" Ginnane says.

For the left, it's an apparatus called Democrats Abroad that is fully integrated into the party. Established in 1964, Democrats Abroad holds a global primary in presidential years and is considered one of the Democratic National Committee's 56 state and territory organizations. \"There have been a number of different organizations that have been the [right-leaning] counterpart to Democrats Abroad, but haven't quite had the staying power and institutional stamina that the Democrats have,\" Sexton says. \"The old quip about, you're not a member of an organized party if you're a Democrat, but when it comes to overseas, I think Democrats have been more organized.\" In September, Democrats Abroad hosted a virtual rally, where candidates in key states this election cycle \u2014 like Senate nominees John Fetterman, Mandela Barnes and Tim Ryan \u2014 made video appeals to get out the vote. \"American citizens living abroad are often the margin of victory in our elections,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said at the rally in a prerecorded message. \"When you vote, you make a difference. In 2018, when we took the House, our blue wave was tiny drops of water, very close races, and the margin of victory was from the military and overseas ballots.\" Candice Kerestan, the international chair of Democrats Abroad, told NPR that a big component of this cycle's organizing efforts was a worldwide voter registration day, where the group set up registration booths in over 50 countries. \"We also run social media and digital advertising campaigns, and we run a voter help desk around the clock so if people have questions on how to vote from abroad, we'll assist them,\" she says. \"Living in Sweden has definitely influenced my perspectives,\" says Lauren Ell, a Republican voter.\n                \n                    \n                    Lauren Ell\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"Living in Sweden has definitely influenced my perspectives,\" says Lauren Ell, a Republican voter.

Ell, 34, started a group called Nordic Republicans to help mobilize American conservatives in Norway, Finland, Sweden, Iceland and Denmark. She says these voices have a lot to offer their party back home. \"When you have Americans who are actually having to work with the systems and the governments abroad, they provide a really important perspective,\" she says. \"When it comes to health care, when it comes to gun control \u2014 I think it's really important to hear directly from Americans living in Sweden what exactly it is like.\" After the U.S. Supreme Court draft opinion on overturning Roe v.

The international treasurer for Democrats Abroad says watching from afar as false claims of election fraud and the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol unfurled was upsetting and led him to reflect on just how fragile democracy is. \"It's really odd, because our democracy in South Korea is because of the United States,\" he says. \"And so much of the narrative in South Korea and democracy is about the United States and living up to that standard. It's really weird to see the United States having these issues with the preservation of democracy and perceived issues with election integrity.\" Lemke adds that living in another country allows him to look at U.S. policy \u2014 and what is possible \u2014 with new eyes. \"South Korea is by no stretch of the imagination a communist-socialist country,\" he says. \"You know, we've fought a war about this, and we have universal health care and to watch that be the conversation in the debates in the U.S. is really odd. I feel I have to educate people about universal health care and how wonderful it is.\" Lemke says his adopted parents, whom he calls Reagan Republicans, have shifted their perspective on health care policy somewhat, given his experiences in South Korea. \"They see the benefits, they see a lived example of \u2014 OK, maybe universal health care isn't a communist program.\" Political scientist Ginnane warns against thinking of overseas voters as the 51st state, with equivalent political might. \"It's important to resist that temptation a little because one has to remember that they're voting in all 50 states,\" she explains. \"So their voting potential is kind of cracked and diffused.\" And since tracking this group remains challenging, it's not possible for campaigns to zero in on which constituencies could have the biggest impact in  contentious races. But even with low turnout and challenges with mobilization, overseas voters have, at times, played an important role in elections. Perhaps the most notable example is the presidential election of 2000 between Al Gore and George W. Bush. Gore was narrowly ahead. A cache of late-arriving Florida ballots from overseas \u2014 both military and civilian \u2014 gave Bush the edge by 537 votes. \"These votes really mattered,\" Ginnane says. \"They don't matter any more than any individual vote but in a very tight election like that, and especially when they arrive late and are counted separately, they begin to look as though they're extremely influential.\" A similar story played out in 2006, when overseas voters played a role in Virginian Jim Webb's Senate victory. And in 2020, thousands of ballots were counted from overseas in states like Arizona and Georgia \u2014 two states crucial to Joe Biden's presidential win.",

Stamp Student Union Center for Campus Life at the University of Maryland College Park, Md., on Oct. 26, 2022.\n                \n                    \n                    Kyna Uwaeme for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Wes Moore, the Maryland Democratic nominee for governor, speaks The Adele H. Stamp Student Union Center for Campus Life at the University of Maryland College Park, Md., on Oct. 26, 2022. Democrat Wes Moore is on track to accomplish something never before seen in the state of Maryland: becoming the first African American to be elected governor. He could be only the third Black elected governor in U.S. history if he wins the office Nov. 8, and potentially the only Black sitting governor in the nation. The gravity of this historic election is not lost on Moore. \"It's very humbling,\" Moore said in a recent interview with NPR, \"because this country has only ever elected two African-Americans as governor in the nation's history.\" \"This is another example of Maryland being ready to lead.\" Running down ballot on the Democratic ticket is an equally historic spate of candidates. The candidate for lieutenant governor, Aruna Miller \u2013 Moore's running mate \u2013 would be the first immigrant elected to statewide office in Maryland; U.S. Rep. Anthony Brown could be the state's first Black attorney general; and Brooke Lierman is looking to make history as the state's first female comptroller. Maryland Democratic gubernatorial nominee Wes Moore joins Democratic National Committee Chair Jamie Harrison (L), Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) and lieutenant gubernatorial nominee Aruna Miller (2nd R) during a campaign rally at the Stamp Student Union on the campus of the University of Maryland on October 26, 2022 in College Park, Maryland.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption While Moore acknowledges the history-making aspect of his candidacy, he is also quick to caution that those are not the only barriers he wants to break as governor. \"We're not in this race to make history. We're in this race because we have a unique opportunity to make child poverty history. That we have a unique opportunity to make the racial wealth gap history,\" the Rhodes scholar and Army combat veteran told supporters last month. \"Now is our time.\" Moore is a longtime businessman and philanthropist who has never held public office. Prior to joining the governor's race, Moore was CEO of the anti-poverty organization called Robin Hood and had worked in finance in New York. National Democrats, who hold a slim majority in Congress and hope to help capture a number of governorships in the upcoming midterms, have played up Moore's resume strengths against concerns over his lack of formal political experience. Wes Moore speaks in front of a crowd on the University of Maryland campus in College Park, Md., on Oct. 26.\n                \n                    \n                    Kyna Uwaeme for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"When you look at Wes and his story, he embodies everything that is great about America,\" said DNC Chair Jamie Harrison. Harrison is among several high\u2013profile Democrats who have stumped for Moore in recent weeks. \"This is a man who has served his nation, who has gone forward and got [an] education, and he's giving back.\" A Baltimore Sun/University of Baltimore poll late last month showed Democrats with a commanding lead in the statewide races. Moore leads his Republican opponent, far-right Maryland Del. Dan Cox, by a comfortable margin. Moore's popularity in the race is perhaps only overshadowed by Cox's unpopularity, particularly among the state's Republican establishment. Maryland is a blue state, having supported the Democratic nominee for president each voting cycle for the past three decades. Students, union leaders and community members flooded into the Stamp Student Union atrium at the University of Maryland to hear from gubernatorial candidate Wes Moore and other Democratic candidates on the ballot on Oct. 26, 2022.\n                \n                    \n                    Kyna Uwaeme for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption But the state's incumbent governor, Republican moderate Larry Hogan, remains popular in the state, even among Democrats. While Hogan has not endorsed either candidate in the race, he has referred to Cox as a \"nut\" and a \"QANON whack-job,\" referring to the candidate's embrace of far-right conspiracy theories. Moore has said this of his opponent: \"I don't think it's lost on voters at all that I'm literally running against an extremist election denier, someone who said he hasn't said if he would honor the results of this election.\" So far, Moore has led a relatively scandal-light campaign, by political standards. His lack of political experience has been called into question. And Cox, who did not respond to NPR requests for an interview, has accused Moore of being a fraud and overexaggerating how long he has lived in Baltimore. Moore's supporters, however, seem unperturbed by these barbs. At one campaign event last month at the University of Maryland, a woman spent fifteen minutes, undisturbed by the chaos of reporters and Moore's handlers, with her head bent into his chest sobbing in prayer and well-wishes for the candidate. Moore eventually emerged from her embrace, his white dress shirt stained with tears and makeup.

And we need somebody to represent us,\" 71-year-old Theresa Grimes said after snapping pictures and holding court with Moore. \"He could be the president,\" Grimes, a lifelong Maryland resident, said. \"He could be the next president and also the second Black president.\" Despite his comfortable lead in the polls, Moore said his campaign strategy is to remain humble.

Every single day. And that's what we always stress to the team. What are we doing today to make up ten votes? And that's how we're running this race.\" Moore says his young children also help him keep perspective. Moore recalled the first time his children saw his face adorned on the side of his campaign bus. \"When my kids saw it, my son said, 'wow, you've got a big head.' \"",

            "article_content": "Israelis go to the polls today in their fifth election in less than four years.  A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: This past weekend, there was a stunning political defeat for the far right in Brazil's election. Now today, halfway around the world, Israel is holding its own consequential election. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Voting has begun and right-wing candidate Benjamin Netanyahu is trying to stage a comeback. He was, you may recall, forced out of power just last year. But he is a frontrunner in this race, in large part by aligning himself with politicians even farther right. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR's Daniel Estrin is in Jerusalem. Daniel, what are you hearing so far from voters? DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Well, I'm outside the polling place where Benjamin Netanyahu cast his vote this morning, and voters tell me they feel the stakes are really high. You have one group of voters that is really afraid Netanyahu will win and partner with far-right parties that are anti-Arab and anti-LGBTQ. Listen to one gay voter we met, Liron Gur (ph). LIRON GUR: The right side don't like gay people, don't like Arabs. So I believe if they will be the power, my life will be very bad. ESTRIN: Now, we've also met right-wing voters who are undecided as they're walking into the polling station. They'd usually vote for Netanyahu's right-wing allies, but this time they're hesitant. They tell us they find Netanyahu's allies now too far to the right. But we've also met a pro-Netanyahu voter here who sounds very much like Trump supporters in the U.S., believing that Netanyahu's corruption trial is a left-wing attempt to keep him out of power. This is voter Ron Hofman (ph). RON HOFMAN: The same stuff they did to Trump with the stolen election, it's exactly like here. They tried to steal. Here, the media control the whole things. The media, for 15 years, pumped that Bibi steal, Bibi corrupted. Now you have a trial, and everything is going down the tube. ESTRIN: And elections in Israel are really complicated. There are about a dozen main parties running. And so the game is, can Netanyahu cobble together a coalition with enough lawmakers to have a majority in parliament? MART\u00cdNEZ: This is Israel's fifth election in 3 1/2 years. Daniel, why does this keep happening? ESTRIN: You know, there's a political crisis in Israel. About half of the political map supports Netanyahu as leader. The other half opposes him. And election after election, this question has not been resolved. But do not be fooled. This is not like every other election that's come before it in the last 3 1/2 years - not more of the same. This is a dramatic election in terms of Israeli democracy. MART\u00cdNEZ: What makes it so - what are the stakes for this? ESTRIN: Israel, broadly, is torn between those wanting liberal democracy without religious Jewish monopoly over parts of public life. They want more joint partnership between Arab and Jewish citizens. And then on the other side, you have lawmakers and voters who want a more nationalistic, religious, Jewish conservative country, that - they want more control over Arab citizens. They want to weaken the justice system, which could help Netanyahu avoid conviction in his ongoing corruption trial. The stakes are very high, and a lot of it is going to depend on voter turnout. If enough Palestinian Arab citizens come out to vote, that could tip the scales away from Netanyahu winning. We could also see a stalemate. And in that case, centrist Prime Minister Yair Lapid would stay in power, and we could see a repeat election. That might be the best that the anti-Netanyahu bloc could hope for in this election. MART\u00cdNEZ: And, Daniel, this looks like it's going to be a close one, right? ESTRIN: It's going to be a really close race. It's going to depend on that voter turnout. And we may not even know the results of this election in days - or it might even take weeks before there's enough political maneuvering, negotiations between parties, to make it clear who is going to be Israel's next prime minister. MART\u00cdNEZ: All right. When they do figure it out, Daniel, we'll check back in with you. That's NPR's Daniel Estrin in Jerusalem. Daniel, thanks. ESTRIN: You're welcome.

Ted Budd, R-N.C., on Sept. 25 in Mount Airy, N.C.\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption This combination of photos shows North Carolina Democratic Senate candidate Cheri Beasley on Aug. 29 in Durham, N.C., left, and Republican candidate Rep. Ted Budd, R-N.C., on Sept. 25 in Mount Airy, N.C. At a late-1800s farmhouse in the heart of North Carolina, national Republicans made an urgent pitch to voters in the final days of October as they gathered for an evening barbecue. \"We win by voting,\" said Florida Sen. Rick Scott, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \"And we win by getting everybody to vote.\" \"Are you ready to take back your country?\" asked Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union and the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC. \"Have you had enough of being called every name in the book? Racist, hater, insurrectionist?\" \"Are you ready to fire [Senate Majority Leader] Chuck Schumer?\" echoed Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee. \"So am I.\" These high-profile campaign surrogates recently gathered on in Mocksville, N.C., on the state's first day of early voting for one reason: get House Republican Rep. Ted Budd elected into the U.S. Senate. Recent history is on their side. The battleground state has not elected a Democrat to the U.S. Senate for more than a decade. Plus, former President Trump endorsed Budd early in the race. Now though, the GOP is facing one of its closest Senate contests in the country. The historic Democratic nomination of Cheri Beasley, the former chief justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court, has boosted supporters' hopes of turning the seat blue. Beasley has also put up strong polling numbers, trailing Budd but within the margin of error in some polls. That, and lower-than-expected campaign funding for the race, have some dubbing it a \"sleeper race.\" Professor Michael Bitzer of Catawba College in Salisbury, N.C., says the race is not drawing as much money or buzz as Senate races in Georgia, Pennsylvania or elsewhere. \"North Carolina is always a strong, competitive state, and I think that that's going to play out again this year,\" Bitzer said. Bitzer explained in a race of this caliber, the candidates might have drawn $200 million or more in spending. However, he projects the total this year for the Senate election could be half of that or less. \"[There's] not a whole lot of attention in terms of things like money coming in, but I think certainly we're going to have that level of competitiveness yet again,\" Bitzer predicted. The race has been rated \"lean Republican\" by Cook Political Report. Both parties are also facing more registered unaffiliated voters this year, versus registration by Republicans or Democrats. Back at the barbecue in Mocksville, N.C., Budd says he is overwhelmed by the applause for his campaign surrogates and other supporters. \"Playing football in Davie County, when I ran a couple of good blocks, nobody ever cheered that hard, y'all,\" Budd joked with a friendly crowd. \"This is great to be home, growing up on a farm just a few minutes from here, seeing a lot of friends that we spent almost all of our lives together.\" Budd said he is hearing from energized Republican voters who are fed up with President Biden's policies. \"People are furious right now about three, three main things,\" Budd told NPR. \"It depends on how you divide it: It's inflation, it's crime, and it's education.\" At a GOP campaign stop in Greensboro, N.C., Budd supporter Robin Bunting agreed. She said she is going out to eat less and has cut back on groceries, such as buying meat only when it is on sale. \"I feel like I'm very fortunate, but we still make choices, you know and cut back,\" Bunting said. \"It's bad and we need a change.\" Republicans are also using fear tactics to get Republican voters motivated, said Bitzer, the politics professor. But some of those claims are largely false or misleading. \"How about allowing men to play in women's sports? I mean we got Title IX so women can have sports and have some success. And now we're going to let men play women's sports? Democrats did that,\" Sen. Scott told the crowd at a stop in Greensboro. Another misleading claim shared by Scott and others: Democrats support abortions \"up until the moment of birth.\" It's now a common refrain for Republican candidates across the country. \"This is a classic kind of campaign strategy nowadays in American politics. It's fear and threats that really motivate people to show up to vote,\" Bitzer said. \"I think what Republicans are trying to do is to frame the issue in the most extreme approach, and say this is what you will get if you elect Democrats.\" Democrats are hoping for a different kind of change: to take a seat held for more than a decade by the GOP, most recently by retiring Republican Sen. Richard Burr, and turn it blue. Beasley, the former chief justice of North Carolina's Supreme Court who's now running for Senate, is angling for an upset. \"People really are excited about this race. They understand the sense of urgency around it,\" Beasley said at a recent Democratic event in Charlotte. Beasley is the first African American woman nominated for the role. That has energized a key demographic \u2014 Black voters. To reach that critical constituency, Beasley is meeting voters at churches around the state. She has also been boosted by a \"souls to the polls\" effort to get church goers to ballot box. \"There's a lot of power in the church,\" Beasley recently told religious leaders at meeting at the Little Rock African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church in Charlotte. \"I grew up in the church. My husband grew up in the church. Our sons grew up in the church. And y'all know, it is not just our religious center. It is our social center and it is our political center.\" At this event, Beasley had a powerful surrogate in House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn. Clyburn played a key role in turning the momentum in Biden's direction in the runup to the 2020 election. \"This election is the most consequential election of any of our lifetimes!\" Clyburn called out. The South Carolina Democrat argues Republicans are fighting to whitewash education by erasing Black history from schools, curtailing voting and restricting reproductive rights. \"We've got to get real! We cannot sit idly by!\" Clyburn implored. But even after abortion rights energized Democratic voters this past summer, Beasley knows inflation is a top priority now. \"People want to know that I'm going to get to the Senate and I'm going to address the rising costs,\" Beasley told NPR. \"People are feeling everything from pain at the pump to the cost of prescription drugs and everything in between.\" Spectrum News 1 political anchor Tim Boyum, left, prepares to moderate a debate between Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate Cheri Beasley, center, and Republican Rep.

Ted Budd, R-N.C., on Oct. 7 in Raleigh, N.C. Bitzer, the politics professor, says both campaigns are making political calculations. He notes Beasley has not appeared on the campaign trail with Biden, who's facing low approval ratings. Meanwhile, the Budd campaign does not often mention Trump during public speeches at campaign stops. \"That's a key dynamic that Republicans do not need in these last few weeks of the election, is to have Donald Trump on the ballot. They want Joe Biden on the ballot,\" Bitzer said. \"If Trump is on the ballot, that not only energizes Republicans, but it also energizes Democrats because they don't want another Donald Trump clone to be in Congress,\" he explained. Turnout will be critical in a midterm race that typically draws fewer voters than presidential election years. Bitzer says even in a race that leans Republican, Black voters could be key to a Beasley upset. \"They need that coalition to come out and perform almost at historic levels for a midterm in order to be competitive,\" Bitzer said. At the GOP event in Greensboro, McDaniel, the RNC chair, said North Carolina has showed strong numbers for registered Republicans since 2020. That year, Sen. Thom Tillis was reelected in a costly run for both parties. Still, McDaniel acknowledges the state is not a slam dunk for Republicans, and the party is closely watching the Senate contest as well as other critical statewide races, including House races and open seats on the state's supreme court. \"I think North Carolina is a purple state, but I do think we've seen some really good trends for the Republican Party,\" McDaniel said. \"So this is a state that can be instrumental in a lot of different ways.\"",

            "article_content": "Once more, Brazil's far-right populist president, Jair Bolsonaro faces off against former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva - this time in a run-off election.  AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: In Brazil today, weeks of divisive and dirty campaigning will culminate in today's runoff election for the presidency there. The choice is between the far-right populist president and a leftist former president. And the electorate is as polarized as the two men competing to lead the world's fourth-largest democracy. NPR's Carrie Kahn is in Sao Paulo this morning and joins us now. Good morning, Carrie. CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: Good morning. RASCOE: So, as I say, you know, very different candidates running against each other in this runoff. It's a stark choice for voters in Brazil. So what are people telling you about having to make that choice? KAHN: Well, incumbent President Jair Bolsonaro has a big and strong base of support, and they say they like his brash, contentious style, and his motto is God, country and family. But his critics feel that the last four years has been disastrous for Brazil and that Bolsonaro is an embarrassment on the world stage and has threatened the country's democracy. And on the other side, you have former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and the poor revere him. When he was president in the 2000s, he rode a commodities boom and helped tens of millions rise out of poverty. De Silva, however, was jailed for corruption. His conviction was later annulled. But he carries that baggage. There are few in the middle. And for them, as this race is getting dirtier and dirtier, it's a very tough choice. RASCOE: Yeah, so this is a runoff election. So in addition to a stark choice, people have already seen these two names on the ballots. Are there really a lot of undecided voters still out there? KAHN: Polls say there are about 3% still unclear how to vote. And in a tight race, that could make the difference. Generally, and especially here in Sao Paulo state, the better-off and rural residents go for Bolsonaro and so do the religious. I was in this farming community of Casa Branca - it's about three hours from here - and met Michelle Coela (ph), and she's 39. She was on a religious pilgrimage through that farm country. And she says Bolsonaro embodies everything important to her. MICHELLE COELA: It's about religion, about trusting God for life. KAHN: Generally, urban residents here tend to go for da Silva. Yesterday, supporters held a huge rally for him. (CHEERING) KAHN: Maria Paola Viera (ph) is a 23-year-old law student. She went crazy when Lula came out. She was screaming away. MARIA PAOLA VIERA: (Non-English language spoken). KAHN: She said that she can't imagine another four years of Bolsonaro. And if that happens, she will just keep fighting. She said she will never stop. RASCOE: The world looks at Brazil as a huge democracy, a huge economy, and as the guardian of the Amazon rainforest, so - which is so important for the global ecosystem. Is the Amazon a big campaign issue? KAHN: It's not really talked about a lot, despite that deforestation here has risen dramatically. And under Bolsonaro, he's rolled back environmental protections and enforcement in the Amazon. Instead, disinformation here has ruled the game. Bolsonaro accuses da Silva of being what he calls a godless abortionist who will turn Brazil into a communist country, a la Venezuela and Cuba. De Silva's camp has tried to shoot back, not as effectively capitalizing on some misstatements by Bolsonaro, claiming he supports cannibalism and pedophilia. RASCOE: So, I mean, what are - what is election night going to look like, in about the 30 seconds we have left? When will we get the results? KAHN: It's going to be close. It's going to be tight. Brazil has this electronic voting system, so results are usually out within hours after the polls close at 5 p.m. Brasilia time. That's 4 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. Bolsonaro has repeatedly questioned the voting system, taking a page from Donald Trump's playbook. He admires him greatly. Lately, he's stepped up those attacks against election officials. He says they're biased against him. So there's concern he may not respect the vote. RASCOE: That's NPR's Carrie Kahn in Sao Paulo. Carrie, thank you so much. KAHN: You're welcome. Thanks.

U.S. security agencies have issued a heightened threat advisory, warning of a potential attacks on political candidates, election officials and others. The alert came Friday, the same day that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband was attacked in their San Francisco home. NPR has obtained the bulletin issued by the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, the National Counterterrorism Center and the U.S. Capitol Police. Attacks conducted by lone actors pose the most plausible threat to potential targets, the bulletin warned. The risk of violence is fueled by an increase in domestic violent extremism, and those carrying out the attacks would likely do so for ideological reasons. Most individuals are likely to cite the 2020 presidential election, repeating the false narrative that the results were skewed, and that former-President Donald Trump was the rightful winner, according to the warning. Since 2021, perceptions of a fraudulent election have contributed to several attacks or violent plots, and the bulletin added that new theories of fraud undermining the midterm elections have been emerging. The advisory said that last month, domestic violent extremists were identified as claiming the electoral system of being \"under attack\" and threatened violence against politicians. With less than two weeks before Election Day, President Biden on Friday called on political figures to \"clearly and unambiguously\" reject political violence, calling the attack on the Pelosi \"despicable.\" The president, citing news reports, drew ties between what Friday's attacker allegedly said \u2014 chanting, \"Where's Nancy?\" \u2014 and what rioters said while storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. \"What makes us think that one party can talk about stolen elections, COVID being a hoax, it's all a bunch of lies \u2014 and it not affect people who may not be so well-balanced? What makes us think that it's not going to corrode the political climate?\" he said. In the bulletin, law enforcement officials warned that the threat of violence extends beyond just politicians, with religious minorities also listed as a potential target. \"We assess some [domestic violent extremists] motivated by election-related grievances would likely view election-related infrastructure, personnel, and voters involved in the election process as attractive targets \u2014 including at publicly accessible locations like polling places, ballot drop-box locations, voter registration sites, campaign events, and political party offices,\" the bulletin said. It warned that extremists could target election-related locations in hopes of \"swaying voting habits, undermining perceptions of the legitimacy of the voting process, or prompting a government reaction.\"",

            "article_content": "NPR's Juana Summers talks with Wisconsin Lt. Governor Mandela Barnes, a democrat, about his campaign for U.S. Senate. The race in Wisconsin could determine which party controls the U.S. Senate.  JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: The Senate race in Wisconsin is one of a handful that could determine which party controls the U.S. Senate. Over the summer, incumbent Republican Ron Johnson looked vulnerable to a challenge by Democrat Mandela Barnes. But now, polling shows that Barnes is trailing Johnson, with just two weeks to go until Election Day. I sat down with Lieutenant Governor Barnes after a meet-and-greet with Latino voters in Milwaukee. And when I asked him about the momentum in this race, he didn't seem worried. MANDELA BARNES: Polls go up, and polls go down. Last three November elections were all decided by 30,000 votes or fewer. We always knew this was going to be neck-and-neck. SUMMERS: After that, we dug into the issues, starting with the Supreme Court's decision in June to overturn the constitutional right to an abortion. BARNES: Well, 70% of people in Wisconsin think Roe should be the law of the land, and that's how out-of-touch and extreme Ron Johnson's position is. And he supported abortion bans that had no exceptions for rape, incest or the life of the mother. And I've been - you know, my mother has been pretty open about her story, having a complicated pregnancy that, you know, she had to end. And it was her choice to make. Any woman should be able to make that choice. And Ron Johnson wants to take that away. In Ron Johnson's America, my mother - women in very similar situations as her don't get to make that choice. We recently had a Black maternal health roundtable, where there were a number of women who, for the very first time, shared their stories about complicated pregnancies, some that had to be terminated. And they had never spoken about it before, but they had a chance to around each other - and also, given the urgency of this moment, where we have politicians in office who want to take that choice away, which would have absolutely made their lives even more difficult. And then, on top of that, for people who are planning a family, Ron Johnson is against expanding the child tax credit. He is against funding for preschool programs. He is against school meal programs - the things that will make it easier for people to have families that can have some sort of success. He voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and this is a lifeline for families - that he wants to take it away. He wants to force people to give birth in a place where he does not want to provide them opportunity, and that's disqualifying. SUMMERS: I want to turn now to the economy, which is obviously something that's affecting every person in this country. Inflation has been unrelenting. We have seen the stock market decline. What do you think, if you were elected - what can be done to help families who are feeling the brunt of those issues? BARNES: Well, there are a couple of things we got to do. One, we got to give working families some relief in the immediate term. That means middle-class tax cuts. We can expand the earned income tax credit for our lower-wage earners to be able to keep a little bit more money in their pockets - people who are struggling to put food on the table. We need to make the child tax credit permanent. And we also need to hold these executives and industries accountable for using inflation as a smokescreen to jack up prices on consumers. Think about the people who are charging the most. These are also the people are having record years - record profit years - and working-class people are paying for that. That's the unfortunate reality that is only going to be exacerbated if people like Ron Johnson are in office because he's only been in it for himself, other wealthy individuals like him and his biggest donors. In the long term, we need to do more to bring jobs back here. SUMMERS: Senator Johnson has focused a great deal of his attention on the issue of crime, and there has been this onslaught of advertising that has labeled you as too liberal on issues of crime and public safety - something that we're seeing in races across the country. As you've watched these ads, what is your reaction to them, and do you believe that they play on racial tropes? BARNES: Ron Johnson is a hypocrite. Ron Johnson has not done a single thing. I have dealt with the loss of life. I don't - I brought this up on the debate stage - didn't get an answer. I can only assume that Ron Johnson never had to bury a friend. I can only assume Ron Johnson has not gone to these funerals and memorial services for young children who are victims of gun violence. Representing a district in the state legislature that had been significantly impacted by violence - it seemed to be routine to have to do that. Ron Johnson has no idea what he's talking about. He only brings up Milwaukee when he talks about crime, but he's never shown up to try to help. He has prioritized the interests and the profits of the gun lobby over the lives of our children and our public safety. He can talk all about - all he wants to about law and order and about law enforcement. He was nowhere to be found on January 6, when 140 Capitol police officers were injured - the people who were there to protect him. He turned his back on law enforcement. He turned his back on all of us. SUMMERS: You're about to kick off a big tour of the states, and one of the big names that's coming out here to campaign for you is former President Barack Obama. I know he's recently cut an ad for you. I'd like to ask you, would you welcome President Biden to the campaign trail with you in the final days of this race? BARNES: Well, we've always said from the very beginning, people who are talking about rebuilding the middle class here in Wisconsin is more than welcome to join us. And, you know, when I heard Barack Obama's DNC speech in 2004, that's what inspired me to get engaged. That's what led me to become an organizer. So this is a sort of full-circle moment for me. SUMMERS: But would you campaign with President Biden? BARNES: Like I said, President Biden - anybody who wants to come talk about rebuilding the middle class - we're happy to do it. I mean, we've had a number of people come in the state. So Biden is welcome if we're talking about the same exact things. SUMMERS: All right, Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes, thank you so much for talking with us today. BARNES: Of course. Thank you so much. Thanks for having me. SUMMERS: And just as a note for listeners - we did reach out to Senator Ron Johnson's campaign for an interview, and they did not make him available. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Wade, which provided a federal right to abortion. The Nov. 8 election in California includes a ballot measure asking voters whether they should amend the state constitution to explicitly protect abortion rights. A majority of Californians support reproductive rights, so the measure, known as Proposition 1, is expected to pass. But the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision last June overturning the federal right to abortion, has increased the urgency and raised the stakes. But what exactly Californians are voting for isn't totally clear.  Some lawmakers say the amendment would merely enshrine abortion rights in the state, while others say the amendment would expand abortion rights. This story was produced in partnership with Kaiser Health News. Current state law allows abortion up to the point of fetal viability, generally about 24 weeks into a pregnancy.  But the proposed constitutional amendment doesn't address the issue of timing, raising the possibility that abortions would be permitted at any point in pregnancy \u2014 and, critics contend, permitted for any reason. This uncertainty emerged during the legislative debate over the ballot amendment and how it would be worded. There were several awkward moments when Democrats were stumped by this question from Republicans \u2014 most notably when Assembly member Kevin Kiley (R-Rocklin) posed the question point-blank before the final Assembly vote in June. \"California law generally bars the performance of an abortion past the point of fetal viability,\" Kiley said. \"Would this constitutional amendment change that?\" The floor went quiet. For a full 30 seconds, no one said anything. Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon whispered with Democratic colleagues, asked to have the question repeated, and then promised to answer later. He never did. Three Democratic legislators in California just after the June 27 vote to finalize language for a state constitutional amendment supporting reproductive rights.

Nancy Skinner, and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon)\n                \n                    \n                    Rich Pedroncelli/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Three Democratic legislators in California just after the June 27 vote to finalize language for a state constitutional amendment supporting reproductive rights. (L-R: State Senate President Pro Tempore Toni Atkins, state Sen. Nancy Skinner, and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon) Fetal viability has long been a controversial concept, plaguing ethicists on both sides of the abortion debate since it was embedded in the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973. In that ruling, the Supreme Court justices wrote that a woman's right to privacy was protected only up to viability \u2014 the point when a fetus is capable of \"meaningful life outside the mother's womb.\" The court said that occurs between 24 and 28 weeks after conception. Since then, many doctors have bemoaned the legal and political bastardization of the medical concept, arguing that viability is much more complex than gestational age alone. But the public has clung to it, and both opponents and supporters of abortion rights have looked favorably on restricting access to the procedure later in pregnancy. Current California law incorporates the viability limit from Roe, allowing abortion for any reason through most of the second trimester, and after that only if the patient's or fetus's health is in danger. But the constitutional amendment outlined in Proposition 1 doesn't contain the word \"viability.\" Even among legal scholars, there is no consensus about whether that means the viability standard in place now will remain if Proposition 1 is approved, or if time limits on abortion will be eradicated in California. \"It at least opens the door,\" says Mary Ziegler, law professor at the University of California-Davis, with courts likely making the final interpretation of Proposition 1 after the vote, if it's approved. When Assembly member James Gallagher (R-Chico) spoke during the final floor debate in June, his voice wavered with emotion. He could not support the constitutional amendment, he said, \"because of what's missing from it.\" He choked up at one point talking about his twin boys, who were born 2\u00bd months premature and almost needed heart surgery in utero. \"They were alive, and they were people,\" he repeated throughout his speech, pointing at the lectern for emphasis each time, as he recounted his wife's pregnancy at 18 weeks, 23 weeks, and 30 weeks. California Assemblyman James Gallagher, the Republican minority leader, called on lawmakers to reject the proposed constitutional amendment on abortion rights for the November ballot, during a final debate on June 27 at the Capitol in Sacramento, Calif.\n                \n                    \n                    Rich Pedroncelli/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption California Assemblyman James Gallagher, the Republican minority leader, called on lawmakers to reject the proposed constitutional amendment on abortion rights for the November ballot, during a final debate on June 27 at the Capitol in Sacramento, Calif. Without any time limits on abortion, Gallagher said, the amendment got the balance wrong between the rights of the mother and the fetus. \"We can do better,\" he said. Proponents of Proposition 1 have said the intention was only to preserve the status quo. But in various committee hearings, supporters at times seemed confused by the language of their own bill and scrambled to answer definitively when asked whether the amendment would preserve the viability limit or discard it. But physicians involved in drafting the amendment, like Dr. Pratima Gupta, said no mistake was made: The word viability was left out on purpose. \"Every pregnancy is individual, and it's a continuum,\" says Gupta, an OB-GYN in San Diego. People come into pregnancy with a range of preexisting health conditions, including diabetes, anemia, high blood pressure, and obesity, she explains. They may not have much money or access to good medical care, with the latest technology. All these very nuanced factors determine whether a fetus is viable, she says, not some arbitrary number. \"If I see a patient who has broken their bag of water at 23 weeks of pregnancy, that doesn't mean that it's viable or not viable,\" Gupta says, explaining that the fetus may survive premature delivery at this stage in some cases, but not in others. Doctors who consulted on the amendment were following the lead of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the leading advisory group for OB-GYNs, which removed the term viability from its guidance on abortion in May. The group explained that the term has become so politicized that it barely has any medical meaning anymore, and deciding whether and when to have an abortion should be left to the patient and doctor. Strangely, the demise of Roe v. Wade has freed doctors from the vagaries of the viability framework, as it was outlined in that ruling. \"In a world where there is no Roe, I think you're seeing California legislators trying to write into law a kind of blank slate, a better idea of what reproductive autonomy could be that isn't just Roe Part 2,\" Ziegler says. In recent years, at least three other states \u2014 Colorado, New Jersey, and Vermont \u2014 and Washington, D.C., have removed gestational age limits from their abortion laws. Abortion opponents argue that if California follows suit, it will be a free-for-all, with women lining up for abortions when they're eight months pregnant. \"We already currently have abortion up to 24 weeks. Why do we need to push it beyond that?\" says Jonathan Keller, president and CEO of the California Family Council, a religious nonprofit. \"Aren't we able to say that that is a step too far, even for California?\" Research indicates such scenarios are highly unlikely. Abortions at or after 21 weeks represent only 1.2% of all abortions, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And studies show the reasons women seek abortions at that point vary, from medical complications that threaten the life of the patient or fetus to, increasingly, legal and logistical barriers. \"It may be that they're delayed because there are lots of restrictions they have to comply with; it may be because they need to travel for an abortion,\" says Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst at the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights. \"It may be that they can't get time off of work. Or, it was a wanted pregnancy and something happened.\" Still, even in California, which positions itself as an abortion sanctuary, voters become more uncomfortable with the procedure the later a pregnancy gets. An August poll found that only 13% of likely voters said they were OK with abortion through the third trimester. But a different poll found that on the question of securing abortion rights in general, 71% of California voters said they would vote for Proposition 1. \"The politics of viability have changed,\" law professor Ziegler says. With the Supreme Court toppling the federal right to abortion, and more than half the states banning or trying to ban the procedure, Ziegler says \"these viability arguments \u2014 that had obviously been compelling for decades \u2014 don't land the same way.\" The polls indicate that California voters are not inclined to nitpick. Ziegler predicted they'll accept the ambiguity in Proposition 1, and then let the courts sort out the details later.

            "article_content": "NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer talks with campaign strategist Chuck Rocha about the Democratic Party's struggle to gain and maintain the support of Latino voters.  SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST: Latino voters represent the second largest and fastest-growing group in the U.S. electorate. Recent polls by Pew and Washington Post-Ipsos show a majority of Latino voters plan to support Democrats in next month's midterm elections. But surveys also show that support waning, and that has Democratic strategists sounding an alarm bell. I spoke about this earlier today with Chuck Rocha, a Democratic strategist who has worked on both of Bernie Sanders' presidential campaigns. Here's our conversation. Chuck, right before the last presidential election in 2020, you warned that Democrats weren't taking the Latino vote seriously. Do you still think that's the case? CHUCK ROCHA: I do not. There's still parts of the party apparatus that is still underperforming, in my opinion, on how they are doing their outreach. But it is being mostly overweighted by folks who have taken what happened in the last election, especially in the Senate, that are probably doing more work in Spanish and in the community earlier than I have ever seen them done before. But then on the House side, now that they've had redistricting, there's all these districts that have heavy Latino populations. I see them running the same playbook that they did before, and I think it could actually cost Democrats the House of Representatives. PFEIFFER: One of the recent polls we mentioned from Washington Post-Ipsos found that Democrats in congressional races have a 27-point advantage with voters who identify as Hispanic. That's a pretty generous margin, but that is a decline compared to a nearly 40-point advantage the party had in 2018. Why do you think Democrats have been losing ground here? ROCHA: It's a couple of things. One is Republicans used to not compete for this vote. I've been doing this work for over 30 years, Sacha. And up until about eight years ago, Republicans would just walk past a Latino neighborhood. So just them showing up and competing for the vote is a big part. I think it's very important for folks to know Democrats are going to win the Latino vote and Latino voters. But what's happening is we're losing a little support a little at a time to Republicans because they're competing. And Latinos are coming of age quicker than any other demographic. So we're younger. And guess what? Younger voters are more infrequent voters. And to where we are today, they're more apt not to participate in an off-year election, which, again, harms Democrats more than Republicans. PFEIFFER: Of course, no racial or ethnic group votes in lockstep, and we should expect continued and even growing diversity in the Latino vote. So with all that diversity, how do you advise Democrats in terms of how they need to focus their efforts and their messaging? ROCHA: I've been telling Democrats we need to get back to the reason that I joined the Democratic Party in 1990, and it was around working-class values, keeping jobs in America. We've lost that narrative and even, I would argue, succumbed some of that argument to people like Donald Trump. Democrats need to get back to really courting a blue-collar worker, which is now, because of the demographic growth of Latinos, a big part of that sector. PFEIFFER: What about issues like abortion and our dicey economy? How is that changing the political landscape for candidates trying to court the Latino vote? ROCHA: You see the Dobbs decision being super-duper impactful with women and women of color. But women already were overperforming for Democrats, especially women of color. The real problem with Democrats are the men and the men of color, non-college educated men in particular. And that's where your argument around the economy and jobs - in focus group after focus groups with Latinos this summer, that's what particularly men were talking about, things that they don't feel like Democrats, in their opinion, have been delivering for them even though Joe Biden and the Democrats have probably done more in the last two years than any administration in a two-year period in a long time. So it's very frustrating when the message is not resonating down to the grassroots in many communities. PFEIFFER: So how worried nationally do you think the party should be about this trend beyond this year's midterms? ROCHA: There's one fact that is clear beyond a shadow of a doubt, and that is that Latino voters will have a dramatic impact on who controls the House and the Senate just because of the concentration of our population in the most marginal seats in America. So Democrats are worried at every level. I'm currently really worried about keeping the House and some of the most important seats - Texas, New Mexico, Colorado and Florida. So stay tuned because there's a reason why there's a lot of worry out there. PFEIFFER: That's Democratic strategist Chuck Rocha. Thank you. ROCHA: Thank you.

When Erin Moore started college, she knew she'd take on student debt. But years later, as she walks around a market in Bucks County, Pa., making loan payments feels much more within reach. Student loan relief \"actually will make it feasible for me to pay,\" said Moore, a teacher in Philadelphia who qualifies for President Biden's student debt forgiveness plan. It's \"so much more than I ever thought I was going to be able to do.\" It's been almost two months since Biden announced his plan to forgive up to $10,000 of federal student loan debt for borrowers making under $125,000, and up to $20,000 for Pell Grant recipients under the same income cap. The move follows through on a campaign pledge that Biden made to younger voters. But when Moore, 25, thinks about why she's voting in the midterms, it's not because of student loans. \"I went into school as an undergrad expecting to never pay off my student loan debt,\" Moore said, \"but the women's right to choose directly affects me and my family and people I care about.\" In other words, she's voting to protect abortion access. Young people may want student loan forgiveness \u2014 and Biden's plan widely has majority support among Millennial and Gen Z age voters \u2014 but looming over this election is the Dobbs decision by Supreme Court last June, which overturned Roe v. Wade and left abortion rights up to the states, paving the way for several to move to effectively ban most abortions outright. \"The climate in the country really scares me, to be honest,\" said Shannon Thomas, 25, who's Moore's girlfriend. She has federal student loan debt as well and expects that Biden's executive action could eliminate years of future payments for her. But she's also a labor and delivery nurse over in Bethlehem, Pa. \"I worry about my patients and I worry about my job and what the future of my job looks like if we don't get protection for women's right to choose in this state,\" she added. Erin Moore (left) and Shannon Thomas both say that while student debt cancellation is important to them, protecting abortion access is the principal reason they are voting in November.\n                \n                    \n                    Elena Moore/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Erin Moore (left) and Shannon Thomas both say that while student debt cancellation is important to them, protecting abortion access is the principal reason they are voting in November. Political organizers focused on engaging young voters say protecting access to reproductive care has become essential to mobilizing efforts. \"It's not to say that other issues are not important,\" said Dakota Hall, the executive director of Alliance for Youth Action, \"but when you have had a constitutionally protected right for so many decades taken away, that impacts so many people in this country, that it has to be No. 1 priority.\" He added that that doesn't mean that organizers don't care about passing environmental legislation or student loan debt or about the economy more broadly, but \"we know right now what's on the line in this moment.\" But other advocates say student debt is on that line too, with some advocating that the White House move to eliminate all federal student debt or at least cancel $50,000. \"I think $10,000 is kind of like a \u2014 we're going to give this to you before midterms, so you turn out to vote. But I think it's kind of like we still need more,\" Kyra Mitchell, 23, told NPR. Mitchell, who votes in Michigan, is a youth board member with the NAACP. She has federal student loans and says the issue has remained a core priority of the organization, given the sizable impact student debt has on Black borrowers. \"I think student loan debt definitely adds a crippling effect to African Americans regardless of your age,\" she added. On average, Black college graduates owe $25,000 more in student loan debt than white college graduates \u2014 according to Education Data Initiative. NAACP organizers outside the White House rally the administration for more action on student debt forgiveness.\n                \n                    \n                    Stefani Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption NAACP organizers outside the White House rally the administration for more action on student debt forgiveness. Mitchell, who also supports safeguarding abortion access and protecting voting rights, says debt cancellation could have an impact far beyond just student loans. \"The racial wealth gap that we have is also influencing a lot of reproductive access,\" Mitchell said. \"And so if we can close one gap, we can also influence this other thing and have like a domino effect.\" Santiago Mayer, the executive director of Voters of Tomorrow, says both student debt relief and abortion access are issues that can have similar messaging. The message: Republicans want to take away your rights. \"It all ties together into this basic message of youth rights and how young people deserve to be able to enjoy their lives in the same sort of way that their parents and grandparents were able to,\" he told NPR. \"Both with the rights of personal freedoms such as abortion, and also being able to have personal finances that allow them to succeed in life, which is now impossible because of the insane cost of college and the burden of student debt,\" he added. That rationale resonates with a lot of young people. Following the Dobbs decision by the Supreme Court, voter registration has increased among younger voters, notably younger women. That's according to Tom Bonier, the CEO of Target Smart, a Democratic-leaning data firm. I've been tweeting a lot about how younger women are seeing large spikes in engagement post-Dobbs (including some astounding turnout data from KS). This chart shows the states where young women have seen the largest increase in share of new registrants since Dobbs. pic.twitter.com/EOPjBBCDBU \"Historically, you see voters being more energized in an oppositional sense,\" Bonier told NPR. \"It generally tends to organize voters, and to the extent that there's a flip side of that coin, it's generally voters being motivated to protect something.\" Bonier hasn't seen any significant boosts in voter registration or turnout that he could pin on Biden's executive order on student loans \u2014 though, he says, its effect could be seen in an overall increase in support among Democratic candidates. \"I think perhaps whereas Dobbs will have the effect of turning out more younger progressive voters to help defend choice, perhaps student debt retirement, things like the Inflation Reduction Act could have the impact among more persuadable younger voters and persuading them to vote for Democratic candidates and seeing them as representing their interests more,\" he added. Although the vast majority of Millennial and Gen Z voters skew liberal, Biden's plan may have some crossover among younger voters who identify as moderate Republicans \u2014 according to recent polling conducted by Avalanche Insights, the voter organization Voto Latino and the student debt cancellation advocacy group Rise. The analysis found that a majority of moderate Republicans surveyed \u2014 who identify as \"soft Trump\" \u2014 either support or somewhat support Biden's executive action on loans. Young voters LOVE @POTUS student debt relief plan. 72% of young voters support the plan 48% of young voters say they're more likely to vote because of it 66% of youth who said they're more likely to vote are more likely to vote for Democrats pic.twitter.com/q5gm8Nzf2t And while there's no explicit correlation, Biden's approval rating among Millennial and Gen Z voters has also ticked upward over the past few months, according to NPR's polling. The latest NPR Marist survey from late September has Biden at 48% approval among younger voters, a five-point bump from late August and a sizable change from just 31% in mid-July. But regardless of polling and voter data, the White House still has to deliver on their promise. On Monday afternoon, the Department of Education officially launched the application borrowers can use to apply for debt relief. The form was first unveiled for beta testing over the weekend and received more than 8 million applications, Biden said. The launch comes just over three weeks before Election Day. But, over the past several weeks, a number of Republican-led states have challenged Biden's executive action in court \u2014 arguing it is an illegal overreach of presidential authority. Biden briefly acknowledged the lawsuits on Monday, telling reporters he doesn't expect them to get in the way of the relief program. \"Our legal judgement is that it won't,\" Biden said, \"but they're trying to stop it.\" And to Mayer, any serious threat to borrowers getting forgiveness could change mobilizing efforts again. \"Young people like it when the government acts and listens to them,\" he said. \"And if there's one thing young people do not like, it's the government doing something and then the court taking it away.\"",

Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) (left) and Republican nominee Hershel Walker (right) are the major party nominees in the Georgia Senate race The leading candidates for U.S. Senate from Georgia were born just 115 miles and seven years apart, both the children of poor Black families who had lived in the state for generations. As Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican football star Herschel Walker compete in one of the most closely-watched Senate contests in the country, each carry their own experiences as Black men growing up in south Georgia during the twilight of the civil rights movement. That history has informed both their lives \u2013 and their opposing views on race and racism echoing on the campaign trail now and likely, when they face off on the debate stage in Savannah Friday night. \"23andMe has screwed us all up,\" Walker said at a recent rally outside Atlanta, referring to the brand of home genetic tests often used to determine a person's country or region of origin. \"It don't matter about your color. A house divided cannot stand, so I want us to come together.\" Walker has recently come under scrutiny for allegations of domestic abuse and violence as well as reports that he paid for an ex-girlfriend's abortion even though, as a candidate he supports a total ban on the procedure with no exceptions. Walker is no stranger to controversy in this election and he has also made headlines for how he talks about race, saying Democrats like his opponent use it to divide. As a senator, candidate and senior pastor at Dr. Martin Luther King's Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Warnock has spoken often about dismantling systemic racism. During his first floor speech in the Senate, Warnock slammed new restrictive voting laws around the country. \"This is Jim Crow in new clothes,\" he said. Conflicting approaches to grappling with race have come into sharp relief in the first Senate race in Georgia history to nominate two Black men. Walker and Warnock's worldview began to diverge decades ago \u2013 as Walker shined on the field and Warnock rose to the pulpit. \"These are two of the most important institutions for questions of democracy and equality,\" explained Leah Wright Rigueur, a political historian at Johns Hopkins University. \"The institution of the church is, for many Black communities, a lifeline. It's an organizing and mobilizing space. Certainly sports becomes a site of resistance, in terms of African Americans desegregating teams, African Americans using sports to grasp some measure of social mobility.\" When Walker played football and track at Johnson County High School, it had only been integrated a few years.

He recalled their members stalking Black kids as they walked home from school, yanking them into the woods for mock lynchings. \"There is a broad misconception about what life is like in the 1980s in the South,\" Riguer says. \"There still remains a very segregated economically unequal society for African Americans.\" For Warnock, that society was Savannah, Georgia and the public housing complex where he grew up. As a teen, Warnock spent hours at a nearby library listening to archival recordings from the civil rights movement \u2013 especially speeches by King. An undated photo of young Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) outside the public housing complex where he grew up\n                \n                    \n                    Warnock campaign\n                    \n                \nhide caption An undated photo of young Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) outside the public housing complex where he grew up \"There are men who stand up in the pulpit and preach every Sunday, and yet they can look at racial injustice and never open their mouths against it,\" King bellowed in a particularly influential sermon for Warnock \u2013 \"A Knock at Midnight.\" \"He preached a different kind of gospel from what I typically heard in most churches,\" Warnock wrote in his memoir. \"He used the lens of the scriptures to examine and speak out against racial injustice and oppression.\" Warnock continued to be influenced by King as he selected his university: Morehouse College, the historically Black school in Atlanta attended by King four decades earlier. Warnock signed up to serve as an assistant at the King Memorial Chapel on campus. The dean, Lawrence Carter, became Warnock's mentor. \"Supremely confident, mature beyond his years,\" Carter remembered Warnock in an interview. \"He seemed to be in a zone all by himself. He frequently would come into the chapel library, no one else there, and study and write.\" It was at the chapel where Warnock's ideas about racial justice and faith coalesced. \"When our chapel is packed and our 6,000 pipe organ is sounding in their ears, surrounded by people doing bold things, that pours iron into your spine,\" Carter says. \"And when you see injustice, you want to do something about it.\" At around the same age, Herschel Walker would soon be called on to raise his own voice in Wrightsville. Walker had just led Johnson County High School to the 1980 state football championship. It was national news when Walker accepted a full-ride to play for the University of Georgia. Days later, Wrightsville attracted the country's attention again. Protests against racial injustice had broken out, directed at the county's white sheriff. As marchers gathered, they were met with violence. The Klan mobilized and the governor called in state troopers, while schools and factories closed. Local residents and out-of-town civil rights leaders pleaded for Wrightsville's most famous resident to speak out. \"It was like, 'Oh Herschel, you've got to do this, you've got to do that,\" Walker said. \"White people called him the N word and he had Black people calling him Uncle Tom,\" Tom Jordan, Walker's track coach and an early mentor, said in an interview. \"And he was just searching for his spot.\" Walker faced pressure as he weighed his own decision about whether to do something about racial injustices in Wrightsville.

You've got to run. Practice is at three and you know I don't tolerate missing.\" More than a dozen of Walker's teammates quit the track team. Walker did not. \"My parents taught me to do what's right,\" Walker said later. \"There's no color in right and wrong.\" He did not say anything publicly about the protests. \"What would have happened if I had went the other way?\" Walker told Killer Mike. \"Where would I be today? Because now I have an opportunity, where I can get a seat at the table.\" That seat at the table may be in the U.S. Senate. \"His political viewpoints and rejection of race as a consideration does not represent African American audiences,\" explained historian Leah Wright Rigeuer. \"It is, however, the perspective of the majority of working class white voters in the state of Georgia.\" Rigueur, who wrote a book titled The Loneliness of the Black Republican, says these views are not an anomaly \u2013 citing for example, Georgia-born Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas, one of the most conservative members on the bench. Rigueur says these perspectives should not be ignored or treated as a fringe viewpoint, particularly when coming from people with immense influence to shape American life. \"We should want to understand that because of what it tells us about the very nature of Black politics, but also questions of American democracy,\" Rigueur says. During this campaign the two men have laid out conflicting descriptions of the country's current divisions, as they compete in an election most polls show is a tossup and could determine which party controls the U.S. Senate. \"We're not a racist country,\" Walker said at a recent rally. \"The United States is the greatest country in the world today and it's time we get leaders that know that.\" \"Within 24 hours, we elected Georgia's first African American and Jewish senators,\" Warnock said last year on the Senate floor. \"Hours later, the Capitol was assaulted. We see in just a few precious hours the tension very much alive in the soul of America. And the question before all of us at every moment is what will we do to push us in the right direction?\" Warnock and Walker's lives took them in two different directions, and Georgia voters will choose which candidate they want to follow.",

            "article_content": "The U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments on Tuesday in a case that could put another nail in the coffin of the landmark Voting Rights Act, first passed in 1965 and aimed at eliminating race discrimination against minority voters. Since 2013, the Supreme Court has twice struck down or neutered major portions of the act. Now, once again, the law is on the chopping block\u00ad \u2014 this time on the question of how state legislatures may draw congressional district lines when the state's voters are racially polarized. At issue is Alabama's congressional redistricting plan adopted by the Republican state legislature after the 2020 census. More than a quarter of the state's population is African American, but in only 1 of 7 districts do minority voters have a realistic chance of electing the candidate of their choice. Black voters are either concentrated in that district so they are a supermajority there or spread out across the remaining six districts so that their voting power is diluted. It's a practice known as packing and cracking. \"In Alabama, voting is racially polarized, which means Black voters and white voters systematically vote for different candidates, particularly when Black candidates are on the ballot,\" says election law expert Richard Pildes. And that, he says, \"triggers the Voting Rights Act.\" Triggering the Voting Rights Act is a big deal, with special irony in this context. That's because this case involves a provision that Congress changed in 1982 to fix what it considered an erroneous Supreme Court interpretation of the statute. After the Supreme Court ruled in 1980 that voting rights advocates had to prove intentional discrimination in order to invalidate an electoral system, Congress  amended the law to make clear that minority voters only have to prove a discriminatory result \u2014 a considerably easier thing to do than proving intentional discrimination. Discriminatory result has been the standard since then, upheld by the Supreme Court and enforced by the lower courts. In January, a three-judge federal court panel ruled unanimously that Alabama could and should have created two compact congressional districts with a majority, or close to a majority, of Black voters: two districts instead of just one.  Two of the judges on the panel were Trump appointees, the third a Clinton appointee. The state appealed to the Supreme Court, which by a 5-4 vote blocked the lower court ruling\u00ad, which ordered a new map for the 2022 election, then nine months away. That was too much for Chief Justice John Roberts, a longtime critic of the Voting Rights Act, but who this time dissented along with the court's three liberals. He said he could find \"no apparent errors\" in the way the lower court applied existing precedents. What he didn't say was whether the court should revisit some of those precedents. And on Tuesday, the court hears arguments on whether to do just that. At issue is whether to overrule or modify those prior decisions that have governed the law for over 30 years. The existing precedents put an \"affirmative obligation\" in the face of racially polarized voting to \"give minority voters an equal opportunity to elect the candidates they prefer,\" says Pildes, a professor at the New York University School of Law. He notes that Alabama's arguments range from the narrow ones about how to interpret the 1982 amendments to the Voting Right Act, to more extreme arguments. One extreme argument, Pildes says, is that the Voting Rights Act doesn't apply at all to legislative redistricting plans, even though the court has historically applied the act to those plans. \"Or,\" he says, \"even more dramatically, that if [the Voting Rights Act] does apply in the way the lower court held here, then the act is unconstitutional.\" Unconstitutional because it is based on affirmatively creating a second compact district based on race. As Alabama put it in its briefs, by requiring a \"race-based\" redistricting map, the lower court indulged in \"the noxious idea that redistricting begins and ends with racial considerations.\" Countering that argument, Black voters contend that the state's argument boils down to a topsy-turvy, inside-out proposition: that any effort to eradicate racial discrimination is unconstitutional because it has to emphasize considerations of race.",

            "article_content": "Republican Sen. Ron Johnson is in a tight race against Democrat Mandela Barnes in the U.S. Senate race in Wisconsin. Rising crime has become a major issue in the campaign for both parties.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Republicans are putting crime center stage nationwide, and Wisconsin's Senate race is one of the most prominent examples. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben just came back from talking to voters there and brings us this report. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: At the GOP Fall Fest in Racine, Wis., last weekend, governor candidate Tim Michels emphasized crime. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TIM MICHELS: There are thousands of laws on the books to reduce crime, to stop crime. It just takes proper leadership. KURTZLEBEN: So did Congressman Bryan Steil. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRYAN STEIL: You're seeing the crime rates go up, and it's soft-on-crime politicians who continue to stand in the way. KURTZLEBEN: As did Republican incumbent Senator Ron Johnson. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RON JOHNSON: How about rising crime? I mean, you're aware of the fact that my opponent, Mandela Barnes, he's the guy who wrote the bill to release criminals without bail. KURTZLEBEN: Johnson is referring to Democratic Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes and his opposition to cash bail. Barnes argues his plan would keep people from, quote, \"buying their way out of jail.\" The attacks reflect what's going on nationally. In a memo earlier this month, the Republican National Committee highlighted crime as a way for Republicans to gain an advantage. Craig Gilbert is a fellow at Marquette University Law School and a columnist at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. CRAIG GILBERT: It's a pretty traditional kind of Republican message to paint Democrats as soft on crime, but it seems to be right now playing a bigger role in this campaign and certainly in the Republican advertising than in most of the statewide races that I can remember in Wisconsin. KURTZLEBEN: It's a decades-old tactic, and past attacks on crime have had racial or even racist components. Race has become a part of this fight as well. Supporters of Barnes, who is Black, have accused Republicans of racism in ads like this one, which attacks Barnes on crimes. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD, \"SO DIFFERENT\") UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: A different Democrat, a dangerous Democrat. KURTZLEBEN: Johnson's campaign denied the ad is racist. Gilbert sees the attacks as part of a wider Republican strategy. GILBERT: Republicans are vulnerable with suburban voters, certainly on the abortion issue and certainly in the Trump era. I think Republicans see crime as a way to kind of counter that trend. KURTZLEBEN: But then, he added, there are real existing fears about crime. In Milwaukee, the murder rate is up, which has many voters worried, including Democrats. I met Jen Whitton outside of a Mandela Barnes event. JEN WHITTON: I do think about crime. We live in Milwaukee, which is a very, unfortunately, high-crime city. I think about crime more in terms of, like, what we're doing to keep our children safe. KURTZLEBEN: Her main issue this year is guns in schools, traditionally framed as a separate issue from crime. Talking to voters emphasizes that especially when crime is up, neither party has a monopoly on worrying about it. Rather, crime becomes another example of how America's problems become reflections of very different worldviews. At the Barnes rally, Melanie McClellan argued for community investment and against the charge that Barnes wants to cut police funding. MELANIE MCCLELLAN: What he wants to do is just reposition those funds to go into other resources instead of cutting back on police forces because we obviously need police, you know, to help in the community. KURTZLEBEN: Meanwhile, outside of Fall Fest, Republican voter Rich Strohm told me that harsher punishments could help reduce crime. RICH STROHM: I do a lot of hunting. I'm a guns guy. But I would like to see when they're used illegally - boy, you know, lock them up, take - you know, they should really be taken seriously. KURTZLEBEN: Polls suggest Johnson has gained ground in recent weeks. It's impossible to know how much these attacks caused that shift. Regardless, Barnes is on the counteroffensive. He started a campaign push this week called Ron Against Roe to maintain the focus on abortion. Danielle Kurtzleben, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

GOP strategist John Feehery has been working to drum up support for the bill among Senate Republicans and says that protecting same-sex marriage isn't just a good political move but a step toward the future of his party. \"I do think that ultimately you don't want to take away the ability for people to get married once you gave them that ability,\" Feehery told NPR. \"Most Republican [voters] are focused on many other issues and will not vote against any Republican who votes for this bill.\" After facing backlash over the overturning of Roe v. Wade, some Republicans in swing states and swing districts are trying to find ways to appeal to constituents who may feel frustrated with the decision. \"For a lot of these senators, it takes a little bit of the edge off,\" Feehery told The Washington Post about supporting the same-sex marriage bill, adding that politically, the policy choice is a \"no-brainer.\" The Respect for Marriage Act, which was introduced in July, was drafted to repeal and replace provisions that define marriage explicitly as between a man and a woman. This legislation would require all states to recognize same-sex marriage on a federal level, and it recently passed the House with the support of 47 Republicans.

The Respect for Marriage Act was one of the focuses of their gathering.\n                \n                    \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer speaks during a news conference on Sept. 7 after a policy luncheon with Senate Democrats. The Respect for Marriage Act was one of the focuses of their gathering. Now, with a Senate vote to come next, doubts are being raised about whether the 10 Republicans needed to support the bill will come forward to push it through. Feehery is confident that more than enough Republicans are willing to support it, if the right circumstances encourage it. \"I think there are more than 10. But I don't think any of these want to be the 10th,\" Feehery said. \"So they're kind of waiting to see and then negotiating potential amendments to see if they have some wiggle room.\" In July, President Biden's press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, told reporters that Biden was a strong supporter of protecting marriage equality. \"He believes it is nonnegotiable and that the Senate should act swiftly to get this to the president's desk. He wants to sign this,\" Jean-Pierre said. Despite a 2021 Gallup poll finding that more than 55% of registered Republicans support same-sex marriage, Feehery said some are still staunchly opposed. \"There's a vocal minority amongst the Republican base that doesn't want this to happen,\" Feehery said. For some senators, Feehery said, weighing the will of their constituents against their own personal beliefs was proving to be a difficult balancing act, while others were concerned about whether the bill explicitly allows for religious exemption within the recognition of same-sex marriage. \"I think there are some valid worries here that a church will be sued if they refuse to perform a same-sex marriage in their church,\" Feehery said. \"I think that if there's an accommodation that can be made that protects the ability of churches to practice their religion freely but also allows people legally to get into binding contracts that are recognized in all 50 states, you know, we can find that way to achieve both ends.\" Advocacy groups like the Human Rights Campaign have mobilized thousands of their supporters and more than 170 businesses to voice their support for the bill. In a letter directed toward the Senate and signed by business leaders at companies like Amazon, Airbnb, Nike, Microsoft and more, they argue that ensuring the protection of same-sex marriage allows them to keep their employees happy. \"A patchwork of inconsistent and discriminatory state marriage laws goes against our company values and makes it harder for us to do business and to recruit and retain top talent,\" the letter reads. This widespread support, in addition to a demanding political landscape, is a key indicator to Feehery that many Republican constituents are not as concerned about this issue as people might think. \"This is not one of the top issues out there. I don't think it's going to be a huge political victory for Joe Biden,\" Feehery said. \"I don't think it's going to change the trajectory of this election, but I think ultimately it can be the right thing to do.\" The radio interview with John Feehery was produced by Karen Zamora and edited by Christopher Intagliata.",

ALBANY, Ga. \u2014 Johnnie Armstrong says he has voted in Albany since 1955, so he remembers an era when local officials tried to keep Black voters like him from the ballot box. \"They'd give you a bottle, a big thing with a lot of marbles in it,\" he says. \"You guess how many marbles, then you can vote.\" Armstrong says it felt remarkable that about 65 years later he got to help elect Georgia's first Black U.S. senator, Democrat Raphael Warnock. Even better, Armstrong says, is Warnock spending a muggy August morning taking selfies with voters on Albany's Ray Charles Plaza as he campaigns for a full term in Washington. Until recently, a statewide candidate spending significant time in this thinly populated, substantially Black, southwest corner of Georgia was virtually unheard of.

For years, Democrats failed to win statewide in Georgia. The ground began to shift about four years ago when Stacey Abrams made her first bid for governor. \"Atlanta cannot live without Albany, and Albany cannot live without the investments that come from Atlanta,\" Abrams said in 2017, launching her campaign, not in Atlanta, but in Albany. \"We need to talk to those forgotten voters, the ones who are rarely talked about. I am running for governor because we need a governor who comes from a town like Albany. Where we begin does not dictate what we become.\" Instead of bending over backward to court more conservative voters, Abrams focused on activating non-voters and irregular voters, especially people of color in overlooked parts of the state. \"I know everybody looks at Atlanta as the African American mecca,\" says Albany Commissioner Demetrius Young. \"But if you follow this blue wave in Georgia, it came right through Albany down into Southwest Georgia. We need to hold the ground that we've gained.\" Abrams' strategy got her within 55,000 votes of the governor's mansion in 2018, losing to Republican Brian Kemp. Two years later, it helped deliver Georgia for Joe Biden and flip two Senate seats, giving Democrats control of the U.S. Senate. Albany Commissioner Demetrius Young outside of Sen.

Young is glad candidates come to Southwest Georgia now, but he says they also need to deliver on their promises for a region that's not benefited as much from the state's economic growth. \"With the pandemic, it ripped wide open the disparities we knew were already there,\" he says. Roughly a quarter of Southwest Georgians live below the poverty line, nearly double the rate in the U.S. For a time, Albany had the country's worst per-capita death rate from COVID. After several grueling election cycles, many voters are tired and organizers are trying to combat that. On a drizzly Monday, Shayla Jackson, an Albany native with the nonpartisan New Georgia Project, canvasses a block of small homes, where backyard chickens roam freely. After striking out at a dozen or so addresses, Lavasha Hooks opens her door for Jackson, with a toddler hiding behind her legs. Hooks says the economy, racial justice and the pandemic are all on her mind. She plans to vote but she hasn't thought much about the midterms yet. She says she doesn't think politicians have done much to improve life in her corner of Georgia. \"The wages are too low in my current job,\" Hooks says. \"And everything is more expensive.\" Jackson walks Hooks through finding her polling location and asks if she will need a ride to the polls. The New Georgia Project, which does not canvas for candidates or parties, was founded by Abrams in 2014 as part of her strategy to expand Georgia's electorate.

More than 50,000 people have registered in Southwest Georgia since 2018. The majority are non-white, the New Georgia Project says. \"Look, for the most part, the rural characterization is true,\" says Dante Chinni, a researcher with the American Communities Project who has studied rural African American counties in the South. \"Rural America tends to vote for Trump, tends to be Republican. But when you divide the vote further, you see these subtleties and nuances.\" Nearly a quarter of rural Americans were people of color in 2020, according to an analysis by the Brookings Institution. And while the country's rural population is shrinking overall, its diversity is growing. Still, the biggest shifts from red to blue in 2020 were in the suburbs of metro Atlanta, where newcomers have poured in from out of state and where then-President Donald Trump repelled many moderate voters. And even while Democrats in racially diverse rural communities in the South turned out more voters in the 2020 presidential election than in 2016, turnout for Trump soared even more in these same counties, driven by white, rural voters. \"This is a both/and strategy. I think some people want to use it as an either/or,\" says Andra Gillespie, a professor of political science at Emory University. \"Even though Democrats expect to lose in rural parts of the state, they can't underperform there.

Its only hospital closed a few years ago. \"When the hospital closed, it became like a sudden death to us,\" says Rhonda Jones-Johnson, who used to work as a nurse there. \"It broke some of our lives.\" This spring, Jones-Johnson spoke alongside Abrams, who held her first formal campaign stop in front of the shuttered hospital. At the event, Jones-Johnson described how her aunt died waiting to access care. \"We had only one ambulance in the county,\" Jones-Johnson said. \"No emergency care. If only we had a hospital open here, I truly believe her life could have been saved.\" Both parties are trying to convince voters far from metro Atlanta that they're listening. Republicans, like Gov. Brian Kemp and Senate candidate Herschel Walker, are regularly barnstorming whiter rural counties, rallying their most reliable voters. Democrats hope to slice into the GOP's margins, particularly in racially diverse rural counties. Warnock has emphasized the plight of rural Black farmers.

In 1961, Black residents in Albany launched what's considered the country's first mass civil rights movement to desegregate an entire city. Bell says she's optimistic about what can happen as voters in this stretch of Georgia harness their power.

            "article_content": "We take a look at the battle between state courts and legislatures on who sets election rules, as well as the pending Senate vote on a same-sex marriage bill.  AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: The midterm elections are more than two months away, but the groundwork is already being laid for a fight on virtually every aspect of the elections, from redistricting to who gets to vote and more. We're joined by NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Good morning, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Ayesha. RASCOE: A group of top judges from all 50 states filed a brief on Tuesday urging the U.S. Supreme Court to not allow state election laws affecting federal elections to go unchecked. Basically, they feel that state courts should have oversight over election laws. This is a very strong message, right? LIASSON: That's right. This is a battle between state judges and state legislatures. And it all springs from a case called Moore v. Harper out of North Carolina, where the state legislature drew a new congressional map. The map was challenged by Democrats and activists. It was struck down by the North Carolina Supreme Court. But then the U.S. Supreme Court refused to uphold that state court order and will hear the case next month. This is extremely consequential for conservative justices on the Supreme Court who've already suggested they're favorable to what's called the independent state legislature doctrine, which gives politicians, in this case Republican state legislators, control over how elections are conducted with no judicial review from state courts, no checks and balances. So this is the latest battle in the war over democracy and who gets to set election rules, who gets to certify and count votes, etc. RASCOE: OK. I want to turn to the same-sex marriage bill which the Senate could vote on this week. It passed the House pretty easily, like, with lots of Republican votes, Like, is that going to happen in the Senate? LIASSON: Probably not. It got 47 Republican votes in the House. So far, it only has three Republicans who support it in the Senate. It's going to need 10 there'll there's - will be a filibuster. And Senators Tammy Baldwin and Susan Collins, Democrat and Republican, think they can get the seven more Republicans, although it's unclear who they might be. And some conservatives are saying, I would vote for this, but the bill is too vague on religious liberties. And Collins and Baldwin are trying to address those concerns with an amendment. But the bottom line here is that a big majority of Americans do support same-sex marriage. They want to keep it legal. The Supreme Court ruled it was constitutional. But in his concurring opinion, when overturning Roe v. Wade, Justice Clarence Thomas suggested that a bunch of other rights, including access to birth control and same-sex marriage, could also be overturned. RASCOE: So, Mara, is this one of those issues in this year's midterms that could help Democrats? LIASSON: Yes. You know, you and I have been talking about this. Issues like same-sex marriage, abortion, school prayer in the past hurt Democrats and favored Republicans. But all of a sudden, you see Republicans backing off, scrubbing their websites from statements they'd made in the past or positions they'd held like, all abortion should be illegal - because overturning Roe energized a lot of women. It increased voter registration among women. Democrats are very hopeful that this election will be the exception to the rule on the culture wars, where they'll have the advantage instead of Republicans. And because of the Dobbs decision overturning Roe, all of a sudden, being pro-life for a Republican in a battleground state is no longer rhetorical or theoretical. Now they have to answer questions like, is the fetus a person? Are all abortions murder? Are they for any exceptions? And instead of talking about critical race theory and transgender athletes, we're talking about legal abortions with restrictions - that's Roe - and same sex marriage. Both of those are popular mainstream positions. RASCOE: In the minute we have left, President Biden is holding his unity summit against hate on Thursday. There's been pressure on him to do this since May, when there was that horrible racist attack in Buffalo, N.Y., that left 10 people dead. What will you be watching for at this event? LIASSON: I'm watching to see whether Biden will be able to plant Democrats firmly in the mainstream on these issues, like gun violence and political violence, because there is a big middle to occupy here, and the Democratic Party right now is closer to it. Biden has been trying, with varying degrees of success, to make a distinction between what he calls MAGA extremists - Republicans who condone violence, who refuse to accept the results of elections - from mainstream Republicans who merely disagree with him on policy. And I want to see if his message is more nuanced on Thursday than his speech was a couple weeks ago. RASCOE: That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thank you so much, Mara.

ATLANTA \u2013 Stacey Abrams didn't always support abortion rights. The high-profile Democratic candidate for governor in Georgia, the daughter of two retired United Methodist pastors, grew up opposing abortion because of her religious beliefs at the time. But on the campaign trail ahead of the November midterms where Georgians will cast ballots in the contentious gubernatorial race, Abrams tells the story of her change of heart that happened in college. \"I evolved on this issue because I learned more. And what I understand is that abortion is not a political decision. It is a medical choice,\" she said during a press conference in July. Abortion rights have been thrust into the center of Democrat's campaign for statewide offices in Georgia. The Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and hand the decision on abortion back to states heightened the stakes of decisions made at the ballot box. Particularly in Georgia, where shortly after the ruling a federal appeals court decided the state's strict abortion law could immediately take effect. By a narrow vote in 2019, Georgia lawmakers passed a law that bans most abortions around six weeks of pregnancy, which opponents say is often before a person knows they're pregnant. It also includes controversial language that gives an embryo or fetus at any stage of development legal rights. That has prompted a slate of legal questions. Questions like whether or not a woman who has a miscarriage could be investigated for murder \u2013 although the law does not explicitly state that. Polling shows Abrams trailing slightly behind her opponent, incumbent Republican Gov. Brian Kemp with a little more than two months until the November election. But the party eyes a new opportunity for a boost in turnout in their favor: hopes that anger over the law will mobilize the base and even win over some swing voters. They have reason to be hopeful. In deeply conservative Kansas, voters recently turned up in droves to vote down a state constitutional referendum that would have dissolved abortion rights. Abrams said that moment gave her hope. \"What that signals to us here in Georgia is that we have the same power. We are not a hyper-conservative state. We are a divided state,\" she said. \"But that division disappears when you look at what's happening around the issue of abortion.\" A recent poll conducted by the University of Georgia for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution showed that more than half of voters do not support the state's new abortion law. Audrey Haynes, professor of political science at the university, said that Republicans may have alienated some independent voters with their strict abortion choices \u2013 a group that will be crucial in November as the margin of votes between statewide candidates has gotten slimmer over the past few years. \"It is clear that in the state of Georgia, most people \u2013 the majority of people \u2013 are opposed to what happened with Roe v. Wade,\" she said. \"In fact, I think that one of the problems that Republicans have in this case is that they are projecting a level of conservatism on the electorate that doesn't really exist.\" Republicans cheered the ruling when a federal appeals court in Georgia allowed the 2019 law to go forward after three years tied up in court. \"We are overjoyed that the court has paved the way for the implementation of Georgia's Life Act,\" said Kemp in the halls of the state Capitol in July. But since initial reactions, the party has been quiet on the issue. Instead, Republicans in Georgia and nationally are working hard to leverage disapproval with President Joe Biden and the national economy as their go-to rallying cry to voters. National polling from Monmouth University shows inflation is still top of mind for voters as they face sky-high prices at the grocery store and the gas pump. Martha Zoller, the executive director for Georgia Life Alliance and longtime conservative commentator, is skeptical that abortion as a driving issue will have a measurable impact on the outcome of the election. \"I think people that are pro-life are already voting Republican and people that are pro-choice are already voting Democrat,\" she said. \"In light of the economy and inflation, I just still think that this issue is not going to be the number one issue for most voters.\" The top of the state ticket in Georgia is nearly entirely women \u2013 Stacey Abrams is the nominee for governor, Jen Jordan is up for attorney general and Bee Nguyen is in the contest for secretary of state. The party has launched an aggressive effort to reach women voters \u2013 Democrats and Republicans alike \u2013 on the issue with emotional personal appeals. \"As more and more women understand what is happening, as more and more women face the reality of this law, we will see more and more women turn out,\" Abrams speculated. In the basement of Abrams' headquarters, a small group of women gathered for an intimate conversation. Abrams sat in the middle of the six women with a grim look on her face as they shared their personal stories of miscarriage. Atlanta resident Alana Leverette emotionally described going through two miscarriages \u2013 one while she was at work.

I felt very, again, sad,\" she said. \"But I wished I had more of a support system to be able to say, I need a minute, I need to grieve.\" Uncertainty around Georgia's new law has sparked deeply personal conversations like this one across the state, although abortion opponents adamantly deny that the law would open a path for women to be investigated for murder after a miscarriage. \"The left is just trying to scare people,\" Zoller, with the Georgia Life Alliance, said. Democratic state Rep. Shea Roberts was also among the group of women gathered at Abrams' headquarters that day. She, too, has been sharing her own abortion story after she made the decision 15 years ago to terminate a pregnancy after bloodwork showed the baby would not survive outside the womb. In 2020, she narrowly beat a Republican incumbent in a suburban Atlanta district \u2013 her opponent was one of the few GOP lawmakers who voted against Georgia's abortion ban in 2019. With suburban women a highly sought-after voter demographic, Roberts is focusing a portion of her reelection campaign on reaching Republican and independent women on the issue of abortion. \"I'm hoping that's going to show up at the ballot box,\" she said. \"I'm hoping that people understand. Yes. There are economic issues that need to be addressed right now.

RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Before about 500 worshippers at an evangelical Christian church in a working-class Rio neighborhood, Pastor Abner Ferreira works himself into a frenzy describing the power of God to save souls. But he's just as fervent about politics. During the nearly three-hour service, Ferreira praises Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and displays photos of himself alongside the right-wing leader on a giant screen displayed behind the altar. Later, in an interview with NPR, he says evangelicals are drawn to Bolsonaro because he promotes conservative family values and opposes abortion and same-sex marriage.

He trails his main opponent in the race, former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, in all of the polls, mainly due to Brazil's stagnant economy.

Brazilians go to the polls in their presidential election on Oct. 2. In the last election, evangelicals, who now make up nearly one-third of the Brazilian population, demonstrated their clout. Nearly 70% of them favored Bolsonaro ahead of the 2018 presidential election runoff, helping him score an easy victory, according to the Brazilian polling firm Datafolha. Nearly one-fourth of Brazil's Congress is made up of evangelicals, while Bolsonaro has named them to his Cabinet. In December, he appointed the first-ever evangelical pastor, Andr\u00e9 Mendon\u00e7a, to the Supreme Court. Upon the announcement, first lady Michelle Bolsonaro, a fervent evangelical, was ecstatic, jumping up and down shouting \"Hallelujah!\" It's a huge change for Brazil, which has long been the world's largest Roman Catholic country. For a time in the 1800s, Catholicism was its official religion while other denominations were not allowed to open churches, says Juliano Spyer, a Brazilian anthropologist who studies the evangelical movement. Evangelicals \u2014 conservative Protestants who, in general, believe the Bible is the ultimate moral authority and that lives must be transformed through a \"born-again\" experience \u2014 made up just a tiny fraction of the population. But amid mass migration from the countryside to Brazilian cities that started in the 1950s, evangelical churches began sprouting up in poor urban neighborhoods. \"People were coming from all sorts of places. They were disconnected from their families. And the church became this substitution for a family,\" Spyer says. He recalls doing field work in a poor settlement near the Atlantic coast city of Salvador. It had one Catholic church and 80 evangelical churches which, due to fewer internal regulations and bureaucracy, are easier to open. In impoverished areas ignored by the government, he says evangelicals have stepped in to provide everything from spiritual guidance to day care and after-school sports programs.

Among the faith's best-known projects are drug-rehabilitation centers, like the Desafio Jovem Eben\u00e9zer facility about an hour west of Rio. There, 128 live-in patients receive religious instruction and classes in auto mechanics and other technical training as they recover from addictions to cocaine, heroin and alcohol. One of the supervisors, Carlos Faria, is a former drug addict who was treated here. He was living in the streets of S\u00e3o Paulo when evangelical pastors invited him into a church. Soon afterward, he was admitted to the rehab center where, Faria says, through the help of God, he kicked his cocaine addiction. \"I was going through some very hard times,\" Faria says as he walks around the grounds of the treatment center. \"But I found refuge in Jesus Christ.\" Carlos Faria at the Desafio Jovem Eben\u00e9zer drug rehabilitation center on July 18.\n                \n                    \n                    John Otis/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Carlos Faria at the Desafio Jovem Eben\u00e9zer drug rehabilitation center on July 18. Evangelicals now make up 31% of Brazil's population, according to a 2020 survey by Datafolha. They're still outnumbered by Catholics, who make up about 51%, according to the survey, but evangelicals are growing at a much faster clip. Looking ahead, Jos\u00e9 Eustaquio Alves, a demographer formerly with the government's Institute of Geography and Statistics, told the Infobae news service that evangelicals would match the Catholic population by 2032. \"In 10 years, Brazil will cease to be a Catholic country,\" Fabio Zanini, a columnist for Folha de S.Paulo newspaper who covered the rise of Bolsonaro and the religious right, told NPR. However, not all evangelicals are conservatives. Many are poor, single mothers, and of African descent, and have often voted for left-wing political candidates due to their economic proposals, says Anna Virginia Balloussier, a Brazilian journalist who is writing a book about the country's evangelical movement. Lula, as the former leftist president is known, is Catholic but he is also trying to woo evangelical voters, who analysts say are often more politically active. Evangelical Pastor Silas Malafaia speaks to churchgoers at the Assembleia de Deus Vit\u00f3ria em Cristo Church in the neighborhood of Penha, Rio de Janeiro, on Sunday. \"The most fundamental and important value for us is the family,\" Malafaia told NPR. \"Any candidate that threatens this value will be bombarded.

Lula criticized the traditional family, and I took the stick and hit back with force.\" \"The evangelical community is more engaged in everything they do. And so it's easier to mobilize people in evangelical churches right now,\" Balloussier told NPR. Bolsonaro is working hard to prevent evangelicals from defecting to Lula. At a meeting with evangelical pastors last month, Bolsonaro declared that real Christians don't vote for left-wing candidates. At another encounter in May, he told pastors that God entrusted in him a hard mission \u2014 the mission of leading Brazil. The pastors responded with a standing ovation for Bolsonaro \u2014 and then by praying for him.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. \u2014 A combination of new election laws and congressional redistricting has made it harder for Black communities in Florida to organize and vote, activists say. Florida, which concludes its primary elections on Tuesday, is among various Republican-led states that have passed laws since the 2020 election that place new restrictions on voters \u2014 as well as on third-party groups that play a big role in registering racial minorities in Florida. Ben Frazier and his small civil rights organization, the Northside Coalition of Jacksonville, recently spent an afternoon in the city helping a group of older Black voters update their voter registration. That way, Frazier said, there are no issues when they go to vote. \"We don't want your voter registration form to be thrown out for any reason,\" he said. \"They are doing a lot of different things to suppress the Black vote in this city and in this state.\" Last year, Republican lawmakers in Florida passed Senate Bill 90, a sweeping law requiring people to apply to vote by mail more often. It also set new limits on drop boxes. And this year, legislators passed Senate Bill 524, which creates new and harsher penalties for voter registration organizations for things like turning in forms late. And notably, Frazier said, the latter law created a new policing unit focused on voting crimes. \"I think all of that has a chilling effect. People are afraid of the police,\" he said. \"We know that this is one of many attempts to suppress the Black vote.\" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks during a press conference Thursday in Fort Lauderdale, where he announced that the state's new Office of Election Crimes and Security is in the process of arresting 20 individuals across the state for voter fraud.\n                \n                    \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption On Thursday, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis announced this new policing unit is charging 20 people with voting illegally in 2020. He said those individuals had felony convictions that prevent them from getting their voting rights back. Several details were not made public at the time, though, including that some of those charged have told the Tampa Bay Times and the Miami Herald that they weren't told they couldn't vote. Their races were also not disclosed. DeSantis said in a press conference that the charges and the investigation carried out by the new agency mark the beginning of the state getting serious about combating alleged voter fraud. \"Before we proposed this [unit] there were just examples of this stuff seeming to fall through the cracks,\" he said. \"So this is just the opening salvo, this is not the sum total of 2020.\" Experts have found voter fraud to be exceedingly rare. Black activists say the reaction to the 2020 election from Republicans leaders in the state is part of a larger effort to diminish Black voting power. Earlier this year, a federal judge ruled that SB 90, in particular, is part of the state's long and \"grotesque\" history of racial discrimination. Soon after the ruling, an appeals court ordered that the law stay in place while legal challenges worked their way through the courts. The Justice Department in recent days agreed that the law is intentionally discriminatory. Reginald Gundy, the pastor at Mt. Sinai Missionary Baptist Church in Jacksonville, says all these new rules in Florida feel deeply personal. Gundy has spent a lot of his time registering voters in communities of color \u2014 mostly Black voters \u2014 in North Florida. Since 2018, Gundy estimates he's registered more than 80,000 people in Duval County alone, which is the county encompassing Jacksonville. Gundy also works to get the vote out, making sure that the people his group registers actually go to the polls during elections. \"If they don't go to polls, we would be like, 'Hey, look you are registered to vote, you haven't voted, you need to go vote,' \" he said. \"We can't tell people who to vote for, but we've been very good at that. So, as a result of that it has brought about a change in Duval County.\" In 2020, Joe Biden won Duval County. It was the first time in decades a Democratic presidential nominee won there. Gundy says this change is not something that went unnoticed by Republican leaders in Florida. In fact, he thinks it's why DeSantis recently redrew the state's congressional lines in a way that cut the number of opportunity districts for Black voters in half. Before redistricting, the state had four seats where Black voters had enough votes to elect the candidate of their choice. Now the state only has two seats like this. One of those lost seats included Black communities in Jacksonville. \"The way they have reconfigured \u2014 redrawn the district in Duval County \u2014 has taken away the right for Blacks to vote and have a representative in Congress,\" Gundy said. \"We will have a congressional leader without proper representation for who we are.\" Gundy says Black voting power and organizational power is the weakest it's been in decades. \"It's sad and we've got to figure out how to fix it,\" he said. In a statement, DeSantis' office said his redistricting decision had nothing to do with politics. A spokesperson said the governor's priority was to \"make sure that the congressional maps would be constitutional and withstand anticipated legal challenges.\" The argument DeSantis made to the state legislature when he vetoed their maps and submitted his own is that he thought the majority-minority district that included Jacksonville is unconstitutional. In a letter to lawmakers, he said the district wasn't compact and \"didn't conform to usual political or geographic boundaries.\" He argued the district was written to favor one race over another, which DeSantis said violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Michael Sampson II, with the Jacksonville Community Action Committee, says he does not buy that DeSantis \u2014 who's thought to be considering a presidential run \u2014 didn't make a political calculation here. \"It's a clear choice to dilute the Black voting power, the Black political power in D.C., especially as the governor is planning his run for president,\" he said. Sampson adds that what is happening in Florida amounts to a \"white blacklash\" reacting to a summer of civil rights protest following the murder of George Floyd. Christina Kittle with Florida For All agrees. \"There's been just a clear attack on organizers and protesters within the Black community, especially since 2020,\" she said. \"When there are clear attacks like that it does make it difficult for us to move. But I don't think ... it hasn't stopped us. We are still out there doing the work. I see other people are too. It's just more difficult.\" Meanwhile the state has big elections on the horizon this fall. DeSantis is up for reelection. And Rep. Val Demings is vying to oust Sen. Marco Rubio. If she wins the uphill battle, Demings would be the state's first Black U.S. senator.",

JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: This coming Tuesday in Florida is primary day, and some activists say this election is happening at a time where Black voters in Florida have far less political power than they've had in a long time. They blame Republican-backed voting laws as well as a new congressional map. NPR's Ashley Lopez reports. ASHLEY LOPEZ, BYLINE: It's a muggy afternoon, and Ben Frazier is at a park in Jacksonville. He's sitting in a circle with some older Black voters from the area. Some of them are dictating their information to volunteers with Frazier's group who are filling out voter registration forms. BEN FRAZIER: I want the canvassers to fill out the form - period, point blank, over and out. LOPEZ: There are a few local organizations doing outreach in the park. Frazier's small civil rights group is the Northside Coalition of Jacksonville and is making sure these voters have an updated voter registration record. FRAZIER: We don't want your registration forms to be thrown out for any reason. They're doing a lot of different things to suppress the Black vote in this city and in this state. LOPEZ: Since the 2020 election, Florida Republicans have passed voting bills that Frazier says will make it harder for Black people to vote and for groups like his to organize. Senate Bill 90 requires people to apply to vote by mail more often and sets new limits on drop boxes. Another, Senate Bill 524, increases and creates new penalties for voter registration organizations for things like turning in forms late. And notably, the law creates a new policing unit focused on voting crimes. FRAZIER: Yeah, I mean, I think all of that has a chilling effect. People are afraid of the police. We know that this is just one of many attempts to suppress the Black vote. LOPEZ: Just yesterday, Republican Governor Ron DeSantis announced this new policing unit is charging 20 people with voting illegally in 2020. He said these individuals had felony convictions that precluded them from getting their voting rights back. He said the charges mark the beginning of the state getting serious about combating alleged voter fraud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RON DESANTIS: Before we proposed this, there were just examples of this stuff seeming to fall through the cracks. So this is the opening salvo. This is not the sum total of 2020. LOPEZ: It's unclear, though, whether those charged knew they couldn't vote. We also don't know their race. But Black activists say these new laws are part of a larger effort among Republican leaders to diminish Black voting power. Earlier this year, a federal judge ruled that SB 90 in particular is part of the state's long and grotesque history of racial discrimination. But an appeals court kept the law in place. In Jacksonville, Reginald Gundy, the pastor at Mt. Sinai Missionary Baptist Church, says the state's racial history has motivated his civic engagement group to register more than 100,000 people across North Florida since 2018 and get them to the polls. REGINALD GUNDY: They don't go to polls, we would - you know, hey, look, you haven't - you registered to vote, but you haven't voted. You need to go vote. We can't tell people who to vote for, but we've been very good at that. And so as a result of that, it has brought about a change in Duval County. LOPEZ: In 2020, Joe Biden won Duval County. It was the first time in decades a Democratic presidential nominee won there. Gundy says this change was noticed by Republican leaders in Florida. In fact, he says, he thinks this is why Governor DeSantis recently redrew the state's congressional lines to eliminate a seat in Jacksonville, where Black voters had a lot of influence on who got elected. GUNDY: The way they have reconfigured, redrawn the district of Duval County has taken away the right for Blacks to vote and have a representative in Congress. We'll have a congressional leader without proper representation for who we are. LOPEZ: In a memo to state lawmakers, DeSantis said he thought that the district was unconstitutional because it was written to favor one race over another, citing the equal protection clause. Regardless of this reasoning, though, experts say this decision will likely affect turnout among Black voters. Andrea Benjamin, at the University of Oklahoma, says research shows Black voter participation suffers when these voters are drawn out of districts with Black incumbents. ANDREA BENJAMIN: You know, I think that has to do with sort of who's outreaching, who's contacting voters. You know, the old saying of sort of I didn't vote because no one asked me to - right? - this idea that if someone's from your community, not only do you think that they might do a good job representing you, they also might do a better job outreaching to you - right? - so mobilizing you to vote. LOPEZ: Black activists in Florida say they are undeterred, but they recognize it's going to be harder to organize in this environment. Meanwhile, the state has big elections on the horizon. Republican Governor Ron DeSantis is up for reelection, and Val Demings is vying to oust Senator Marco Rubio. If she wins the uphill battle, Demings would be the state's first Black U.S. senator.

Alexander Kueng got three years Wednesday for violating George Floyd's civil rights. ST. PAUL, Minn. \u2014 The last two former Minneapolis police officers who were convicted of violating George Floyd's civil rights during his May 2020 killing were sentenced Wednesday in federal court to three and 3 1/2 years \u2014 penalties that a judge said reflected their level of culpability in a case that sparked worldwide protests as part of a reckoning over racial injustice. J. Alexander Kueng was sentenced to three years and Tou Thao got 3 1/2 years. They were convicted in February of two counts of violating Floyd's civil rights. The jury found they deprived the 46-year-old Black man of medical care and failed to stop Derek Chauvin as he knelt on Floyd's neck for 9 1/2 minutes. As Chauvin pinned Floyd's neck, Kueng held Floyd's back, Officer Thomas Lane held his feet and Thao kept bystanders back during the killing, which was recorded by bystanders. The federal government brought the civil rights charges against all four officers in May 2021, a month after Chauvin was convicted of murder and manslaughter in state court. They were seen as an affirmation of the Justice Department's priorities to address racial inequities in policing, a promise made by President Joe Biden before his election. And they came just a week after federal prosecutors brought hate crimes charges in the killing of 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia and announced two sweeping probes into policing in two states. Kueng and Thao were convicted in February of two counts of violating Floyd's civil rights. The jury found they deprived the 46-year-old Black man of medical care and failed to stop Chauvin. Kueng, who is Black, was sentenced to three years on each count, to be served concurrently. The lower sentence for Kueng and Thao raise questions about whether he would consider a plea deal or risk a state court trial on Oct. 24, when they face counts of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Chauvin, who pleaded guilty last year to violating Floyd's civil rights and the civil rights of a teenager in an unrelated case, was sentenced to 21 years in federal prison. Lane, who twice asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side so he could breathe, was convicted of one count and was sentenced last week to 2 1/2 \u2014 a sentence Floyd's brother Philonise called \"insulting.\" Kueng and Thao got a victory last week when Magnuson issued rulings that affected how their federal sentences would be calculated. The rulings \u2014 particularly one that cross-references their crimes with involuntary manslaughter instead of murder \u2014 meant the men headed into Wednesday's hearings with a recommended range of 4 1/4 years to 5 1/4 years. They might have faced a life sentence. Mark Osler, a professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law and former federal prosecutor, said ahead of the hearings that Kueng and Thao would likely seek a plea deal on the state charges that won't exceed the federal sentence and will let them serve the sentences concurrently. Kueng and Thao can still appeal their federal convictions. If they plead guilty in state court, any federal appeal would be moot, said Mike Brandt, a criminal defense attorney who has been following the case. But it's also hard to win a federal appeal, he said. \"Those are some of the calculuses they are going to have to make in terms of, `Do I go to trial and risk something worse? Do I think I have a good shot at appeal on the federal case?'\" Brandt said. Lane, who is white, pleaded guilty to a state charge of aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter and is awaiting sentencing in that case. He was allowed to remain free on bond after his federal sentencing. Chauvin, who is white, was sentenced to a 22 1/2-year state sentence in addition to his federal sentence. Those sentences are being served simultaneously.",

            "article_content": "An interfaith group in Oregon has been working for years advocating for gun control in that state. Recent shootings have galvanized support among voters for their latest efforts.  AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: In Oregon, a gun control measure will likely appear on the November ballot. It's an effort born primarily of religious rather than political organizing. Katia Riddle reports from Portland. KATIA RIDDLE, BYLINE: A turning point for Rabbi Michael Z. Cahana was the Parkland shooting in Florida four years ago. After so many such tragedies, he was growing tired of listening to himself just talk about gun violence. MICHAEL Z CAHANA: Yes, the rabbi can get up and can give yet another sermon. And I was giving a lot of sermons on this subject, and that's not enough. RIDDLE: His faith and a feeling of desperation from his own congregation, Beth Israel, helped push him beyond thoughts and prayers. CAHANA: We have to have action. RIDDLE: Cahana led his Portland synagogue into an effort to change the law in Oregon. If Measure 17 passes, the state will require safety training and background checks for people purchasing guns. High-capacity magazines will be banned altogether. CAHANA: And so when we were able to say, and here's something you can do, you can start gathering signatures right now to get this on the ballot - that got people engaged. MARK KNUTSON: Synagogues, church, mosque, temples - that's where a lot of the good movements start. RIDDLE: Pastor Mark Knutson is standing in the basement of his Augustana Lutheran Church in northeast Portland. It's buzzing with energy. A dozen volunteers sort signatures in tidy piles. Knutson says it's in part history that inspires this effort. KNUTSON: The civil rights movement came out of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, you know, on Dexter Avenue in Montgomery. And I've been there. I've done those - out of a little church basement came amazing things. RIDDLE: Knutson recruited rabbis and imams, Native American spiritual leaders and evangelical ministers. Getting the measure on the Oregon ballot requires a hundred and twelve thousand signatures. It's a number, they say, they've surpassed with a surge of support after recent shootings. SIMONE MARTIN: After Uvalde, especially, we sent, on the first day out, 800 packets for people who wanted to be circulators. RIDDLE: Simone Martin is the campaign organizer here. She says at one point, they were hurting for circulators to gather signatures. After Uvalde, they had more than they knew what to do with. MARTIN: Oh, my gosh. It was almost overwhelming. Like, I still have people waiting to volunteer now. RIDDLE: At one point, volunteer Joe Paterno was collecting signatures seven days a week. He's a member of this Lutheran congregation. JOE PATERNO: I can't separate my faith from this work and this kind of movement. RIDDLE: In the days leading up to the signature gathering deadline, Paterno is working outside a grocery store. Advocating for gun control, he says, is how he lives out his faith. PATERNO: It's what we should all be about, is caring for each other. RIDDLE: Despite the religious foundation of this effort, volunteers say God is not really a talking point in the campaign. Delivery driver Steve McMullen has just signed. He leans on his dolly while he chats with Paterno. PATERNO: Whereas our best weapon is talking to each other. STEVE MCMULLEN: Yeah. PATERNO: Yes. MCMULLEN: Or just using your feet and walking away from a situation. RIDDLE: Mostly conversations go more like this one - volunteers appealing to people out of common sense. Rainer Gades also gathers signatures in this parking lot. RAINER GADES: Coming from Germany, I never understood the gun culture here in the United States. RIDDLE: Gades says after more than 15 years here, he's never stopped being shocked at how easily people can kill each other. He's wearing a cap that reads, out-of-the-closet atheist. He says it's the issue that drew him to this cause. GADES: For me, it's a clear-cut thing. You know, less guns means less violence. RIDDLE: He's just got a signature from Mary Elizabeth Smith. She says this effort won't eliminate gun violence, but it can't hurt. MARY ELIZABETH SMITH: Even if it is just a Band-Aid, it's still something, you know? RIDDLE: Got to start somewhere. SMITH: Yeah, you got to start somewhere. RIDDLE: Smith grew up Christian. She no longer considers herself a part of the church, but she says she still tries to live many of the teachings of Christ that she was raised with. She's happy to support this effort that was organized by people of faith. SMITH: Yeah, it's great. Using religion for good is always a good thing. RIDDLE: Smith says there's no use of an assault rifle that's Christ-like. For NPR News, I'm Katia Riddle in Portland, Ore.

            "article_content": "Even as the Jan. 6 hearings play out, election misinformation keeps spreading. NPR tracked four leaders preaching false information about election fraud at hundreds of grassroots events nationwide.  MILES PARKS, HOST: Over the past few weeks, the January 6 Commission has shown how many lives were upended by Donald Trump's false attacks on the American election system. Ruby Freeman and her daughter Shaye Moss were election workers in Georgia during the 2020 election, and they were driven into hiding when Trump and his team falsely accused them of rigging the election. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RUBY FREEMAN: The President of the United States is supposed to represent every American, not to target one. But he targeted me, Lady Ruby, a small business owner, a mother, a proud American citizen who stand up to help Fulton County run an election in the middle of the pandemic. PARKS: In the year and a half since, it hasn't gotten easier for people involved in elections. The lie that the 2020 election was stolen continues to spread. And over the past few months, I worked with NPR's investigations team to track the people who work every day to keep spreading it. The story took me to Weld County, Colo., where on a recent Wednesday morning, Carly Koppes was reading through her emails. Koppes is a Republican, and she runs the county's elections. CARLY KOPPES: (Reading) Traitors will be exposed. These guys are going down, and you have no chance. PARKS: Over the past year and a half, she's gotten more and more messages like that, accusing her and her colleagues of election fraud. KOPPES: (Reading) You deserve everything coming your direction. Bless the Lord and glory to God. Isaiah 45:7 (laughter). PARKS: A big part of that tone shift can be traced back to April of 2021, Koppes said, when a guy named Douglas Frank came to town with a presentation on election fraud. KOPPES: It started because of, you know, Dr. Frank and his really bad data analysis. Him and his people, unfortunately, just don't know how to read election records correctly (laughter). PARKS: Frank is a high school math and science teacher from Ohio, who's taken his election conspiracies on tour full time. When he came to Colorado, Frank took over a hotel conference room. He gave a presentation to dozens of people, including the Republican activist who posted this video of the event on Facebook. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Oh, Boulder. PARKS: He's pointing at a PowerPoint with charts and graphs and making a well-worn claim among election deniers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DOUGLAS FRANK: And up here too, up here too, right in here... UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Yep. FRANK: ...You've got more people voting than you have people. PARKS: You have more people voting than you have people, he says. That's a common election fraud myth that comes from mixing up population and voting data. And it's been debunked numerous times, including recently by a Republican-led oversight committee in Michigan. Over the past two years, the election denial movement has moved from Donald Trump's tweets to community events like that one, led by a core group of election denial influencers. An NPR investigation tracking them over the last 18 months found four in particular, with large followings, who travel widely - Douglas Frank... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANK: You know, I didn't serve in the military. I didn't serve my country in that way. And so this is my tour. PARKS: ...Mike Lindell of MyPillow fame... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MIKE LINDELL: Now that I know we have that big of an audience, I should start talking about the election crimes, right? PARKS: ...Retired Army Captain Seth Keshel... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SETH KESHEL: We have a real pandemic in this country, and it is called chronic electile (ph) dysfunction. PARKS: ...And former law professor David Clements. DAVID CLEMENTS: This is a spiritual battle. And last point, it's the machines. It's the machines. It's the machines. PARKS: The four either declined our request for comment or didn't respond, but we tracked their movements using social media and news reports and found that since last year's attack on the U.S. Capitol, they've appeared at at least 308 events in 45 states and D.C. The group know each other and often repeat each other's talking points, but they don't necessarily coordinate their efforts. Our investigation found that the scale and reach of the election denial movement has grown into a nationwide force beyond swing states and despite the January 6 committee's investigation and efforts to fight disinformation. Chris Krebs oversaw election security efforts at the Department of Homeland Security through the 2020 election. He says there's been a noticeable shift in strategy. CHRIS KREBS: It's this constellation of election conspiracy theorists. Rather than going at the national level, they have kind of decentralized post-January 6 and really trying to effect change at the lowest possible level. PARKS: But they also seem to spur action by regular people, who are inspired by their almost evangelical intimacy. Here's Clements at an election integrity event in a church gymnasium in Idaho. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLEMENTS: Let's say a prayer. Let's repent. Let's have an accounting for why we got into this mess. PARKS: In Colorado, there's been a clear chain reaction since Doug Frank's visit. Take Jim Gilchrist. He's a doctor of holistic medicine in Pueblo County, Colo. He already had doubts about the 2020 election and was looking for ways to get involved when he stumbled across one of Frank's videos. JIM GILCHRIST: I just kind of wish that there was some way of making sure the vote was counted correctly. And so Douglas Frank kind of offered a solution that we could do as citizens. PARKS: Inspired, he started volunteering with a canvassing group, and he says he spent more than 20 hours knocking on doors in Colorado last summer. And this kind of canvassing for fraud has popped up in a number of other states as well. But the leaders of this movement don't only target regular people. NPR found that over the past 18 months, the four election denial influencers either met or appeared with at least 78 federal, state and local elected officials, many of whom will have a role in how future elections are run and certified. Here's Mike Lindell at a rally in Arizona that was attended by at least three sitting members of Congress. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDELL: Our voice has gotten bigger and bigger every single day since last year, and you can't stop that. So we will get our country back, and God bless America. PARKS: The men also worked to persuade officials to embrace voting misinformation, like one meeting last spring between Frank and staff from the Ohio secretary of state's office. Through a public records request, NPR acquired audio of the meeting, which lasted more than 2 hours. The staffers pushed back on Frank's many fraud accusations, and at one point, he responded by threatening to send unauthorized people or, as he put it, plants, into election offices. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANK: We have plants everywhere that go into buildings when your machines are on and capture your IP addresses. We have those, not necessarily in Ohio, but we can arrange for that. So what - all I'm trying to point out to you is that this is coming. Be ready. And I'm not trying to fight you. Do you see that I'm trying to help you? PARKS: The staffers in that room didn't budge, but shortly after that meeting, someone did attempt to breach an Ohio county's election network, though officials say no sensitive data was accessed. It's been a rapid rise in prominence for a group of men who, other than Lindell, were mostly unknown before the 2020 election. But now they've become influencers of a sort. They've even got merch promoting products along with election disinformation Body lotions, T-shirts, and the ubiquitous MyPillow often are part of the roadshow. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDELL: Here's two pillows and some sheets, because you're going to need them to sleep at all... PARKS: The events almost always include instructions, too. At one David Clements event NPR attended, he ended his presentation by begging people to show up at the offices of their county commissioners. They respond to fear, he told them. And maybe predictably, election officials have felt a ripple effect from messages like that. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson says her office has seen a direct correlation between election-denier events and harassment. JOCELYN BENSON: Whenever there is an appearance in which the former president or Lindell or others come out attacking our system, we know to expect an uptick in threats and add additional security as a result. PARKS: But the people in charge of America's elections have not figured out a perfect way to fight back. That's because election denialism has grown from a political movement into something almost religious, says Koppes, the county clerk in Colorado. KOPPES: Some of these people really, truly believe they're doing the Lord's work. But I think, you know, at the end of the day, it has - they so desperately want to believe what they're being fed, that they're using all means to justify what they're doing. PARKS: It's become almost pointless trying to convince these sorts of voters otherwise, she says. But Franita Tolson, an elections expert at the University of Southern California, says she and Americans everywhere need to keep trying, because at each one of these events, the election denial movement pushes the U.S. closer to the brink. FRANITA TOLSON: So I think it's a existential threat to American democracy. PARKS: Tolson describes herself as an optimist, but she says democracy's survival isn't inevitable. TOLSON: That's never been the case. It's always been the case for over 200 years that people have fought for this. And we just have to continue fighting. PARKS: Ahead of the midterm elections, it's a fight that's moved out of the limelight and into hotel conference rooms, car dealerships, backyards and church banquet halls all across the country.

            "article_content": "The ruling party in Japan, to which the slain former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also belonged, is expected to dominate legislative elections there today.  AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: Exit polls suggest victory for Japan's ruling party in a parliamentary election that has been overshadowed by the assassination two days ago of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. It's hardly surprising that his party, which has run Japan for most of the past seven decades, is on track to win. But Abe's death may have boosted voter turnout and shifted the focus of the election. NPR's Anthony Kuhn is following the story from Seoul and joins us now. Welcome, Anthony. ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: Hi, Ayesha. RASCOE: So what's the latest on the results? KUHN: Well, based on exit polls, public broadcaster NHK is predicting that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP, and its coalition partner, the smaller Komei party, are going to claim more than half of the 125 seats up for grabs in the upper house of Parliament. And voter turnout appears to be more than the last upper house vote three years ago, but turnout then was below 50%. I don't think we can say that people are super enthusiastic about this election. It does look, though, like the ruling bloc will even hang on to its two-thirds majority, and that gives them a shot at amending Japan's constitution. The main aim there is to ease post-war restraints on Japan's military and the country's ability to wage war. And that issue was one of Shinzo Abe's big unfinished projects, as well as one that the LDP has pursued nearly - for nearly seven decades. RASCOE: What issues are voters focused on in this election? KUHN: This is the first election since Prime Minister Fumio Kishida took office about nine months ago, so it's seen as sort of a referendum on his performance. One big thing on many voters' minds is surging inflation, especially food and energy prices. Now, Japan has been plagued by deflation for decades. Abe tried to create inflation by printing lots of money and doing lots of government spending, and Abe's successors have mostly stuck with that policy. But the LDP's grip on power has been so strong and the opposition parties have been so divided that many voters really don't feel they have much of a choice. And that's been one reason for low voter turnout. RASCOE: Now, Abe's assassination has certainly focused attention on domestic security. Like, how is that playing out? KUHN: Well, we've heard a lot of reports in recent days about Japan's low crime rate, its gun control laws, its low-security election campaigning. But still, people are really shocked that a man with an improvised shotgun could, you know, sneak up on Abe from behind and shoot him not once, but twice without being spotted or stopped by police or bodyguards. The head of police in Nara city, where this happened, admitted that security was flawed. And he said he felt responsible, but he's not going to step down. Security for the election has been tightened with metal detectors and bag checks at Prime Minister Kishida's campaign stops. RASCOE: More details have come out about the alleged assassin. What's new on that front in just the 30 seconds we have left? KUHN: Well, police have found equipment in the suspected assassin's home to make several guns, gunpowder and bombs. One really important thing is that the police say that this may have been linked to a religious group who the killer felt Abe was connected to. And there are a lot of conspiracy theories going around and a lot of fingers pointing at foreign groups in Japan. RASCOE: That's NPR's Anthony Kuhn joining us from Seoul. Thank you so much.

TOKYO \u2014 Japan's governing party and its coalition partner scored a major victory in a parliamentary election Sunday imbued with meaning after the assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe amid uncertainty about how his loss may affect party unity. The Liberal Democratic Party and its junior coalition partner Komeito raised their combined share in the 248-seat chamber to 146 \u2014 far beyond the majority \u2014 in the elections for half of the seats in the less powerful upper house. With the boost, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida stands to rule without interruption until a scheduled election in 2025. That would allow Kishida to work on long-term policies such as national security, his signature but still vague \"new capitalism\" economic policy, and his party's long-cherished goal to amend the U.S.-drafted postwar pacifist constitution. A charter change proposal is now a possibility. With the help of two opposition parties supportive of a charter change, the governing bloc now has two-thirds majority in the chamber needed to propose an amendment, making it a realistic possibility. The governing bloc already has secured support in the other chamber. Kishida welcomed the major win but wasn't smiling, given the loss of Abe and the hard task of unifying his party without him. In media interviews late Sunday, Kishida repeated: \"Party unity is more important than anything else.\" He said responses to COVID-19, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and rising prices will be his priorities. He said he will also steadily push for reinforcing Japan's national security as well a constitutional amendment. Kishida and senior party lawmakers observed a moment of silence for Abe at the party election headquarters before placing on the whiteboard victory ribbons next to the names of candidates who secured their seats. Abe, 67, was shot while giving a campaign speech in the western city of Nara on Friday and died of massive blood loss. He was Japan's longest-serving political leader over two terms in office, and though he stepped down in 2020 was deeply influential in the LDP while heading its largest faction, Seiwakai. \"This could be a turning point\" for the LDP over its divisive policies on gender equality, same-sex marriages and other issues that Abe-backed ultra-conservatives with paternalistic family values had resisted, said Mitsuru Fukuda, a crisis management professor at Nihon University. Japan's current diplomatic and security stance is unlikely to be swayed because fundamental changes had already been made by Abe. His ultra-nationalist views and pragmatic policies made him a divisive figure to many, including in the Koreas and China. Following the assassination, Sunday's vote took on new meaning, with all of Japan's political leaders emphasizing the importance of free speech and defending democracy against acts of violence. Abe's killing may have resulted in sympathy votes. Turnout on Sunday was around 52%, up about 3 points from the previous 48.8% in 2019. \"It was extremely meaningful that we carried out the election,\" Kishida said Sunday. \"Our endeavor to protect democracy continues.\" On the final day of campaigning Saturday, party leaders avoided fist-bumps and other friendly gestures in close contact with the public \u2014 a sign of tightened security following Abe's assassination during a campaign rally. Abe's body has been returned to his home in Tokyo's upscale Shibuya, where many mourners, including Kishida and top party officials, paid tribute. His wake and funeral are expected in coming days. On Sunday, the suspect accused of his murder was transferred to a local prosecutors' office for further investigation, and a top regional police official acknowledged possible security lapses allowed the gunman to get close to Abe and fire his homemade gun at him. The suspect, Tetsuya Yamagami, told investigators he acted because of Abe's rumored connection to an organization that he resented, police said, but had no problem with the former leader's political views. The man hated a religious group that his mother was obsessed about and that bankrupted a family business, according to media reports, including some that identified the group as the Unification Church. Nara prefectural police chief Tomoaki Onizuka said Saturday that problems with security were undeniable, that he took the shooting seriously and will review the security procedures. Abe stepped down two years ago blaming a recurrence of the ulcerative colitis he'd had since he was a teenager. He said he regretted leaving many of his goals unfinished, including revising Japan's war-renouncing constitution. While some conservatives consider the post-World War II charter a humiliation, the public is more supportive of the document. Abe was groomed to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather, former Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi. His political rhetoric often focused on making Japan a \"normal\" and \"beautiful\" nation with a stronger military through security alliance with the United States and bigger role in international affairs. He became Japan's youngest prime minister in 2006, at age 52. But his overly nationalistic first stint abruptly ended a year later, also because of his health, prompting six years of annual leadership change. He returned to office in 2012, vowing to revitalize the nation and get its economy out of its deflationary doldrums with his \"Abenomics\" formula, which combines fiscal stimulus, monetary easing and structural reforms. He won six national elections and built a rock-solid grip on power. Japan is known for its strict gun laws. With a population of 125 million, it had only 21 gun-related criminal cases in 2020, according to the latest government crime paper. Experts say, however, some recent attacks involved use of consumer items such as gasoline, suggesting increased risks for ordinary people to be embroiled in mass attacks.",

It isn't hard for Maxwell Alejandro Frost to name political moments throughout his childhood that have stuck with him. \"Turning on the TV and seeing a bunch of people sleeping outside of Wall Street talking about something called 'wealth inequality' \u2013 seeing that in elementary school,\" Frost said. \"Growing up learning that 30 minutes away from me, a kid that looked like me who was wearing a hoodie was murdered for being Black, Trayvon Martin, and seeing the outrage after that,\" he added. Frost is running for Congress in Florida's 10th Congressional District, an open and solidly blue seat containing parts of Orlando \u2013 he's 25 years old, the minimum age to serve in the U.S. House. He's also part of Generation Z \u2013 which the Pew Research Center defines as anyone born between the years 1997 and 2012 \u2013 and, if elected, would potentially be the first Gen Z member of Congress. The 2022 midterm cycle marks the first time in 16 years that Millennials are not the youngest generation able to run, raising questions about how Gen Z will approach Washington. For Frost, his roots are in organizing, working as an activist since the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012 and most recently serving as the national organizing director for March For Our Lives, a youth-led group advocating for increased gun control policy. He's also a survivor of a separate incident of gun violence. He says that Gen Z has a new way of approaching politics, given this generation has come of age during such a volatile period in American history. \"Our generation has been born into a lot of trauma and a lot of civil unrest around people being frustrated with things. And I think because of that, our generation naturally thinks about things in a bit of a different way,\" Frost said. In the Saint Louis suburbs, 25-year-old Ray Reed is also breaking from the traditional mold. He's an organizer and former Democratic campaign staffer vying to oust Republican Rep. Ann Wagner in Missouri's 2nd Congressional District, and he pushes back against those who say he should start in local politics. Ray Reed, a Democratic candidate in Missouri's 2nd Congressional District, speaks to voters on April 28 at City Hall in Brentwood.\n                \n                    \n                    Brian Munoz/STLPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ray Reed, a Democratic candidate in Missouri's 2nd Congressional District, speaks to voters on April 28 at City Hall in Brentwood. \"The cynics kind of say, oh, he's too young, he's too untried, maybe if he were to spend, a few terms in Jeff[erson] City, maybe then he'll be ready to run for Congress. Which is really just political talk for let's get him in our system. Let's teach him how to play the game our way. And then if we say he's ready, he can run for a higher office,\" Reed said. He says cynics cast him out as the risky pick. \"I think the real risk is to nominate the same type of Democratic candidates election after election after election and somehow expect a different result,\" he added. Both Reed and Frost are progressives, honing in on issues like curbing gun violence, passing the Green New Deal and canceling student debt. After the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe vs. Wade, both candidates expressed outrage over the ruling and posted photos and videos of protests they attended. Reed also tied the decision back to Gen Z voters. A reporter just asked me what\u2019s my generation\u2019s response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn #RoeVsWade\u2014We\u2019re going to march, organize, and VOTE like our lives depend on it!\ud83d\uddf3 And while Frost and Reed are issue-oriented, there's no denying that age is part of their campaigns. To Frost, the potential to make history as the first Gen Z House member plays more of a symbolic role. \"Yes we march, yes we engage in mutual aid, yes we engage on social media, and now we're running for office because we believe that we are prepared to be in the rooms and to be the voice for our communities and we can do that and young people should be allowed,\" he said. Though Frost faces a challenge from his primary opponent, state Sen. Randolph Bracy, he has picked up a slew of high-profile endorsements, including from progressive leaders like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash. He's also got the backing of the Congressional Progressive Caucus PAC and the gun control organization Giffords. Frost and Reed's drive makes sense to Amanda Litman, a Millennial and the CEO of Run for Something, an organization that supports first-time Democratic candidates. \"You don't run for office as a 25-year-old because it is your next step in your career or it is the thing you've been planning for since you were a kindergartener or a college president,\" Litman said. \"You run because there is a problem that is so fiercely driving you that you can't imagine doing anything else with your time,\" she added. But this passion isn't just found among Democratic candidates \u2013 Karoline Leavitt is a fierce conservative running for Congress in New Hampshire's 1st District, a toss-up seat currently held by Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas.

Leavitt turns 25 in August, making her eligible to serve in Congress by next January. \"It's a very one-sided culture that we live in,\" Leavitt said, \"How do we break through that mold? It's by electing young people to office that can resonate with these voters, have a platform at the national stage, that can show them ideas, policies, values that they're not hearing elsewhere at all.\" Leavitt is already a vetted GOP staffer, working in the Trump administration as an assistant press secretary. Most recently, she served as the spokeswoman for Millennial Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who made history in 2014 as the youngest woman ever elected to Congress at that point. Leavitt is also endorsed by Stefanik, along with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Rep. Madison Cawthorn, N.C. Though Gen Z's early voting trends are decidedly liberal, Leavitt hopes her campaign will energize young conservatives and steer voters away from progressive ideas she argues are too extreme. \"I think some of these more progressive candidates are just a reflection of the system that exists and it's the exact system I'm trying to fight against,\" she said. Leavitt sits to the right side of then White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany as she holds a briefing at the James Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Leavitt sits to the right side of then White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany as she holds a briefing at the James Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House. From the opposite end of the political spectrum, Frost shares a similar fighting attitude when envisioning how he would work in a bitterly divided Congress. \"We come to the negotiating table not already at the compromise, which is usually what Democrats tend to do,\" Frost said. \"I think this is part of the reason why the Republican Party has these long-term plans that a lot of times come to fruition,\" he added. This determination to stand by your values shows an apparent deviation from the Millennial generation who came to Congress during the Obama presidency, according to Kristin Soltis Anderson, a conservative pollster and strategist \u2014 who's also a Millennial. \"The frame has shifted from, 'I'm going to bring about that change by being someone who looks for opportunities to work across the aisle,' and more, 'I'm going to disrupt the institutions and systems that are allowing the other side to continue to prevail,'\" she said. But coming to Congress and disrupting the institution isn't received the same way by Democrats compared to Republicans. \"It's very striking that while the Democratic Party does better among younger voters, they don't seem to have cornered the market on elevating younger candidates,\" Anderson said. To Litman, this is where Democrats have a big problem, and she points to the age breakdown among House leadership in each party. \"There is really no incentive for older folks in Congress to step aside and let a younger generation lead,\" Litman said, \"because the longer you serve, the more likely you are to get seniority within a committee.\" Stefanik (left) and Leavitt (Right) walk through the Capitol Visitors Center on May 14, the day Republican members voted Stefanik to House leadership.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Stefanik (left) and Leavitt (Right) walk through the Capitol Visitors Center on May 14, the day Republican members voted Stefanik to House leadership. Unlike on the Democratic side, Republicans have started elevating younger members. Last year, Stefanik moved up in GOP ranks, becoming the Chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, and bringing the average age of GOP leadership down to 55. On the Democratic side, Millennial trailblazers remain left out of leadership, and the average age is 71. This age disparity between parties prompts Anderson to argue that neither side has a real leg up right now. \"I don't think either party has a dramatic advantage on elevating Generation Z voices in elected office at this moment, and that's despite the fact that Democrats do have an advantage among those voters at the ballot box,\" she said. While both Democratic and Republican prospects with future Gen Z members remain unclear, the inaugural class running this midterm cycle forges onward towards their primaries. Reed's match-up in Missouri is set for Aug 1., Frost's in Florida is Aug. 23 and Leavitt's in New Hampshire is Sept. 13.",

NASHVILLE \u2014 At a recent gathering of thousands of religious conservative activists held by the Faith and Freedom Coalition, one thing immediately stood out: the crowd isn't as white as it used to be. That's not an accident, according to founder Ralph Reed. \"Our goal is, over the coming decades, to build a genuinely multiracial, multiethnic, faith-based movement that changes the demographic location of our movement,\" Reed said during a lunch roundtable with a handful of reporters. Attendees listened to Christian worship music \u2014 at times sung in Spanish \u2014 and attended sessions on how to turn out the vote in this year's midterms. The message, and the movement, is resonating with Black pastors like W.J. Coleman from Lewisville, Miss. \"Many realize they are conservative, but the word 'conservative' and 'Republican' have been made an evil word,\" he told NPR. \"But if you take that out of the equation, many more minorities would find themselves being that.\" The Supreme Court is handing down recent decisions in their favor \u2014 against abortion rights and in favor of public prayer \u2014 and the Republican Party's rising stars, like Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, are eagerly taking on the progressive politics of corporate America. Reed has been an activist in evangelical GOP politics for three decades. He runs the Faith and Freedom Coalition now, but he is best known for starting the Christian Coalition back in the early 1990s. He has been a controversial figure at times. In the mid 2000s, he got caught up in the Washington scandals involving disgraced former lobbyist Jack Abramoff, but Reed was never charged with any wrongdoing. He found his way back to national prominence after he embraced Donald Trump in 2016 and helped turn out the white evangelical vote in his favor.

It secured a 6-3 conservative majority on the Court and fulfilled a key promise Trump made to white evangelical voters in 2016, when Reed became a political ally. Reed's stock is once again on the rise as Republicans see a red wave coming in the fight for control of Congress this November. \"We are focused like a laser beam at turning out the largest faith-based evangelical and pro-life vote that we've seen in a midterm elections in our lifetimes,\" Reed said. He noted that when he started the Christian Coalition, the outfit built a database of 8 million voters. Today, Reed's database measures at 46 million voters. \"We will knock on more doors, touch more voters at the door, not only than we have ever touched in the history of the organization, but than I believe have been touched by any outside organization on the center right in my career,\" he said. If Reed sounds optimistic, he has reason to be. His organization has become a touchstone for any Republican candidate seriously considering a run for president. Trump spoke at his Nashville gathering last month. Plus, the decisive sway of evangelical voters in primary politics has ambitious politicians making moves to win them over. One of those presidential hopefuls, Florida GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis, recently went after the Walt Disney corporation's special tax status in his state after the company opposed a new state law prohibiting educators from discussing sexual orientation or gender identity with children before the 4th grade. Reed said that was \"a watershed moment\" for the conservative movement. \"For that to not only happen, but for it to happen like that, and for DeSantis to do it and not only pay no political price, but I would argue become a political beneficiary, and then for Disney to basically go radio silent and just take it, was unbelievable,\" he said. The Disney fight has emboldened activists to more aggressively take on institutions that have been their traditional political allies. Disney did not respond to a request for comment. \"If the Disneys and the Deltas and the Coca-Colas of the world are not careful, they're going to take the best friend they've ever had when it came to economic policy and regulation \u2014 and policies that would benefit their ability to grow their companies \u2014 and turn them into adversaries,\" he said. Reed sees issues involving sex and gender and parental rights as a new avenue for the Republican Party to make inroads with Black and Latino voters who attend church at higher rates than White voters do, according to the Pew Research Center. \"They really, really play and resonate powerfully in these minority communities,\" he said. \"Not among everybody, but it would be a minimum of 25% in the black community, and it would probably be a minimum 30% in the Hispanic community.\" Reed spoke to reporters days before the Supreme Court handed down the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, though the outcome was expected after the draft opinion was leaked. He did not think that abortion would be a major issue come November, noting historically only about 5% of voters list abortion as their number one reason for voting. \"I think this election is going to be about what we all know it's going to be about, which is the economy, inflation and high prices,\" he said. The impact, come November, could be a Republican controlled Congress emboldened to advance a more socially conservative agenda.",

WASHINGTON \u2014 Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on Thursday launched a $1 billion first-of-its-kind pilot program aimed at helping reconnect cities and neighborhoods racially segregated or divided by road projects, pledging wide-ranging help to dozens of communities despite the program's limited dollars. Under the Reconnecting Communities program, cities and states can now apply for the federal aid over five years to rectify harm caused by roadways that were built primarily through lower-income, Black communities after the 1950s creation of the interstate highway system. New projects could include rapid bus transit lines to link disadvantaged neighborhoods to jobs; caps built on top of highways featuring green spaces, bike lanes and pedestrian walkways to allow for safe crossings over the roadways; repurposing former rail lines; and partial removal of highways. Still, the grants, being made available under President Joe Biden's bipartisan infrastructure law, are considerably less than the $20 billion the Democratic president originally envisioned. Advocacy groups say the money isn't nearly enough to have a major impact on capital construction for more than 50 citizen-led efforts nationwide aimed at dismantling or redesigning highways \u2014 from Portland, Oregon, to New Orleans; St. Paul, Minnesota; Houston; Tampa, Florida; and Syracuse, New York. Meanwhile, some Republicans, including possible 2024 presidential contender Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, have derided the effort as the \"woke-ification\" of federal policy, suggesting political crosswinds ahead in an election season. \"Transportation can connect us to jobs, services and loved ones, but we've also seen countless cases around the country where a piece of infrastructure cuts off a neighborhood or a community because of how it was built,\" said Buttigieg, who was announcing the pilot program later Thursday in Birmingham, Alabama. He described Reconnecting Communities as a broad department \"principle\" \u2014 not just a program \u2014 to address the issue with many efforts underway. \"This is a forward-looking vision,\" Buttigieg said. \"Our focus isn't about assigning blame. It isn't about getting caught up in guilt. It's about fixing a problem. It's about mending what has been broken, especially when the damage was done with taxpayer dollars.\" The Transportation Department has aimed to help communities that feel racially harmed by highway expansions, with the Federal Highway Administration last year taking a rare step to pause a proposed $9 billion widening project in Houston, partly over civil rights concerns. That move likely spurred action in other places such as Austin, Texas, where environmental and racial justice groups recently filed a lawsuit to force the Texas transportation agency to better lay out the impacts of a proposed highway expansion there. Buttigieg drew fire from some Republicans earlier this year when he said the federal government had an obligation to address the harms of racist design in highways. \"There's trees they're putting in, they're saying that highways are racially discriminatory. I don't know how a road can be that,\" DeSantis said in February, dismissing it as \"woke.\" Under the program, $195 million in competitive grants is to be awarded this year, of which $50 million will be devoted for communities to conduct planning studies. The department will also launch a \"Thriving Communities\" initiative to provide technical support for potential projects that serve disadvantaged communities alongside the Housing and Urban Development Department. The Transportation Department has previously estimated it could help as many as 20 U.S. communities under the new program to remove portions of interstates and redesign streets by tapping into other transportation funds. According to the department, communities that win the Reconnecting Communities grants but still need additional funds will be prioritized in their applications for other pots of federal transportation money. Dozens more communities could derive benefit from the planning grants. \"Prior to 2021, the idea that we would deal with highway infrastructure that has divided communities was very much a fringe idea,\" said Ben Crowther, coordinator for the Boston-based Freeway Fighters Network, which is supported by the Congress for the New Urbanism. \"The Biden administration has really transformed that into mainstream thinking. We are thinking now this is something that is possible \u2014 that you can remove a highway and instead build safe streets that are walkable, add housing and address other community needs besides travel time.\"",

Seth Keshel, a retired U.S. Army captain, has worked to challenge the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n                \n                    \n                    Brian Snyder/Reuters\n                    \n                \nhide caption Seth Keshel speaks at a New Hampshire election security seminar presented by the New Hampshire Voter Integrity Group in Manchester, N.H., on Nov. 19, 2021. Seth Keshel, a retired U.S. Army captain, has worked to challenge the results of the 2020 presidential election. Editor's Note: Since this story's publication, NPR has updated the data accompanying this story to more accurately reflect the number of election-related events at which each influencer appeared. On a quiet Tuesday night in Howard County, Md., dozens of people gather in a community center and listen to Seth Keshel's 10-point plan. \"Captain K,\" as he's known in election fraud circles, is a former U.S. Army intelligence officer, and he is walking through his go-to presentation: comparisons of vote totals from the past few election cycles, which he falsely claims prove President Biden's win in 2020 was illegitimate. His 10-point plan to \"true election integrity\" includes banning all early voting and requiring all American voters to re-register. The next night, more than a thousand miles away in Minneapolis, in a small building across from a popular garden shop, roughly 60 people wait for David Clements to take the stage. Clements, professorial in a tan blazer with a graying beard and unruly curly hair, begins his presentation with a prayer. Then he goes to the slideshow. The audience, which appears to be all white and mostly middle-aged, occasionally gasps as he shows charts and graphs, which he claims contain evidence of widespread election fraud. Clements ends his talk with a request to the people in the audience: Go to the offices of your local officials. \"They respond to fear,\" he says. \"You need to hold these institutions with the contempt they deserve.\" An NPR investigation found that since Jan. 6, 2021, the election denial movement has moved from Donald Trump's tweets to hundreds of community events like these \u2014 in restaurants, car dealerships and churches \u2014 led by a core group of election conspiracy influencers like Keshel and Clements. Loading... These local gatherings may reach fewer people than viral internet posts, but they seem to effectively spur action by regular people, who are motivated by their almost evangelical intimacy. \"It's this constellation of election conspiracy theorists,\" said Chris Krebs, a former Department of Homeland Security official who oversaw the federal government's election security efforts in 2020. \"You can see the complexion of local politics shifting as a result. They have decentralized post-January 6th and are really trying to effect change at the lowest-possible level.\" NPR monitored the election-denial influencers through events advertised on their public social media accounts, the websites and social media accounts of local organizations, events NPR attended, video footage and news reports over the past 18 months. Four prominent purveyors of voting misinformation stood out, crisscrossing the country to appear at at least 308 events in 45 states and the District of Columbia. Loading... NPR tracked Keshel and Clements, as well as Douglas Frank, who misleadingly claims to have discovered a secret algorithm that swings vote totals across the U.S. (his methodology has been widely debunked by voting experts), and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell. The scale of their movements paints a portrait of an election denial movement that has evolved into a nationwide force, beyond just swing states \u2014 and despite the Jan. 6 Committee's investigation and efforts by voting officials at every level to combat disinformation. NPR's investigation is the first such effort to document the scope of these influencers. \"It's an existential threat to American democracy,\" said Franita Tolson, an elections expert at the University of Southern California. \"If the numbers get big enough, it's unclear whether we will survive it.\" Carly Koppes, who runs elections in Weld County, Colo., says she noticed a tone shift in her county after Douglas Frank came to town. She's reading over an email that just came in from one of her voters. \"Traitors will be exposed. These guys are going down and you have no chance...\" She trails off as she scans. \"You deserve everything coming your direction.\" The Republican county clerk takes a long sigh. Last summer, a group of suspicious citizens here knocked on thousands of doors looking to uncover evidence of election fraud. \"It started because of Dr. Frank and his really bad data analysis,\" Koppes said. \"Him and his people, unfortunately, just don't know how to read election records correctly.\" Douglas Frank, a former high school math and science teacher from Ohio, gives a presentation to about 100 people in the Missouri Capitol rotunda on his theories about election fraud, on Jan. 6, in Jefferson City, Mo. Frank, whose ideas have been debunked, claims to have discovered secret algorithms that were used to rig the 2020 election in favor of President Biden.\n                \n                    \n                    David Carson/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Douglas Frank, a former high school math and science teacher from Ohio, gives a presentation to about 100 people in the Missouri Capitol rotunda on his theories about election fraud, on Jan. 6, in Jefferson City, Mo. Frank, whose ideas have been debunked, claims to have discovered secret algorithms that were used to rig the 2020 election in favor of President Biden. In his former life, Frank was a high school math and science teacher in Ohio. He's moved now into touring the country spreading election fraud conspiracies full time. He, and the other three men whose movements NPR documented, either did not respond to requests for comment or declined to comment for this story. In the visit Koppes mentioned, on April 24, 2021, Frank held court in a DoubleTree hotel conference room near Denver. Dozens of people cheered as Frank pointed at graphs that he claimed showed how the 2020 election was marred by fraud (something that's been debunked many times by hand counts, audits and investigative reports across the country). \"Go knock on some doors!\" Frank implored. And many people in this Colorado community listened. A group popped up there, dedicated to this sort of fraud-motivated canvassing, and they devoted their organizing playbook to Frank. Jim Gilchrist, a doctor of holistic medicine in Colorado, saw an online posting of Frank's talk and volunteered to canvass with the group. He estimates he spent more than 20 hours last summer knocking on doors. \"I just kind of wished there was some mechanism for there to be a more transparent kind of way of making sure the vote was counted correctly,\" Gilchrist said in an interview with NPR. \"Douglas Frank kind of offered a solution that we could do as citizens.\" The election denialists also frequently bump elbows with people in power. NPR found that over the past year and a half, the men met or appeared with at least 78 elected officials at the federal, state and local levels \u2014 many of whom will have a role in how future elections are run and certified. At least two secretaries of state, two U.S. senators, 10 U.S. representatives, two state attorneys general and two lieutenant governors met or appeared with the figures NPR tracked. More than three dozen members of state legislatures, many of whom have introduced legislation in their states that would affect how Americans cast ballots, have also appeared at events with them. \"Our voices have gotten bigger and bigger every single day since last year and you cannot stop that,\" said Mike Lindell, at a rally in January of 2022 attended by three members of Arizona's congressional delegation, Debbie Lesko, Andy Biggs, and Paul Gosar, all of whom voted not to certify Arizona's election results at the U.S. Capitol a year earlier. \"We will get our country back.\" Mike Lindell, political activist and CEO of MyPillow, speaks during a rally hosted by former President Donald Trump at the Delaware County Fairgrounds on April 23 in Delaware, Ohio.\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mike Lindell, political activist and CEO of MyPillow, speaks during a rally hosted by former President Donald Trump at the Delaware County Fairgrounds on April 23 in Delaware, Ohio. In some cases, the election denial influencers worked to persuade skeptical officials to embrace their claims. In May 2021, Frank met with staff from the Ohio secretary of state's office for more than two hours. NPR acquired audio of the meeting, which was first reported by The Washington Post, through a public records request. The staffers in the meeting pushed back on Frank's many fraud accusations, and at one point he responded by threatening to send unauthorized people, or \"plants\" as he put it, into local voting offices. \"We have plants everywhere that go into buildings when your machines are on and capture your IP addresses. We have those, not necessarily in Ohio but we can arrange for that,\" Frank said, his voice rising. \"So all I'm trying to point out to you is that this is coming. Be ready. And I'm not trying to fight you \u2014 do you see that I'm trying to help you?\" The staffers in that meeting didn't budge. But shortly after that meeting, someone did attempt to breach an elections network in Lake County, Ohio, though a state official told NPR that no sensitive data was ultimately accessed. The four election denialists also appeared with well over 100 candidates for local, state and federal office in the 2022 primaries. Some, including U.S. Rep. Mary Miller of Illinois and state Sen. Doug Mastriano, who is running to be governor of Pennsylvania, have already won their party's nomination for the general election. The highest profile of the group that NPR tracked is MyPillow CEO Lindell, a prominent and longtime Trump supporter. Lindell says he has spent millions of dollars on his crusade, which started almost as soon as ballots were cast on Nov. 3, 2020. Sometime around March of 2021, he brought Frank into the fold and Frank's popularity skyrocketed. \"I went from being completely mum to suddenly 10 million people knowing me in about a week,\" he told a group in Utah last July. David Clements talks to audience members after speaking to the Surry County board of commissioners during a presentation by several individuals that aimed to cast doubt on election integrity, urging the commission to replace existing voting machines with purely paper ballots in Dobson, N.C., on May 16.\n                \n                    \n                    Jonathan Drake/Reuters\n                    \n                \nhide caption David Clements talks to audience members after speaking to the Surry County board of commissioners during a presentation by several individuals that aimed to cast doubt on election integrity, urging the commission to replace existing voting machines with purely paper ballots in Dobson, N.C., on May 16. Frank often speaks at events with Keshel and Clements. Clements is a lawyer and former professor at the New Mexico State University business school who was fired for not complying with the school's COVID-19 policies. Keshel is a retired Army captain and veteran of Afghanistan. While those in the group often repeat talking points and appear together, they don't necessarily coordinate appearances or strategy. And other than Lindell, they were mostly unknown before 2020. Now they're influencers in the movement with online followings of hundreds of thousands of people. They even promote merchandise like T-shirts, books and body lotions, along with their election misinformation. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, says they're using election fraud as a vehicle to advance themselves. \"There's no shortage of ability to access the truth about our election system, yet there seems to be a proliferation of people willing to lie about it,\" Benson said. \"I think it's logical to conclude that they know better. And that they're knowingly spreading misinformation ... to win elections, to raise money, to gain attention and celebrity.\" Benson says her office has seen a direct correlation between election denier events in Michigan and a rise in harassment toward voting officials. \"Whenever there is an appearance in which the former president or Lindell or others come out attacking our system we know to expect an uptick in threats and add additional security as a result,\" she said. But she, and the thousands of other Americans in charge of elections nationwide, have yet to figure out a truly effective way to fight back and break through to the two-thirds of Republican voters who believe voter fraud helped Joe Biden win the 2020 election. That's because election denialism has grown from a political movement into something almost religious, said Koppes, the Republican county clerk in Colorado.

And they keep just moving the goal posts. And moving the goal posts.\" Between conversations with voters and research on all the separate false claims that have popped up over the past two years, she estimates she's spent thousands of hours dealing with the fallout of Donald Trump's misinformation campaign. At this point, she says she's had to stop engaging with voters who are unwilling to listen to her. \"Some of these people really, truly believe they're doing the Lord's work,\" Koppes said. \"But I think at the end of the day, they so desperately want to believe what they're being fed, that they're using all means to justify what they're doing.\" Monika Evstatieva, Barbara Van Woerkom, Barrie Hardymon and Meg Anderson of NPR's Investigations team contributed reporting to this story.

            "article_content": "President Biden is urging voters to elect representatives who support abortion rights in November's election. But it's doubtful the issue will shift the balance of power in Congress.  SUSAN DAVIS, HOST: President Biden also expressed opposition to the Supreme Court ruling. He called it a product of an extreme ideology and tragic error by the court. He outlined a few steps the executive branch could take alone, like guaranteeing the ability to receive abortion medication through the mail, but said the real solution has to come with November's elections. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: We need to restore the protections of Roe as law of the land. We need to elect officials who will do that. This fall, Roe is on the ballot. DAVIS: NPR senior editor and correspondent Ron Elving joins us to talk about how all of this might play into the midterms. Hey, Ron. Good morning. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Sue. DAVIS: So what do you think the effect is going to be on the election? ELVING: Right now, with emotions and anger running high, we should think it would be an enormous factor. But the vote is months away, and for most voters, it may be just one factor among several. With gas prices, food prices, other economic concerns, we don't know which factors will seem most important four months from now. Also, there are relatively few swing states, swing districts, places where neither party has a distinct advantage. So there may be relatively few places where the abortion issue alone moves enough votes to determine the outcome. But there will be some. DAVIS: Former President Donald Trump was very quick to take credit for this decision. He said it could only happen because of the three judges he put on the court. He has a point there. ELVING: It's hard to deny. The three justices Trump appointed made the difference here, and they are more than likely to do so again on other issues. President Biden made that very clear in his remarks yesterday. And Hillary Clinton, if she had been president, would have chosen three very different people for the vacancies that Trump got to fill. So that was a fundamental part of his appeal to social conservatives, especially religious conservatives, in both 2016 and 2020. And it would be again in 2024 if he were to run. DAVIS: Yeah. In another major Supreme Court decision this week, a New York state gun law was struck down. This all is happening at the same time Congress just passed the first gun legislation in a generation. President Biden signed that bill into law this morning. The country seems to be sending mixed signals here. ELVING: Yeah, mixed signals, indeed. Conservatives on the courts are saying that they can decide such issues as the right to bear arms - expanding those rights, as you've described - nationwide. Meanwhile, Congress is trying to do something to reduce gun violence. New York's gun law that was struck down here had restricted who and why people could carry guns. It had ramifications for other blue states with similar restrictions, and those would seem harder to enforce now, even in states with long histories of such restrictions. We have to say the congressional bipartisan gun deal was rather modest, the minimum they could do after the most recent gun massacres in Buffalo, N.Y., Uvalde, Texas, targeting grocery shoppers and schoolchildren. What we are calling the gun deal here is as much about funding mental health and school safety, but it does provide more time for background checks for people under 21 buying semi-automatic rifles and other long guns. And perhaps most important, it established that the federal government can and still thinks it will have a role to play on guns. DAVIS: Ron, you see a conflict here in the court delivering decisions on two very controversial issues, guns and abortion, that seem to go against the will of the American people. ELVING: That's right. And you could have argued back in 1973 when the Roe decision came down that the court was out of step with public opinion then. That point can be argued back and forth. There are certainly those people who feel that the court should completely lock out public opinion when it makes its decision and look only at the Constitution and the legislation in question. But it's been observed for a very long period of time that the Supreme Court also follows the election returns. DAVIS: Also this week, the House January 6 committee wrapped up its first round of live hearings this month. What's your assessment of how this has played so far? ELVING: They've made an impression - maybe stronger and deeper than expected, but hard to say whether permanent enough to affect the elections in November, let alone elections in 2024. The hearings themselves, though, have been impressive, Sue - well-presented and quite dramatic at times, relying primarily on the testimony of Republicans, people who refused to go along with Trump's effort to overturn the certified and genuine results. And many Republicans now regret that their leaders in Congress elected not to have their own voices on the panel, especially because the two Republicans who are on the panel, because Speaker Pelosi chose them, Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, have been highly effective, and also because the hearings are getting through to the public without much representation for the Republicans who oppose them. DAVIS: NPR's Ron Elving - Ron, I always love talking to you. Thank you. ELVING: Thank you, Sue. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "In a joint statement released, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid say they've agreed to hold a vote next week to dissolve parliament and hold early elections.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Israeli voters are heading to the polls again. In a joint statement released today, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid say they have agreed to hold a vote next week to dissolve parliament and hold early elections, quote, \"after exhausting the efforts to stabilize the coalition.\" NPR's Daniel Estrin is in Tel Aviv. Hi, Daniel. DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: You must be having a sense of deja vu right now. You have reported on many elections in Israel. What happened this time? ESTRIN: That's right. I mean, this was the most diverse Israeli governing coalition in history. It lasted just about a year, and it just could not hold together. This was a very unlikely partnership of right-wing religious Jewish nationalists. There were left-wing lawmakers, pro-Palestinian lawmakers. There was a secular party headed by a gay politician and a conservative Muslim party that ran on an anti-LGBTQ platform. So they stuck together because they didn't want Benjamin Netanyahu to stay in office, but they didn't really agree on much else. And in recent months, some of Naftali Bennett's right-wing allies withdrew their support for this coalition. The final straw was actually about one of Israel's most controversial topics - settlers in the occupied West Bank. There were not enough votes to renew some legal protections for settlers, rights that Palestinians don't have. These legal rights have to be renewed every few years, and they expire in just ten days. And so on TV today, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRIME MINISTER NAFTALI BENNETT: (Non-English language spoken). ESTRIN: He said if these rights aren't renewed for settlers, Israel will endure heavy security damage and chaos that he could not allow. So he's stepping down. Parliament dissolves, and these settler protections will be frozen in place. SHAPIRO: As you know, this is the fifth Israeli election in just over three years. I'm thinking of that quote about doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. What does this say about Israeli politics right now? ESTRIN: I mean, I think that's very apt. It resurrects Israel's political crisis. The country is polarized. And Benjamin Netanyahu plays a huge role here. He has a strong base, but he faces corruption charges. And we saw again and again in elections he doesn't have enough support to form a government, but neither does the opposition. The big question is, can Netanyahu return to power? He's going to try. He has framed the failure of this government on its partnership with an Arab party. He calls it terror supporters, which is a slur. And so I think a major question in these elections are going to be, will Arab-Jewish political partnership and even more equality for Arab citizens be possible in the future? SHAPIRO: And meanwhile, President Biden is scheduled to visit next month. Is that going to go forward, and can anything be accomplished under these circumstances? ESTRIN: The U.S. embassy says their working assumption is that the trip is still going forward. Israel does have some hopes for this trip. They hope that Israel and the U.S. can build an alliance with Arab countries to confront Iran. But you know what? If President Biden does come to Israel as planned, he'll just be meeting a different prime minister, the future prime minister, Yair Lapid. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Daniel Estrin in Tel Aviv reporting on another Israeli election. Thank you, Daniel. ESTRIN: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The Biden administration is taking steps that could change how the U.S. census and federal surveys produce racial and ethnic data that is used for redrawing voting districts, enforcing civil rights protections, policymaking and research. The multiyear process is likely to carry out long-awaited data policy changes that will particularly affect how Latinos and people of Middle Eastern or North African descent are counted in statistics around the country. In a blog post released Wednesday, Karin Orvis, U.S. chief statistician within the White House Office of Management and Budget, said the federal agency is starting a new formal review of the government's standards for statistics about race and ethnicity to help ensure they \"better reflect the diversity of the American people.\" The goal, Orvis added, is \"completing the revision no later than Summer 2024,\" which would be months ahead of the next presidential election and in time for any changes to be incorporated into 2030 census plans. \"I understand the importance of moving quickly and with purpose. It is also important that we get this right,\" Orvis said in the post, noting that the process will include gathering input from federal agencies and members of the public. A little-known part of the federal government, OMB is in charge of determining how the Census Bureau and all other agencies can ask about a person's racial and ethnic identities, as well as defining the checkboxes found on surveys. First set in 1977, OMB's standards for racial and ethnic data were last revised in 1997 and have influenced how surveys across the U.S. generate demographic statistics. A major overhaul was expected ahead of the 2020 census. But those efforts stalled during former President Donald Trump's administration despite years of research by the bureau suggesting that certain changes to the standards could improve the accuracy of statistics about Latinos and people with origins in the Middle East or North Africa. Other proposals included no longer officially allowing the term \"Negro\" to be used to describe the \"Black\" category on federal surveys and taking out \"Far East\" from the standards as a description of a geographic region of origin for people of Asian descent. Orvis noted that the new review will make use of past research, as well as the work of an earlier working group of career civil servants who were reviewing proposals to allow forms to ask about a person's Hispanic origins and race in a combined question and to include a checkbox for \"Middle Eastern or North African.\" Many Democrats in Congress have been calling for OMB to add a separate category for people of Middle Eastern or North African descent, whom the current standards classify as \"White.\" \"Federal demographic data does not reflect the realities of MENA individuals and community-based organizations, which makes it increasingly difficult for advocates, researchers, agency officials, and policymakers to communicate, understand, and address community needs,\" wrote a group of Democratic members of the House Oversight and Reform Committee led by Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York, the committee's chair, and Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan in a letter this week to the head of OMB. The Biden administration has previously signaled that adding such a category would be a priority. Movement at OMB, however, has been slowed by the delayed confirmation of a new agency director and the hiring of a new chief statistician. Asked by NPR why OMB decided to start a new review of its standards on racial and ethnic data instead of continuing its earlier review, OMB's press office did not answer directly and referred instead to Orvis' blog post.",

            "article_content": "Former Gov. Paul LePage is in a close race with Maine's sitting governor, Democrat Janet Mills. Maine's GOP is uniting around the fall of Roe and has a motivated base.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Access to abortion is protected in the state of Maine even if the U.S. Supreme Court strikes down Roe v. Wade. But Republicans, including former GOP Governor Paul LePage, are running strong campaigns trying to reclaim control of state government - an outcome that could put Maine's abortion protections at risk. The question is whether Democrats and abortion rights advocates can match Republican enthusiasm this November. Steve Mistler from Maine Public Radio reports. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Chanting) Can't go back. Can't go back. STEVE MISTLER, BYLINE: Demonstrations about the seemingly imminent demise of Roe v. Wade have intensified here ever since a draft of the court's opinion was publicized. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Chanting) My decision. My choice. My decision. My choice. MISTLER: At a recent protest in Portland, Maine, resident Heather Jamieson worried the next generation might not have access to a procedure that has been legal for nearly 50 years. HEATHER JAMIESON: I am worried for my daughters. I'm worried for their friends. I'm worried for my grandchildren. Banning abortion does not stop abortion, it only creates unsafe abortions. MISTLER: And abortion rights supporters have good cause for concern, says Nicole Clegg of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England. NICOLE CLEGG: People are going to be harmed by what can potentially be happening here. MISTLER: Even though Maine has a 28-year-old law signed by a Republican governor that protects access to abortions no matter what the Supreme Court decides, Clegg warned that it, too, could be overturned if an anti-abortion governor and legislature ascends to power in November. CLEGG: They're laws. They are subject to repeal. Elections matter. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JANET MILLS: I pledge to the people of Maine, so long as I'm governor, access to abortion care will be safe and legal in Maine, just as it is now. We will not go backwards. MISTLER: Governor Janet Mills has positioned herself as a champion of abortion rights, like many Democratic legislative candidates facing elections this year. It might boost her reelection chances made uncertain by significant headwinds, including President Biden's low approval rating, voter concerns over inflation and an enthusiasm gap with a motivated Republican base. Maine Republicans are also hoping the return of former Governor Paul LePage, a conservative firebrand often described as a Donald Trump prototype, will energize support for its entire ticket of candidates. Here's LePage at the state convention last month. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PAUL LEPAGE: The choice in November is very clear. I stand for faith, freedom and trusting the Maine people. MISTLER: LePage's campaign declined a request for an interview, but he recently released a statement reaffirming his, quote, \"proven history of supporting life,\" end quote. It also left the door open to changing Maine's abortion laws without specifically saying how. MIKE MCCLELLAN: I think I can safely say we have obviously seen him as an ally on life and issues like that. MISTLER: Mike McClellan is a former Republican legislator who now works for the Christian Civic League of Maine, a group that is staunchly anti-abortion and influential in the Republican Party here. MCCLELLAN: Our look is to the day that there's just no abortions at all in Maine and that they're not needed. MISTLER: Maine is one of the most secular states in the country, but the religious right here punches above its weight in numbers with pew-to-polls activism and turnout. McClellan says anti-abortion candidates are winning elections, and as a result, Republican legislators are more unified in restricting abortion access than they were just a few years ago. And he anticipates a wide slate of anti-abortion bills if the GOP wins control of state government. MCCLELLAN: All the polls suggest that even people that support abortion want limits to it. MISTLER: So far, Republican candidates here seem poised to rely on voters' complex abortion views and their own vague plans in a post-Roe world to ride out the backlash. Meanwhile, Democrats like Governor Mills are framing access to the procedure as fundamental to a woman's right to self-determination. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MILLS: This draft opinion declares that there's basically no right of privacy in the U.S. Constitution. That's extraordinary and extreme. It's an extremist view, and it shouldn't be tolerated, and I won't tolerate it at the state level. MISTLER: Whether those concerns resonate with voters and help Mills win reelection this year is unclear. A recent poll taken before the release of the draft opinion showed her in a statistical dead heat with LePage. For NPR News, I'm Steve Mistler in Augusta, Maine.

The draft opinion from the Supreme Court obtained by Politico that shows the conservative majority ready to overturn Roe v. Wade, which made abortion legal in this country almost 50 years ago, is going to have wide-ranging political consequences. While it's a draft opinion and justices can change their votes before a final decision, this draft ruling has the potential to be an earthquake in this election year. In a statement, Chief Justice John Roberts confirmed the authenticity of the draft opinion and said the leak would be investigated. \"To the extent this betrayal of the confidences of the Court was intended to undermine the integrity of our operations, it will not succeed,\" Roberts said. \"The work of the Court will not be affected in any way.\" On the left, there are likely going to be mass demonstrations from women \u2014 and men \u2014 in favor of abortion rights \u2014 and the draft opinion could fire them up to vote in a midterm year in which Democrats are facing enormous political headwinds. \"I believe that a woman's right to choose is fundamental,\" President Biden said in a statement. \"Roe has been the law of the land for almost fifty years, and basic fairness and the stability of our law demand that it not be overturned.\" But what to do about it is another question. The draft opinion is going to raise the pressure on Democratic congressional leaders to get rid of the filibuster and pass legislation that codifies abortion rights in this country. Cases in point: Congress must pass legislation that codifies Roe v. Wade as the law of the land in this country NOW. And if there aren\u2019t 60 votes in the Senate to do it, and there are not, we must end the filibuster to pass it with 50 votes. It is a fundamental right for a woman to make her own health decisions. We must protect the right to choose and codify Roe v Wade into law. Similarly, on the campaign trail, Democratic Senate candidates in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2014 Democrats' top two pick up opportunities this year \u2014 for example, are calling for that. \"Democrats have to act quickly and get rid of the filibuster to pass the Women's Health Protection Act + finally codify Roe into law,\" Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman said. \"We cannot afford to wait.\" \"It has never been more clear why we need to abolish the filibuster and take immediate action to protect every person's right to make decisions about their own bodies,\" Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement Monday night that conservative justices have \"lied\" to the American people because during their confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court, justices repeatedly said Roe is \"precedent\" and the \"law of the land.\" Schumer said Tuesday that the Senate would vote \u2013 again \u2013 on making the right to an abortion law through congressional action. But that vote would largely only be symbolic. Democrats do not have 60 votes to overcome a Republican filibuster. And a similar vote already failed earlier this year, with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia joining Republicans in voting against it. That included pro-abortion-rights Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. They said the Democratic legislation went \"too far.\" \"I have long supported a woman's right to choose, but my position is not without limits, and this partisan Women's Health Protection Act simply goes too far,\" Murkowski said in March. \"It would broadly supersede state laws and infringe on Americans' religious freedoms.\" Murkowski and Collins instead introduced their own scaled-back legislation. That Democrats don't have the votes for it is likely one reason Schumer did not explicitly endorse or outline a strategy to overturn the filibuster. Biden also notably stopped short of endorsing the elimination of the filibuster in his statement Tuesday morning. \"At the federal level,\" Biden said, \"we will need more pro-choice Senators and a pro-choice majority in the House to adopt legislation that codifies Roe, which I will work to pass and sign into law.\" But with Republicans favored to take back the House and possibly the Senate this fall because of concerns over inflation, the clock is ticking. Collins voted for Trump-appointed Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. In her reason for voting for Kavanaugh, she explicitly said it was because of the way he described Roe and the 1992 affirmation of the decision, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, as \"precedent\" and \"precedent on precedent.\" Supreme Court Judge Neil Gorsuch \u2014 then a nominee \u2014 meets with Sen. Susan Collins in her Capitol Hill office on Feb. 9, 2017.\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supreme Court Judge Neil Gorsuch \u2014 then a nominee \u2014 meets with Sen. Susan Collins in her Capitol Hill office on Feb. 9, 2017. \"When I asked him, would it be sufficient to overturn a long-established precedent if five current justices believed that it was wrongly decided,\" Collins said in her Senate floor speech at the time announcing her vote, \"he emphatically said, 'No.' \" During his confirmation hearings in 2017, Gorsuch called Roe the \"law of the land,\" said he accepts that and noted that a \"fetus is not a person.\" On Tuesday, Collins said: \"If this leaked draft opinion is the final decision and this reporting is accurate, it would be completely inconsistent with what Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh said in their hearings and in our meetings in my office.\" The playbook at those hearings has been to be vague and not be forthright. But this draft opinion now threatens to end any good-faith in those lengthy Supreme Court confirmation hearings \u2013 and the things nominees for these lifetime appointments say in them. Gallup found in September that the court's approval had hit a new low \u2013 40% \u2013 since it began tracking that figure in 2000. The draft opinion, and the leak itself, will only further make people believe the court is political. The justices, people may now believe, don't tell the truth when they are sworn in before Congress and the people at the court can't trust or be trusted. Initial votes can shift, and make no mistake: this leak was likely designed to gain the kind of wildfire-like attention it's getting and encourage mass protests in the hopes that votes can be swayed. Ironically, this decades-long shift has taken place under Roberts, who is acutely aware of the politics of the court and wanting to keep it out of the political line of fire. Republicans have used culture war issues to fire up their base, and no issue is more central to that than abortion. But it's worth pointing out that the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll showed Democrats with an 11-point advantage on the question of which party Americans think is better at dealing with abortion as an issue. An ABC News/Washington Post poll out last week had similar numbers, so the NPR poll is not an outlier. The overwhelming majority of Americans believe abortion should remain legal in some form, according to survey after survey in this country \u2013 despite abortion being a tinder-box issue that people have very strong feelings about. In fact, a 2019 NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found three-quarters of respondents said abortion should remain legal in some form. Just 13% said Roe should be overturned. (Gallup similarly found that only about 1-in-5 believe it should be illegal in all circumstances.) Public opinion becomes more divided when looking at the circumstances of an abortion or how many weeks or months when one would take place, but a Supreme Court opinion outright overturning Roe would be woefully out of step with the American public.",

As the political calendar inches towards the midterm elections in November, a run of recent polling all points to one thing: President Biden has a problem with young voters. The new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found support for the president had plummeted 16 points among Gen Z and millennials in the past year, to sit at 37% \u2014 the lowest of any age group in the U.S. Harvard's Institute of Politics also found approval ratings with Gen Z were down 18 points in the past year, to 41%, and Gallup found a 21-point drop to 39%. Climate change, racial justice, and student debt are some of the key issues for young people, said Cristina Tzintzun Ramirez, president and executive director of NextGen America, one of the biggest youth vote-mobilizing organizations in the country. \"When you combine millennials and Gen Z, they are the largest voting bloc in American history \u2014 65 million young people that are eligible to vote in that younger demographic,\" she said. While Democratic pollsters are sounding the alarm, many young voters say it's no surprise to them. Biden performed well with young voters in 2020, capturing 61% of voters aged 18-29, according to AP VoteCast. James Kweisi Butler, 24, is a model and content creator from Los Angeles who voted for Biden at the last election. He describes himself as black and queer and says that his identity informs his political opinions, which lean liberal. His frank assessment of the polls is that Biden was seen as a safe option in 2020 and since his election he hasn't done a good enough job of meeting his commitments. Tzintzun Ramirez says cancelling student debt could help Democrats, since young voters today are the first generation in American history to be economically worse off than their parents.\n                \n                    \n                    Paul Morigi/Getty Images for We The 45 Milli\n                    \n                \nhide caption Tzintzun Ramirez says cancelling student debt could help Democrats, since young voters today are the first generation in American history to be economically worse off than their parents. \"I'm not surprised at all, because we weren't very excited. I feel like that was our safety net,\" Butler said. \"We gave him our vote, we got so many promises, one being the student loans, which is hugely impacting our generation right now. And that big promise has still been unfulfilled.\" Without a candidate like Donald Trump to rally against, Butler said he wouldn't be surprised if more Gen Z voters sat out the midterms and the next presidential election, or chose to support third-party candidates. \"I completely understand why people are feeling that [they shouldn't vote]. And at times, I still feel that way.\" Butler said. \"They might make a bigger statement than continuing to put our time and energy and vote into the system that we're realizing is just messed up and continuing not to listen; really listen to us and what we're saying that we need.\" That lack of faith in the system crosses the political divide among younger voters, says Eddy Thurber \u2014 another Gen Z voter who describes his political views as \"nuanced\", though generally leaning conservative. Thurber is a political science student at Cal State Fresno in California, and in his view, Biden's problem with young people isn't just about his track record, it's also about what he represents. \"He's been in office for his whole life. And I think he has this in common with most of the older generation of politicians, is that young people can't relate to him at all,\" Thurber said. \"Joe Biden's entire career is about being a voice that can make things happen. He's the, I suppose, the ultimate 'good old boy'. He can make things happen because he knows everybody,\" he said. \"We don't have anybody that can speak for us. We don't have any 'good young boys' that have the connections to make things happen for us.\" For Democratic strategist Dan Sena, the problem isn't policy, it's communication. Sena helped Democrats take the House in 2018, and his assessment is that they have done a lot to appeal to younger voters, pointing specifically to their track record in fighting climate change and addressing equity and inclusion. In his view, Democrats should focus on messaging and communication if they want to bring more young voters into the fold. Biden performed well with Gen Z voters in 2020. However, current polling numbers show the president's approval rating with young people at all time lows.\n                \n                    \n                    JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Biden performed well with Gen Z voters in 2020. However, current polling numbers show the president's approval rating with young people at all time lows. \"I think the challenge that most Democrats now have is really connecting with Gen Z voters on their own record,\" he said. \"I think there's a lot that Democrats have to sell to Gen Z, we just have to take the time and the tactics and the campaigns to do it.\" Sena describes Gen Z as \"pragmatic voters\" who, on the whole, actually align with the Democratic platform. But he says they are more difficult to convince than the older generation. \"There's always a little bit of a 'show me what you have done for me lately and show me the facts' piece to it. And I think Gen Z'ers require a higher level of proving the point than I think other generations have had,\" he said. The ability of Democrats \u2014 and President Biden \u2014 to do just that will be put to the test in November.",

Three-term Prime Minister Viktor Orban is facing a conservative candidate.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: On Sunday, voters in Hungary will go to the polls in what's being called the most important election there in a generation. For the past 12 years, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has steadily chipped away at his country's democratic institutions. This time, the opposition has unified around a religious conservative candidate in the hopes of finally defeating Orban. NPR's Rob Schmitz reports. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Singing in non-English language). ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE: It's an afternoon mass at Budapest's Mother Church of Our Lady of the Assumption, just days before Sunday's election, and Father Zoltan Osztie holds out his arms and asks his congregation to pray for a good outcome. ZOLTAN OSZTIE: (Non-English language spoken). SCHMITZ: \"We cannot elect a representative who is unworthy of us,\" he says, \"only someone who protects the hierarchy of God, homeland and family.\" This is a Catholic church, and it's not clear whether he's talking about three-term prime minister Viktor Orban - who used to be an atheist, but converted to Christianity after he became a politician - or opposition candidate Peter Marki-Zay, a lifelong Catholic who has joined with left-wing parties to try and defeat Orban. But then, Father Osztie makes it clear. OSZTIE: (Non-English language spoken). SCHMITZ: \"The candidate who has formed an alliance with the devil just to topple the current government is not,\" he says, \"a true Christian.\" (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Singing in non-English language). SCHMITZ: In his 12 years leading Hungary, Viktor Orban has not only gained the support of conservative Christians through his campaign against the LGBTQ community, he's also managed to consolidate the public forum that debates these issues by ensuring that nearly all media in the country is under his party's influence. Despite this, polls suggest Orban and his party are facing the biggest threat to their grip on power, and the face of that threat is Peter Marki-Zay. Speaking in Berlin last month, he called beating Orban mission impossible, but that he remains hopeful. PETER MARKI-ZAY: It is a miracle in itself. It's a sign of the resilience of the Hungarian people that, after 12 years of brainwashing, there are still about 50% of the people in Hungary who want a regime change. It's a fantastic starting point already. SCHMITZ: For the first time, a coalition of Hungary's six major opposition parties from the left and right have united behind this mayor of a small city in southeastern Hungary, hopeful his conservative credentials are enough to oust Orban. Something else giving them hope is that Orban's troubling foreign policy is now in the spotlight since Russia invaded Ukraine. For years, Orban has built ties with autocrats, like Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, while rejecting liberal democratic principles of the West. Analyst Gabor Gyori says Sunday's election is also a test of Orban's worldview. GABOR GYORI: The kind of Western liberal model is failing - with its multiculturalism, with its openness - and that the nationalist and the culturally conservative societies in the East are much more coherent. They are much more united, and they are more focused on the issues that matter for the future. They're better at managing their economies, their societies. They are better at suppressing the kind of dissent that disintegrates society. SCHMITZ: But Orban's view that Hungary needs to follow what he believes is a political and cultural model that's winning doesn't ring true for many young Hungarians, like Anna Ats, who works as a translator in Budapest. ANNA ATS: I don't like the attitude. I don't like the program. I don't like how they handle social issues. The politics is not really inclusive, which would be very important for me. I'd like to see something more Western. SCHMITZ: Ats says she's also sick of the corruption. There are allegations that Orban's friends have benefited from big government contracts for construction projects like soccer stadiums and railways. (SOUNDBITE OF CHURCH BELL RINGING) SCHMITZ: But churchgoer Gabor Lenkei (ph) says these accusations amount to what he calls fake news. GABOR LENKEI: (Through translator) If Orban's stealing so much, why is there construction all over Budapest - all these churches, museums, sports stadiums? He's also handing out family subsidies. If his party manages to do all that and steal some on the side, let them steal it. SCHMITZ: Lenkei, Ats, and millions of other Hungarian voters will weigh in on all of this on Sunday.

Access to abortion is about to become even less available in the state as a six-week ban became law.\n                \n                    \n                    Idaho Statesman/TNS\n                    \n                \nhide caption A procedure room at Planned Parenthood in Meridian, Idaho, one of the few clinics in the state to offer abortions. Access to abortion is about to become even less available in the state as a six-week ban became law. A patient who gets an abortion \u2013 or the person who impregnated her and specific members of their family \u2013 could sue abortion providers in Idaho for tens of thousands of dollars in damages, under a new law signed by Gov. Brad Little on Wednesday. The law, which bans most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, is modeled after a similar Texas law, SB 8, which allows anyone to bring lawsuits against health care providers, or anyone else, accused of helping provide such abortions. \"Unfortunately we don't even have to guess about what this will look like, because we've been watching what's been happening in Texas, so we already know what this looks like,\" says Mistie Delli Carpini-Tolman, Idaho State Director for Planned Parenthood. Delli Carpini-Tolman notes that in the month after the Texas law took effect in September, the number of abortions reported in Texas fell by 60%, prompting many patients to travel out of state. The Idaho legislation, known as SB 1309, narrows the field of potential plaintiffs to biological relatives, defined as a \"female upon whom an abortion has been attempted or performed, the father of the preborn child, a grandparent of the preborn child, a sibling of the preborn child, or an aunt or uncle of the preborn child.\" Penalties for abortion providers start at $20,000 per violation. Shaakirrah Sanders, a law professor at the University of Idaho, says that provision could provoke lawsuits that would quickly make it impossible for healthcare providers to continue offering the procedure. \"If there are 10 siblings and parents, all of those people can sue you, and they can all get $20,000,\" Sanders says. \"You can see how one lawsuit could pretty much wipe out an entire clinic.\" Unlike the Texas law, Idaho's ban allows abortions for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest \u2014 if the assault is reported to law enforcement. According to the anti-sexual violence group known as RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network), more than two-thirds of victims do not report their assaults for a variety of reasons, including fear of retaliation or a belief that police would not help them if they did. SB 1309 specifies that anyone who causes a pregnancy by committing rape or incest is not eligible to sue, though it's silent on how that person's guilt would be proven. And it includes no such exclusion for a rapist's family members. In a letter to Idaho's Senate President about the law, Gov. Little expressed some reservations about the use of lawsuits for enforcement. Little expressed support for the abortion ban itself but said, \"I fear the novel civil enforcement mechanism will in short order be proven both unconstitutional and unwise.\" He raised concerns that the same technique could be applied to other issues, such as religious freedom or gun rights, adding that, \"none of the rights we treasure are off limits.\" Little also expressed \"significant concerns\" about the potential impact on rape and incest victims, noting that many victims may lack the ability or support needed to report their assaults, and asked the state legislature to take unspecified steps to address those concerns. Asked about those provisions, Carol Tobias, President of the National Right to Life Committee, says she believes such a policy would help to deter abortions.\"I think we need to do everything possible to save lives,\" she says. \"And we would encourage anybody to take steps necessary to protect that life.\"Tobias says she believes abortion is always wrong, and that rape victims should carry their pregnancies to term.  Her group has been promoting similar state legislation around the country. The unique enforcement mechanism first tried by Texas, which relies on ordinary citizens filing lawsuits, has succeeded where similar efforts to ban abortion have failed. Several states have passed laws in recent years banning the procedure in the first two months of pregnancy, only to see them blocked by courts. SB 8's novel legal strategy so far has sustained a series of state and federal court challenges, and the U.S. Supreme Court has refused to strike it down. Taking cues from that success, Republicans in several states have proposed similar legislation; Idaho is the first to pass it. During legislative debate this week, Republican state Rep. Steven Harris, who co-sponsored the bill in the Idaho House, praised the Texas law for stopping abortions \"in their tracks. In the ensuing months, babies have been saved.\" The move comes as state legislatures around the country are gearing up for a Supreme Court decision expected this summer that could overturn, or dramatically erode, Roe v. Wade and other precedents guaranteeing abortion rights. At the center of that case is a Mississippi law banning most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Meanwhile, similar proposals are advancing in states including Tennessee and Oklahoma. Missouri lawmakers are considering legislation that would use a similar enforcement mechanism to try to prevent residents from leaving the state for an abortion. Florida recently passed a 15-week ban, sending it to the desk of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. Providers in neighboring states report that the onslaught of patients traveling from Texas has put pressure on their clinics, making it more difficult for local patients to get appointments. \"I think that with these laws going into effect, we're going to start to see ripple effects,\" says Jessica Arons, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. \"You're going to see more and more patients displaced and having to travel even further to obtain care.\" Barring a successful legal challenge, the Idaho law is set to take effect in 30 days. Reproductive rights groups say they're weighing their next steps.",

            "article_content": "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis wants lawmakers to redraw two Congressional voting districts with majority Black populations. Observers say he is apparently courting a national audience.  ELISSA NADWORNY, HOST: States around the country are drawing up new boundaries for congressional districts to reflect the 2020 census results. In Florida, Republican Governor Ron DeSantis is threatening to veto the maps that have been approved by the legislature. He wants to reconfigure two districts so that Black candidates would not be likely to win those seats. NPR's Greg Allen reports. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Ron DeSantis has emerged as a national leader in the Republican Party by taking outspoken positions on controversial topics. Now he's setting his sights on overturning laws that protect the voting rights of African Americans. Florida's Legislature recently drew up maps maintaining protected African American voting districts approved after the 2010 census. In recent years, the Supreme Court has weakened the Federal Voting Rights Act, and DeSantis believes discrimination to stop Black voters in the past is no longer a problem. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RON DESANTIS: You would have parts of the country where the African American turnout was, like, 8%. I mean, obviously, they were not being allowed to vote. Now you have turnout rates that are much higher across the board. So I think it'd be very, very difficult to show that. ALLEN: Civil rights lawyer Cecile Scoon says racial discrimination at the polls is not a thing of the past. Scoon, African American and president of the League of Women Voters in Florida, says for evidence, just look at laws recently passed in Florida and other states. CECILE SCOON: They are making voting more difficult for individuals with what we consider to be voter suppression laws - unnecessary ID requirements, limiting drop box uses - really what it is is trying to shut the voice of the people. ALLEN: In Florida, the responsibility of drawing up new congressional maps is left to lawmakers. DeSantis does, however, have a veto, and he said repeatedly that he plans to use it on the maps approved by the Republican-controlled legislature. Michael McDonald, a redistricting expert and professor at the University of Florida, believes DeSantis is being motivated in part by 2024 presidential ambitions. MICHAEL MCDONALD: DeSantis doesn't want to look to be the politician, the governor that gave control of the House of Representatives to the Democrats. ALLEN: Following the census, Florida is gaining one House seat for a total of 28. Under DeSantis's map, Republicans would likely gain three seats over what they have now. Florida is not alone in wanting to challenge protected districts for African Americans. Alabama and Georgia have also produced congressional district maps that have been met by lawsuits. The Supreme Court has said the contested maps in these states will be used in the upcoming election because changing them now would cause, quote, \"chaos and confusion.\" That means the congressional map proposed by DeSantis would represent a significant win for the GOP if he can convince Republican lawmakers to sign on. So far, that hasn't happened. During the legislative session, Republican leaders resisted pressure from the governor to adopt his maps, and they've adjourned. Ellen Freidin is with a nonpartisan voting rights group FairDistricts. It's filed a lawsuit asking the courts to step in because, Freidin says, the legislature and governor have shown they're unable to agree on new maps. ELLEN FREIDIN: At this point, there is no reason to think that there isn't going to be an impasse. ALLEN: Florida voters actually decided about a decade ago to ban political gerrymandering and to make sure that minority voting districts are protected in the state. DeSantis says he believes those measures violate the federal constitution, and he wants the courts to strike them down. Ultimately, it's a battle over political power in a state that's almost evenly divided between Republican and Democratic voters. Despite that, Republicans control the legislature and nearly all statewide offices, and Freidin says DeSantis wants to keep it that way. FREIDIN: He's calling it wanting to do away with racial preferences, but what it really is is he wants to be able to gerrymander these maps. ALLEN: So far, Republican leaders in Florida's Legislature aren't indicating they're willing to go along with the governor and produce maps that will tie them up in expensive, time-consuming lawsuits. If DeSantis vetoes their maps, the Republican leaders will have some choices to make - go along with the governor, override his veto or do nothing and let the courts decide.

Iowa \u2014 for some reason, you have to go there if you want to be president. For generations, the state's caucuses have been the first proving ground for presidential aspirants. But, at least for Democrats, Iowa's time in the sun may be over after the debacle the state party produced in 2020. Last week, the Democratic National Committee began to consider ways to reorder its primary contests in order to better reflect the racial makeup of its voters. Iowa and New Hampshire, where the nation's second nominating contest is held, are both more than 90% white. Democratic voters are about 40% non-white. \"Our party is best when we reflect the people we are trying to serve, and it's just as plain as that,\" Jaime Harrison, chair of the Democratic National Committee, said at a meeting last Friday. No formal process has been adopted for states to petition for an early spot on a new calendar, but the most eager have already pitched their hat in the ring anyway. This week, the chair of the New Jersey State Democratic Party, LeRoy J. Jones, Jr., sent a letter to the Democratic National Committee asking to be among the nation's first primary contests. \"New Jersey is as diverse as any state in the nation, with a population that is 15% Black, 10% Asian American, and 21% Latino,\" Jones wrote. \"This striking level of diversity makes New Jersey truly representative of the Democratic Party and the current and future American electorate.\" Practicality was also central to New Jersey's pitch. Candidates spend inordinate amounts of time campaigning in the early states \u2014 then-candidate Kamala Harris memorably remarked to a Senate colleague \"I'm ****ing moving to Iowa\" \u2014 and Jones is hopeful that the party could take ease of campaigning into consideration. \"Our state is noteworthy for its compact size as the fourth-smallest state in the nation, which would save candidates valuable travel time and resources and encourage the kind of retail campaigning that has always been a hallmark of the Democratic presidential primary process,\" he wrote in the letter. Whatever the Democratic National Committee decides is likely to have a big impact on the narratives that form around the presidential candidates. The results of 2020's Iowa caucuses were famously muddled, but then-candidate Joe Biden came in a distant fourth behind candidates who were considerably more popular with white voters. \"I\u2019m not gonna sugarcoat it,\u201d Joe Biden said at an event in New Hampshire. \u201cWe took a gut punch in Iowa. The whole process took a gut punch. But look, this isn\u2019t the first time in my life I\u2019ve been knocked down.\u201d https://t.co/6dr7RYsohp Biden finished fifth in New Hampshire three days later. For three weeks, he faced questions about whether he would end his campaign. And then came the endorsement of Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, one of the most prominent Black politicians in the country, and a resounding victory in that state's primary \u2014 Biden beat the second-place finisher by nearly 30 points in the 2020 primary with a sizable portion of Black voters. \"When this campaign was at its lowest end, the African American community stood up again for me,\" Biden said in his victory speech nine months later. \"You always had my back, and I'll have yours.\" Despite not having an earlier say, Black voters in South Carolina still set the course for the 2020 Democratic nominating process, amplifying the doubts inside the party about its primary calendar.",

            "article_content": "NPR's Ari Shapiro talks with Elizabeth Bruenig from The Atlantic about the political benefits of arguing over book bans in schools.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Vida Rahman knows what it's like to be concerned about what our kids are reading at school. VIDA RAHMAN: He was in middle school, so it was a book that they were going to have - you know, I think they had, like, five books... CHANG: This was a few years back. Her oldest son is now in high school, but, at the time, she was worried because the book he was reading as a sixth-grader dealt with some pretty heavy stuff, like the main character's parents dying in a car crash. RAHMAN: I think it might have been \"Outsiders.\" CHANG: \"The Outsiders\" by S.E. Hinton - a coming-of-age story involving two rival gangs in Tulsa, Okla. Well, Rahman wasn't familiar with it, so she reached out to the school. She wanted to talk with someone about why it was included on the book list. And her son's librarian called her back. RAHMAN: She explained the process to me, you know, what the book was about. And at the end of that conversation, I said, OK, no problem. I don't have a problem with my child reading this book. You know, I'll be asking him questions. We will talk about it and discuss it. And it ended up not being a problem. CHANG: Rahman didn't think much more about the whole experience until November of last year, when book lists became the No. 1 topic at Williamson County School District board meetings. That's her children's district in Tennessee, just south of Nashville. Parents showed up to read excerpts from books found in school libraries. Many had sexual language or references to abuse, but parent groups were also pushing to remove titles that dealt with the history of slavery and racism. RAHMAN: That's what's so frustrating. It's frustrating when people are trying to take these things out and say that it doesn't - you know, my kid doesn't need to hear that. CHANG: As a Black parent, Rahman was very concerned to see books like \"Ruby Bridges Goes To School\" and one about Martin Luther King Jr.'s march on Washington included on banned request lists sent to district officials. The timing of it all also felt strange to her. RAHMAN: These were the same faces, same people who were upset about the masking guidelines of the school. CHANG: Rahman belongs to a group called One WillCo that has been pushing back against these requests. And while the board has not banned all of these books, these complaints have kept them really busy. It's remained a primary topic of debate and conversation for months, which Rahman says takes the focus away from more pressing issues, like reports her group has received about students being called the N-word at school, Black boys receiving a disproportionate rate of discipline and other curriculum concerns about how Southern racial history is being taught. RAHMAN: I can't quit. I'm not cut from the quitting cloth. I have to persist. I have to still be there. I have a ninth-grader and a sixth-grader. I'm vested in this community, and I will be actively making sure that they are doing things to help students of color and to make them feel equal, just as every other student here. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) CHANG: Of course, what's happening in Williamson County, Tenn., is not an isolated incident, and the debates happening in school boards throughout the country have had real political consequences, like during last year's gubernatorial election in Virginia. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENT) LAURA MURPHY: As a parent, it's tough to catch everything. So when my son showed me his reading assignment, my heart sunk. It was some of the most explicit material you can imagine. CHANG: That is an ad from then-candidate Glenn Youngkin, a Republican who was attacking his Democratic opponent, Terry McAuliffe. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENT) MURPHY: He doesn't think parents should have a say. CHANG: These school issues were front and center for that election, and Youngkin came out on top. He's now governor of Virginia. And now, with midterms coming up in the fall, we might be seeing more and more of this. The Atlantic writer Elizabeth Bruenig half-jokingly called this moment the Kinderreferenda, and she's written about why these arguments surrounding the classroom have been such a lightning rod for political debate. She spoke with my co-host, Ari Shapiro, about that. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: Why do you think we see this fervor, whether it is over masks and home schooling or over critical race theory or over books that are in libraries on reading lists? Why are we constantly seeing these battles in schools and school board meetings and PTA meetings? ELIZABETH BRUENIG: I think in the United States, because we're a liberal democracy, we have more or less decided that there are, you know, quite a few subjects, and these are the most important subjects to people in a lot of cases, but they regard religion. They regard sort of matters of ultimate concern - the most important, private, personal beliefs. We're going to leave those out of politics and leave them up for the individual to decide what to do in those cases. But with children and what to teach children in public schools, which are run by the state - they are state-run and organized - it becomes impossible not to give them information or, in some sense, give them direction. And so schools become places where adults fight about these questions because we don't have many other opportunities to just publicly fight about these things. And I think people relish it to some degree. I mean, obviously, the people going to these town halls or, you know, getting into punditry over this are making quite a bit of hay out of it. SHAPIRO: There's obviously a strong political element to this. These debates helped a Republican win the governor's office in Virginia. How much do you think these controversies are connected to the upcoming midterm elections? BRUENIG: I think that they are likely to have an effect on the upcoming midterms. You mentioned Youngkin's win in Virginia, that surprise gubernatorial win in '21. I would expect that these debates would have a very similar effect on the midterms. I think that they are highly emotive. They involve children, everyone's children, the most important thing in their lives. SHAPIRO: Do you think that's why these debates are happening? I mean, are politicians and their interests ginning up these debates in order to get a leg up for the election? BRUENIG: Oh, yeah. I mean, I think that they find it - I think these are ready-made, pre-existing debates that, you know, sort of exist due to these - you know, the structural landscape of American politics, this sort of way that liberal democracy works. And then I think politicians find it helpful to provoke them, especially when you have a midterm election like this where you have, you know, sort of Democrats with unified control. The federal government, Republicans are very strong against them. They look like they're going to have a pretty good go of things in the midterms, and they want to make that as strong of a sweep as they can. And so I think they are doing everything they can to kind of provoke these pre-existing tensions. Yeah, absolutely. SHAPIRO: This may be an impossible question to answer, but do you think that most of these arguments are in good faith? BRUENIG: A lot of people who get into these arguments genuinely believe their grievances, and they have come to genuinely feel that the emotional pitch at which these arguments are had is the appropriate emotional pitch. You know, do I still disagree with them in many cases? Yeah, absolutely. And do I feel that they, you know, are perhaps participating in something that's a bit more organized (laughter) than, you know, and inorganic than they might suggest? Yes. SHAPIRO: Elizabeth Bruenig is a staff writer for The Atlantic. Thanks a lot. BRUENIG: Thank you so much. (SOUNDBITE OF DAFT PUNK'S \"DEREZZED\") Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The race between South Korea's two leading presidential candidates has seen unprecedented levels of toxic rhetoric, mudslinging and lawsuits. How bad is it? \"Hitler,\" \"beast,\" and \"parasite\" are some of the choicer insults leveled by both camps. Some are even calling it \"The Squid Game Election,\" in reference to Netflix's megahit survival drama where people are killed if they lose children's games. And the stakes? There's widespread speculation that the loser will be arrested. \"It's a dreadful presidential election when the losing contender faces prison. Please survive this dogfight in the mire!\" senior opposition politician Hong Joon-pyo wrote on Facebook. Just days before Wednesday's election, Lee Jae-myung from the liberal governing Democratic Party and Yoon Suk Yeol from the main conservative opposition People Power Party are locked in an extremely tight race. Their negative campaigns are aggravating South Korea's already severe political divide at a time when it faces a battered, pandemic-hit economy, a balancing act over competition between its main ally, Washington, and its top trading partner, China, and a raft of threats and weapons tests from rival North Korea. Opinion surveys show that both candidates have more critics than supporters. \"Isn't our national future too bleak with an unpleasant and bitter presidential election that calls for choosing the lesser of two evils?\" the mass-circulation Dong-A Ilbo newspaper said in an editorial. Yoon has slammed Lee over his possible ties to an allegedly corrupt land development scandal. Lee has denied any connection, and in turn has tried to link Yoon to the same scandal, while separately criticizing him for his reported ties to shamanism \u2014 an ancient, indigenous religious belief. There have also been attacks on the candidates' wives, both of whom have been forced to apologize over separate scandals. Yoon described Lee's party as \"Hitler\" and \"Mussolini\" while an associate called Lee's purported aides \"parasites.\" Lee's allies called Yoon \"a beast,\" \"dictator\" and \"an empty can\" and derided his wife's alleged plastic surgery. Their campaign teams and supporters have filed dozens of lawsuits charging libel and the spread of false information, among other issues. \"This year's presidential election has been more overwhelmed by negative campaigning than any other previous election, and the mutual hatred won't easily die down after the election,\" said Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership. Among the fault lines in the electorate are South Korean regional rivalries, views on North Korea, a conflict between generations, economic inequality and women's rights issues. Yoon is more popular with older voters and those in the southeastern region of Gyeongsang, where past conservative and authoritarian leaders came from. His supporters typically advocate a stronger military alliance with the United States and a tougher line on North Korea, and they credit past authoritarian rulers for quickly developing the economy after the Korean War. Lee enjoys greater support from younger people and those from Jeolla province, Gyeongsang's rival region in the southwest. His supporters generally want an equal footing in relations with the United States and rapprochement with North Korea while being extremely critical of past authoritarian rulers' human rights records. In a notable development, many surveys showed Yoon has received greater approval ratings than Lee from voters aged 18 and 29, most of whom were born after South Korea became a developed country. \"They didn't experience poverty and dictatorships. ... They are very critical of China and North Korea, and they have rather friendly feelings toward the U.S. and Japan,\" said Park Sung-min, head of Seoul-based MIN Consulting, a political consulting firm. South Korea's deep divisions are reflected in the troubles of the last three leaders. Their supporters say intense corruption investigations after they left office were politically motivated by their rivals. During a corruption probe of his family, former liberal President Roh Moo-hyun jumped to his death in 2009, a year after he left office. His successor, the conservative Lee Myung-bak, and Lee's conservative successor, Park Geun-hye, were separately convicted of a range of crimes, including corruption, and given lengthy prison terms after Roh's friend and current President Moon Jae-in took office in 2017. Park was pardoned in December, but Lee is still serving a 17-year prison term. Moon's government took a big hit with a scandal involving Moon's former justice minister and close associate, Cho Kuk. Cho and his family members are alleged to have participated in financial crimes and the faking of credentials to help Cho's daughter enter medical school. Cho was seen as a reformist and potential liberal presidential hopeful. Moon's early attempts to keep Cho in office split the public, with his critics calling for Cho's resignation and supporters rallying to his side during large street protests. Yoon originally served as Moon's prosecutor general and spearheaded investigations of previous conservative governments. But he eventually left Moon's government and joined the opposition last year after a conflict with Moon's allies over the Cho case helped him emerge as a potential presidential contender. \"Cho's case was a watershed in South Korean politics. It made Yoon a presidential candidate, and many in their 20s and 30s switched their support from Moon,\" said Choi, the institute director. During a recent TV debate, Yoon and Lee agreed not to launch politically motivated investigations against the other side if they win. But some question their sincerity. In a newspaper interview last month, Yoon said that if elected, his government would investigate possible wrongdoing by the Moon government and also the land development scandal that Lee has been allegedly linked to. When Moon's government was conducting widespread investigations of past conservative governments, Lee said they were necessary to eradicate \"deep-rooted evils and injustice.\" Cho Jinman, a professor at Seoul's Duksung Women's University, said a new president must exercise restraint and calm calls for political revenge by hard-line supporters. \"We now have an election race like 'Squid Game,' but it will be a new president's responsibility to pull us out of it,\" he said.",

This time, those issues were not the focus. \"From a president who said that he would make race equity a linchpin of his administration, he didn't mention it,\" Cliff Albright, a cofounder of the group Black Voters Matter, said on a panel with other progressives who were responding to Biden's State of the Union address. \"I don't think he said 'race' or even the word 'Black' once, even when he was talking about the first Black woman potential Supreme Court justice who he nominated. If you look at the transcript of the speech, he doesn't use the word anywhere in the speech,\" Albright added. Black voters were key in sending Biden to the White House and giving Democrats majorities in both the House and the Senate. Now, some activists who worked to mobilize their communities amid the racial justice protests of 2020 and a global pandemic say Biden's urgency and forceful language has been replaced by silence, as the president signals an election-year shift to the middle. \"You can't say that it's time for America to come together on race by ignoring race,\" said Rashad Robinson, president of the racial justice group Color of Change. During the speech, Biden made only passing mention of voting rights, an issue that energized the party in a yearlong push for federal legislation that ended in January. He made no mention of the fact that, if confirmed, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson would be the first Black woman to sit on the Supreme Court in its 233-year history. He did not renew calls for police reform legislation, an issue on which bipartisan talks broke down last fall. Instead, he directly rebutted persistent Republican attacks that Democrats want to \"defund the police.\" You can't say that it's time for America to come together on race by ignoring race. Rashad Robinson, of Color of Change Robinson said that the White House was making a political miscalculation by deemphasizing issues of equity and justice in such a high-profile moment. He and some other activists and strategists say they worry that some core Democratic voters, including voters of color and young voters, might not be as energized this year because of failures to make good on Biden's campaign promises on police reform, voting rights and other issues. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll conducted ahead of the State of the Union found that 54% of respondents said the president is not fulfilling his campaign promises. \"Racial justice is not charity. It's not the thing that a president should do to be nice to Black and brown folks. Racial justice is strategy,\" Robinson said. \"The quicker the White House and other folks recognize the strategic power of engaging on racial justice to motivate, engage and deliver for the communities most impacted, the better off they will be and the better off the country will be.\" Biden's decision in his address to emphasize the need for more law enforcement funding \u2014 and to rebut calls for defunding the police \u2014 particularly stood out to some activists. \"We should all agree: The answer is not to defund the police. The answer is to fund the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities,\" Biden said in a line that received a standing ovation from members of a deeply divided Congress. Amara Enyia, the policy and research coordinator for the Movement for Black Lives, said that in the speech, Biden was addressing white moderates and conservatives, in a \"betrayal\" of the party's base. \"Calling for funding the police is simply a political play to appease Republicans and to appease those who are afraid that their political futures may be on the line,\" she said. White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters this week that Biden has never supported efforts to defund police departments, despite \"attempts to mischaracterize his position and the position of, frankly, a number of his Democratic colleagues.\" Psaki also said that the president supports ensuring \"police departments have the funding they need ... but that there also needs to be steps that are taken to ensure there are accountability measures put in place. \" Democratic strategist Joel Payne said Biden's speech was a \"pretty clear course correction,\" and that he was charting a middle-of-the-road course in an election year. \"It feels like the president has decided to kind of revert back into what some people might think of as the original Biden, the Biden that we saw in the Senate for three decades and the Biden who for most of his public, political career was thought as a scion of the middle,\" Payne said. He said that Biden's comments on police funding were a \"very purposeful thing that needed to be said out loud so not only the president, but the president's allies could use that as a political chum.\" But Payne also said the White House omitted some big issues that could have excited Black voters who turned out in 2020 and who Democrats need to turn out again this year. Enyia, of the Movement for Black Lives, warned that Biden and Democrats \"have to care more about your base than you care about wooing Republicans.\" \"If people don't feel that their material conditions, their lives have improved over the last year, it's going to be very hard to get them out to vote in the midterms. And that's even more dangerous for the Democratic Party,\" she said.",

Teens and young adults get a bad rap. They're often called lazy and entitled, with a new generation seen as inextricably glued to their phones and TikTok. And when they speak up about issues, it can be met with an eye roll or a knowing sigh. It's the one that suggests, \"Maybe they will get how the world works when they're older.\" But the veteran pollster John Della Volpe says that everything he was told \u2014 and that most people think \u2014 about Generation Z is wrong. Della Volpe is the director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics and a former adviser to the Biden campaign, and he explores the evolution of Gen Z in his new book. Fight: How Gen Z is channeling their fear and passion to save America, covers the coming of age of the 70 million young people in America born in a 20-year period beginning in the mid-1990s. Della Volpe examines the political awakening of this generation that has come largely during the Trump era, as well as what he describes as a \"significant mental health crisis,\" intensified by the state of the country's politics. The forward to Fight was written by one of Gen Z's most visible activists, David Hogg, a survivor of the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Hogg told NPR that older people often thank him for his generation \"standing up,\" eager to pass the baton. But Hogg argued that lasting change requires more than the resolve of young people \u2014 it requires a coalition across generations. Their conversation is below, edited for length and clarity. Juana Summers: I want to just start here with the basics. You've been leading polling focusing on young people in the United States for more than two decades. What inspired you to write this book? John Della Volpe: Frankly, I think that everything that I was told and everything that many people think about Gen Z was frankly, wrong. And I wanted to write this book to kind of correct those myths. I think every generation has had its share of angst and turmoil. I'm Gen X, but I don't think there is any generation in 75 years that has been confronted with more chaos, more quickly in their young lives than Gen Z or Zoomers. When we think about this, many of them were born right around 9/11, and it's always been kind of a shadow in their lives. Millions of their parents lost their homes due to the Great Recession. Entering school, they faced lockdown drills, things that my generation had never seen. And the idea of going to a place and being safe never really existed for young people. Just so much chaos, even before COVID-19 and the social isolation of the lockdown, all of this accelerated by social media. All of this happening before they were 25. So that's where they came of age. But rather than melting, it made them harder and made them tougher and made them more focused to do great things for themselves and for the country. JS: David, in the forward to the book you offer up a rallying cry to other members of your generation What's your message to them? David Hogg: While voting is important and it's obviously a very important thing for us to do, it can't be the only thing that we do because our generation is not going to wait for progress. As we've seen from all these movements, especially over the past four years, that young people have played a critical movement and from the March for our Lives, to calls for racial justice, to everything else. We have to vote, but we also have to remember that change has to be created inside and outside of politics, because real power in politics isn't just generated with a vote. It's generating an issue and a cultural shift around young people and how we perceive the world that we live in and the world that we want to leave behind.

JS: John, this book draws from your years of work as a pollster, but also from focus groups you conducted. I want to ask you about a moment from a focus group that you say really stuck with you. You asked what older generations do not understand about Generation Z, and you quote a participant named Grace: \"An older generation would not understand waking up in a classroom and thinking about how easy it would be for someone to shoot it up. The same daily weight on an adult's shoulders over bills or taxes is what children feel about living or dying.\" John, what stuck out about that to you? JDV: I've been asking that question for 20 years. And what I used to hear when I would ask that question is optimism, and opportunity, even in some of the poorest communities across the country, some of the most challenging circumstances. I used to hear young people talk about kind of connection and opportunity is there in America, if you were to work for it. And now what I heard was that [they] don't have the luxury of even thinking about that. Young people were challenged with just the daily weight of living and dying. Grace wasn't the only one \u2014 every single hand in that group went up and was nodding their heads. We talked about this on the outset. There was just no place that was safe. JS: David, I want to ask you the same question that John asked Grace. What don't older generations understand about your generation? DH:  John brings up a good point around the fear and anxiety aspect that Gen Z faces. And I think that the anxiety that comes from gun violence, from climate change to all these other things is something that a lot of generations right now just can't understand, the scale of the existential threat that young people today feel. What I will say, though, is that as we've seen in times before, when generations faced challenges, they come to meet them. Oftentimes, you know, movements find their leaders. I think we saw that in 2020. JS: Gen Z is a generation that came of age with the hold that former President Trump had on politics and culture. John, how has that shaped them? JDV: Every generation determines their political values in their teenage years, in their early 20s, and so much of that is shaped by the president that is serving during that period of their lives. While [Gen Z] were looking for an opportunity to unite us, they saw a president and administration more bent on dividing young people. From the earliest days of the Harvard research, we found that the biggest predictor of whether or not a young person participates in politics or votes is whether they can see a tangible difference in their vote. And that first hundred days, those first six months, those first eight or nine months leading up to Charlottesville were everything that young people need to see about the tangible difference that Donald Trump was making. And obviously in a way that did not comport at all kind of with their values. And it's something that I think was a real sense of ignition to what we saw as a tremendous level of political participation in 2017, 2018, 2019 and obviously 2020. JS: David, you are a part of that generation and movement that came of age during the Trump presidency. DH: Even with a president that was a Republican \u2014 which most members of Gen Z tend to lean more progressive \u2014 even despite that, we hoped that we would be united somewhat in the early days. By the time Charlottesville rolled around and all these other things started happening, it was so abundantly clear to many of us that that wasn't going to happen. Our generation stepped up and decided to unite ourselves. What I fear at this point, though, is the mental health crisis that Gen Z is facing right now and the burnout and exhaustion that I know so many of us feel, myself included. That despite us turning out at record numbers in 2018 and 2020, that our vote doesn't seem to have made that tangible of a difference. If we can't see that our vote makes a difference... what I fear is that some younger people are going to look at the events of January 6th and see that as the alternative, that it's OK if you don't get what you want in politics to go out and attempt to overthrow the government. JS: John, what do you have to say to that? JDV: One of the dangers, as David said it's kind of connected to this, is the sense of alienation that so many young people face. In recent [Institute of Politics] polling released at the end of last year, we have a majority of young people, which is tens of millions of people, saying that over the last couple of weeks they at more than several times felt anxious, hopeless, depressed, isolated, et cetera. And you have 25% indicating thoughts of self-harm. It's just a just a significant, significant crisis. When folks are so depressed and so isolated and they withdraw, one of the concerns I have for them is to withdraw, spend more time online where they could potentially be more easily recruited into places where they don't necessarily even agree with the ideology, but are looking for some sort of community and then perhaps find themselves in a situation that's difficult to get out of. Whether it's alt right groups or some of the folks like David talked about who participated in the Jan. 6 riot and insurrection, you know, hate groups, etc. That's my concern. We have so many young people, especially young men, who are vulnerable right now. JS: In the book, John cites demographers who estimate that by 2028 Generation Z and their immediate elders \u2014 millennials \u2014  will make up half of the electorate. What does that tell you about the future? JDV: We think so much about this country being divided, and clearly it is. But it's really divided by age. We look at Gen Z and millennials \u2014  two-thirds of them support candidates who are Democrats, not Republicans. And once you get to Baby Boomers and the Silent Generation, it's a different scenario. As younger people age, as younger people begin to make voting a more regular habit, there is no question that they will be voting for the values that they've been developing over the last couple of years: concern about the way in which capitalism is practiced, concern about our climate, concern about racial justice. These are the issues that will be driving young people to the polls. They've made a greater impact on these issues than many people may already appreciate, and that those Democrats, as well as Republicans who don't take them seriously today, will underestimate them at their peril. JS: David, what do we need to understand about Gen Z as we look to the future? DH: I often hear older people come up to me and say, \"I'm so thankful that your generation is standing up, and we can finally kind of pass the baton off to you.\" It can't be that way. It can't. It's going to take every generation working together in order to fix these things. If our older generations or our country is simply putting it on younger people to fix these things, they're never going to get fixed. Because as powerful as we are, it has to be an inter-generational coalition of people that work hand in hand, and don't patronize or talk down to young people, but lead with young people and our vision and ideas for the future.",

Businessman Glenn Youngkin was sworn in as the 74th governor of Virginia on Saturday in Richmond, the first Republican to hold the office in nearly a decade. \"No matter who you voted for, I pledge to be your advocate, your voice, your governor,\" Youngkin said in his inaugural speech, offering a message of unity that, at times, was absent from the campaign. \"Our politics have become too toxic. Soundbites have replaced solutions \u2014 taking precedence over good faith problem-solving.\" But during his speech, the crowd was loudest, and many stood on their feet, when Youngkin spoke about \"removing politics from the classroom.\" On the campaign trail, he frequently talked about parents' rights to say what is taught in school. Two history-making Republicans also took the oath of office. Former state Delegate Jason Miyares was sworn in as attorney general, the first Latino elected to statewide office. And former state Delegate Winsome Sears is now lieutenant governor, the first Black woman to hold that title. Youngkin began leaving his mark shortly after the inauguration when he signed several executive orders. His first executive order bans what he calls \"divisive concepts\" \u2013 including critical race theory \u2013 from teacher diversity trainings, as well as \"all guidelines, websites, best practices, and other materials\" produced by Virginia's Department of Education, and orders a review of school curriculum for CRT-related content. Youngkin campaigned heavily on the notion that school equity programs designed to address systemic racism had gone too far. Critics noted CRT does not appear in Virginia's K-12 curricula and accused Youngkin of stoking racial resentment. Another order attempts to fast-track Virginia's removal from a regional carbon cap-and-trade program. Youngkin also ordered an end to a mask mandate for public schools and scrapped a vaccine or weekly testing mandate for state employees put in place by outgoing Gov. Ralph Northam. Several school districts, including Arlington and Richmond, said they would keep their mask mandates in place. Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, says some of the policies were likely to be met with legal challenges. \"I think he's pushing the envelope,\" Tobias says. \"And I think the General Assembly will be unhappy with some of it, too.\" Youngkin's victory in November shocked Democrats who \u2014 after President Biden's 10-point margin in the state \u2014 were hoping former Gov. Terry McAuliffe would be able to return to the governor's mansion and continue the party's grip on an office. But Youngkin's campaign turned out many voters in rural Virginia and made inroads in suburban areas of the state. The former private equity CEO framed his lack of political experience as an asset. In addition to seizing control of all three statewide offices, Republicans also hold a 52-48 majority in the House of Delegates after flipping seven seats in the 100-member chamber. During their brief time in the majority, Democrats raised the minimum wage, abolished the death penalty, expanded access to voting and legalized marijuana. Republicans are hoping to work with the new governor to roll back some of the more progressive elements of those new laws. But they'll have to cajole or compromise with Democrats in the state Senate, where Democrats still hold a 21-19 edge, with broader margins on key committees.

Youngkin will also have to face an issue that he didn't talk about on the campaign trail: figuring out how Virginia's new marijuana industry will work. Democrats legalized marijuana in small amounts, but the system for retail sales still hasn't been established. Youngkin's cabinet includes a mix of political newcomers as well as veterans of state and federal government, including staffers who worked under former President Donald Trump. That includes natural resources secretary nominee Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist and administrator of Trump's Environmental Protection Agency who rolled back protections passed by former President Barack Obama. Wheeler's nomination sparked immediate outcry among Senate Democrats in Virginia, who are hoping to block his nomination. The fight over Wheeler's nomination could be an early test of Youngkin's ability to work his way through delicate political situations. Youngkin has so far ignored those protests, calling Wheeler \"incredibly qualified\" in an interview with member station VPM on Tuesday. Northam, the outgoing Democrat, has said he's unlikely to run for office again. He faced widespread calls to resign in February 2019 after reporters surfaced a racist photo on his medical school yearbook page. Northam ultimately denied he was in the photo, stood down those calls and went on to sign sweeping policy changes pushed by Democratic majorities.

Sears is also a philanthropist, a former director of a homeless shelter and a volunteer for a prison ministry. And she is a comeback story \u2013 someone who overcame a traumatic childhood, political setbacks and family tragedy to come within one heartbeat of the governor's mansion. Sears plans to use her new power to address what she sees as pressing problems: a country that under-educates its children and over-taxes its citizens, as well as a state unwilling to move on from its dark past. \"Slavery happened, absolutely,\" Sears says. \"And there are some vestiges of it. But how long are we going to go back there?\" It's an uncommon message for Black politicians in Richmond, the former capital of the Confederacy. Virginia has been shaped by centuries of racial trauma, from slavery to redlining. Democrats have been talking more about the lingering impact of those scars since racial justice protests rocked the country in 2020. For supporters like Bishop E.W. Jackson, a former GOP candidate for lieutenant governor who is also Black, Sears embodies a firey Republican response to a racial reckoning that's gone too far \u2013 a response to the idea that the U.S. remains rooted in white supremacy. \"The people who traffic in that, and benefit from that, hate Winsome Sears because she's the antithesis of that and proves the thesis that America is a place of decency and fairness,\" Jackson says. In her campaign, Sears ran as a pro-Trump underdog who lit up crowds with her speeches. Off-stage, she remained deeply religious, listening to worship music as she crisscrossed the state. Her name recognition \u2013 dimmed after two decades out of office \u2013 was propelled by the iconic photo of her holding her military-style rifle, taken at a gun range while on the trail. Beautiful day \u2600\ufe0f = Range day! Marines know how to use guns and I won\u2019t ever support a red flag law!

Democrats hold a 21-19 advantage in the state Senate, meaning Sears, like Fairfax, could break ties when a Democrat breaks ranks. The soon-to-be lieutenant governor's critics note she came to power on a ticket fueled by racial themes. Taking a cue from former President Donald Trump, Sears and Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin claimed that equity programs in schools \u2013 designed to address systemic racism \u2013 were pitting students against each other and painting an overly pessimistic portrait of U.S. history. Ravi Perry, chair of Howard University's political science department, says Youngkin and Sears' rhetoric misrepresented the reality of Virginia classrooms, where he says the history of slavery is still undertaught. \"It gave them a chance to harp on an issue that really does not exist,\" Perry says. \"The rhetoric is not only divisive and tiring and exhausting, it's also inaccurate.\" That's not the only Trumpian talking point that Sears repeated on the campaign trail. \"I guess dead people voted,\" she told members of the Fairfax GOP in February, winking at false claims of widespread election fraud. \"We Republicans have never been able to get our dead folks to vote.\" Sears says she grew up around newspapers and dinner-table political chatter in Jamaica. At the age of 6, Sears moved to New York to follow after her father. Everything was unfamiliar \u2013 the smells, the cold, the deadbolts on her apartment door in the Bronx. Her family wasn't wealthy; she says her father arrived in the U.S. in 1963 with only $1.75 in his pocket. \"When I stepped off that plane at JFK, it was very traumatic because I stepped into a new world,\" Sears says. But she thrived in her new home. Sears graduated high school early, joined the Marine Corps, got a master's degree, raised three children, served in Virginia's legislature and on the state Board of Education, and started her own business. In 2001, she became the first Black Republican elected to Virginia's General Assembly since Reconstruction. She pulled off the win in a heavily Black and Democratic district in Hampton Roads against a longtime incumbent who was ensnared in scandal.

Sears' victory against a Democratic incumbent in the House of Delegates that month stunned her opposition. Sears' win shocked the political establishment. Backers like Republican state Sen. John Cosgrove says Sears showed up in public housing developments where residents had long been ignored. As a lawmaker, he says Sears was an independent-minded conservative who got along with everyone. \"She was never one to back down from a position that she had taken and nobody expected her to,\" Cosgrove says. Sears' legislative record doesn't have the same blistering tone as her later campaign rhetoric. Many of the dozen or so bills she sponsored during her time in the legislature had bipartisan support, including a successful push to reform the state's medical board. She was one of two Republicans to vote against a GOP effort to raise taxes. When Sears announced her resignation after a single term, the editorial board of the Virginian-Pilot lamented the \"loss of moderating voices\" in the chamber. Sears' next move \u2013 an unsuccessful 2004 campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives \u2013 tested that label. According to the Daily Press, Sears ran a TV ad claiming that her opponent, Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott, had voted against legislation that would make child pornography a crime. Scott noted that it was already a crime and said Sears was misconstruing his record. Sears also claimed Scott had \"forced\" Virginians to accept same-sex marriage because of his vote against a constitutional amendment that would ban the practice. After her loss, Sears published a book, Stop Being a Christian Wimp, and opened a home appliance business. In 2011, she was appointed to the state Board of Education where she served as vice president. Sears defended the board's efforts to create different testing benchmarks in reading and math for students of different races, with lower standards for Black and Latino students compared to white ones. \"We're starting with Black children where they are,\" Sears told NPR at the time. Then, in 2012, Sears suffered a family tragedy. One of her daughters, as well as two grandchildren, were killed in a car accident. When she got the proverbial knock on the door, Sears says a Bible verse came to mind: \"It was 'The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away, blessed be the name of the Lord,' \" Sears recalls. \"And then I collapsed.\" Sears re-emerged on the political scene in 2018 when she staged a write-in campaign against Republican Corey Stewart, a U.S. Senate candidate who openly associated with white nationalists. In 2020, she chaired a group backing then-President Donald Trump called \"Black Americans to Re-elect the President.\" When Sears considered a run for lieutenant governor, she called up Andrew Leppert, a Republican campaign operative who was working on Trump's unsuccessful attempts to challenge the results of the vote in Wisconsin. Leppert says he liked her odds. \"If you assess where Republicans and how Republicans were successful in 2020, it was veterans, minorities, or females, and Winsome Sears is all three of those things,\" says Leppert, who went on to become an early campaign manager. It was a message Sears repeatedly made herself in the GOP nominating fight. Republicans hadn't won a statewide election in Virginia since 2009 and Sears offered a fresh face without compromising on conservative credentials. Leppert took the now-famous photo of the lieutenant governor-elect holding her gun and peppered voting sites across Virginia with yard signs featuring the picture. \"If you've seen one of those signs in person, one of them looks like three, and six looks like 15,\" Leppert says. Sears' campaign ran into headwinds during the general election. The Hill reported that she said she would back hardline Texas-style abortion restrictions in Virginia, sparking an immediate outcry. Days later, she fired her campaign staff. Virginia Republican Lt.

Gov.-elect Winsome Sears, then candidate, addresses the Virginia FREE Leadership Luncheon in McLean, Va., on Sept. 1, 2021. The problems didn't appear to affect Sears' performance at the ballot box, where she won a slightly higher percentage of votes than either Youngkin or Attorney General-elect Jason Miyares. Sears says she can help win over conservative Black voters and chafes at President Joe Biden's remarks during the 2020 campaign saying Black voters who favored Trump \"ain't Black.\" \"How dare you tell me that?\" Sears says. But Lamont Bagby, a Democrat who chairs Virginia's Legislative Black Caucus, says it's still not clear what Sears' policies are or how they will help Black voters. \"Black folks aren't just voting for Democrats because they like the color blue. It's based upon the issues,\" he says. Sears has been quiet on one key issue \u2013 she won't say whether she's vaccinated against COVID-19. But she says her main focus in office will be education by trying to add school vouchers and create charter schools. For Sears, education is the backbone of her optimism about the country's future. \"America is progressing,\" she says. \"I'm proof.\" Sears has four years to make that case to Virginia voters.",

Trump supporters gathered in the nation's capital to protest the ratification of President-elect Joe Biden's Electoral College victory over President Trump in the 2020 election. One year after the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, when mobs stormed in, trying to stop Congress from certifying the election of President Biden, the \"Big Lie\" that drove it all remains as widespread as it has ever been. Countless recounts, courts, commissions and private contractors \u2014 including Republicans \u2014 have all dismissed former President Donald Trump's claims that the election was stolen. But a new NPR/Ipsos poll shows that two-thirds of Republican voters and just over one-third of all voters still believe it. It's prompting both consternation and more creative efforts to reach those who remain adamant \u2014 despite all evidence to the contrary \u2014 that rampant fraud robbed Trump of the presidency. \"Of course!\" exclaims one such believer from Wisconsin named Jerry. \"There's just there's no way [Biden] got 81 million votes. It's not possible.\" Jerry is a Republican and a fervent Trump supporter. He asked that his last name not be used because he says he doesn't want to be targeted by what he calls \"wacky\" liberals. His views, Jerry says, are based on reason. He assails mainstream media as \"skewed,\" opting instead for what he describes as \"local conservative radio.\" But he dismisses any suggestion that that might be slanted. \"There's not usually a spin to it,\" he says. \"It's what's right and what's wrong.\" When he is confronted with evidence affirming the legitimacy of the election, he pushes back with broad-brush pronouncements such as \"they found emails,\" and vague, baseless references to ballot harvesting, big money and the \"deep state.\" He says nothing will ever convince him the election wasn't stolen. \"It just won't happen,\" he says. \"We all know the whole game is rigged.\" This kind of intractability, however, isn't stopping people around the nation from continuing to try to get through to their loved ones. Many are filling up support groups for people struggling to reach family members who've fallen deep down the rabbit hole. \"I get frustrated and angry at my dad,\" says one such woman, who goes by Rain. \"I've always thought of him as so intelligent. But he's being misled, and there's no way to get him to see the light on that.\" In a meeting that's run online by Antidote, a group that combats psychological manipulation, the stories are remarkably similar. Shannon, a 37-year-old from Colorado, explains how heartbroken she is that the \"big lie\" has come between her and her mother. The participants asked that their full names not be used to protect their family members from retribution and so as not to jeopardize their reconciliation. Members of the National Guard and the Washington, D.C., police keep a group of demonstrators away from the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n                \n                    \n                    Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Members of the National Guard and the Washington, D.C., police keep a group of demonstrators away from the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Shannon tells the group that her mother, who she says was at the Capitol during the insurrection, will barely listen when her daughter tries to bring her evidence that the election was not stolen. \"It's a waste of my breath,\" she sighs. \"I brought up all kinds of information, and she dismisses it immediately. It's blind allegiance. And I've seen it get worse.\" Others in the group nod in agreement as the group leader, Diane Benscoter, offers empathy and then advice. As a former cult member, Benscoter says she understands the defense mechanisms that kick in when anyone tries to tell you you've been duped. After decades of helping people get out of cults, she's now making something of a second career helping families apply those same strategies to everyone from hard-core QAnon conspiracy theorists to more mainstream MAGA enthusiasts who believe the election was rigged. She gently cautions Shannon that trying to prove her mom wrong will most likely backfire and cause her mom to dig her heels in further. Instead, Benscoter says, just keep her close and watch for little cracks of doubt that might signal an opportunity to plant another seed. But you need to tread lightly, Benscoter repeatedly warns, when trying to reach someone who's so \"all in\" on the falsehood about the election. \"As time goes by, what happens is it becomes not just your political view \u2014 it is your identity,\" she explains. When family members confront a fervent believer and try to persuade the person that what they believe is not true, Benscoter tells the group to remember that \"what's being threatened is their very identity.\" These days, identifying as red or blue, or as a die-hard Trumper or anti-Trumper, has become a kind of \"mega-identity,\" as it has been dubbed by Lilliana Mason, a Johns Hopkins University associate professor of political science. She says partisan identity has become so fully fused with cultural, religious, racial, gender and geographical identity that it's very high stakes for people to break with their party \u2014 or the party line.

And that feels great. That's just like the most primitive human instincts to follow the good feelings, not the bad feelings.\" Experts say it's also all too human to dig in on a position that's seen as a moral one, as today's partisan divide seems to have become. The NPR/Ipsos poll shows 70% of Americans believe the nation is in crisis and at risk of failing. What used to be partisan quarrels about topics such as tax policy have morphed into what many see as an existential fight between good and evil, with each side believing it's saving democracy, or saving America. Mason's research shows the level of loathing. She says a clear majority of Republicans now see Democrats as not only a serious threat to the nation, but also \"downright evil.\" Democrats also feel that way about Republicans to a slightly lesser degree, Mason says, but they're catching up. \"We've now got to the point where you dislike the other party more than you like your party,\" says Joshua Tucker, a New York University politics professor and co-director of the NYU Center for Social Media and Politics. He calls it \"political sectarianism\" and says such intense animus makes partisans impervious to facts and averse to compromise. Tucker says candidates such as Trump feed into \u2014 and off of \u2014 that polarization for political gain and have little political incentive to stop. The more inflammatory they are, the more rewarded they are. \"There's a kind of vicious cycle here, which in itself is fed by the nature of the electoral system in a lot of the United States,\" says Tucker. Politicians would have different incentives, he says, if presidents were chosen by popular vote instead of through the Electoral College system, for example, or if legislative districts were less gerrymandered and more competitive. But such major reforms are unlikely anytime soon. So, instead of waiting for politicians to change their tune, many moderate Republicans are pinning their hopes for change on the wide swath of centrist voters who are exasperated by extremists. \"Sometimes you have to be willing to admit that the person from the party that you vote for most of the time may not be what's best for the country,\" says the Rev. Franklin Ruff of First Baptist Church in Stilwell, Kansas. As a \"pragmatic conservative\" and lifelong Republican who supports most of the party's principles, Ruff is not interested in trashing the GOP. For him, it's about rescuing the Republican Party from the grip of pro-Trump extremists. To do that, Ruff says, millions of voters must be \"willing to go against their own party in order to say, 'Hey, could you give me better choices!' \" That's exactly what Ruff did when he couldn't bring himself to vote for Trump in 2016 or 2020; he voted for neither party. And in the 2018 gubernatorial race, he voted for the Democrat, Laura Kelly, over Republican Kris Kobach. \"Because I felt she was the best candidate for the state, and the person running against her was basically a mini-Trump,\" he says. \"Too far right for me.\" To many, that kind of crossover may be the best hope for snuffing out disinformation about the election. For example, former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and former Department of Homeland Security official Miles Taylor have implored the \"rational remnants of the Republican Party\" to join forces with Democrats to defeat those who've \"turned belief in conspiracy theories and lies about stolen elections into a litmus test for membership and running for office.\" They're part of a larger group of conservatives called the Renew America Movement who're calling for what they've dubbed \"coalition campaigning.\" Miles Taylor (center), seen here in March 2019, is among a group of conservatives imploring the \"rational remnants of the Republican Party\" to join forces with Democrats to defeat those who've \"turned belief in conspiracy theories and lies about stolen elections into a litmus test for membership and running for office.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Brandon/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Miles Taylor (center), seen here in March 2019, is among a group of conservatives imploring the \"rational remnants of the Republican Party\" to join forces with Democrats to defeat those who've \"turned belief in conspiracy theories and lies about stolen elections into a litmus test for membership and running for office.\" If \"concerned conservatives\" and \"patriotic progressives\" team up together to support a centrist who is not the dream candidate of either side, Whitman and Taylor propose, they could beat back the \"extremist insurgency\" that \"seek[s] to tear down our Republic's guardrails.\" They're aiming to win the support of voters such as Joe Horcher, a lifelong Republican from Kentucky, who has also had it with the \"big lie\" and the GOP. \"The Republican Party changed,\" Horcher says. \"There are a number of times I thought about tearing up my card and sending it to Sen. Mitch McConnell and telling him to stuff it.\" Ultimately, if more voters feel that way, more politicians may have second thoughts about peddling disinformation about the election. And less peddling of the \"big lie\" may be what finally creates those little \"cracks\" of doubt in all those voters who've been buying it.",

Remus is the \"quarterback\" of the effort to nominate a Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court. White House counsel Dana Remus is working around the clock to help President Biden make history \u2014 logging hours on the phones, meeting with Republicans and supervising background checks so he can fulfill his promise to nominate a Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court. In the words of White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain, Remus is \"the quarterback of this whole process.\" But, unlike a star football player, Remus prefers to operate behind the scenes, whether she's shepherding a Supreme Court nomination or carrying out any other of her many duties as the White House's top lawyer. A former law professor and ethics expert, Remus has racked up all sorts of elite credentials: graduating from Harvard and Yale Law School, clerking for Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, serving in the Obama White House. Diverging from some of her D.C. contemporaries, she simply doesn't broadcast them. In keeping with that understated approach to life and the law, she declined an interview request. Remus breaks the mold in other ways, too. Democratic presidents tend to choose judges or luminaries close to retirement to serve as their top attorney in the White House. Remus, though, is 46, with a toddler son at home. Still, those who work close to her say Remus is the right person for this moment. This month, she and her team are driving the effort to replace retiring Justice Stephen Breyer and add the first Black woman to serve on the high court. While working on Biden's presidential campaign, Remus met nightly with a group of senior lawyers during the run-up to the 2020 election, puzzling over what to do about former President Donald Trump's baseless claims of voter fraud. Remus anticipated trouble that could delay the vote count long before Jan. 6, so she briefed senators on how to defend the legitimacy of the slates of electors coming in from key states and made plans to rush to court, just in case. \"A lot of the extraordinary threats to the electoral process we had been speculating about were emerging in real time before our eyes,\" said Don Verrilli, a member of the group. \"Dana ran that whole process with aplomb, and she made exactly the right judgments 100% of the time.\" Sometimes the group disagreed about what to do. But Remus won, by being polite but firm. \"I've been on a call where she was with three former solicitors general, and she said why we were all three wrong and she was right. And, 'let's move on to the next question,' \" former Acting Solicitor General Walter Dellinger, who was also part of the group, said in an interview with NPR last week, before his death. Dellinger knew eight White House counsels going back to the Clinton administration and Remus is the \"best of the bunch,\" he said. Her job description involves a huge portfolio of responsibilities that touches nearly every aspect of the Biden agenda and involves making quick decisions. Just this week, Remus wrote to the National Archives, concluding that the White House would not assert executive privilege over most visitor logs from the Trump era, which are being sought by the Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6 riots. She pointed out that the administration already treats most visitor logs as public information. And, she said, the Biden team has determined the Capitol Hill insurrection requires \"a full accounting to ensure nothing similar ever happens again.\" \"I think what makes a good White House counsel, and what makes Dana a great White House counsel, is a combination of legal acumen, just raw legal horsepower, and an understanding of how the government works,\" Klain, the chief of staff, told NPR. Parts of Biden's agenda have gotten a tough reception in the courts. And his legal bid to extend the eviction moratorium drew criticism even from some Democrats. But Remus and her team have already broken records on the judge front, steering 40 judges to lifetime appointments in their first year. Eighty percent are women and more than half are people of color. She's closely monitored diversity on her own staff, too. Two-thirds of the counsel staff are women, and 40% are people of color, according to spokesman Andrew Bates. More than 20% are LGBTQ, Bates said. Neil Eggleston, who served as White House counsel in the Obama administration, said Remus has a sophisticated understanding of her role. \"The White House counsel cannot do the entire job by herself, and she's put together a really experienced and terrific team,\" Eggleston said. \"And my impression from talking to her is that she's done a really good job of delegating out responsibility while at the same time maintaining ultimate accountability.\" President Biden hosts a meeting that includes White House counsel Dana Remus.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Biden hosts a meeting that includes White House counsel Dana Remus. Remus is familiar with both the high court and the Senate. She clerked for conservative Justice Alito and taught a class with Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee. But her closest ties are with people from the Obama White House. That's where she met Valerie Jarrett, a former senior adviser. \"She was responsible for making sure that we were complying with all of our ethical rules and regulations, and President Obama's directive to Dana was to make sure we all colored well within the lines,\" Jarrett said. \"And so I relied on her heavily for advice and counsel to ensure that we did that.\" Obama officiated Remus' wedding in 2018 to another White House aide, Brett Holmgren, who's now working as an assistant secretary of state for intelligence and research. Jarrett said Obama performed marriage ceremonies very rarely and that his participation speaks to his respect for Remus as a lawyer \u2014 and as a person. The ceremony marked one of the few times that Remus has attracted tabloid coverage during her years in Washington. Her friends said lawyers know they're doing a good job when their names aren't in the newspapers.",

The second gentleman, Doug Emhoff, hosted a roundtable at the White House Wednesday on the rise of antisemitism in the United States, saying there is an \"epidemic of hate facing our country.\" \"Words matter,\" Emhoff said. \"People are no longer saying the quiet parts out loud, they are screaming them.\" The husband of Vice President Harris was joined by a dozen leaders from the Jewish community, including representatives of Hillel, the Anti-Defamation League and Orthodox Union. The meeting comes amid a surge of anti-Jewish comments and actions from prominent people. The rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, has expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler, among other remarks; and former President Donald Trump recently had dinner with Ye and Holocaust-denier Nick Fuentes. Ambassador Deborah Lipstadt, Biden's special envoy who monitors antisemitism around the world, told the roundtable that many people have not taken antisemitism seriously enough. \"For too long, Jew-hatred has been belittled or discounted because Jews have erroneously been considered white and privileged. This is a very real threat to Jews, and that alone would make it worth fighting with all our soul and with all our might,\" Lipstadt said. The White House asked participants for their ideas on how the administration could address the rising tide of antisemitism at home \u2014 insights that were shared during a private portion of the meeting closed to reporters. Wednesday's meeting was the first high-profile policy issue that Emhoff \u2014 the first Jewish spouse of a president or vice president \u2014 has led at the White House. \"We cannot normalize this,\" Emhoff said. \"We all have an obligation to condemn these vile acts. We must not stay silent. There is no either/or. There are no two sides. Everyone must be against this.\" He talked about growing up in Brooklyn and New Jersey in a typical Jewish family, going to synagogue and celebrating his bar mitzvah. \"What's happening now is just it's visceral, it's real. And that's why this is so personal to me,\" he said. He said one of the reasons he went on to become a lawyer was to fight inequality. The Anti-Defamation League, which tracks antisemitism, has reported more anti-Jewish attacks last year than it has in any year since it started tracking in the 1970s. Jewish people are very concerned, said Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the group. \"I don't think it's an understatement to assert that we are reaching a point where this is becoming a national crisis,\" Greenblatt said. \"We have celebrities repeating antisemitic tropes. We have the former president breaking bread with bigots, including white supremacists. We have athletes normalizing Holocaust denialism.\" President Biden raised his own concerns on Twitter last week when he called out \"political leaders\" for not strongly denouncing antisemitism. \"I just want to make a few things clear: The Holocaust happened. Hitler was a demonic figure. And instead of giving it a platform, our political leaders should be calling out and rejecting antisemitism wherever it hides. Silence is complicity,\" the president wrote. I just want to make a few things clear: The Holocaust happened.  Hitler was a demonic figure.  And instead of giving it a platform, our political leaders should be calling out and rejecting antisemitism wherever it hides.  Silence is complicity. In the past, politicians have raised concerns about giving extremists more oxygen by paying attention to their views, but leaders say it's a different time. Ian Russell, a Democratic strategist, says that was a view before the election of Trump, whose blunt rhetoric and aversion to political correctness angered detractors and fueled supporters. \"There was a unspoken tacit understanding between the two major parties that there were some things you just didn't say,\" said Russell, a former deputy executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \"Some dog whistles you didn't send and some things we just kept out of mainstream political dialogue in the United States because we all believe in never again. Instead, Trump said the quiet part out loud. He turned the dog whistle into a megaphone.\" But this type of talk is now part of the mainstream political dialogue. He said the White House is right to call it out. Social media has helped normalize hate speech, said Rabbi Noah Farkas, president of the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles, describing the surge as \"open talk of maybe what was always said in private, but now is being said in public.\" \"Someone once told me you're never weird online,\" he told NPR. \"You'll always find, 'your people.' And while that might be true for people who love to roller skate or people who love kittens, it's also true for people who hold the deeply hateful feelings, thoughts and actions in their hearts. And the truth is, is that social media thrives on these kinds of viral, emotional in-group feelings.\" It's not just Democrats who are concerned, though some Republicans have been careful not to attack Trump directly. A number of Republicans, including Sens. John Cornyn of Texas, Tim Scott of South Carolina and James Lankford of Oklahoma, signed onto a bipartisan letter, led by Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-N.V., calling on Biden to develop a national strategy against antisemitism. \"Rising antisemitism puts Jews both in the United States and around the world at risk,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"Antisemitic voices, inciting hateful and violent action, are finding new audiences, with anti-Jewish conspiracies gaining traction across the globe and through social media.\"",

A lot of filmmakers these days seem to be in an intensely personal, self-reflective mood. There's a terrific movie in theaters right now called Aftersun, and it's based on the childhood memories of its first-time director, Charlotte Wells. Several upcoming films, like Steven Spielberg's The Fabelmans and Bardo, from Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, are also drawn from their filmmakers' life experiences. Armageddon Time, the latest movie written and directed by James Gray, is an especially thoughtful and moving example. While it's a loving re-creation of a time and place Gray knows well \u2014 some of it was shot just blocks away from his childhood home in Queens \u2014 the director has more than a rosy nostalgia trip in mind. He's made an uncommonly tough-minded movie about race, class, assimilation and white privilege in America. And while it takes place in 1980, a few months before the election of Ronald Reagan, it has nearly as much to say about the present. The story follows Paul Graff, an 11-year-old version of Gray played by a wide-eyed young actor named Banks Repeta. Paul wants to be an artist when he grows up. He's also a bit of a class clown at his public school, where his best friend is a Black classmate named Johnny, played by Jaylin Webb. They have fun hanging out and goofing off, and they take turns sticking up for each other when they get in trouble, which is often. But as Paul soon notices, it's Johnny who always gets the more severe punishment. He also knows that Johnny is poor and lives with his grandmother. That places him in stark contrast with Paul and his comfortably middle-class Jewish family. Gray does a wonderful job of immersing us in the everyday bustle of the Graffs' home, where relatives are always coming over for dinner, none more beloved than Paul's grandfather, affectionately played by Anthony Hopkins. Jeremy Strong is terrific \u2014 and very un-Kendall Roy-like \u2014 as Paul's father, a plumber with a big heart and a fierce temper. Anne Hathaway does her finest acting in some time as Paul's gentler but more resilient mother. Like any good parents, Paul's mom and dad only want what's best for him. They've worked hard to make a good living and earn a level of social standing in their community. Given their Jewish immigrant roots, they also know the challenges of assimilating into American culture. At extended gatherings, Paul's relatives share grim stories about the anti-Semitic violence their family fled from in Ukraine. But Gray doesn't shy away from exposing their own casual prejudice: We also hear some of those same relatives spout derogatory remarks about Black people around the dinner table. It's been a while since I've seen a movie that captured family dynamics with this much unsparing honesty. It's also been a while since I've seen a Hollywood movie with such a layered understanding of how white supremacy pits people of different backgrounds against each other. Justin Chang It's been a while since I've seen a movie that captured family dynamics with this much unsparing honesty. It's also been a while since I've seen a Hollywood movie with such a layered understanding of how white supremacy pits people of different backgrounds against each other. That's a concept that feels painfully resonant now in a moment of heightened anti-Semitism and anti-Black racism. And just to make the present-day parallels obvious, Gray throws in a sharp jab at the Trump family, a major presence at Paul's private school. At its heart, though, Armageddon Time is about Paul and Johnny's friendship and how that friendship tragically changes. It's here that things get a little tricky: Some might see Johnny as a regrettable stereotype, the Black character who suffers grievously so that his white friend can learn a hard-hitting lesson. But I think that reading may be too easy, partly because the film is all about the limitations of Paul's perspective, and partly because Gray has no interest in dispensing reassurance or uplift. He's made an angry, despairing movie about one boy's disillusionment with the injustice of the world and his own silent complicity with it. What makes Armageddon Time so powerful is that Gray reserves his harshest anger for himself.",

            "article_content": "If you're a Taylor Swift fan, this was a pretty big week. After more than 15 years as a name in the music industry, Swift has dropped her 10th studio album, Midnights. For all her longevity, it seems that Swift is as big as ever. What is it about her and her music that's so enduring? Host Brittany Luse sat sat down with an avid Swiftie and Rolling Stone writer, Brittany Spanos, who teaches a college course on Swift. They talk about the artist's evolution and how she's navigated the music industry through the years. You can listen to the full episode \u2013 which also features scenes from this year's Bravocon and an interview with Los Espookys creator Julio Torres \u2013 at the top of the page, or on Spotify or Apple Podcasts. These excerpts have been edited for length and clarity. Taylor Swift's multigenerational appeal Brittany Spanos: It's one thing to release albums that still get critical acclaim and still keep your fans happy, that keep you creatively happy. And that's because she's a songwriting nerd. She's a very good songwriter. But I also think she's really attuned to the industry in a way that sometimes makes people distrust her. I think she cares about doing well and she cares about the changes in the industry. She's very in touch with social media. She's an artist who kind of has come up through every possible social media platform you can. She grew her fan base on MySpace. She was using Tumblr way past its prime. Twitter. She's now on TikTok, commenting on people's videos. So she uses all these things in a way that allows her fans to feel like they can really, really connect with her. And that's kept her really relevant. Like I have a 10-year-old sister who is a big fan of hers. Brittany Luse: You're teaching a college class about Taylor Swift. I imagine a lot of your students are Gen Z. What's the Gen Z read on Taylor Swift? Did they have opinions about her before they came to your class? Spanos: Yeah. It was an interesting mix of students for that class... You can either look at her as extremely cringe and her music is kind of corny, or you can be like, \"I relate to this a lot and this is like this speaks to my soul.\" But I think they didn't really understand the cultural history, the sociopolitical and cultural elements that have molded Taylor as a millennial woman because they grew up after that. Luse: Yeah, I was going to say, how much did you have to explain about the era that produced Taylor Swift so they could see her in proper context? Spanos: A lot. One was feminism in pop music. They did not realize that artists did not publicly claim feminism in pop music for a long time. Beyonc\u00e9 doing the VMA performance, I think, was the biggest turning point. Luse: Where she did that whole medley and she had \"feminist\" like emblazoned out on the stage behind her. Spanos: That was a huge turning point in pop music. Taylor, of course, came out of that. And the other was Kanye [West]. They had no context for Kanye, really. They didn't have that heartbreak of losing Kanye because Kanye's been the way he is today for the entirety of their development. Luse: I want to go back to Taylor's positioning as a white woman. Because she puts herself in her work, her privilege, her experiences and her biases show in her approach. Especially in music videos. Like the way she would make brunettes the villains, in the \"White Horse\" video, or \"You Belong with Me.\" In the \"Wildest Dreams\" video, she finally makes the brunette the hero. But then she's romanticizing colonial-era Africa. I want to know what your take is. And again, as a fan, how do you navigate it when she does things like that? Spanos: I think it's hard because she does come from country music. She was on a country label for so long she only had people behind her who were from the country music scene. And the country music scene is historically just geared towards white audiences. There's only a handful of artists of color who have broken through and in that scene. That sort of amplifies the whiteness of Taylor a lot. I also don't think anyone who became famous really young is really smart when it comes to political dynamics in that way. I think that you're sort of blinded very early by a lot of privilege, especially when you're a white artist. So I don't think she even realized how much of a representative of, like, white culture she had become until 2016, until Nazis and white supremacists absorbed her because she was so absent. And because she had not said anything, it was easy for them to just be like, well, she must be on our side. So I don't think she realized that until later because she stopped having those 4th of July parties. She started really speaking out more. I think she just thought she was doing her  little storytelling. Like, I don't think she genuinely knew that that's what was happening. Luse: There's this saying that celebrities are frozen at the age they get famous. And that's kind of what happened for for her. I see this in Taylor Swift's styling. A lot of what she wears and how she presents herself fits perfectly into 2000 mainstream style. All of that is fine. Now, she's one of the most successful pop artists of all time and has access to world-class stylists. It feels to me like she's resistant to looking contemporary, or too fashionable. And I think you can actually see a similar effect across the subjects of her music. A lot of the lyrical content of her two most recent albums were a lot of throwback references that felt very like '40s, '50s, '60s Americana. I wonder if in an attempt to achieve timelessness, that Taylor Swift, in a way, is stuck in time. I mean, that's my read. How does that track for you? Spanos: So she separates her songs into three categories, which is like the nerdiest thing you could do. She has the glitter gel pen songs, quill pen songs and the fountain pen songs. Quill pen songs are like the period piece songs. Like she loves old movies, like period piece type of novels. She loves kind of all that stuff. And a lot of folklore and evermore have songs that are based in a different time. You know, \"The Last Great American Dynasty\" is about the history of the house that she lives in and in Rhode Island. She has like the glitter gel pen songs which are like the, you know, like \"ME!\" and \"You Need to Calm Down\" and the Reputation songs that are very over-the-top pop songs. She has the fountain pen songs that are kind of like the more modern songs like \"All Too Well,\" where it's like stuck in a specific moment. You know, I think that is always going to stand the test of time, is like to be able to craft a really good song. With the styling part of it, I just don't think she's ever cared too much. Luse: But she has she has co-chaired the Met Gala, which I know is kind of like a celebrity event. But still, that's quite an association to have. Spanos: That's an association for sure. that was 2016. That was a moment when she was sort of doing her most experimentation with like high fashion and doing a lot more events than she had ever done. 1989 was about Taylor doing all the things that would make her a pop star in that sphere. And so doing something at the Met gala made sense. I feel like she's stepped back from that. She's never seemed to care too much about doing a lot of high fashion stuff. So it's hard to sort of see that as like her just kind of being stuck in time with that. She's always been really fascinated by the way that teen girls' minds kind of develop these fantasies and develop relationships. She's still unpacking that, what it meant to become famous at a young age. I think every artist is still dealing with that. We see Britney Spears talk about that on Instagram every day still. And I think that's the same thing for Taylor. Luse: When I thought about timeless pop music, I thought immediately of Dolly Parton and Mariah Carey. Those are two people who are very much of their respective times. Dolly Parton's appearance was the butt of many jokes. Mariah Carey's appearance was the butt of many jokes. I mean, I love both of them, so they weren't they weren't jokes for me! But especially with Mariah Carey's resurgence of the past couple of years \u2013 she got [into] the Songwriting Hall of Fame, she released her memoirs. And I think people are taking her seriously in a way that for a while they didn't. I wonder if a part of timelessness is for a period seeming stuck in time, if there's a lull where people almost see you as a joke. And then when you're still doing it in 10 to 15 years, you're iconic. Spanos: Yeah, I mean, every pop star sort of has that one image that is that enduring part of them. If you were to do a police sketch of Dolly Parton, we would all say the same things. It would all look the same. You know, she's changed over the years. But there is like a basic structure to it, right? That's what makes an iconic artist iconic. The people who don't last the test of time you can't do that with.

Ivanka Trump appeared remotely before the Jan. 6 committee on Tuesday morning and spoke with members about the events surrounding the Capitol Hill insurrection into the afternoon, according to the committee chairman. The daughter and onetime adviser to former President Donald Trump  appeared less than a week after her husband Jared Kushner, whose testimony several members said was considered  \"helpful\" to the committee. Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., issued a letter in January seeking Ivanka Trump's voluntary cooperation, after the committee had uncovered new evidence about her activities on the day of the siege, which included multiple attempts to get her father to intervene in the attack. She was the first Trump family member approached by the committee to voluntarily appear. \"She's answering questions \u2014 not in broad chatty terms \u2014 but she's answering questions,\" Thompson told reporters Tuesday afternoon before entering the House chamber for votes. Two sources familiar with the committee's schedule, but not permitted to speak publicly on record, said Trump's interview was slated to start at 10 a.m., meaning she likely met with House members for more than five hours. Thompson also said that Trump had not asserted any privileges. The White House said last week that President Biden would not exert executive privilege over testimony from Trump or Kushner, preventing them from refusing to answer questions with claims of protecting the executive branch's confidentiality. The Trump and Kushner appearances are strong indications the committee is moving its investigation into the former president's inner circle as it approaches the final stages of its probe. Thompson said the two high-profile witnesses were part of a group that were most frequently in former President Trump's orbit. Former President Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka Trump and son Donald Trump Jr. make their way to board Air Force One before departing Marietta, Ga., on Jan. 4, 2021, as the family rallied supporters after Trump's election loss.\n                \n                    \n                    Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former President Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka Trump and son Donald Trump Jr. make their way to board Air Force One before departing Marietta, Ga., on Jan. 4, 2021, as the family rallied supporters after Trump's election loss. According to the committee's January letter, Ivanka Trump heard her father from the Oval Office in the morning of Jan. 6 trying to convince then-Vice President Mike Pence to break with his constitutional duties to fulfill a largely ceremonial role and reject the election's results at the Senate that day. The panel has also obtained evidence from other witnesses showing White House staff had asked for her help to intervene and get her father to tell the rioters to go home. Kushner, also a former White House senior adviser, appeared before the committee last Thursday for more than six hours. Although he wasn't at the White House on Jan. 6, he still revealed some important details, according to Thompson. \"It's helping us find the facts,\" he said. The committee is looking to slow down its current frantic pace of interviewing two to three witnesses day, so it can soon turn its attention to public hearings. Its goal is to issue an interim report this summer, and final report in the fall. Committee members and staff have questioned more than 800 people, on top of compiling reams of documents. Notably, it has interviewed key advisers who surrounded Pence and who have provided critical information on what the former president did in the days and weeks leading up to the deadly attack on Congress.

LONDON \u2014 This was a tumultuous year in the United Kingdom, where the only constant seemed to be change. In one four-month stretch, the U.K. had four chancellors of the exchequer (essentially Britain's treasury secretary), three prime ministers and two monarchs. The year concluded with near-11% inflation and a series of walkouts by nurses, immigration officers, driving test examiners, postal staff and railway workers in the worst strikes the country has seen in more than a decade. \"Lots of my colleagues are really struggling financially,\" said Matthew Lee, a train conductor picketing outside London's King's Cross station earlier this month. \"I want to get back to work, but there comes a point where you have to make a stand and just say: 'That's it.'\" National Health Service workers and supporters gather outside Downing Street to protest during the second day of strike action by NHS nurses on Dec. 20 in London. For the first time in its history, the Royal College of Nursing called its members out on strike in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, over pay and conditions.\n                \n                    \n                    Leon Neal/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption National Health Service workers and supporters gather outside Downing Street to protest during the second day of strike action by NHS nurses on Dec. 20 in London. For the first time in its history, the Royal College of Nursing called its members out on strike in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, over pay and conditions. There were also signs that \u2014 for the first time since leaving the European Union in 2020 \u2014 public opinion has turned sharply against Brexit. More than three-quarters of British firms said the U.K.'s post-Brexit trade deal with Europe is not helping them increase sales, according to a survey by the British Chambers of Commerce. Another survey found 56% of respondents believed it was wrong to leave the European Union, with only 32% still supporting Brexit. The 2016 referendum was supposed to resolve Britain's long, tortured relationship with the European Union, but the question now seems far from settled. A Union flag waves behind a European Union flag outside the Houses of Parliament in London on Oct. 19. The British government denied a report on Nov. 20 that it is seeking a \"Swiss-style\" relationship with the European Union that would remove many of the economic barriers erected by Brexit \u2014 even as it tries to repair ties with the bloc after years of acrimony.\n                \n                    \n                    Alberto Pezzali/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption A Union flag waves behind a European Union flag outside the Houses of Parliament in London on Oct. 19. The British government denied a report on Nov. 20 that it is seeking a \"Swiss-style\" relationship with the European Union that would remove many of the economic barriers erected by Brexit \u2014 even as it tries to repair ties with the bloc after years of acrimony. \"Without any doubt, this sense of regret has become a more prominent feature of British political life,\" says Matthew Goodwin, a political science professor at the University of Kent. \"There will be a growing political pressure to turn this public opinion reality into something at the ballot box ... calling for a much closer relationship with the European Union.\" Some factors that drove this year's tumult were beyond Britain's control, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the queen's death. But many analysts said long-term problems contributed. They include the country's lack of a written constitution and the Conservative Party's selection of leaders, such as Theresa May, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, who promised voters solutions they couldn't deliver. \"Each of them is essentially telling their party and the country that it can \u2014 to use Boris Johnson's phrase \u2014 have its cake and eat it, too, only to discover, 'surprise, surprise' ... that it can't,\" says Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London and author of the upcoming book, The Conservative Party after Brexit. \"I actually don't think ... the U.K. is inherently ungovernable, but I think if you try to govern it on the basis of fantasy, then you're going to eventually get caught.\" Much of this year's dramatic change emanated from the Conservative Party and another major British institution, the royal family. Queen Elizabeth II died in September, followed by 10 days of mourning as the country said goodbye to the only monarch most Britons had ever known. People lined up for miles along the River Thames for the chance to see the queen's casket, which lay in state in the Houses of Parliament. Left: The procession following the coffin of Queen Elizabeth II, aboard the State Hearse, travels up The Long Walk in Windsor on Sept. 19.

King Charles III, 74, did not generate much enthusiasm before his mother's passing. But in polls soon afterward, the percentage of those who thought he would make a good king nearly doubled, from 32% to 63%. December was a rocky month for the royals. Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, dropped a six-part Netflix series in which they criticized members of the royal family, including King Charles, Prince William and even the queen. The family declined to comment and went on with their usual schedule of public events, following something of a royal motto, \"Never complain, never explain.\" The day after the second set of Netflix episodes debuted, King Charles attended a Hanukkah reception at a Jewish community center in London, where he met volunteers making food packages for the needy. In this new war of the Windsors, most of the British public has sided with the royal family. \"Here in the U.K., Harry and Meghan are very much [seen as] the villains of this story,\" says Tom McTague, who writes about Britain for The Atlantic. That said, King Charles faces some long-term challenges. As a privileged white man, there are limits to how much he can represent an increasingly diverse Britain. Sunder Katwala, director of British Future, a think tank that researches issues around race and identity, says the king is wise to reach out to people from different faiths and ethnic backgrounds and show support for a multicultural Britain.

Boris Johnson was forced to announce his resignation as prime minister last summer, after he was caught lying about government staff holding parties when they were banned under the government's own COVID-19 rules. Queen Elizabeth II takes her seat during the funeral of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, in St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on April 17, 2021, in Windsor, England. Prince Philip served as Prince Consort to Queen Elizabeth II until his death on April 9 at age 99. His funeral took place at Windsor Castle with only 30 guests invited due to coronavirus pandemic restrictions.\n                \n                    \n                    Jonathan Brady/WPA Pool via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption One party, which Johnson did not attend, involved a suitcase full of wine and took place the night before the funeral of Prince Philip, the queen's husband, who died in April 2021. The following day, the queen wore a mask and sat alone in a pew, following the rules. The juxtaposition with drunken government parties was politically devastating for Johnson. Members of the Conservative Party chose Foreign Secretary Liz Truss to succeed Johnson in September. One of Truss' first acts was to try to close a massive budget gap with unfunded tax cuts, reminiscent of Reagan-era, trickle-down economics in the United States. The financial markets rebelled and the pound tanked. Truss was forced to resign after about six weeks, becoming the shortest-serving prime minister in British history. She was famously outlasted by a wilting head of lettuce. Left: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivers a farewell address before his official resignation at Downing Street on Sept. 6 in London.

He has calmed the markets and called for tax increases and spending cuts. Political analysts say part of the extraordinary political instability this year is due to the way the major political parties here choose their leaders. In a country of about 67 million people, Truss was elected by just 81,000 Conservative Party members. Patrick Dunleavy, an emeritus professor of politics at the London School of Economics, says rank-and-file party members are not representative of the rest of the country. They are older, whiter, much more conservative and \u2014 he says \u2014 aren't astute judges of politics or economics. \"That is a very good example of what happens when you don't have checks and balances in your constitutional system,\" says Dunleavy. \"Until that's fixed, I don't really think anything much is going to improve in British politics.\" Another problem is the conflict between the party's more conservative membership and more pragmatic parliamentarians. This stretches back to at least the Brexit vote and continues to haunt the party and country. \"You had a referendum in 2016 that provided a surprise result that . . . nobody in parliament expected [and] nobody in parliament wanted,\" says McTague, who is writing a book about the road to Brexit called The Conquest. \"This [was] the most enormous constitutional and economic revolution in British politics and there were no instructions on how to do it.\" Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak leaves 10 Downing St. in central London on Oct. 26 for the House of Commons to take part in his first Prime Minister's Questions. Sunak faced off against opposition lawmakers for the first time as British prime minister, in a raucous parliamentary session following weeks of political turmoil.\n                \n                    \n                    Justin Tallis/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption There was at least one bright spot for the British government this year, as it tried to find a new role on the international stage outside the European Union. The U.K. called out Russia before its invasion of Ukraine and went on to heavily arm and train Ukrainian soldiers. As prime minister, Boris Johnson was wildly popular in Ukraine. Back home, the situation looks considerably tougher for the Conservatives. They are running about 24 percentage points in popularity behind the opposition Labour Party. After a dozen years so far in power, the Tories are expected to lose the next election in 2024. NPR's London producer Morgan Ayre contributed to this story.",

Congressman-elect Maxwell Frost was excited. He thought that for the first few months of living in DC, he'd be couch surfing to save money. But as luck would have it, he found an apartment in Washington, D.C.'s Navy Yard neighborhood with monthly rent he figured he could swing. This week, he went to view the apartment and spent about an hour filling out the application and providing information for a credit check. He also submitted a $50 application fee. There was one thing he was worried about, though. After a year and half of campaigning (and winning, which, having been born in 1997, made him Congress's first elected Generation Z lawmaker), Frost had gotten himself into debt. And, as a result, he had a low credit score. Despite his low credit, Frost, said, the apartment representative said he'd be fine. He wasn't. \"Just applied to an apartment in DC where I told the guy that my credit was really bad. He said I'd be fine. Got denied, lost the apartment, and the application fee. This ain't meant for people who don't already have money,\" Frost tweeted Thursday. Landlords often use credit checks to approve a tenant's rental application. But research has shown that credit scores actually perpetuate racial disparities. Sometimes the information provided in a credit check is even wrong, unfairly costing people an opportunity at housing, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Frost told NPR that he posted his tweet in a moment of frustration, but also to highlight this serious problem of affordability and accessibility in the D.C. political world for people who don't come from wealth. While Frost dealt specifically with a credit rejection, other incoming lawmakers and politicians \u2014especially younger members \u2014 have dealt with Washington's lack of affordable housing in recent years. \"[Frost] just stating this publicly is kind of saying the quiet part out loud and shining a light on a reality that it's incredibly expensive to live in D.C., to be young in D.C., and then maintain it even for members of Congress,\" Casey Burgat, the legislative affairs program director at George Washington University. This lack of affordability has a trickle-down effect, Burgat said. \"It makes Congress exactly what it's been for so long: A disproportionately wealthy, disproportionately white institution,\" Burgat said. \"This is a main contributor for why people can't afford to run for office. It's not seen as a viable path. And though we're getting a little bit better at our diversity, we still have a long way to go and the cost of it is not getting cheaper.\" When Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won in 2018, she also had trouble finding a way to afford an apartment in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Rick Loomis/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption When Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won in 2018, she also had trouble finding a way to afford an apartment in Washington, D.C. Zillow reports that, in Washington, D.C. the median rent is $2,600 \u2014 up $350 from last year's number. The lack of affordable places to rent in major cities is a huge problem nationwide. Rental prices are up 15% from a year ago, Redfin reported in June. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talked about her own trouble with affording housing when she was elected in 2018. She told The New York Times that year, \"I have three months without a salary before I'm a member of Congress. So, how do I get an apartment? Those little things are very real.\" Frost said he's spoken to other members of his freshmen class who similarly have had a hard time finding a place to live. \"It's unfortunate. It's a known issue, especially amongst the more working-class members,\" he said. \"It's definitely a problem.\" Dozens of members of Congress have even turned their Capitol Hill offices into their makeshift apartments. This practice has been criticized as an inappropriate use of taxpayer money \u2014 and potentially uncomfortable for staffers who may catch their bosses in pajamas. On paper, being a politician pays incredibly well, Burgat said. Rank-and-file members make a $174,ooo salary, though there are rules surrounding their investments and how much they can make. But Burgat noted the election season is longer than it used to be, and that it makes it nearly impossible to have a regular full-time job. For Frost's part, he said he had to quit his full-time gig and take up Uber driving to make some money while he campaigned for a year and a half. Even that wasn't enough to keep him out of debt, he said. \"There's no career that supports this type of campaigning, particularly for young people,\" Burgat said. \"It's for people that are able to withstand that financial burden for the amount of time that they have to, and just as we see with Congress itself, the people that are able to do that are disproportionately wealthy and disproportionately white.\" Congressman-elect Maxwell Frost, while he campaigns in Florida.\n                \n                    \n                    GIORGIO VIERA/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Congressman-elect Maxwell Frost, while he campaigns in Florida. Frost noted he's in a privileged place now that he is about to join Congress and will eventually make a good salary. \"In two years, my credit won't necessarily be a huge problem. But, you know, right now it is, and so many people go through this,\" he said. His personal experience has encouraged him to look into solutions for other people in the same boat once he joins Congress in January. \"Bad credit alone shouldn't mean that people have problems finding places to live,\" he said. Some of the things he's hoping to tackle include pushing the federal government to invest in affordable housing in areas of opportunity and to end rental application fees. \"It's known that a lot of these big leasing companies and management companies will tell people with bad credit that it's okay to apply because these application fees for a lot of these companies are actually a source of revenue. And that should not be allowed,\" Frost said. Come January, Frost said he won't be caught sleeping in his office. \"I think self preservation is important,\" he said. \"I think it's important that we have spaces we can go to outside of work.\"",

TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. The House Select Committee investigating the January 6 assault on the Capitol holds its first public hearing tonight. It's at 8 o'clock Eastern and will be shown on most major network and cable news channels. My guest Luke Broadwater has been reporting on the investigations by the committee and the Justice Department into attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. He's a congressional correspondent for The New York Times and is one of the authors of a new article that pulls back and puts together the months-long attempts to declare Trump the winner despite the fact that all the evidence showed he lost. I spoke with Luke Broadwater yesterday morning. Luke Broadwater, welcome back to FRESH AIR. LUKE BROADWATER: Hi, Terry. Thanks for having me. GROSS: When you stand back and look at the big picture, you see that just about every facet of government was involved or pressured to be involved in the effort to overturn the election - the White House, the White House chief of staff, lawyers that were allies of President Trump, members of Congress, the Department of Homeland Security, the military, state houses, election officials as well as far-right radical groups. What am I leaving out? BROADWATER: I think you did a good job of summing everything up. The effort by Donald Trump and his allies to try to overturn the results of the 2020 election was such a sprawling and diffuse effort that it literally did range from local election board officials all the way up to challenges at some of the highest courts in the country. It involved discussions atop the Justice Department about firing, you know, the acting attorney general. It involved attempts to consider seizing voting machines by various federal agencies. It involved high-level discussions among the military about whether the National Guard would be deployed. Donald Trump tried just about everything he could think of to stay in power until ultimately, you know, a mob of his supporters came crashing into the Capitol that dark day two months ago. GROSS: So do you feel like you see a pattern now that you didn't see before? BROADWATER: I think we know a lot more now than we did before. And I think the craziness of the buildup to January 6, which many people probably wrote off at the time as sort of delusional or fanciful thinking among conspiracy-minded people, now looks a lot more serious in retrospect. You can look back now and see things that just seemed crazy at the time and see them now as part of an orchestrated plan to overturn an election and to keep a failed president in power. And we just know a lot more detail now. I mean, there's been, one, the House committee investigation with more than a thousand witnesses interviewed. There's a sprawling Justice Department investigation with more than 800 people charged criminally. There have been books written. There have been thousands of newspaper articles from, you know, our paper, The New York Times, and many other fine journalists and other institutions. So we just - we know so much more now about the buildup to January 6 and what led to this attack on the Capitol than we did in the days right after January 6. GROSS: Who do you think is most likely to face criminal prosecution? BROADWATER: Well, what's happening now is the Justice Department, in my view, is working backwards from January 6. They've charged more than 800 people who were at the riot, and they're going back from sort of the low-level rioters - you know, the people who stormed the Capitol and chanted for - to hang Mike Pence and put their boots up on Nancy Pelosi's desk. And they're going to a level of organization right above them - so the leaders of extremist groups. We've now seen conspiracy and sedition charges against the leaders of the Oath Keepers, a right-wing militia group, and the Proud Boys, another right-wing extremist group. And so now we're talking about planning and execution for how to attack the Capitol and coming prepared in a very strategic way to commit violence. We also know that the Justice Department is moving beyond even those groups. We've been able to obtain some subpoenas they've sent out investigating several of the schemes involving political actors to try to overturn the election. Those include a scheme that we call the fake elector scheme where they are investigating the people who put forward themselves as Trump electors from states won by Joe Biden. And the Justice Department is asking, basically, who put you up to this? And there's a list of lawyers' names involved with the Trump campaign that they want information about. We also know that the subpoenas ask for information about people in the executive branch and people in the legislative branch and also information about the planning of the rallies that brought the mob to Washington, D.C., and ultimately to the Capitol that day. GROSS: Do you think the Justice Department has gotten to the level of Trump yet? BROADWATER: We have not seen an indication that it's gone beyond Trump's personal lawyers. That said, you know, these were people who reported directly to Donald Trump. Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, Cleta Mitchell - these are people who dealt directly with Donald Trump. So if they - and they were essentially carrying out his bidding, his wishes, to try to stay in power. So it's perhaps not an incredible stretch to believe that, you know, anything they're investigating regarding the Trump campaign and its lawyers does tie back to Donald Trump. Of course, he has certain protections, both legally and politically, that perhaps people beneath him do not. And that is - you know, we have no tradition in this country of charging our former presidents. So, you know, I do think there is reluctance within the Justice Department, based on the people I've interviewed, that - to set a new precedent of charging a former president if it came to that. But, you know, Merrick Garland, the attorney general, has repeatedly said they will pursue the investigation wherever it goes and that no one is off-limits. GROSS: The storming of the Capitol is not an isolated event. It's the most dramatic, most documented and most visible and physically threatening part of the larger story, but it's just one part. So how do you see the insurrection as fitting into the larger months-long story and the attempt to overthrow the results of the election? BROADWATER: Well, it's the culmination of everything that came before it. And basically, the Trump campaign had run out of options at that point. At first, they had tried to keep the former president in power through the courts. You know, right away on election night, Donald Trump announces that he won the election, and - despite what the votes say. And so they try lawsuit after lawsuit to try to keep him in power. And that's the legitimate way to do it, right? I mean, these lawsuits were very dubious, and they were bogus. But that is the proper remedy to try to contest an election - is to go to the courts. And they try some 60-plus times and fail each time. Each one of these suits is thrown out. After that happens, they try schemes that are increasingly at odds with norms and standards in the law. So they then come up with this idea that, well, if the courts won't go along with this, it's because they haven't seen the evidence of fraud that we believe exists. And in order to get that evidence of fraud, we need to take control of the voting machines because there must be fraud. So they strategize with a number of theories for how they can take control of various voting machines. Obviously, this is a very dangerous and frightening plan. And at first, we believed it was mainly pushed by people with extreme views. But through reporting, we've been able to determine that Donald Trump himself actually entertained this plan and checked with three different agencies to see if they would carry it out. And each one rejected these attempts to seize voting machines. And so that plan sort of dies in the water once he can't get any of his agency heads to go along with it. GROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Luke Broadwater, a congressional correspondent for The New York Times who's been writing about the investigations by the House Select Committee and the Justice Department into the January 6 assault on the Capitol and the monthslong attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF LITTLE SIMZ SONG, \"OFFENCE\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday morning with Luke Broadwater, a congressional correspondent for The New York Times who's been writing about the investigations by the House Select Committee and the Justice Department into the January 6 assault on the Capitol and the monthslong attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. So when previous efforts to overturn the election failed, then there was the effort to submit fake electors to the Electoral College so that the Biden electors wouldn't be getting to vote; Trump electors would be getting to vote. So tell us how that figures in. BROADWATER: So, yes, after the Trump campaign realizes they cannot win through the courts or through seizing voting machines, they have to come up with a different strategy to keep Donald Trump in power, as that's their goal. And one idea they settle on is to have their lawyers fan out across the country and contact Republicans in seven different battleground states that were all won by Joe Biden and convince them to meet and certify slates of electors for President Trump instead of Joe Biden and then send those slates to the Congress and to the National Archives. But in order for this plan to have any legitimacy, they need the governors of those states or the state legislatures to approve of these slates, to say, yes, in fact, there was a contested election here. We have two slates of electors. We don't know which one is right. Here, Congress, please decide for us. The problem for Donald Trump is no one's willing to go along with that plan. They do get the fake electors to sign these certificates, but no governor and no legislature is willing to meet to sign off on them. So they don't have any legitimacy once they get to Washington. And that's when Donald Trump becomes, one, enraged at those people who won't go along with it. You know, I recall Governor Kemp of Georgia receiving a lot of ire from the president because he would not acquiesce. But then they have to come up with a different way to try to keep him in power, to say, well, maybe we don't need to get governors to sign off on them; maybe we can just have Vice President Mike Pence accept these fake electors and throw out legitimate votes. And that's when the pressure really turns to Mike Pence. GROSS: And Pence decides, like, he can't go forward with that. It's not legal. And he decides that after talking with his lawyers and with former Vice President Dan Quayle. And then Trump gets really angry with Pence and even says - as they're chanting, Mike Pence, even says, maybe they should hang Mike Pence. And we don't know what the tone was when he said that, whether he was saying that in a snarky way or, like, I-really-mean-it kind of way. But it is a demonstration of how angry he was. So how does all of this lead to the actual violence, the actual storming of the Capitol, the insurrection on January 6? Like, where does that fit in to the larger story? Like, connect the dots to that explosion. BROADWATER: Yes. So the only reason to have a crowd assembled in Washington on January 6 is to put pressure on Congress and on Mike Pence specifically to overturn the election. There's never a rally on January 6 any other year. The purpose of that was to bring a crowd to D.C. and to the Capitol. So the very fact that they've assembled this crowd of thousands creates a sort of very hostile political environment where angry people are being told the election was stolen from them, and they're being directed to put pressure on those people inside that building. And Donald Trump directs the crowd to march towards the Capitol that day. Now, when does it get violent? That is a question of substantial investigation. And how much planning went into the violence? And what we know now is that several militia groups and hundreds of people did, in fact, plan to commit violence that day. There's a lot of testimony that federal prosecutors have. There are a lot of guilty pleas coming out of the various court cases where - there were some people, obviously, who did get caught up with the mob, caught up in the moment. Maybe they didn't come to D.C. that day to commit violence against anyone. But there were people there who did have that plan, and they believed they were carrying out Donald Trump's orders. If you look at - and I believe the January 6 committee, at the hearings, will play this out in great detail. But there's sort of a call-and-response dynamic going on between Donald Trump - his public statements and his tweets in particular - and then how the mob and the violent actors respond to them. For instance, Donald Trump's tweet on December 19 where he says - he encourages people to come to D.C. and he says it's going to be wild, that really sets in motion the entire rally. Before that, there were no permits filed. There were no travel plans to D.C. All of the sudden, you see thousands of actors immediately going to work. GROSS: Oh, and didn't the right-wing groups, like, amplify that? BROADWATER: Absolutely, yeah. They spread it around immediately. GROSS: Through social media. BROADWATER: Rally planners have started to file permits. Message boards exploded with this as their call to arms. And, you know, different people have wanted to overthrow the current system of government for years in America. And these people now saw this as their chance. They had a direction from the sitting president, who they loved, to do this, and so they got to work. And if you look at a lot of the guilty pleas in the various court cases, many of these people are saying, we attacked the Capitol because we believe that's what Donald Trump wanted us to do. I stormed the building because I believed Donald Trump when he told me the election was stolen and democracy was on the line, and I was fighting for American elections. So they have - it has this great effect over the crowd. Now, I think the thing that both congressional investigators and the Department of Justice are interested in is whether there's anything more than what happened to publicly. Was there any internal planning or any acquiescence to the idea that violence might be useful? And that's why I think the 187 minutes of inaction that the committee plans to dig into... GROSS: Trump's inaction, Trump just, like, not doing anything to say, stop the violence. He just watched it on TV and did nothing for 3 hours? BROADWATER: Yes. So on January 6, for more than three hours, it's believed Donald Trump did nothing to stop the violence. And we're going to hear testimony probably at one of the later hearings about people imploring him to do something to stop the violence and Trump seeming to, one, not want to do that and, two, perhaps enjoy it. And, you know, we reported in The New York Times recently about this testimony the committee has where Donald Trump said maybe they should hang Mike Pence. And so he did not react with horror once he heard what the crowd was doing, according to testimony the committee has. But he reacted with approval. So - and I would note that we put that statement to Trump's spokesman for comment. And he attacked the committee for leaks, but he did not deny the contents of that statement. So also that day, Donald Trump tweets out that - while the Capitol is under siege, that Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do the right thing. So he continued to encourage the anger among the mob publicly as the violent assault was happening. GROSS: So one of the things that you've learned recently has to do with Marc Short's role, and Marc Short was the chief of staff for Vice President Mike Pence. So how does Marc Short figure into the larger story now? BROADWATER: Yes. One of the things we've learned - and Marc Short told the committee this - was that in the - during the pressure campaign on Mike Pence, Marc Short had become so concerned with what Donald Trump was doing to Mike Pence that the day before January 6, he went to a Secret Service agent assigned to Pence and told him that he believed President Trump was going to turn on Pence that next day and it would create a security risk for the vice president. And so here's someone - and sure enough, that, in fact, did happen. You know, rioters stormed the building chanting, hang Mike Pence. So here's someone who could see what was happening within Donald Trump's mindset and his actions and what he was doing to Mike Pence and raised an alarm about it. And I think that's a very significant development in terms of Donald Trump's planning and mindset headed into January 6 and that it was perhaps not just a spontaneous event, but that there were some dark themes at play there. GROSS: Well, let's take a break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Luke Broadwater, a congressional correspondent for The New York Times who's been writing about investigations by the House select committee and the Justice Department into the January 6 assault and the monthslong attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. We'll be right back after a break. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF JEFF PARKER'S \"SEA CHANGE\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday morning with Luke Broadwater, a congressional correspondent for The New York Times who's been writing about the investigations by the House select committee and the Justice Department into the January 6 assault on the Capitol and the months-long attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. So Jim Jordan is one of the people trying to discredit the House committee investigating January 6. If the Republicans win in the midterms and take back the House, Jordan will end up heading the judiciary committee. What has been his role in the efforts to overturn the election and in January 6? BROADWATER: So right away, after Donald Trump loses, Jim Jordan immediately begins strategizing with top Trump officials, including the chief of staff, Mark Meadows, about what they can do to seed doubt among the electorate to try to keep Trump in power. Jordan begins forwarding emails about January 6 and about how Congress could vote to keep Trump in power on January 6 using sort of novel legal theories that had not been explored before. He also starts meeting and planning out a communication strategy where they will seek to discredit the election and, you know, rile up the base, so to speak, to believe Donald Trump really won. If he is judiciary chairman, he plans to launch a series of investigations into Democrats that would serve, in some people's view, as payback for the subpoena that he has received from the January 6 committee. He plans to investigate, you know, Hunter Biden's laptop. The - Dr. Fauci in particular will be a target of his and various other avenues of investigation. And as of right now, it does look like Republicans have the momentum on their side to take back the House. Most pollsters who have looked at the battleground data will say that Republicans are in line to retake the House and, perhaps, pick up as many as 20 or 30 seats. So it's very possible that Jim Jordan, who did receive a subpoena from the January 6 committee and was involved in the strategies to overturn the election, will be the new House judiciary chairman. GROSS: And he hasn't complied with the subpoena, right? BROADWATER: He has not. He - the Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy, and several other Republican members of Congress have essentially refused to meet with the committee. They were asked for voluntary interviews at first. They refused those. Then they were issued subpoenas. And what Jordan did was, rather than flatly refuse to comply with the subpoena, he issued a series of demands on the committee, including turning over voluminous documents to him, before he would agree to an interview. And those demands made it so onerous on the committee that it was essentially a refusal. The committee has not yet said how they will respond to this refusal. But as of right now, they have no testimony from Jim Jordan or any of the House Republicans about their role in the fight to overturn the election. GROSS: What do Republicans want to investigate about Fauci? BROADWATER: Yeah. So they think he misled the public on - about the lab leak, about whether the coronavirus was originated from a lab or originated elsewhere naturally. They think that he lied to the American people multiple times. They - basically, they think he is a target to - for them to - they think he's unpopular with their base. They think he is someone who they don't like. He doesn't like them. And they're going to try to vilify him. GROSS: A significant portion of the first hearing will focus on the Proud Boys - of the first public hearing by the House select committee. The Proud Boys are a far-right group. Five members, including the former leader, Enrique Tarrio, were indicted on Monday of seditious conspiracy. What does that mean, and why is it so consequential? BROADWATER: Well, it gets beyond the idea that this was a spontaneous attack, that it was just a mob that got out of control - people got too excited that day. This gets to, actually, the planning of, essentially, political violence. The one thing that's interesting for me to look at, and I think the committee as well, is the connections that the Proud Boys have to Republican politics, and connecting the violent extremists and the militia groups with the Republican Party and Republican political actors. So for instance, Enrique Tarrio and some of the Proud Boys are members of Latinos for Trump. So they were sort of brought into the Trump campaign as a way to motivate supporters and get certain voting blocs to support the president. At the same time, these same people, according to federal prosecutors, are planning a seditious attack on the government. So you have - and I think you see a similar thing with the Oath Keepers, where you have the Oath Keepers providing security for Roger Stone, an ally of Donald Trump. And then those same Oath Keepers are seen as part of a very organized force marching into the Capitol that day. So you're seeing an overlap between people in Republican politics and also people as part of these militia or right-wing extremist groups. And I think we're going to see a lot of exploring and investigation of those themes at these hearings. GROSS: Yeah. Well, the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers are becoming very closely aligned and kind of intermeshed with part of the Republican Party. So for instance, in Miami-Dade County, the Proud Boys - several Proud Boys have become part of local politics. About a half a dozen current and former members of the Proud Boys have seats on the Miami-Dade Republican Executive Committee. Has anything like that happened before, where people from such a far-right group have become embedded in the Republican establishment of local politics? BROADWATER: It really is a shocking development. I mean, we're talking about a chapter of the Republican Party, which was once a stronghold of the Bush family, now has five current or former Proud Boys involved. But we're seeing more and more of this, Terry, across the country. The leader of the Republican Party in Wyoming, a fierce opponent of Liz Cheney, is a member of the Oath Keepers. I did a story shortly after the attack on the Capitol where I looked at members of Congress and their connections to these militia groups. And it actually isn't very hard to find examples where members of Congress go to Proud Boy meetings or go to Oath Keeper meetings or go to joint events or have the Oath Keepers provide security for them or the Proud Boys provide security for them. So it is very much - it has been allowed and perhaps even encouraged to bring in these militia groups and bring in these extremist groups into the right flank of the Republican Party. And to the extent now that we're seeing they're taking seats of power and seats of positions on various state and local boards, I think that, you know, most people would be concerned by that. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Luke Broadwater, a congressional correspondent for The New York Times. We'll be right back after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF KYLE EASTWOOD'S \"SAMBA DE PARIS\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Luke Broadwater, a congressional correspondent for The New York Times who's been writing about the investigations by the House select committee and the Justice Department into the January 6 assault on the Capitol and the monthslong attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. So, you know, in the sedition case against the Proud Boys, prosecutors say that a week before the attack, one of Enrique Tarrio's girlfriends - and again, he was a former leader of the Proud Boys - that the girlfriend gave him a document titled \"1776 Returns\" and that that had a detailed plan to monitor and storm government buildings near the Capitol on January 6, but it didn't mention the Capitol itself. And there were other references in texts to and from Tarrio referring to 1776. And one of them, a text back and forth between Tarrio and a Proud Boy member from North Carolina, made a reference not only to 1776, but to the Winter Palace. What is the significance of 1776 and the Winter Palace in the context of these communications? BROADWATER: Well, those are two, of course, you know, historic references - one to the Russian Revolution and the other to the American Revolution. And so I think prosecutors saw those as demonstrating the mindset that Enrique Tarrio and the Proud Boys had going into January 6 where they're talking specifically about historic events and where - in which there were, you know, overthrows of what people believed were authoritarian regimes. And so whether you're looking at American history or Russian history, that was the plan and the mindset of the Proud Boys headed into January 6. GROSS: So that can be used as evidence, that the Proud Boys wanted to overthrow the government. BROADWATER: Yes. And I mean, it - and it's not just beyond the language. It's beyond what was actually in the plans where they were talking about taking over various government buildings around the Capitol that day. So, you know, we'll see how the defense responds to these allegations. But it does seem like there's a plan here written down about taking over government buildings that is using language of a revolution. GROSS: What does sedition literally mean legally? BROADWATER: Sedition under a federal statute is - can be applied to people who advocate the overthrow of the federal government by force. So you have to have the intent to overthrow the government, and then you have to have the plan to do it by force. So it can't just be someone who's, you know, ranting against the government in their home office. They have to actually take some steps to carry this out violently. GROSS: Do the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers and other militia groups subscribe to the great replacement theory, that Jews and Black people and immigrants are trying to replace or will succeed in replacing white people and this will irreparably damage America? We will no longer recognize America. BROADWATER: Well, I can't speak for all the members of those groups, but we do know that the great replacement theory has been pushed by leaders in the Republican Party usually under the framing that this is about political power. So you look at an ad Elise Stefanik ran regarding immigration. She very much played on this replacement theory idea, that Democrats were encouraging immigrants to come into the country to take away the votes of the real American, so to speak. And it's not too hard to realize the code that they're talking in there, which is to sort of scare white people, that their votes are being taken away by immigrants. Obviously, this was something the mass shooter in Buffalo believed in. And so after that mass shooting, there was a lot of scrutiny on things that Republican leaders are saying but also Republican pundits and people on Fox News, what they're saying and how this has spread out among the masses. You know, one thing we did see on January 6 is we saw a lot of racist imagery at the Capitol, people flying racist flags and wearing racist T-shirts. And, you know, it was very much intertwined with the racism that we saw that day as well as just trying to keep Donald Trump in power. GROSS: Do you think it's fair to say that it's a mistake to think of January 6 as something that happened in the past but rather something that's continuing in terms of the ambitions of the far-right wing of the Republican Party? BROADWATER: I think it's still a threat, particularly as you look at what's happening at some of the state boards and in some of the elections around the country. We know that, basically, our democratic institutions are only as good as the people who occupy the seats of power. You can have a law that says one thing, but you need people to actually enforce that law. And what we saw around the country during the runup to January 6 was a lot of people in local office who actually stood up to a pressure campaign from Donald Trump and his allies. Donald Trump was calling people directly. Rudy Giuliani was calling people directly. And if they could have gotten a few more boards in various seats in the country to refuse to certify a legitimate election for Joe Biden, they perhaps could have stolen it. And so if they're able to win some races, put in people who are just simply loyal to Trump no matter what the vote says, we could have a very - I think we could have a great - a very great threat to democracy in the next election if we don't have people in positions who are willing to follow the will of the voters instead of the will of Trump. GROSS: Well, let's take another break here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Luke Broadwater, a congressional correspondent for The New York Times. We'll be right back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF BENJI MERRISON AND WILL SLATER'S \"BETWEEN FEEDS/AMOROUS PEACOCK\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Luke Broadwater, a congressional correspondent for The New York Times who's been writing about the investigations by the House Select Committee and the Justice Department into the January 6 assault on the Capitol and the month-long attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. John Eastman, who is one of the lawyers allied with Trump - he was one of the architects of the fake electors scheme or schemes. And in March, a federal judge in California ruled in a civil case that Eastman had likely conspired with Trump to obstruct Congress and defraud the U.S. by helping devise and promote the alternate elector scheme and presenting plans to Mike Pence suggesting he could exercise his discretion over which slates of electors to accept or reject at the January 6 certification. So the judge wrote that this scheme was, quote, \"a coup in search of a legal theory,\" unquote. So what does that ruling mean? Where does it go from there? Is that ruling being appealed? Like, what weight does that ruling carry? BROADWATER: Well, so functionally what that ruling did was it caused John Eastman to have to turn over documents to the committee. John Eastman had sued the committee trying to block its subpoenas. One of the things John Eastman said is these documents are covered by attorney-client privilege. And that's a legitimate argument for lawyers of a person to say, well, I cannot divulge communications with my client. That said, the committee responded to that by arguing that attorney-client privilege is only valid if there's no crime committed. So there's something - there's an exception called the crime-fraud exception. And what that means is, essentially, a lawyer can't, you know, launder drug money for a client or carry out some sort of crime for the client. And they argued, essentially, that John Eastman and Donald Trump had been plotting to commit a crime by what they were doing with regards to January 6, and a judge agreed. The judge said, looking at all the evidence, that the documents John Eastman was trying to protect, at least some of them, would fall under the crime-fraud exception and that it was more likely than not that Trump and Eastman had violated two federal felonies. One was conspiring to defraud the American people, and the second was obstructing a official proceeding of Congress. So, you know, in terms of - functionally, it just means John Eastman had to turn over documents, but it did send a huge message to the committee and, I think, to law offices across the country, including the Justice Department, that - here you have a sitting federal judge say, I've looked at the facts. I've looked at the evidence. I've applied a civil standard, and I believe that there were crimes committed here. So if you were looking for a test about whether anyone in the judicial mindset believed that January 6 and the buildup to it was a crime, it was a pretty dramatic moment when that decision came down. GROSS: Have you seen compelling evidence that Trump was directly involved in plans to overturn the election and committed acts that could be called sedition? Whether he's actually charged with that or not, 'cause it's tricky to indict a former president, what is the most compelling evidence that you've seen of criminal activity or sedition, which is criminal, that Trump was involved in? BROADWATER: So the evidence that I've seen of crimes, I think, were most clearly laid out by that federal judge in California, where he said - essentially, what happened was the plan to overturn the election through the fake electors scheme at first started as sort of an academic exercise where people were looking at old federal codes and old elections and saying, well, what if we did this? And what if we did that? But eventually, it became an actual plan of action. And at that moment, once they started strategizing about how to disrupt the official counting of documents to put - to certify an election for the person chose by the voters, once that became an action plan, that that was an actual crime. And one of the things the House committee has done is they have documented how, time and time again, Donald Trump was told by top advisers both within the Justice Department and the White House counsel's office that his claims of fraud were not true. And so - but he kept repeating them anyway to, one, try to stay in power and, two, rile up his supporters. And so what they're arguing and what a judge agreed is this amounted to a fraud on the American people. And so if either of those crimes, either conspiracy to commit fraud or disrupting an official proceeding of Congress, could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, then those would be your elements of a criminal case. I have not seen the committee make the case for a sedition charge against Donald Trump. We know that sedition is being charged against, you know, some of the domestic violent extremists. But I have not heard talk about that charge being applied to President Trump. GROSS: You know, in the past, the attempts to prove criminal activity in the White House have failed. I mean, the Mueller report - everybody was saying, oh, the Mueller report, that's going to, like, blow the roof off. And it didn't. And there were, really, no consequences for Americans. And, you know, there have been other investigations, and nothing's really come of it. So what do you think the odds are that either the January 6 committee or the Justice Department investigation will actually lead to any people being held responsible for what happened? BROADWATER: Yeah, it's a good question. It does - you know, I think a lot of Democrats look at the Trump presidency, and they saw outrage after outrage. And they cannot understand why he wasn't thrown out of office or put in jail. And, you know, there have been numerous congressional investigations into that. I do think here, though, we have some pretty damning evidence that the Justice Department can use as they make their way up the ranks. Will that ever happen? Will they ever get into the Trump White House or the Trump campaign? Will they move beyond the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers? I don't know. I can't make those predictions. But we do know at least one federal judge has said there were crimes committed by the president. And if that's any guide, there's a potential that the Justice Department could follow that lead and pursue those crimes even higher.

            "article_content": "2022 was a tumultuous year in the United Kingdom when the leaders of two major British institutions exited the stage. What does 2023 hold for the U.K.?  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: 2022 has been a tumultuous year for the United Kingdom, marked by major changes at the top of British institutions. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HUW EDWARDS: A few moments ago, Buckingham Palace announced the death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. SHAPIRO: This was also the year that No. 10 Downing Street became a revolving door, as the country had three prime ministers in less than two months. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: After one of the most dramatic weeks in British politics, Boris Johnson was forced out of the top job after nearly 60 MPs quit his government. SHAPIRO: And now, as December runs out, the U.K. faces a series of strikes by immigration officers, nurses, postal workers and rail workers. To explain what happened in Britain this year, NPR's London correspondent, Frank Langfitt, is here. Hi, Frank. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: The departures of the queen and Boris Johnson were obviously very different events involving two very different characters. But I want to talk about the impact of these two larger-than-life figures leaving the stage, beginning with the queen. LANGFITT: Yeah. You know, Ari, the queen - as you know because you covered the United Kingdom - the death of the queen creates this big vacuum. She was more popular than the monarchy itself and much more popular than her son, King Charles, who's now 74. And so the royal family now sort of faces this generational challenge, how to remain relevant when it's most popular and unifying leader is no longer there. SHAPIRO: And how would you rate the first three months of King Charles' reign? LANGFITT: You know, he's doing better than expected. And I would say, Ari, as you know, expectations were not that high in September, but we've seen a jump in support, in part because simply he's now king. So soon after his mother's death, the percentage of people who thought he would make a good king has nearly doubled from 32% to 63% in one poll. Now, you know, this month has been rockier for the royals. Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, the duchess of Sussex, they dropped that six-part Netflix series that some people might have seen. And there was - a lot of it was spent criticizing the royal family. SHAPIRO: Yeah, I've heard a lot of discourse about that series. How did the royal family respond to it? LANGFITT: You know, Ari, it was kind of classic royal family. They didn't respond. They sort of went along business as usual. The day after the final three episodes dropped, King Charles - he visited a Jewish community center in London. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Singing in non-English language). LANGFITT: And here he is dancing with Holocaust survivors, including the stepsister of Anne Frank, which, in a way, was kind of the royal family's response, which is, you know, when it comes to criticism, sometimes they think the best thing that they can do is just do their jobs. SHAPIRO: Dancing to a tune from \"Fiddler On The Roof\" there. So the king is enjoying a bit of a honeymoon in the polls. But what is the likelihood that such a privileged white old man can represent an increasingly diverse country like the U.K.? LANGFITT: Well, Ari, there are clear limits as you point out. I mean, that said, I was talking to a guy named Sunder Katwala. He's the director of British Future. It's this think tank that looks at issues of race and identity. And he says he thinks Charles is making the right kind of steps. He's reaching out to people from different faith and ethnic backgrounds, just like what you saw there at that community center in London, and showing support for a more multicultural Britain. Here's Katwala. SUNDER KATWALA: For the king to be a source of bridging or unity, he's actually got to be more proactive. I think by getting out and showing that the crown wants to be a source of cohesion in British society when our politics are quite divisive and quite clashing and quite polarizing will be well received by quite a lot of people. SHAPIRO: OK. So let's talk about those divisive, clashing, polarizing politics. It was only a few years ago that the British political brand was steady, predictable governance. How's that going? LANGFITT: Really badly, Ari. Boris Johnson, of course, forced from office over the summer, and the reason was he was known - well-known in the country for lying often throughout his career. But he lied to Parliament about these parties that were banned by his government's own COVID rules during a partial lockdown. Now, after Johnson resigned, members of the Conservative Party, they chose Liz Truss. She tried to solve what is a $67 billion budget gap by lowering taxes. The markets rebelled. The pound tanked. And this is how Britain's ITV described the situation at the time. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TOM BRADBY: It has been a night of astonishing scenes at Westminster, with reports of jostling, manhandling, bullying and shouting outside the parliamentary lobbies in a supposed vote of confidence in the government. In short, it is total, absolute, abject chaos. LANGFITT: Now, Ari, as probably a lot of people would remember, Truss was actually forced out after just about six weeks. That's the shortest tenure of a prime minister in British history. And she famously did not outlast a wilting head of lettuce. It was shown in a parody online video stream. Now enter Rishi Sunak. He's the new prime minister, former chancellor of the Exchequer, has a better finance background and sort of a more realistic approach. He's talking about major tax increases and spending cuts. The Conservative Party, they're now still about 20 points behind the Labour Party, and there's an election probably going to be in 2024. The Conservatives are still expected to lose that, and that would be after 14 years in power. SHAPIRO: So how do you explain the revolving door that No. 10 Downing Street became and what that tells us about the ruling Conservative Party in British politics? LANGFITT: Well, you know, the real questions here, Ari, about how the party chooses its leader. Remember, Truss was elected by just 81,000 Conservative Party members, and this is in a country of 67 million people. Patrick Dunleavy is an emeritus professor of politics that I know at the London School of Economics. And he says, you know, rank-and-file party members in the Conservative Party, they tend to skew older, and they're not representative of the country, nor does he think they're particularly good judges of politics or economics. This is how he put it. PATRICK DUNLEAVY: You know, the whole incident of Liz Truss coming into power, appointing a not very well-known person as chancellor, pushing through a whole series of unfunded tax cuts and a budget without any economic forecasts and then having to tear it all up within four weeks, that is a very good example of what happens when you don't have checks and balances in your constitutional system. LANGFITT: And there's this other conflict between more conservative membership of the party and more pragmatic parliamentarians. And this goes back to at least the Brexit vote. Here's Tom McTague, who writes about British politics for The Atlantic. TOM MCTAGUE: Referendum in 2016 that provided a surprise result that the government did not expect - nobody in Parliament expected, nobody in Parliament wanted. And so they were left holding this baby that they didn't know what to do with. SHAPIRO: It's really striking, Frank, how often talk of British politics returns to the impact of Brexit. It's been just about three years now. How is it going? LANGFITT: Not well, Ari. You know, there was a recent survey. More than three-quarters of firms say the U.K.'s post-Brexit deal with Europe isn't helping them in terms of increasing sales. There's another survey - 56% of people now say it was a mistake to leave the European Union, with only 32% still supporting Brexit. I was talking to Matthew Goodwin. He's a political science professor at the University of Kent. And here's what he says the country's in store for. MATTHEW GOODWIN: Without any doubt, this sense of regret has become a more prominent feature of British political life. There will be a growing political pressure to turn this public opinion reality into something at the ballot box, calling for a much closer relationship with the European Union. SHAPIRO: So, Frank, are there any silver linings to all of these clouds that you've been describing? LANGFITT: Yeah, there is one, I'd say, prominently, and that is after leaving the EU, the United Kingdom was once again kind of looking for a place on the international stage. And it found one in the war in Ukraine, pouring a lot of weapons into Ukraine, training Ukrainian soldiers here in England and really taking a really robust position on one of the major events of the year. SHAPIRO: So what are you looking ahead to in 2023? LANGFITT: I think it's going to be interesting to see what happens with King Charles' coronation. That's going to be in May. And it's an opportunity to rally the country around, you know, a new monarch. Rishi Sunak's made it really clear that he wants to work with the royal family to improve the U.K.'s image during the coronation. And he and the royals, I think, hope to put this year behind them. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Frank Langfitt in London. I hope your new year is quieter and calmer than the old one. LANGFITT: Thanks, Ari. You, too. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

ATLANTA \u2014 A judge on Wednesday ordered former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to testify before a special grand jury that's investigating whether then-President Donald Trump and his allies illegally tried to influence the state's 2020 election. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis opened the investigation early last year into actions taken by Trump and others to overturn his loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Meadows is one of a number of high-profile associates and advisers of the Republican former president whose testimony Willis has sought. Because Meadows doesn't live in Georgia, Willis, a Democrat, had to use a process that involves getting a judge where he lives in South Carolina to order him to appear. She filed a petition in August seeking to compel his testimony. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who's overseeing the special grand jury, signed off on the petition, certifying that Meadows is a \"necessary and material witness\" for the investigation. Circuit Court Judge Edward Miller in Pickens County, South Carolina, honored McBurney's finding and ordered Meadows to testify, Willis spokesman Jeff DiSantis confirmed. Meadows attorney James Bannister could not immediately be reached for comment. Meadows is a key witness as the special grand jury investigates whether Trump and his allies sought to illegally influence the election. The former GOP congressman was at the very center of Trump's plans to overturn his presidential election defeat. Meadows traveled to Georgia, sat in on Trump's phone calls with state officials and coordinated and communicated with the many outside influencers who were either encouraging or discouraging the then-president's pressure campaign. In the petition seeking Meadows' testimony, Willis wrote that Meadows attended a Dec. 21, 2020, meeting at the White House with Trump and others \"to discuss allegations of voter fraud and certification of electoral college votes from Georgia and other states.\" The next day, Willis wrote, Meadows made a \"surprise visit\" to Cobb County, just outside Atlanta, where an audit of signatures on absentee ballot envelopes was being conducted. He asked to observe the audit but wasn't allowed to because it wasn't open to the public, the petition says. Meadows also sent emails to Justice Department officials after the election alleging voter fraud in Georgia and elsewhere and requesting investigations, Willis wrote. And he participated in a Jan. 2, 2021, phone call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, during which Trump suggested the state's top elections official, also a Republican, could \"find\" enough votes to overturn his narrow election loss in the state. In a court filing this week, Bannister argued that executive privilege and other rights shield his client from testifying. Bannister asserted in the filing that Meadows has been instructed by Trump \"to preserve certain privileges and immunities attaching to his former office as White House Chief of Staff.\" Willis' petition calls for him \"to divulge the contents of executive privileged communications with the President,\" Bannister wrote. Meadows previously invoked that privilege in a fight against subpoenas issued by the U.S. House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The House held Meadows in contempt of Congress for defying the subpoena, but the Justice Department declined to prosecute. Special grand juries in Georgia cannot issue indictments. Instead, they can gather evidence and compel testimony and then can recommend further action, including criminal charges, in a final report. But it is ultimately up to the district attorney to decide whether to seek an indictment from a regular grand jury. Bannister argued that the special grand jury proceedings do not qualify as a criminal proceeding under the South Carolina law that governs out-of-state subpoena requests and that Meadows cannot be compelled to testify in a civil inquiry. Because he has no testimony to offer, he cannot be considered a \"material witness,\" the filing argues. Grand jury secrecy is \"paramount\" in South Carolina, Bannister wrote. Because the special grand jury is expected to ultimately issue a public report and the paperwork seeking Meadows' testimony was publicly filed, it is contrary to South Carolina grand jury secrecy provisions and that would violate his state right to privacy, Bannister argued. McBurney, the Fulton County Superior Court judge, has made clear in ruling on other attempts by potential witnesses to avoid or delay testimony that he considers the special grand jury's investigation to be a criminal proceeding. He has also stressed the need for the secrecy of the panel's workings.",

Lawyers for Dominion Voting Systems indicate they intend to use Scott's words against Fox in its $1.6 billion defamation suit against the network.\n                \n                    \n                    Fox News\n                    \n                \nhide caption Fox News Media CEO Suzanne Scott warned colleagues not to \"give the crazies an inch\" after then-President Donald Trump and his allies pressured the network. Lawyers for Dominion Voting Systems indicate they intend to use Scott's words against Fox in its $1.6 billion defamation suit against the network. Besieged by angry viewers, denounced by then-President Trump, questioned by some of its own stars, Fox News found itself in a near-impossible spot on Election Night 2020 after its election-analysis team announced before any other network that Joe Biden would win the pivotal swing state of Arizona. Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott proved so flummoxed by what ensued that she warned colleagues, \"We can't give the crazies an inch.\" That's according to the account of a lawyer for Dominion Voting Systems, which is seeking $1.6 billion from Fox in a defamation suit over false allegations on the network that the company committed election fraud. A trial date is set for April in Delaware. The voting machine and technology company's attorney, Justin Nelson, revealed Scott's remarks in a court proceeding earlier this week, in which he argued that Dominion's legal team is entitled to receive the employment contracts of 13 Fox News executives, including Scott. She has served as CEO since 2018. (Dominion is also suing Fox Corp., the network's parent company.) In a ruling Wednesday, Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric M. Davis affirmed that Dominion should receive the contracts \u2014 the point of contention in the hearing. For days after the election, Trump and his top aides demanded the network rescind its announcement of Biden's victory in Arizona, even pressuring the network's controlling owners, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch. In the weeks that followed, a cadre of Fox News stars hosted Trump's advisers \u2014 and even Trump himself \u2014 to peddle baseless conspiracy theories of election fraud. Many of those false claims asserted without evidence that Dominion's technology and machines had been used to rig the vote and to cheat Trump out of the White House. According to Nelson's remarks at the hearing, senior Fox News executives interceded to try to block Fox Business stars Lou Dobbs and Maria Bartiromo from having Trump's campaign attorneys, Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani, on their shows to repeat such lies. In late 2020, Dobbs and Bartiromo hosted Trump's advocates to make those accusations. In December 2020, Fox Business host Lou Dobbs suggested to viewers that Republicans who voted to certify President-elect Joe Biden's win were \"criminal.\" Off the air, according to an attorney for Dominion, Fox News executives sought to block Dobbs and Maria Bartiromo from inviting two of then-President Donald Trump's attorneys on their shows.\n                \n                    \n                    John Lamparski/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption In December 2020, Fox Business host Lou Dobbs suggested to viewers that Republicans who voted to certify President-elect Joe Biden's win were \"criminal.\" Off the air, according to an attorney for Dominion, Fox News executives sought to block Dobbs and Maria Bartiromo from inviting two of then-President Donald Trump's attorneys on their shows. Fox's attorney, Justin Keller, did not dispute the remarks attributed by Nelson to Fox News CEO Scott. Nor did he deny that executives sought to intervene in the two programs' efforts to book Powell and Giuliani even though their claims had been discredited. Instead, he made a broader argument against allowing scrutiny of the executives' contracts, saying that was unnecessary given how many documents the network has already turned over to Dominion. Fox News and its chief trial attorney, Dan Webb, declined to comment for this article, as did Dominion's lawyers. However, the arguments that played out during a hearing Tuesday reflected a looking-glass world: Dominion depicted the network's executives as scrambling to rein in the chaos engendered by its stars, while Fox's attorneys were effectively arguing the executives had little time, ability or inclination to do so. In his exchanges with the judge, Keller, the Fox attorney, drew a line distinguishing between a host or producer \"who are sometimes pre-scripting material for the show that is going to be tethered to a specific channel's telecast\" and a network executive. \"That person is going to be far removed from the day-to-day operations of editorial control and discretion over the particular channel's telecast,\" he said. Beyond Scott, the executives whose contracts are being sought include Jay Wallace, Fox News' president and executive editor, and Meade Cooper, the executive vice president of primetime programming. Nelson, the Dominion attorney, retorted by citing a document obtained from Fox that \"talks about the daily editorial meeting that occurs, including almost all of these executives that we're looking at right now.\" Dominion appears to be drilling down on its argument \u2014 hotly disputed by Fox \u2014 that the network's executives knowingly allowed such false conspiracies to air on its programs to boost their audiences because their pro-Trump viewers had abandoned them after the Arizona call. Under U.S. Supreme Court rulings, Dominion has to prove Fox demonstrated \"actual malice\" to win a defamation case. That means either knowingly broadcasting false and damaging information, or doing so with reckless disregard for the truth. \"Fox sought to profit off a lie. That's the allegation,\" Judge Davis summarized. \"Whether that's true or not, we'll stay for the trial.\" In their new book on Trump, The Divider, journalists Peter Baker and Susan Glasser reveal that Fox anchor Bret Baier cited intense pressure from Trump's team to explore whether and under what circumstances the Arizona call could be reversed. Fox did not withdraw its projection. The authors also reported that Wallace, the head of news, overruled his election-analysis desk and instructed his anchors to not announce that Biden had won Nevada, too. What ensued involved a split screen. Fox became the last network to project Biden's win of the presidency despite being the first to make the Arizona call that proved accurate. And while its reporters often unraveled election fraud allegations, many of Fox's biggest stars tolerated, amplified and even embraced them, Dominion's lawyers noted. No one at Fox would directly comment on Baker and Glasser's assertions, other than Baier, who released a statement taking some issue with how his objections were framed. One person inside Fox with direct knowledge of its election coverage told NPR the delay in calling the full White House win for Biden involved a technical glitch in a control room as one show transitioned to the next at the top of the hour. In hosting Fox's first post-election interview with Trump that November, Bartiromo echoed Trump's disproven allegations of electoral fraud, saying, \"This is disgusting and we cannot allow America's election to be corrupted.\" She told viewers in mid-December that \"an intel source\" told her that Trump had won the election. Bartiromo, officially designated as a news anchor, never returned to explain on what grounds the source made that statement. (Fox no longer publicly characterizes her as an anchor, which had rooted her in the news side of Fox, as opposed to an opinion host.) In December 2020, Dobbs contended on the air that Trump's opponents within the government had committed \"treason,\" and later suggested any action by a Republican officeholder to uphold Biden's victory might have been \"criminal.\" His departure from the network was hastily announced the day after another election-software company, Smartmatic, filed its own $2.7 billion lawsuit against Fox for defamation surrounding similarly false accusations of fraud. That case is not as far along in the process. Fox has dismissed both suits as efforts to stifle legitimate coverage of inherently newsworthy allegations - election fraud \u2014 made by inherently newsworthy people \u2014 including the then-sitting U.S. president and his top campaign advisers. Fox never did back down from its projection of Arizona for Biden, its original sin in the eyes of Trump and his campaign. As viewers abandoned the network for harder-edged fare on Newsmax, OANN and elsewhere, some Fox stars served up incendiary rhetoric and challenged the legitimacy of Biden's pending certification in early January. Even so, under Scott and her team, Fox fired former political director Chris Stirewalt weeks after the election. The network also announced the retirement of Washington Managing Editor Bill Sammon \u2014 who is among the executives whose contracts were sought by Dominion. Both men had been involved in the decision to project Biden's win in Arizona. Other digital reporters were laid off too. And the network shifted to give a greater emphasis to opinion, turning over two hours of programming that had been reserved for news reports to shows led by Jesse Watters and Greg Gutfeld. In recent weeks, Dominion has argued that Fox host Jeanine Pirro \u2014 a former district attorney and New York state judge, as well as a Trump confidant \u2014 sits at the heart of its case. NPR previously revealed the existence of an anguished email from a Fox News producer begging colleagues to keep Pirro off the air because she was circulating lies about election fraud from dark corners of the internet. Dominion's legal team asked the court to compel additional testimony from Pirro late last month, after Fox invoked a reporter's privilege to shield her from some questions during her deposition. A ruling on whether Pirro must return for questioning has not been made public. As with the Scott admonition about \"the crazies,\" Dominion's legal team is seeking to use those exchanges to show that Fox knowingly allowed Dobbs, Pirro, Bartiromo and their guests to peddle false claims that defamed the company and set the country on edge ahead of the Jan. 6, 2021 siege of the U.S. Capitol. According to filings reviewed by NPR, Dominion is also asking the court to compel additional testimony from Fox star Sean Hannity, a close adviser to Trump. Dominion's attorneys are seeking to bar \"improper assertions of reporter's privilege,\" arguing that Fox inappropriately asserted reporter's privilege for Hannity during earlier questioning as well, though the full filing is sealed. He was deposed in late August, according to court records. Fox News has repeatedly defended its conduct by invoking the importance of free-speech principles bound up in the First Amendment, saying the Smartmatic and Dominion cases are attempts to chill independent reporting and commentary. Fox Corp. CEO and Executive Chairman Lachlan Murdoch has taken a seemingly conflicting stance halfway across the globe in Australia, where the media magnate and his family now live. A political columnist for the magazine Crikey accused the Murdochs of being \"unindicted co-conspirators\" in the insurrection at the U.S. Congress by Trump supporters because of the false fraud allegations and the hyper-charged rhetoric ahead of the planned rally. In that case, Murdoch is accusing a much smaller media outlet of defamation. He has forced the site to pay out for highly critical commentary several times previously; Crikey says it intends to use the suit as a test case for recent changes in libel law in that country. Media outlets have less legal cover in Australia than they do here in the U.S. Maddy Lauria contributed to this report.",

The building drama over documents that left the White House with President Trump provides fresh proof that the ghosts of old scandals never die \u2013 or at least not in Washington. Watergate happened half a century ago, but its name and spirit are still with us, thanks in large measure to former President Donald Trump. He has not been charged and may never be charged, but memories of President Richard Nixon have been revived repeatedly by two impeachment proceedings and countless other scrapes and potential scandals. Trump has found himself at odds with Congress, federal courts and legal authorities in at least two states. And yet it is the document dispute, which has been public since the FBI searched and seized documents at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Aug. 8, that brings the specter of Watergate to the fore with renewed force. Operatives hired with money from Nixon's 1972 re-election campaign were caught burglarizing and bugging the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in the Watergate office complex. Fearful of the fallout, Nixon ordered aides to cover up the connection and directed the payment of hush money to the burglars. Discussions of all this at the White House were caught on Nixon's own taping system, and two years later those recordings would force him to resign on the brink of impeachment and removal from office. But along the way, when it mattered most, Nixon and his crew found that people who might have been political allies in the past were not especially sympathetic to his case. When Nixon fired Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor who had been pursuing him in the fall of 1973, the White House recruited a replacement who seemed likely to be more tractable. Leon Jaworski was a well-respected Texas prosecutor who had supported Nixon for president twice (and would later join a Texas-based group called \"Democrats for Reagan\"), Surely he would not be as dogged in seeking the White House tape recordings as Cox had been \u2013 or so people thought in the fall of 1973.

Wrong call. Jaworski proved a relentless pit bull as special prosecutor. He led a grand jury to indict nearly a score of White House personnel and name Nixon himself \"an unindicted co-conspirator.\" The Nixon team had also thought they might find a relatively friendly courtroom when Federal Judge John J. Sirica took over handling the Watergate cases and trials. A former congressional staffer for Republicans, Sirica had been active in the GOP and rewarded with a federal judgeship in 1957 by Republican Dwight Eisenhower, while Nixon was vice president. By 1972, Sirica was the senior judge on the District of Columbia circuit and could assign cases as he pleased. He assigned Watergate to himself. But from there on, nothing went quite as Nixon's team might have hoped. Sirica sentenced the president's chief of staff and his top domestic adviser to prison terms, along with Nixon's first attorney general and his former White House counsel and others. Sirica was responsible for the pivotal ruling that Nixon could not claim executive privilege to withhold the critical tape recordings Jaworksi wanted to use as evidence at criminal trials. Sirica eventually ruled that the tapes also had to go to the House Judiciary Committee as it weighed Nixon's impeachment. When Nixon took that on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, Jaworksi presented the argument for Sirica's ruling and won a unanimous judgment (including the votes of three justices whom Nixon had appointed).

The tapes were released to Congress; and 16 days later, Nixon was gone. In recent days we have seen a beleaguered former President Trump struggling to find a legal response after an FBI search of his home that found scores of classified and even top-secret documents that his lawyers had told the authorities he no longer had. Throughout his business and political careers, Trump has relied on the legal advice he got early on from one of his life mentors, the renowned attorney Roy Cohn. Having been the lead counsel for Sen. Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s and thereafter an attorney for prominent New Yorkers (including sports and entertainment celebrities and Mafia dons), Cohn had an approach to all disputes. \"Don't tell me what the law is,\" he would say, \"tell me who the judge is.\" When Trump finally got his legal team together after the Mar-a-Lago search, they wanted a court to appoint a \"special master\" to review the documents and weigh Trump's claim to keeping them. The idea was to slow and possibly derail any plan to prosecute the former president. But they did not go to the judge who issued the search warrant or to one of the other federal judges in the same courthouse, the closest federal court to Mar-a-Lago. Instead, they went 70 miles to the outer edge of the same judicial district, where they might have hoped to find a more receptive judge. There their case was assigned to Federal Judge Aileen Cannon, still in just her second year on the federal bench. Cannon was one of the last of Trump's appointees to be confirmed by the Senate. She gave the Trump team most of what they wanted, including an order that the Department of Justice stop looking at the documents they had seized or using them in any way. She also ordered appointment of a special master, directing Justice and Trump's team to each suggest two candidates. Trump's team rejected both of Justice's candidates, but Justice was willing to accept one of the two names offered from the other side. That's the one Cannon chose. But then things began to go awry. On Tuesday of this past week, the special master Cannon chose, Raymond Dearie, came to court in Brooklyn N.Y. and told the Trump team they needed to show evidence for Trump's claim that the documents had been declassified. Trump's lawyers said they wanted to hold any such evidence back for now, to leave the question open and then possibly use the declassification issue as a defense later on. Dearie would not let them have it both ways. The documents were either classified or they were not. Put up or shut up, some might say. \"You can't have your cake and eat it, too,\" Judge Dearie said. Later in the week, things got even more problematic for Trump when a three-judge panel on the Federal Appeals Court for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta overruled Judge Cannon and said the Justice Department could continue using the classified documents in its investigation after all. That panel included two of Trump's own appointees, and in their ruling they treated Cannon's previous ruling rather dismissively. The 11th Circuit could be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, so we await the result there. But we have seen some of Trump's three appointees on that court vote against him as well during his fruitless objections to the 2020 election outcome. The momentum of the case is decidedly not encouraging from the standpoint of the former president. And his own lawyers strongly implied to Judge Dearie that they foresaw Trump dealing with an indictment in the document case. We are a long way from resolving this or several other legal matters pending against the former president. And the federal cases are unrelated to the proceedings in New York where the state attorney general has sued Trump and three of his adult children and the Trump Organization over fraudulent filings to deceive banks and tax authorities. They are also unrelated to continuing testimony being taken by a grand jury in Georgia weighing charges against Trump for his attempt to overturn the 2020 election results in that state. But as harvest time arrives, and as all these cases hover over the political season, one can sometimes hear echoes of \"Watergate\" wafting in the autumn breeze.",

According to a new poll, 67% of independents do not want Trump to run again, while just 28% said they do. Former President Donald Trump continues to heavily suggest he will run for president in 2024, but a new poll out from NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist shows voters in the middle overwhelmingly don't want him to give it another go. Sixty-seven percent of independents said they do not want Trump to run again, while just 28% said they do. In 2020, Trump lost independents and lost the election. In 2016, Trump fared better with the group, but throughout his presidency and afterward he suffered with them and has never regained them. \"I think we need someone who can start uniting the country,\" said survey participant Mike Helms, 68, of Lincolnton, N.C., an independent who voted for Trump in 2020. \"I don't think him or [President] Biden can unite this country.\" Trump has continued to be heavily unpopular outside of his base, raising questions about the strength of a Trump 2024 candidacy. People who live in large cities and suburban women continue to be two of the groups most opposed to Trump, while white evangelical Christians, whites without college degrees and those in rural areas are most supportive. Loading... \"I definitely don't want him to run, because he will split the Republican Party and give the vote to the Democrats,\" said Greg Cox, 54, of New Haven, Mo., another independent who voted for Trump in 2020. Overall, 61% of survey respondents said they don't want Trump to run again, largely unchanged from just after the 2020 election that Trump lost. A lot has transpired since then, and it shows just how locked in Americans' views are of Trump. In fact, when respondents were asked if they would want Trump to run again, even if he is charged with a crime, the percentage saying no only increased marginally to 65%. That's within the margin of error. Republicans looked like they were starting to pull away from Trump, but since the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago, his Florida home, for classified materials, they have reconsolidated around him. When it comes to the FBI search, a plurality (44%) of respondents said they think Trump did something illegal. Another 17% think he did something unethical, but not illegal. Nearly 30% maintain he did nothing wrong, including 63% of Republicans. Two-thirds of Republicans said they want Trump to run again, and a whopping 61% of them said they still want him to run even if he's charged with a crime. Trump is using the FBI search as a rallying cry, calling it an \"egregious abuse of the law.\" That's despite the FBI obtaining a legal search warrant. The Justice Department has said that it began investigating after a referral from the National Archives about classified material being mixed in with other material it received from Trump. The FBI said it had evidence that Trump's team did not turn over all the documents it was asked for \u2014 and the search bore that out. An inventory of the search of Trump's home found dozens of boxes of documents, including some marked with the highest, most sensitive classifications. On Monday, Trump was granted the right to a \"special master\" to separate out materials that have attorney-client privilege and even potentially material that could be argued to have \"executive privilege,\" even though Trump is no longer president. \"We're going to take back America,\" Trump said at a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pa. Saturday, where he lambasted the FBI search. \"And in 2024, most importantly, we are going to take back our magnificent White House.\" But Trump's base alone proved not to be enough in 2020, and likely wouldn't be in 2024, either. Biden has also struggled with independents, who have largely disapproved of the job he has done so far, so they will be a major question mark and potentially hold the key to a 2024 presidential election, if it is a Biden-Trump rematch. Helms, for example, said he would vote for Trump over Biden if Trump does run again, but not happily. Cox said he would \"absolutely not\" vote for Trump again if there's a next time around, but he emphatically said he is not open to voting for Biden, either. \"Maybe I'd vote Libertarian,\" Cox said. Methodology The survey of 1,236 adults was conducted Aug. 29 through Sept. 1. It has a margin of error of +/- 4.1 percentage points, meaning results could be 4 points higher or lower than what is shown. There are 1,151 registered voters surveyed with a margin of error of +/- 4.3 percentage points.",

            "article_content": "The House Jan. 6 panel has issued a subpoena for former White House Counsel Pat Cipollone. The committee is asking him to appear for a deposition next week.  A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: After weeks of calling for former White House counsel Pat Cipollone to cooperate, the House committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol finally issued a subpoena for him last night. The committee is asking Cipollone to appear for a deposition next week. And the subpoena comes the day after former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson offered startling testimony under oath. She recounted how Cipollone tried repeatedly to block former President Trump's efforts to disrupt the electoral count to formally elect President Joe Biden. NPR correspondent Susan Davis joins us now. Why this subpoena only issued now, Sue? SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Well, it looks like the committee tried to do it the easy way. And now they're going to do it the hard way, you know? Cipollone has spoken with them. He appeared voluntarily in an informal capacity back in April. But in a letter to Cipollone, the committee says he has refused all efforts to cooperate since then. And he's refused to provide any on-the-record testimony. So they say they were left with no other choice. Now, Cipollone hasn't responded to the subpoena. It's not clear if he will actually appear. But defying a congressional subpoena could open the door to possible legal action against him if he chose that. MART\u00cdNEZ: All right. So what do they want to ask Cipollone about? DAVIS: Well, the committee says he has direct knowledge of President Trump's involvement in a lot of efforts to subvert the 2020 election, including trying to submit fake ballots to Congress, trying to politicize the Justice Department and, of course, the president's role on the Capitol attack. In her testimony on Tuesday, Hutchinson repeatedly invoked Cipollone's name. She testified under oath that he was a key figure inside the White House trying to stop Trump from going to the Capitol on January 6. Now, Trump did not go to the Capitol on January 6. She said he asked her to help make sure it didn't happen, saying, quote, \"we're going to get charged with every crime imaginable if we make that movement happen.\" She also testified that Cipollone pleaded with Trump and his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, to do more to stop the violence once the riot at the Capitol was underway. MART\u00cdNEZ: Now haven't other people who have testified before the committee also offered testimony on Cipollone's actions right around the time? DAVIS: Yeah. I mean, former Justice Department officials testified that he backed up their efforts to block Trump from appointing Jeffrey Clark to run the department. Clark was willing to illegally try to aid Trump's efforts to overturn the election from there. And former campaign aide Jason Miller testified that Cipollone also confronted Trump lawyer John Eastman over his theory that Vice President Pence had the authority to stop the electoral count. He did not have that authority. And Cipollone said it was crazy. MART\u00cdNEZ: So it seems to me that this paints a picture of someone who tried to uphold the law and tell the president to do the same. Why resist, then, cooperating with the committee? DAVIS: That has certainly been the view of Wyoming Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney. She's the panel's co-chair. She has said publicly that the committee's evidence shows that Cipollone and his office tried to do, quote, \"the right thing.\" She also said she thinks the public should hear it from him directly. You know, there are probably some questions here about executive privilege, attorney-client privilege and the kind of things he can be compelled to say or not say. If he engages with the committee, it's possible he might not appear next week. But they could schedule it at a later date. This might take some lawyering. But really, this is not about Pat Cipollone. This is about Donald Trump. I mean, the committee has been building a very public, very provocative case that a sitting president tried to subvert the peaceful transfer of power. And they've also relied really heavily on Republican witnesses to make their case. I mean, Trump's White House counsel, who was there for all of it, would be able to provide valuable insight into the president's state of mind and his intentions at the time.

Doug Jones, D-Ala., right, as they listen during a confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, March 22, 2022. The top lawyer in the White House is stepping down after more than a year-and-a-half in the role, NPR has learned. White House counsel Dana Remus made history by helping to confirm the first Black woman for the U.S. Supreme Court. She also set records for appointing dozens of lower court judges with diverse professional experiences, selecting public defenders and civil rights attorneys for posts that carry a lifetime tenure. Current deputy White House counsel Stuart Delery will replace her, as part of a small White House staff shuffle as the country enters the final five months before the congressional midterm elections. Former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, at one point a contender to be Biden's running mate, will become senior advisor for public engagement, the White House announced on Wednesday.  Director of  the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs Julie Chavez Rodriguez will be promoted to senior advisor while continuing her current duties, as well. Lance Bottoms is the best-known of the group, having led a major city during the pandemic and racial justice protests after the killing of George Floyd, while also dealing with a mass shooting targeting Asian-Americans and a large-scale cyberattack. Biden said she is \"bright, honorable, tough and has the integrity required to represent our administration to the American public.\" Reums has worked with Biden for a while, serving as a top adviser in his campaign and, later, his chief lawyer. \"I am immensely grateful for the service of Dana Remus, who has been an invaluable member of my senior staff for the past 3 years and helped reinstate a culture of adherence to the rule of law,\" Biden said in a statement on the staffing changes. Among her many duties: playing a key role behind the scenes in Biden's decision not to assert executive privilege over documents and testimony about the siege on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. \"The constitutional protections of executive privilege should not be used to shield, from Congress or the public, information that reflects a clear and apparent effort to subvert the Constitution itself,\" Remus wrote in a letter to the National Archives last year. Associates said the job has been a pressure cooker from the start. During the campaign, Remus launched a war room that included three former solicitors general and hundreds of volunteer attorneys who prepared to fight in \u2014 and outside of \u2014 court as former President Donald Trump contested the election. \"There were few people more pivotal in making sure the president got into office as Dana was,\" said Jeff Zients, co-chair of the Biden transition team and former counselor to the president. \"A lot of the extraordinary threats to the electoral process we had been speculating about were emerging in real time before our eyes,\" Don Verrilli, a member of the group, told NPR. \"Dana ran that whole process with aplomb, and she made exactly the right judgments 100% of the time.\" Once in the White House, Remus made diversity a top priority. Nearly three quarters of Biden's judicial nominees are women. Nearly one in three are Black and nearly one in three have experience as public defenders. That emphasis carried over into the legal ranks in the White House counsel's office, too. The founding team there included a majority of women and people with public interest backgrounds. An administration official said her replacement, Delery, 53, is the first openly gay person to serve as White House counsel. He's currently handling such high-profile issues as the administration's pandemic response. As Associate Attorney General, Stuart Delery speaks about the indictments of 14 owners and employees from the New England Compounding Center Wednesday, Dec. 17, 2014, in Boston.\n                \n                    \n                    Steven Senne/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption As Associate Attorney General, Stuart Delery speaks about the indictments of 14 owners and employees from the New England Compounding Center Wednesday, Dec. 17, 2014, in Boston. Before that, Delery worked in high-ranking posts in the Obama Justice Department, where he led the effort to implement the Supreme Court's landmark decision on LGBTQ+ rights in United States v. Windsor across the federal government. The Human Rights Campaign called that effort \"the single largest conferral of rights to LGBTQ people in history.\" Earlier in his career, Delery clerked for Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Byron White. He and his husband have two children. \"My family is the most important thing in the world to me,\" Delery told NPR in 2014. \"One of the critical insights ... of the Windsor decision from the Supreme Court was that same-sex married couples face the same joys and challenges as their opposite-sex married neighbors.\" Verrilli, who worked as Solicitor General during the Obama years, said he interacted with Delery throughout that era. \"He is known and trusted by the President and the White House senior leadership,\" Verrilli said. \"He is a calm and steady presence. He has excellent judgment. And he is the consummate team player.\" Remus, 46, prefers to work outside the limelight. She did not agree to an interview for a story about her departure from government service. But Ketanji Brown Jackson, the Supreme Court justice who will start work next term, thought enough of Remus to express thanks \"for the awe-inspiring leadership\" after her Senate confirmation in April. Jackson will be the first Black woman on the high court, and the first person with public defense experience since Justice Thurgood Marshall. In the short term, a White House official said Remus plans to spend more time with her husband and toddler son. Remus addressed the arc of her career last month, in a commencement speech at Drexel University's law school. \"I joined a political campaign for the first time in my life when I was five months pregnant,\" Remus told graduates. \"I decided by what felt right; felt exciting; what inspired me. And it worked out. Looking back, I wish I could tell my younger self not to worry so much.\" White House chief of staff Ron Klain said he'd miss Remus \"immensely, as a great friend and colleague, but I know we're in great hands with Stuart, who has played a key role in all of the office's work since day one.\" Robert Bauer, White House counsel during the Obama administration, said the approach by Remus and Delery of avoiding self-promotion and focusing on the work could be a model for other aspiring lawyers. \"It goes to show you, there's another way in Washington that's possible: their performance,\" Bauer said.",

Hundreds of Trump supporters later stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to disrupt the certification of President Biden's victory. In a remarkable 44-page ruling, a federal judge found it was \"more likely than not\" that former President Donald Trump violated the law and \"corruptly attempted to obstruct\" Congress in his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results. The court's finding is narrowly focused on a set of documents sought by the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, and does not have direct legal consequences for Trump himself. The finding could be rejected on appeal, or be contradicted by other judges hearing cases related to the Capitol riot. Still, the ruling is consistent with a legal theory advanced by the House select committee investigating Jan. 6 that Trump and others may have broken the law in their attempts to overturn the election. \"It's enormously significant,\" said Jonathan Shaub, an assistant professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law. \"This is a thorough judicial analysis that, I think, it's difficult to sort of just brush aside, and it will give the committee's statements that there have been crimes some credibility.\" Shaub noted that the charge of obstruction of an official proceeding, which the judge found Trump \"likely\" committed, has been brought against many Jan. 6 riot defendants. The ruling arose out of a dispute between the pro-Trump attorney John Eastman and the congressional committee. In the aftermath of the 2020 election, Eastman put together legal strategies and advised the Trump team on how they might overturn President Biden's electoral victory, and met with Trump, then-Vice President Mike Pence and others at the White House. The pro-Trump legal scholar John Eastman testifies on Capitol Hill in 2017. On March 28, 2022, a federal judge ordered Eastman to hand over documents to the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n                \n                    \n                    Susan Walsh/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption The pro-Trump legal scholar John Eastman testifies on Capitol Hill in 2017. On March 28, 2022, a federal judge ordered Eastman to hand over documents to the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The Jan. 6 select committee in Congress has since sought documents and testimony from Eastman related to this work, including by issuing subpoenas. Eastman sued to block their release and claimed that some of his communications were shielded by attorney-client privilege. The judge in the case, U.S. District Court Judge David Carter of California, largely rejected Eastman's arguments and ordered that 101 of the disputed 111 documents be released to the committee. In one instance, Carter, who was nominated to the bench by former President Bill Clinton, found that the attorney work-product protection (which is similar to the attorney-client privilege) did not protect a document from disclosure, due to what's known as the \"crime-fraud exception.\" Under the law, that protection does not apply to communications made to further an ongoing or future crime or fraudulent activity \u2014 in this case, the alleged attempts to obstruct Congress and overturn the election. Carter described Trump and Eastman's plan as \"a coup in search of a legal theory,\" which \"spurred violent attacks on the seat of our nation's government, led to the deaths of several law enforcement officers, and deepened public distrust in our political process.\" Still, Carter made clear that his ruling would only directly affect these disputed documents. \"More than a year after the attack on our Capitol, the public is still searching for accountability. This case cannot provide it,\" Carter wrote. \"This is not a criminal prosecution; this is not even a civil liability suit.\" In a statement, an attorney for Eastman noted that the court's findings on the crime-fraud exception \"were not subject to the presumption of innocence, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, or any of the constitutional protections normally applicable to criminal proceedings.\" Instead, the judge's finding was on the basis of a \"preponderance of evidence\" \u2014 or, in layperson's terms, \"more likely than not.\" The statement added that Eastman \"respectfully disagrees with the judge's findings\" and \"asks all persons interested in this case to join him in calling upon the January 6th committee to release all the evidence so the courts and the public can reach accurate conclusions about the matters involved.\" Eastman \"intends to comply with the court's order,\" the statement said. Shaub, who also previously worked in the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel, said the ruling may put additional pressure on the Justice Department to bring charges against high-level officials involved with the efforts to overturn the election. \"I think it's harder to dismiss claims that there have been crimes committed, when you have a judicial finding that there is enough evidence to say that they were planning a crime,\" said Shaub. The judge's ruling concluded with a warning that investigators should continue their examination of the Jan. 6 attack in order to protect the rule of law in the U.S. \"If Dr. Eastman and President Trump's plan had worked, it would have permanently ended the peaceful transition of power, undermining American democracy and the Constitution,\" Carter wrote. \"If the country does not commit to investigating and pursuing accountability for those responsible, the Court fears January 6 will repeat itself.\" A Trump representative did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

The Democratic-led House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol says the evidence it has leads to the conclusion that then-President Donald Trump broke the law in his effort to overturn the 2020 election. The revelation was detailed in a court filing Wednesday evening. The filing was part of a court case tied to lawyer John Eastman, who has been fighting a subpoena issued by the panel to share additional documents. Eastman was a key figure in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, sharing a memo detailing how then-Vice President Mike Pence could reject Joe Biden's win as he presided over the counting of the electoral votes. Eastman, the select committee says, has tried to keep some records hidden from the investigation, citing privilege claims. \"The Select Committee's brief refutes on numerous grounds the privilege claims Dr. Eastman has made to try to keep hidden records critical to our investigation,\" committee Chair Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., and Vice Chair Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said in a joint statement. The panel says the evidence it has accumulated points to Trump and his allies illegally obstructing an official proceeding \u2014 Congress' counting of the Electoral College votes. The committee adds in the filing that it \"has a good-faith basis for concluding that the President and members of his Campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States.\" The filing details: \"The evidence supports an inference that President Trump, Plaintiff, and several others entered into an agreement to defraud the United States by interfering with the election certification process, disseminating false information about election fraud, and pressuring state officials to alter state election results and federal officials to assist in that effort.\" Trump faces potential criminal charges in Georgia for his efforts to try to overturn the election results there. Thompson and Cheney note that their legislative committee is not conducting a criminal investigation, though such allegations could ramp up pressure on the Department of Justice to pursue charges on its own. Republicans have decried the committee as a partisan attack on Trump.",

The Democratic-led House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol has subpoenaed former Trump White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, after he documented his own attempts to delay the certification of the 2020 election results in a memoir about this time in the Trump administration. Navarro marks the 80th subpoena for the committee, which has now conducted interviews with more than 500 witnesses who have voluntarily cooperated to help the committee track the subplots that fueled the deadly siege. \"Mr. Navarro appears to have information directly relevant to the Select Committee's investigation into the causes of the January 6th attack on the Capitol,\" select panel Chair Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said in a statement. \"He hasn't been shy about his role in efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election and has even discussed the former President's support for those plans.\" Like Trump allies subpoenaed before him, Navarro in a statement called the panel's investigation a \"witch hunt.\" Navarro also attacked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, several Republicans, including former Vice President Mike Pence, and the committee, calling them \"terrorists.\" Navarro leaned on former President Trump's previous executive privilege claims, signaling his lack of interest to cooperate. \"President Trump has invoked Executive Privilege; and it is not my privilege to waive,\" he said in his statement. However, Trump lost a related case on that effort before the Supreme Court earlier this year. The committee said public reports and Navarro's own book details how he was involved in efforts to delay Congress's certification of President Biden's win, as well as overturn the results. Navarro also reportedly worked with former Trump adviser Steve Bannon and others to develop efforts to delay that certification process, the panel said. In Navarro's book, he described it as the \"Green Bay Sweep\" as the \"last, best chance to snatch a stolen election from the Democrats' jaws of deceit.\" Thompson, in his letter to Navarro, quoted from Navarro's In Trump Time: My Journal of America's Plague Year released last year. He also noted that Navarro said in an interview that Trump was \"on board\" with the effort, along with \"more than 100\" members of Congress. The committee also said Navarro released a three-part report called the \"Navarro Report\" on his website that shared misinformation and ties to false claims of election fraud. \"And, because you discussed these and other relevant issues in your recently published book, in interviews with reporters, and, among other places, on a podcast, we look forward to discussing them with you,\" Thompson said. The panel is asking Navarro to turn over documents in two weeks, by Feb. 23, and testify three weeks from today on March 2.",

Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., speaks at Fort Drum, N.Y., in a file photo. It can be easy to forget how many of Donald Trump's loudest allies once had nothing but insults for the man. Lindsey Graham is one. There's New York Rep. Elise Stefanik. Ohio Sen.-elect J.D. Vance and Wyoming Rep.-elect Harriet Hageman both opposed Trump before accepting his endorsements. Despite Trump's clear power, though, there are signs of weakness: many of his endorsees lost in the midterms. A majority of Republican voters want someone else as the nominee in 2024. And then there's the fact he is the subject of multiple high-level investigations at the moment. All of which raises a big question for the GOP: is Trump still the leader of the party? That made this the perfect time to talk to Tim Miller, author of Why We Did It: A Travelogue On The Republican Road To Hell \u2014 our latest selection for the NPR Politics Podcast Book Club. Tim is a former Republican operative who defected from the party over his objections to Trump. His book is a Washington insider's exploration of how the Republican elite fell in line under Trump, despite many of them privately claiming they opposed him. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. Danielle Kurtzleben: Let's start with I suppose a pretty D.C. question \u2014 I'm going to ask you for your resume. Tell us about your background in Republican politics. What were you doing up until Trump's election, and what are you doing now? Tim Miller: I grew up in Colorado, and I started as a young high school kid being a political nerd. And I just had the privilege and the luck to have a neighbor that was friends with a guy that was running for governor \u2014 his name was Bill Owens. And so in the summer, when other kids had to flip burgers or whatever, I went and interned on his campaign. He ends up winning a really, really close race that just kind of got me hooked on politics. I end up getting to go to the governor's office, and my task is to read his mail and sift through all the crazy letters that get sent to the governor's office. I [began] working on campaigns in a bunch of states, leading up to being a spokesperson on John McCain's Iowa presidential campaign. From there, I worked on a bunch of what would now be extinct, moderate RINO Republican presidential campaigns. [I was] a spokesperson for Jon Huntsman in 2012. And then after he lost, I begged my way into representing Mitt [Romney] at the RNC during the general election. Then in 2016, I was communications director for Jeb Bush's campaign before speaking for the first kind of Republicans against Trump PAC, which was called Our Principles PAC. And then, I don't know if you recall, but Donald Trump ends up winning, and I have a life crisis. Since then, I have been writing \u2014 I wrote for The Bulwark and other places. And I also was political director for Republican Voters Against Trump, which is a project aimed at getting Republicans to vote for Joe Biden in 2020. DK: You write early on that you knew this book would be cathartic for some liberals \u2014 to just read a dunkfest on top Trump officials. What were you hoping people would get from this book, if not just the joy of dunks? TM: I want to caveat that that was actually the original idea for the book, was to just tomahawk dunk on everyone. An agent came to me and said, \"I think you'd be really good at this book.\" You know, \"Write 'the ten slimiest grifters in Republican Washington' or whatever, and we'll sell a million copies.\" That didn't feel like that was going to be satisfying for me on the writing side of things. And so while there is a little bit of that for sure, what I really wanted to do was focus more on the gray areas. I jumped over a couple of things, going over my resume, things that I'm less proud of: as a gay Republican, how I worked for candidates that opposed the most important thing in my life right now \u2014 my husband and child. [I wanted to] write about the people who saw the danger and went along with it anyway and tried to explore why they did, and I tried to explore why I got as far down that path as I did, even though I peeled off. DK: Well, let's get into that \u2014 you were on the Trump payroll for a bit. You at one point advised Scott Pruitt in his bid to become EPA administrator. So in terms of answering the question of \"Why We Did It,\" what can you say about the motivations of D.C. Republican insiders and also of yourself at the time? TM: Of course there's a money element to this and power, but it's not just that, right? I think \"power\" in particular is a little bit of a misnomer. There are a handful of people that like to wield power in Washington, but power comes with responsibility. Power has downsides. Being around power is great to [insiders]. That is, I think, really a driving force for a lot of people. They just want to be in the golf cart with Trump, in Lindsey Graham's case, or they want to be in the back row of a room where they can go home for Thanksgiving and tell their family. This is the drug in D.C. For myself, one thing that I talked about was these two elements of inertia and identity. You get into a career, you're mid-level, and then all of a sudden you start to feel kind of icky about it. And then it's like, well, what do I do now? The Scott Pruitt situation was that for me. Trump had won. This had been my whole life, being a Republican spokesperson or researcher. And I knew [Pruitt]. I didn't know him that well, but he called me and he's like, \"Hey, will you prep me for this job?\" And I took it just because I was in a crisis \u2014 I was like, \"I don't know what I'm going to do. Am I going to have a job?\" And then I also think that there is the identity element about this, which is \u2014 particularly in Washington, but increasingly, in a concerning fashion, everybody who posts about politics on the internet \u2014 politics becomes part of people's identity. In Washington, you have people that \u2014 Republican is who they are. The people that went to their wedding are all Republican operatives. The bar they go to is the Republican bar. Their poker night is Republican poker night. They have a kids' playgroup with other people who are Republican operatives. It's hard then to just say, \"I'm not this anymore.\" The thing that surprised me in a bad way was just how much resentment and interpersonal bitterness drove this. DK: Oh, yeah. The animosity among Republican voters towards Democrats \u2014 and among many Democrats towards Republicans \u2014 is just huge. And you're saying that that negative partisanship is reflected among the Republican ruling class. TM: For sure. I say this not as a compliment to myself, by the way \u2014 this is a self-criticism \u2014 but I saw this as a little bit of kayfabe, which is this wrestling term of performative anger. Like, Hulk Hogan wasn't really mad at Andre the Giant \u2014 I'm showing my age with that reference. But it was fake. When I was at the RNC as the spokesperson, my job was basically to criticize the Obama campaign. The Obama campaign spokespeople at the time \u2014 Ben LaBolt and Liz Smith \u2014 are friends of mine. Like, we'd go out and drink and trash-talk each other. To me, it was performative, and so that's how I was processing things. I was assuming that everyone was on my level. And what I came to find out is that they really weren't, and that this bitterness towards Obama, [there was] an element of race to it for sure. But more than that, I think that for a lot of the people in the political class, it was this resentment that he got treated so well, that he was the golden child in the media and that everyone loved him and that their candidates didn't get treated as well. And then in the Trump years, this just gets on steroids. What I thought was performative fighting between the parties, among many, many, many of my colleagues actually became a driving, motivating force. One guy said to me directly, \"Tim, I'm a white guy, and with all of this woke nonsense and with my wife's friends calling me racist for working for Republicans and all this criticism, all this heat I have to take, I'm not up for jobs. And it just leaves me no choice but to just think about the one or two things I agree with [the Trump administration] on and just focus on that.\" What I came to find out is that that guy really represented the private thoughts of a lot of Republicans. DK: There's another motivation that I want to drill into. There are two categories of Republicans you call the messiahs and the junior messiahs. And these are people who told themselves and others that they took Trump administration jobs because they were afraid of who would do it otherwise \u2014 that, hey, at least I can be the adult in the room. You do not buy this argument. Why not? TM: I don't. I think it's the toughest category, because at some level, are we lucky that H.R. McMaster was national security adviser instead of Michael Flynn? Clearly. So it's hard to kind of begrudge H.R. McMaster on the one hand. On the other hand, their actions after they took the job \u2014 all of those people who said that they went into the White House because it was better them than someone else \u2014 their actions kind of betrayed that they really had other motivations. I say that because if it was true that these people went in because they just felt like they had this duty to country and that it was better them in public service than someone else, then they would have supported Joe Biden in 2020. But none of them really came out and said, \"no, we need to stop this person.\" And that would have been the logical next step of somebody that was going in really to save the country. DK: Throughout your book, it feels like voters are always right at the edge of the picture. I'm thinking about Iowa voters pushing John McCain in 2008 to be tougher on immigration. Or you talk about the formerly moderate New York representative, Elise Stefanik, who justified becoming Trumpier by saying, \"well, I'm just doing what voters want.\" So my question is, you blame a lot of Republican elites for falling in with Trump \u2014 do you feel similarly towards voters? I don't. I'm of two minds about the voters. One is that I do think they are the ones that are driving this. And my book is about the cowardice of the collaborators. The Republican ruling class would have been happy to go along with a more benevolent person to just continue their access to power, but they went along with the more dangerous and bigoted nativist route, because that's what the voters wanted. And OK, why are voters like that? That's a different book. I think that the voters have a lot of real reasons why they were upset. I mean, some people are bigots out there for sure. But I think the Republican ruling class didn't listen to [voters'] concerns. I write about the autopsy, which I worked on in 2012. I mean, a lot of Republican voters were mad about the Iraq war, were mad about the hollowing-out of their communities. We didn't do anything to try to address that. We didn't challenge Republican orthodoxies on any issues, and Trump did. So I think it makes sense that those voters were attracted to Trump. He was offering them something different. And one of the chapters in the book is [about] the political media class \u2014 the conservative media in particular. It shouldn't be that surprising that if someone is every minute getting a text message or an email or a tweet or a Facebook post about how their country is being stolen from them, that they would want to support radical ends to fix that. I try to have grace towards voters and people in my life that have gotten swept up in this. And I think that we have, in a representative democracy, an obligation of the people at the top of the funnel to resist people's worst impulses. There was nobody that did that. And that is why those folks are the negative characters in my book. DK: You mentioned the autopsy you helped write \u2014 the report the RNC released after Mitt Romney lost in 2012, telling the party how to have longer-term success. A lot of it was about working harder to appeal to nonwhite and women voters. Trump certainly did not fit that bill ... and listener Rachel Gershman was wondering in our Facebook group, \"Does the autopsy have any relevance now?\" TM: Not really. It has relevance as an insight into what the Republican political class, left our own devices, actually wanted. So I think that it's interesting in that regard. I think there's a lot of reasons to think maybe an autopsy vision of the Republican Party might have worked. Hillary Clinton was a flawed candidate, partially because of that conservative media complex \u2014 the hyperbole and lies that she was targeted with \u2014 but she also had some flaws that she brought upon herself. Could a candidate that was more moderate on immigration and believed in climate change \u2014 could someone with Elise Stefanik's 2014 platform of believing we should deal with climate change and and supporting gay marriage, could that person have beaten Hillary Clinton? I think maybe, yeah, probably. But because Trump won, that created this mindset within the Republican Party, especially after McCain and Romney had lost, that this kind of populist, nativist, working class path is the way for Republicans to win national elections again. DK: One other thing I wanted to ask about is being a gay Republican. You write about the mental tap dancing you did to support a party that just didn't support gay people like you. I'm wondering if you could tell us how that experience affected how you saw your fellow Republicans do their own sort of tap dancing as they tried to justify their allegiance to Trump. TM: I spent a lot of time thinking about this because there are obviously limits to any parallel. But I think that there are a lot of parallels. I look back with regrets on not being more vocal on gay rights matters, on not drawing a bright red line around the types of candidates that I would work for. Part of the reason why I did it when I think back about my own rationalizations was, I felt like the arc of the gay history was bending towards justice, to steal a phrase \u2014 I felt like we were already on this trajectory, and so why should I ruin my career over it? I also used these same kind of rationalizations of, Oh, the other side's not perfect, too. I mean, in 2008, Obama won't say he's for gay marriage and everybody knows he privately is. You can talk yourself into the fact that, you know, \"the other side is not perfect on this either. And so why should I worry about it?\" All of these rationalizations happened, and with the benefit of some distance and with Trump kind of shaking me out of this kind of mindset, I looked back on that and thought, \"Man, I don't think I was seeing myself clearly.\" So when Trump came around, I saw those same machinations happening in my colleagues. I think the other thing that happened is that whole identity question that I talked about earlier. I was probably the visible gay Republican spokesperson for a while. So I had been through this \u2014 people seeing me in a different way and having to deal with that kind of identity change. And so, I think that it made it less hard for me to do it when Trump came around. I also had those mistakes that I could look back on and say, \"I'm not going to make this mistake again.\"",

            "article_content": "Lachlan Murdoch is set to be deposed in the $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Lachlan Murdoch is set to be deposed in the $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News It's press-shy Lachlan Murdoch's turn in the spotlight. On Monday, at the offices of a powerhouse Los Angeles law firm, the head of Fox News' parent company \u2014 and son of its founder \u2014 is scheduled to be deposed under oath. He will face questions about his knowledge of the wild and false allegations the network presented about a voting tech company's role in then President Donald Trump's loss in the 2020 elections. The deposition represents the apex \u2014 to date \u2014 of the witnesses assembled by Dominion Voting System's legal team as part of a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit filed in Delaware Superior Court. Despite supporting Trump throughout his presidency, Lachlan and his father Rupert Murdoch refused to force Fox News to retract its projection that Joe Biden would win the key state of Arizona on Election Night 2020 in the face of intense pressure from the Trump camp. A slew of Fox News guests and hosts - among them Sean Hannity, Jeanine Pirro, and Maria Bartiromo  - slammed Dominion Voting Systems for weeks afterward, breathlessly suggesting and even baselessly asserting it committed election fraud. Dominion says Fox was trying to win back the Trump loyalists who abandoned Fox after the election. And the voting tech's attorneys have worked its way up the ranks, deposing Fox News staffers from junior producers to those star hosts to network executives. \"It's an orchestrated effort,\" Dominion attorney Justin Nelson argued at a court hearing back in October. \"It's not just on the part of each host individually, but it's across Fox News as a company.\" And, he said, that applied to Fox Corporation as well. Dominion's suit notes that countless local, state and federal officials and dozens of court rulings have validated the election as clean and fair. Now attention swings upward to Lachlan Murdoch, Fox Corp's executive chairman. Such legal proceedings can prove fraught, legal authorities say. \"Reputations can be made and broken in moments like this,\" says Charles Elson, an attorney who is the founding director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. \"If you prove not to be credible, that's a problem. If you prove to have acted in a sloppy manner, that's an issue too.\" The lawsuit represents an unexpected and unwelcome challenge to Murdoch - legally, potentially financially, and, as Elson suggests, professionally. He and Rupert, the 91-year-old patriarch of the family's media empire, are intent on reuniting their broadcast and print empires despite some signs of mounting shareholder opposition. And Lachlan's three eldest siblings \u2014 Prudence, Elizabeth and James \u2014 are said by associates to be skeptical of Lachlan as the appropriate heir to lead their family's holdings after their father's death. The move to once more combine the print and television holdings \u2014 News Corp and Fox Corp \u2014 are in large part a means for Lachlan to consolidate power before his father is no longer on the scene. The four older Murdoch children will then together control the family trust, which holds about 40 percent of voting stock. James, who left his position on the board of News Corp in July 2020 over the editorial direction of the Murdoch empire, was deposed in October. Rupert Murdoch led Fox News for nearly two years after the Murdochs ousted then-Fox News chairman Roger Ailes over a sexual harassment scandal. The elder Murdoch also struck a political alliance with Trump, though he has cooled on the former president, signaling in private and through his media outlets that he wants to see another generation of Republicans to rise. Meanwhile, Lachlan Murdoch's free speech credentials have been somewhat muddied in his father's native country of Australia, where Lachlan moved his family during the pandemic; he is suing the political news site Crikey there for an opinion column calling the Murdochs \"unindicted co-conspirators\" in the January 6, 2021, siege of the U.S. Capitol for the vitriolic rhetoric of many of Fox's stars and guests. According to court filings, the Dominion attorneys' deposition of Lachlan Murdoch \"will continue from day to day (Sundays and holidays excluded) until complete, unless otherwise agreed.\" The only major figure Dominion has not yet questioned is Rupert Murdoch. That is expected to happen before the end of the year. Fox News has embraced the mantle of freedom of the press, calling this a nuisance suit and saying it expects to prevail. \"There is nothing more newsworthy than covering the President of the United States and his lawyers making allegations of voter fraud,\" Fox News Media said in a statement for this story. And it has invoked the journalistic standing of Hannity, in seeking to shield him from another round of questioning under oath. Under prior federal and Delaware court rulings, journalists have some protections against revealing sources and information in court. Hannity was one of Trump's most prominent champions on the air and one of the former president's closest advisers off the air. During his Aug. 31st deposition, which lasted more than seven hours, Hannity was grilled about the episode of his program that ran on November 30, 2020. It featured Trump campaign attorney Sidney Powell, who was condemned, among others, by a federal judge in Michigan for abusing the court system in her challenges to the 2020 election results. Dominion is also seeking the court to force Powell \u2014 in a separate case in Washington, D.C. \u2014 to produce documents involving her communications with Fox News. Attorneys for Fox assert that an absolute journalistic privilege protects Hannity's conversations and communications with confidential sources as Dominion tries to force additional testimony from Hannity. Hannity is not himself a defendant in the case. Fox's legal filings note he has not waived his own claims of journalistic privilege. Over the years, Hannity has publicly characterized himself in a series of contradictory ways. He has not only a strong conservative point of view but also a partisan bent; he has been chided several times by the network for campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates and conservative causes. \"I'm not a journalist,\" Hannity said in fall 2016, in defending himself for giving Trump gentle treatment in the dozens interviews he conducted that election season. \"I'm a talk show host.\" Similarly, earlier this year, Hannity sought to knock down criticism of his repeated private exchanges with top Trump White House aides, including Trump's chief of staff, Mark Meadows, after they surfaced in the House Select Committee's investigations into the January 6 siege of Congress. \"Yes, I'm a member of the press,\" Hannity told viewers of his program in April, \"I'm on the Fox News Channel, which is a news channel, but I don't claim to be a journalist. I claim to be a talk show host.\" He said he is capable of doing investigative reports and continued, \"I am a registered conservative. Yes, I voted for Donald Trump. I make no apologies, I give my opinions straight-forward. We even do culture, we do sports \u2013 I'm like the whole newspaper.\" Lachlan Murdoch typically characterizes Fox News as a \"center-right\" news organization. Fox draws a sharp distinction between its reporting and news shows with its point-of-view programming. Yet in recent years the network has jettisoned hours of news shows or relegated them to less-prominent time slots. And many outside observers \u2014 including former Fox News journalists \u2014 argue that Fox's hard-right tilt greatly influences its news shows as well. Of late, Fox News and Dominion have sparred over whether Fox host Jeanine Pirro should have to give testimony anew after Dominion objected to her refusal to answer some questions about her texts. Dominion won the right for its lawyers to question her under oath further on Nov. 23rd. As NPR first disclosed, Dominion, in the discovery process for its lawsuit, acquired an email from a producer begging colleagues not to allow Pirro on the air after the 2020 election, saying she was spreading unfounded conspiracy theories plucked from unreliable websites. Pirro has recently been promoted to become a co-host of the popular weekday show, The Five. Fox and Dominion are wrangling over other grounds as well. Fox News is arguing for sanctions against Dominion, alleging the company destroyed evidence: electronic messages of CEO John Poulos and senior executives Waldeep Singh and Kay Stinson. Such destruction is called \"spoliation.\" Fox is asking for dismissal of the case, monetary punishments and other legal measures. In a statement for this story, Fox News wrote: \"Dominion's potential spoliation is not central to Fox's ability to make our case, but it should be noted that courts have found that intentional, bad-faith spoliation of evidence is an abuse of the judicial process and warrants a sanction. It is our intention to provide all relevant and material evidence in this matter.\" A spokeswoman for Dominion replied, \"This meritless claim is a distraction and will not impede Dominion from moving the case forward based on its merits. We intend to hold Fox accountable for its reckless disregard for the truth and are confident the truth will ultimately prevail.\" Maddy Lauria contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "James Whitfield, former principal at Colleyville Heritage High School in Colleyville, Texas, in a photo taken at his home in Hurst, Texas, last year.\n                \n                    \n                    Ben Torres for the Texas Tribune\n                    \n                \nhide caption James Whitfield, former principal at Colleyville Heritage High School in Colleyville, Texas, in a photo taken at his home in Hurst, Texas, last year. In the spring of 2020, James Whitfield had just become the first African American to be named principal at Colleyville Heritage High School, located in a predominantly white Dallas-Fort Worth suburb. Whitfield, who holds a doctorate in education, was anticipating big challenges when students returned in the fall. COVID-19 had already shut down in-person learning, and the pandemic was about to make a chronic teacher shortage even worse. Then came the death of George Floyd, the unarmed Black man killed by a Minneapolis police officer during an arrest outside a convenience store. Unable to sleep one night in early June, days after Floyd's death, Whitfield set down his thoughts in an email to friends and colleagues. He wrote about \"systemic racism\" and wondered what could be done to stop it. At first, Whitfield says, \"I got nothing but positive responses ... from people in the community, parents, family members [and] staff members.\" In the months that followed, though, pressure on him mounted as internet chatter began to heat up among those he calls \"[conservative] operatives here in Texas that are trying to take over school boards.\" There were even indirect aspersions cast on his biracial marriage. Whitfield's email came around the time that a slew of new laws were introduced across the country that have reshaped public education. Some target critical race theory, or CRT, an academic framework positing that people who are white have benefited from racism ingrained in U.S. institutions. Other laws are aimed at prohibiting classroom discussion about sexual orientation or gender identity. As a result, in some places teachers and administrators \u2014 already facing long hours and low pay \u2014 now find themselves under additional pressure from politicians, parents and even their own school districts. It all comes as many schools are losing qualified teachers and waging an uphill battle to improve flagging test scores. A year after his email and weeks after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a law banning CRT in K-12 public school classrooms, Whitfield was accused at a school board meeting of promoting the concept. He denied the charge, but soon after, the board voted not to renew his contract, which expires in August 2023. In the meantime, Whitfield is on paid administrative leave. When contacted, the Grapevine-Colleyville Independent School District referred NPR to a statement issued nearly a year ago that says, \"the District and Dr. Whitfield each strongly believe they are in the right.\" The growing polarization in the nation's classrooms comes as many schools are struggling to hold on to teachers and staff. One recent study estimates there are more than 36,500 teacher vacancies across the country and more than 163,500 teachers are either not fully certified or not certified in the subject they are teaching. Those figures are conservative, because data from more than a dozen states could not be collected, according to the study. Meanwhile, a report released last month by the Government Accountability Office says \"[negative] perception of the teaching profession and perceived lack of support for current teachers\" are \"among key recruitment and retention challenges.\" Further, in a survey published by the Rand Corp. earlier this year, more than a third of teachers and 60% of principals reported being harassed during the 2021-2022 school year \"because of their school's policies on COVID-19 safety measures or for teaching about race, racism, or bias.\" The situation has a negative impact on students too, says Lindsay Marshall, a former teacher who is now a history professor at the University of Oklahoma. \"It was very clear to me in the classroom that I was not only engaging with my students, I was engaging with their whole world,\" Marshall says. When politics gets infused into the classroom, it breaks down that relationship between teachers, students and parents, she says. Perhaps no other state has become more embroiled in the controversy than Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis has spearheaded efforts to reshape the public school curriculum to reflect his conservative values. That includes the passage of the Parental Rights in Education bill and the governor's strategy of weighing in on local school board races. The bill, dubbed the \"Don't Say Gay\" law by critics, prohibits teachers from discussing LGBTQ-related topics \"in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.\" \"The law is clear, and simple: educators are prohibited from instructing students on matters of gender identity or sexuality in grades K-3,\" DeSantis spokesman Bryan Griffin wrote in statement to NPR. \"Florida's education will be focused on the fundamentals: reading, writing, math, civics, and other core subjects \u2013 not politically motivated indoctrination.\" Andrew Spar, president of the Florida Education Association, says the politically charged environment around K-12 education is one of several factors \"driving a lot of teachers, especially experienced teachers, out of the profession.\" Ahead of the start of the current school year, the Florida Education Association, or FEA, said statewide there were 10,771 advertised vacancies, with 6,006 for teachers and 4,765 for support staff. Those figures are disputed by the Florida Department of Education. In an email to NPR, a spokesman for the department called the numbers part of \"a false narrative [that] continues to be spread by media activists and union clowns.\" Even so, by the Florida DOE's own estimates, it has one of the highest numbers of teacher vacancies in the country. \"This whole teacher and staff shortage is not just people not coming into the profession, which is an issue, but it is a mass exodus of people in some cases with, you know, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years or more of experience,\" Spar says. Michael Woods is a special education teacher with nearly three decades of experience at Santaluces Community High School in Palm Beach County. Outside of school, he makes no secret of being an LGBTQ activist and has helped organize local Pride events. But \"I don't openly discuss it with kids,\" he says. Woods says he doesn't understand the charge by some parents and politicians that teachers are trying to \"indoctrinate\" students into some sort of liberal ideology. \"If I could indoctrinate kids to do something, it would be to bring a pencil to class and to do their homework,\" he says jokingly. He says he's thankful to work for a \"supportive administrator,\" but worries about the direction his state has been going in recent years. The new law could result in the revocation of an educator's teaching certificate if they are found in violation, \"bypassing all the safeguards that we've had for decades and decades that were guaranteed by law,\" Woods says. But the issue can cut both ways. Some educators have recently made headlines for going public on their way out the door in protest of their schools' alleged use of critical race theory or sensitivity to LGBTQ issues. Among them is Frank McCormick, who taught history for 11 years in a Waukegan, Ill., high school before calling it quits midway through the 2021-2022 academic year. He says he \"started off pretty progressive, politically,\" but that he gradually became disillusioned after witnessing what he describes as a \"very dysfunctional, very toxic\" environment at the school. Over the years, McCormick says he witnessed \"increasing politicization\" and an ever-bolder liberal ideological agenda among administrators and fellow teachers, especially after the 2016 election. Last year, he went public with his concerns at a local school board meeting, excoriating the superintendent as \"a member of a bureaucratic class of charlatans and frauds, enriching herself at the expense of an impoverished community while students suffer.\" Former teacher Frank McCormick, seen on the set of Candace on March 22 in Nashville, Tenn.\n                \n                    \n                    Jason Davis/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former teacher Frank McCormick, seen on the set of Candace on March 22 in Nashville, Tenn. McCormick resigned in January, just a few months after Tony Kinnett, a now-former STEM coordinator and head instructional coach for the Indianapolis Public Schools, posted similar criticisms of his school in a video on Twitter. Kinnett, who previously worked on education policy in former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's office, said he was fed up with endless meetings about diversity and equity trying to decide \"who was more oppressed.\" \"I sat there and watched my colleagues argue with each other for hours on end about that kind of thing,\" he says. In his video, Kinnett accused the public school system of deliberate \"misdirection\" on CRT. \"When schools tell you that we aren't teaching critical race theory, it means one thing: Go away and look into our affairs no further,\" he says in the video. \"It isn't about transparency, it isn't about cultural relevance, it's race essentialism painted to look like the district cares about students of color.\" Kinnett was placed on paid leave while the school opened an investigation. He  was eventually dismissed. When NPR reached out to the Indianapolis Public Schools, the district declined comment. Since his departure, Kinnett has appeared on Fox News and become a regular contributor to The Daily Caller and the conservative magazine National Review. He also started his own website, Chalkboard Review, which says it promotes \"diverse perspectives in education.\" Kinnett was asked in January to testify before the Indiana House on a bill to ban any teaching that would make a student \"feel discomfort, guilt, anguish or any other form of psychological distress ... [due to] sex, race, ethnicity, religion, color, national origin or political affiliation.\" Despite the experiences that led to his departure from the teaching profession, Kinnett told lawmakers that he opposed the bill, which ultimately died in the state's Senate. \"I said [that] the way that the bill is written now ... it is a bad way to accomplish the goals that we are trying to accomplish,\" he says. \"I don't think that a state banning or approving certain specific curriculum or ideas to discuss is a very good measure.\" Former social studies teacher Matthew Hawn was accused of insubordination and repeated unprofessional conduct for showing Kyla Jen\u00e8e Lacey's poem White Privilege to his contemporary issues class. Hawn sits on his couch inside his home on Aug. 17, 2021.\n                \n                    \n                    Caitlin Penna\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former social studies teacher Matthew Hawn was accused of insubordination and repeated unprofessional conduct for showing Kyla Jen\u00e8e Lacey's poem White Privilege to his contemporary issues class. Hawn sits on his couch inside his home on Aug. 17, 2021. Matthew Hawn, a 16-year veteran of Sullivan Central High School in northeast Tennessee, lost his job after ending up on the wrong side of the debate over critical race theory. During a discussion in his contemporary issues class about Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager armed with an AR-15 rifle who shot and killed two people and wounded a third at a Black Lives Matter protest in Kenosha, Wis., Hawn \"made the statement that white privilege is a fact,\" he says. \"I asked our students, what are we going to do to help solve this problem of racism in the United States?\" he says. At the time, the school \u2014 which has since become a middle school as part of a consolidation \u2014 was in the midst of hybrid learning due to COVID-19. When Hawn accidentally uploaded a video of the discussion to the wrong class, an angry parent noticed and emailed school officials. He immediately took down the video. \"I was just sick over what happened,\" Hawn says, but teaching contemporary issues at a time of such massive polarization would prove to be a minefield for Hawn moving forward. Months later, when the topic of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol came up in Hawn's contemporary issues class, Hawn assigned an essay from The Atlantic by Ta-Nehisi Coates titled \"The First White President,\" a critique of the presidency of Donald Trump as, among other things, \"the negation of Barack Obama's legacy.\" He was reprimanded by school officials. Ultimately, for Hawn, it was showing a video of Kyla Jen\u00e9e Lacey performing her poem White Privilege to his juniors and seniors in contemporary issues that apparently proved too much for school administrators. He remembers the date of his dismissal: May 5, 2021, the very same day that Tennessee's legislature passed anti-CRT legislation. Hawn is currently fighting to get reinstated. NPR reached out to the Sullivan County Schools for comment, but received no reply. In Florida, Alexander Ingram, who has taught civics, advanced placement government, African American studies and the history of the Vietnam War for the Duval County Public Schools in Jacksonville, Fla., for about nine years, says he enjoys those classes precisely because they challenge his students. \"I love the courses I teach because they are controversial,\" he says. \"I think the most controversial ideas are in many ways the most fun to teach because they are intellectually stimulating.\" So, as the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol unfolded, he turned on the television and \"my class watched in real time.\" In the discussions that followed, some students recognized that the violence at the Capitol was not protected speech. Others brought up the issue pushed by then-President Donald Trump that the 2020 election was stolen. Generally speaking though, \"kids are a lot better about talking about politics than adults,\" he says. Ingram says it's the adults, not the students, who have made being an educator so difficult. \"I've heard the things that are said about educators,\" he says. When he once defended LGBTQ students, he was publicly berated by members of the community as a \"pedophile and a groomer.\" Since Florida's Parental Rights in Education law went into effect, Ingram says he's \"very aware of what the punishment can be right now, which is me losing my certification as well as the civil case against me.\" At this juncture, he calls teaching \"a double-edged sword.\" \"On the one hand, I feel like this job is more important than it's ever been,\" he says. \"At the same time, it would be dishonest for me to say that I'm content here.\"",

The impact of the committee's work will likely take longer to gauge.\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Jan. 6 committee presented voted this week to subpoena former President Trump. The fate of the subpoena will likely be decided soon by the courts. The impact of the committee's work will likely take longer to gauge. When a dramatic development punctuates a long-running narrative, people ask: Is this it? Is it the turning point or the tipping point, the moment we will remember? This week, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol took a shot at providing such a moment in the saga of former President Donald Trump. As they wrapped their latest and possibly last public session, the nine committee members voted unanimously to subpoena the former president's documents and testimony relevant to Jan. 6. Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., described Trump as \"the central figure\" in the entire episode, then proceeded to present more than two of hours of evidence to that effect. \"Trump knew, from unassailable sources, that his election fraud claims were false,\" added the panel's vice-chair, Liz Cheney, R-Wyo. \"There is no defense that Donald Trump was duped or irrational. No president can defy the rule of law and act this way in a constitutional republic, period.\" Videotaped witnesses and emails then detailed how Trump and some of his innermost circle planned well in advance to resist leaving office if he lost his re-election bid in November 2020. Trump's claims of victory on Election Night (\"Frankly, we did win this election\") were not just premature, they said, but premeditated. They were part of a script sketched out well before that night and referenced in private communications within his inner circle. But will this be the finger that pops the bubble of belief in Trump and his baseless claims of fraud? Experience tells us the ultimate measure of any congressional investigation is not in its final report or even the impact of public hearings along the way. The ultimate measure does not come from the actions of any investigator or witness, or from any member of Congress or elected officeholder. It comes from appointees in the executive and judicial branches of government. No matter how much news and attention a congressional panel may generate, the ultimate effect depends on whether they alter the arc of a presidency or otherwise change the course of national history. It will be up to Attorney General Merrick Garland to decide whether Trump faces charges for his role in the riot and his broader effort to remain in office despite losing the national popular vote and the constitutional vote of the Electoral College. Garland must also decide whether to bring charges against the former president for removing troves of official records including highly classified documents from the White House when he left office. Trump continues to insist the records belong to him and demand they be returned by the FBI, which seized them with a search warrant at his Mar a Lago estate in Florida. As for the Jan. 6 subpoena, we can now expect weeks and perhaps months of maneuvering, as Trump and the committee compete for control of the story line. Few experts in either camp expect Trump to testify, though he may well posture himself as willing to do if allowed to make it a personal forum. Most legal experts who commented on this prospect this week said Trump's lawyers would never advise him to speak before the committee. All the committee's witnesses have been under oath. That would expose the former president to charges of perjury or lying to Congress if he repeated his usual statements and denials about the election and related topics. In the end, it is far more likely Trump will follow the course taken by his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, who refused own his subpoena from the Jan. 6 panel citing \"executive privilege.\" The Department of Justice has so far declined to prosecute Meadows. It could take another view of Trump's defiance of Congress, and indeed it has with respect to Steve Bannon, a Trump adviser and strategist in 2016-17 and at times since. Bannon was not, however, a member of the Trump administration in 2020. In media interviews, Trump himself has teased a willingness to testify. But he has indicated he would want to do so in person on live TV in prime time, with an opportunity to turn the questioning on the committee. On his Truth Social account after the hearing he asked why the committee had not called him sooner, perhaps when it began its hearings. Trump also called the committee's work \"a total BUST\" and blamed the riot on Speaker Nancy Pelosi (referring to her as \"Crazy Nancy\"). Trump has previously claimed that he had authorized thousands of National Guard troops and been rejected by Democratic leaders in Congress. But there is no record of such authorization and those leaders would not have the authority to reject them if there were, according to Politifact. The following day, Trump's attorneys released a 14-page barrage of denials and attacks on the committee at week's end without indicating whether Trump would respect the subpoena. It also included assertions the election itself was stolen, once again without evidence. We have been here before. When Democrats captured the majority in the House in 2018, they pledged an examination of the connections between Trump and Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election in the U.S. An investigation of the 2016 campaign had begun earlier with the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, whose report was partially released in March 2019. Mueller found there had been extensive Russian interference, largely in social media. And while there had been contacts between those efforts and Trump's campaign (such as the sharing of polling information by a Trump campaign official), Mueller did not find evidence of a criminal conspiracy. At the same time, Mueller refused to exonerate Trump from charges of obstructing the investigation. Instead, he cited a Justice Department memo that said a president could not be indicted while in office. Some Democrats wanted to start impeachment proceedings based on what Mueller had found. Pelosi resisted that but supported impeachment hearings later that year when Trump delayed delivery of military aid to Ukraine and asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the business ties of Hunter Biden, son of Joe Biden (who was then out of government but seeking the 2020 nomination for president). The House proceeded to impeach Trump on those charges, but he was not convicted in the Senate. A second impeachment of Trump was carried out on a far more abbreviated timetable after the events of Jan. 6, 2021. But the House vote, in which 10 Republicans joined all the Democrats in voting to impeach Trump for his actions before and during the riot, once again failed to move the necessary two-thirds of the Senate (though there were more Republican votes to convict than there had been the previous year). Trump seemed to have earned the tabloid label of \"Teflon Don,\" a reference to earlier instances in which he had emerged from bankruptcies and apparent scandals unscathed. Congressional hearings into an apparent scandal have run their course and convinced much of the public that something must be done to hold certain parties accountable. The most famous case was Watergate, half a century ago. A Senate committee appointed for the purpose held hearings throughout the summer of 1973 investigating the role of President Richard Nixon in covering up a burglary at the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in the Watergate office complex in Washington. The Senate's televised hearings lasted into the fall and brought to light a remarkable array of misdeeds in the 1972 Nixon re-election campaign (when he won 49 states), casting a pall of suspicion over Nixon himself. The president's approval rating in the Gallup Poll tumbled from a peak well above 60 percent in early 1973 to well below 40 in the fall. But Nixon might well have remained in office had the hearings not exposed the existence of tape recordings made in the White House. Those tapes became to evidence for a case pursued by a special prosecutor using the resources of Nixon's own Justice Department. His subpoenas were supported by federal judges handling the burglary and related matters, all the way up to the Supreme Court. When the tapes came out, Nixon was forced to resign. Congress also held joint House-Senate hearings 14 years later that failed to do significant damage to President Ronald Reagan. His administration had been secretly selling arms to Iran in order to free Americans held hostage in that country. The proceeds of these sales were then secretly used to circumvent a congressional ban on military aid to anti-communist rebels in Nicaragua. But the Congress did not unearth substantial evidence of Reagan's personal involvement. A special prosecutor was appointed and several dozen officials of the Reagan administration were eventually indicted, including the secretary of defense. Eleven convictions resulted, some of which were vacated on appeal. The few remaining were pardoned in the final days of the term of Reagan's successor, President George H.W. Bush, who had been vice president during what was called \"the Iran-Contra affair.\" There were also hearings into Wall Street misdeeds that had led to the \"mortgage meltdown\" financial panic in 2008, as there had been into public and private misfeasance in the savings and loan industry in the 1980s. But while these brought attention to serious abuses and prompted legislation to try to address them, they have been largely forgotten since \u2013 largely because they did not send major figures to prison. National media were also deeply interested in the workings and report of the special commission appointed to investigate after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The commission found evidence that warnings were received within the government about terrorists operating inside the U.S. and even planning to use airplanes as weapons. But while this led to embarrassment in some instances there were no prosecutions, and President George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004 after the commission released its report.",

Trump is currently facing two Justice Department investigations, as well as an investigation in the state of Georgia.\n                \n                    \n                    Mario Tama/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Mesa, Ariz., on Oct. 9. Trump is currently facing two Justice Department investigations, as well as an investigation in the state of Georgia. As the Jan. 6 hearings resume this week, New York Times journalist Maggie Haberman says former President Donald Trump is likely in greater legal peril than ever before. \"The scale and nature of the investigations that he's facing now are more significant than almost anything else he has faced,\" Haberman says. Trump is confronting two Justice Department investigations \u2014 one related to the Jan. 6 insurrection, and another specific to the classified documents that were seized from his Mar-a-Lago residence in August. Officials in Georgia are also looking into his involvement in efforts to challenge the 2020 election results in that state. Haberman notes that though all three of the investigations pose a threat, Trump seems most concerned with the documents case: \"The documents case connects more directly to him because there's a clear throughline where he was being told to return these boxes and he wouldn't, and that there were three different efforts to recover documents and they kept finding classified documents with each interaction. It's just harder to blame on someone else.\" Haberman has known and reported on Trump for decades. Her new book, Confidence Man: The Making of Donald Trump and the Breaking of America,  chronicles Trump's formative influences in the rough-and-tumble worlds of New York City real estate and machine politics. Haberman writes that Trump learned early to personalize every conflict and see political relationships as transactional. His father, Fred Trump, cultivated relationships with powerful politicians \u2014 including Meade Esposito, the scandal-ridden Brooklyn Democratic machine boss \u2014 and then \"gifted\" those connections to his son, Haberman says. \"I asked [Trump] about Esposito and if he had thought that being president was going to be like that. He said Meade 'ruled with an iron fist,' \" Haberman says. \"That was how he believed government worked. People made decisions for their fiefdoms and what they said went and people operated in fear. And that was how Trump believed Washington would work.\" On Trump's interests in college He left scattered impressions on the people he encountered. He either seemed like a hyper-competitive person looking to get into real estate or, more privately, he had this interest in being a star. And he talked about this in an interview a few years back, it was before the presidency, about how he had brought show business to the real estate industry. He had toyed with the idea of going to USC film school. He has been obsessed with movies all his life, and I think part of it is just creating this alternate reality for himself. On Trump speaking differently for print vs. broadcast interviews To me, it was one of the most interesting moments of any of the three interviews. He led in by saying, \"Well, we've agreed you're not releasing these tapes.\" And I said, \"No, we have not not agreed on that, but I will listen to you if you have an argument to make.\" And he started explaining that, if [he's] being interviewed for [broadcast] that he speaks differently. And he said, \"Whereas if I'm being interviewed by you for the written word, like your book, I use repetition to beat it into your beautiful brain. Do you understand that?\" And it was quite a statement. It was quite a statement because it was menacing on the \"beating it into my brain.\" But it was also pretty self-aware about how he uses repetition, which is something that anyone who has focused on how Donald Trump uses language, which I have, and I wrote a whole story with Pat Healy, my colleague, about this in 2015. Repetition is a huge part of his repertoire, but hearing him talk about it was really interesting. On Trump's longtime habit of tearing up documents, scattering pieces in trash bins or on the floor or flushing them down toilets The ripping it up just seemed to be a habit that he had from Trump Tower, and he saw no reason to change once it was the government's documents. The flushing it, the staff who was aware of this had all kinds of speculation about why. They all uniformly believed it was things he didn't want people seeing. I do know from reporting that he was very suspicious of burn bags. He would use them. But burn bags are the method by which you get rid of paper in [the] White House, whether it's for the president or for staff. He was always questioning whether the material would actually be gotten rid of or if people would be going through it. He's deeply paranoid. On concerns for Pence's safety leading up to Jan 6. Marc Short, Pence's chief of staff in the White House, became concerned on January 5th, the day before the planned rally. Trump was becoming much more aggressive toward elected officials. And he became convinced that Trump was going to publicly turn on Pence and that they might have a security risk because of it. And so Marc Short called Tim Giebels, who was Pence's lead Secret Service agent, to Short's West Wing office, where he told him about this and flagged it. And it was the only time that Short, who was only in that role for, I think, two years, but it was the only time that he flagged a security risk \u2014 and the security risk he's flagging is the president. On Trump's habit of asking everyone around him for advice \u2014 including the valet who brought him Diet Cokes He treats everyone like they're his therapist: Friends and pseudo-friends and White House aides and campaign aides and Mar-a-Lago aides, the guy who brought him the Diet Coke. He is working it out in front of all of us in real time. One of the most interesting bits of color I got around his deliberations on what he was trying to do and how far he was going to take things ahead of January 6th ... he kept asking everyone what he should do, including the valet, who brings him the Diet Coke when he presses a red button on his desk. And this was pretty striking to the people who saw it, who came away thinking, 'Seriously, you're asking the person who's bringing you a Diet Coke what avenue you should be taking and to try to stay in power?' This is just who he is. On the criticism that her coverage helps \"normalize\" Trump I really don't think that's the case. I think we've all pretty clearly captured how outside of normal he is and was as a president. But becoming president is in and of itself normalizing because of the nature of the office. He is, despite his behavior, he is literally human, and so when you're writing about somebody's life, you learn things about their life. ... What I find with him is that just baseline human interpersonal behavior with him, the people who really like him tend to rate it much higher than they would with somebody else, because they're countering it against the bad behavior. On a photo of Haberman and Trump together that's used to discredit her When you're seeing that picture, it looks like something other than what it is. That picture was me going to the White House to visit a Trump aide to talk to them for a story when [the administration] had first come into office. So it was really in the first few days and the person said, \"The president wants to say hi,\" or something. I was with a colleague I brought to the Oval Office. Trump said, as he often does, \"Let's take a picture.\" Now, his goal in taking a picture, I think, is normally to have it for some purpose of his own. At the very last minute, he threw his arm around me very hard and it really startled me. And I reacted with the look on my face how I reacted. But Trump is all about dominance. And that seemed to me that's what it was like. So I don't think that's going to calm people down about what they think that is. But that is what that is. On the \"breaking\" of American politics I think American politics was changing to this level of smash-mouth to some extent before he got here. I think the Tea Party era helped usher that in and I think he fueled it and accelerated it and benefited from it. And I think it is defining the Republican Party in large measure right now. I think all of our politics are defined, not just the Republicans at this point, by who you hate and who hates you back. He just happens to fare very well in that kind of an environment, because ... he sees hate as a civic good. Heidi Saman and Susan Nyakundi produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

The affidavit that the FBI used to get a warrant for searching former President Donald Trump's home at Mar-a-Lago is now public. A redacted version of the document was released by a federal court this afternoon. Of the 32 pages in the affidavit from an FBI special agent with expertise in counterintelligence and espionage investigations, nearly half were covered in thick black lines masking information that had demonstrated to a federal judge the need to search Trump's Florida property. Eight pages of exhibits and supplementary information were also released, which were not redacted. \"Probable cause exists to believe that evidence, contraband, fruits of crime, or other items illegally possessed\" was being improperly stored in various places at Mar-a-Lago, the affidavit states. According to the affidavit, 184 classified documents, including 25 marked \"Top Secret,\" were found among 15 boxes that the National Archives had obtained from Mar-a-Lago earlier in the year, as well as others denoted with labels indicating they contained national security information, such as \"FISA.\"  Some of those documents were intermixed with other files, loose and unlabeled, which prompted the Archives to refer the case to the Justice Department. As the department worked with Trump and his attorneys, it became concerned about the nature of other records at the property, and that they were no adequately protected or stored. The Justice Department also grew concerned about misleading public statements from Trump and a former administration official about the materials that the Archives had recovered, the affidavit shows. Shortly after the affidavit was released on Friday, Trump made an emotional statement on his Truth Social media account, referring to the search as \"the Break-In of my home.\" He also said federal law enforcement was carrying out \"a total public relations subterfuge,\" without providing explanation, and declared \"WE GAVE THEM MUCH\"  when he described his voluntary turning over of some of the materials improperly kept at Mar-a-Lago. Since the search was executed on Aug. 8, threats of violence toward the FBI have increased. Anticipating the potential for violence from Trump supporters, the agent in the affidavit asked for it to be sealed. The agent also said publicly releasing it could lead to criminal activity. \"I believe that sealing this document is necessary because the items and information to be seized are relevant to an ongoing investigation and the FBI has not yet identified all potential criminal confederates nor located all evidence related to its investigation,\" the unidentified agent wrote in the affidavit. \"Premature disclosure of the contents of this affidavit and related documents may have a significant and negative impact on the continuing investigation and may severely jeopardize its effectiveness by allowing criminal parties an opportunity to flee, destroy evidence (stored electronically and otherwise), change patterns of behavior, and notify criminal confederates.\" A previous version of this story said that PACER, the country's main court filing system, was unable to handle the downloading demand for the document, which meant that scores of people and media outlets could not read it until well after the court-mandated deadline of noon. Media organizations went to court to demand that the public be able see the affidavit laying out the reasons and research for the unprecedented search.  The Justice Department then countered that it contains information that could compromise ongoing investigations as well as the safety of federal employees. Judge Bruce Reinhart last week ordered the department to provide him with a redacted version to consider for release. On Thursday he said the government had made its case that disclosing all of the affidavit would reveal witnesses, the investigation's strategy, its scope and grand jury information and there was reason to keep much of it under wraps for now. But he said that the government's proposed redactions were tailored narrowly enough to protect the integrity of the investigation and provided \"the least onerous alternative\" to keeping the entire document sealed. The affidavit also explains the work of a \"Privilege Review Team\" to identify and segregate documents that may be shielded by attorney-client privilege. Still, Trump has asked a different judge to halt the FBI review of the Mar-a-Lago documents and appoint a neutral special master. That judge has given him a deadline, also on Friday, to resubmit his request outlining and clarifying jurisdiction and legal points made in his first request. At the request of Trump's lawyers, the FBI attached a letter where the lawyers stated that Trump \"readily and voluntarily\" agreed to give the Archives documents it had requested, and made the argument that the criminal statute on classified materials does not apply to presidents or former presidents, essentially saying that Trump could not break the law. They also restate Trump's point of view that a president has absolute authority to declassify documents. President Joe Biden, who defeated Trump in the 2020 presidential election, cracked a joke on Friday when asked about Trump's assertion that as president he had the power to declassify all of the documents found at Mar-a-Lago. \"I just want you to know I've declassified everything in the world. I'm president. I can do it,\" Biden said sarcastically. \"Come on.\" While speaking to reporters at the White House, Biden also said he would not comment on the affidavit and referred questions to the Justice Department, adding, \"I don't know the details. I don't even want to know.\" Before the redacted affidavit was published, the court released the Justice Department's memo arguing why information should be kept under wraps. Although it, too, had large redacted sessions, the memo shed additional light on the investigation into how the former president took potentially secret documents home. It indicated there are \"a significant number of civilian witnesses,\" in the investigation. \"The government has well-founded concerns that steps may be taken to frustrate or otherwise interfere with this investigation if facts in the affidavit were prematurely disclosed,\" the Justice Department also said in the memo.",

Dr. Anthony Fauci, who played a critical role in steering humanity through the two pandemics of our time, AIDS and COVID-19, announced Monday he is stepping down from his role in the federal government. As of December, he will leave the position he's held for 38 years as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, as well as his job as chief of the NIAID Laboratory of Immunoregulation, and his role as chief medical adviser to President Biden. The straight-talking scientist and physician was the government's top infectious disease doctor for decades, and one of the few scientists that many Americans knew by name. Fauci, 81, served under seven U.S. presidents and helped lead the country through numerous health crises. He was instrumental in combatting the AIDS epidemic, starting as the youthful director of NIAID in the early 1980s. He also took center stage in a politically fraught response to the nation's COVID-19 pandemic, and he was both praised and assailed for his tell-it-like-it-is philosophy. Biden hailed him as a \"dedicated public servant\" in a statement issued Monday. \"Because of Dr. Fauci's many contributions to public health, lives here in the United States and around the world have been saved,\" the president said. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, who took leadership of the agency a year into the COVID pandemic, said he relied on Fauci's counsel and praised him for \"his ability to break down complex science in simple terms to the American people to save lives.\" Fauci's actions during the AIDS epidemic helped marshal a scientific and government response that saved millions of lives. His approach to engaging AIDS activists also transformed the way patients and activists interacted with medical science for many diseases. \"Tony Fauci is a really interesting character in the history of the AIDS epidemic,\" said Jon Cohen, a journalist at Science magazine who wrote a book about Fauci's passionate but ultimately unsuccessful effort to develop an AIDS vaccine. \"He becomes the voice of science, he can translate science into English better than anyone, and he can speak to every president, every congressperson, every world leader, and he can speak to patients,\" Cohen said in an interview. Those abilities emerged during the earliest days of the AIDS epidemic, when the Reagan administration tried to downplay or ignore the deadly disease afflicting particularly gay men and users of drugs by injection, as well as people with hemophilia who died because their medication was derived from contaminated blood products. Dr. Fauci served as a panelist at the National AIDS Update Conference on Oct. 12 1989 at the San Francisco Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, Calif.\n                \n                    \n                    Deanne Fitzmaurice/The San Francisco Chronicle/Hearst Newspapers via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Dr. Fauci served as a panelist at the National AIDS Update Conference on Oct. 12 1989 at the San Francisco Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, Calif. Part of Fauci's strategy was to engage the patients and activists who were demanding not only answers but a rapid federal response. \"He was one of the few [powerful people in Washington] that opened his doors early to us to listen and to hear us out,\" said Peter Staley, one of the founding members of Act Up New York, a prominent AIDS activist group. \"And he was one of the few that wasn't afraid of us, and thought we had something to bring to the table.\" Staley recalls regular dinners that Fauci held in the home of a gay man who worked in his office. Those dinners \"would last for many hours over many bottles of wine, and we debated these issues, and it would sometimes get very heated,\" Staley said. They didn't always agree, \"but I came to respect the man intensely during that period.\" The AIDS activists pushed for being part of the research and having a seat at the table, as scientists and government officials figured out how to develop drugs and test vaccines to control the AIDS epidemic. Fauci also oversaw a laboratory at the NIH and saw patients throughout his long career, keeping connected to the science as well as the human dimensions of infectious disease. \"Tony won the respect of the angriest, most frustrated people because they saw him as an ally and because he listened to them and he incorporated them \u2014 he made them part of finding solutions,\" Cohen said. And that approach \"radically overhauled how we think about disease and research and patients, not just AIDS.\" Breast cancer activists adopted this cooperative approach and many other disease advocates followed suit. Fauci was also instrumental in an effort, undertaken by the George W. Bush administration, to make AIDS medicines available globally. The multibillion-dollar program, called the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, has saved millions of lives, primarily in Africa. Fauci's gift for communication put him at the center of many public health crises, in Republican as well as Democratic administrations. Those included viral outbreaks ranging from Zika and West Nile disease to the annual flu. To help calm a jittery American public during the Ebola scare in 2014, Fauci stepped up to the cameras and embraced an Ebola patient \u2014 a nurse, Nina Pham \u2014 who had been treated at the NIH. \"I want to tell you what a great pleasure, and in many respects a privilege it has been for me and the staff here ... to have had the opportunity to treat and care for and get to know such an extraordinarily courageous and lovely person,\" he said in his distinctive Brooklyn accent. His political acumen stood him in good stead with seven presidential administrations, starting with Ronald Reagan. No other leading federal scientist in modern times held a top position for as many years as Fauci did. Fauci even got a shout-out from George H.W. Bush during a 1988 vice presidential debate. The candidates had been asked to name their heroes, and Bush included Fauci in his list. \"You probably never heard of him,\" Bush said. \"He's a very fine researcher, top doctor at the National Institute[s] of Health. Working hard, doing something about research on this disease of AIDS.\" Fauci's biggest political challenge came during the Trump administration. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump frequently brought Fauci to the White House as a member of the Coronavirus Task Force, to participate in meetings and press conferences. But as the disease spiraled out of control, the president tired of Fauci's warnings. Fauci found diplomatic ways to correct the president's often errant statements about the coronavirus, for example when Trump wondered whether COVID-19 could be treated with bleach injections or by shining ultraviolet light into people. The relationship hit a low point a few days before Election Day, 2020, when a crowd at a Trump campaign rally in Opa-Locka, Fla., started changing \"Fire Fauci! Fire Fauci!\" Trump replied, \"Don't tell anybody, but let me wait until a little bit after the election. I appreciate the advice. He's been wrong on a lot,\" Trump continued. \"He's a nice man but he's been wrong on a lot.\" Trump did not fire Fauci, who had made some missteps during the early days of the pandemic. At first, scientists didn't fully understand how the virus spread or how to contain it. Fauci initially misjudged the degree to which the virus spread from people who had no symptoms of disease. He quickly changed his view as scientists learned more. Like many scientists, he was also uncertain about the value of masks early on. But he never wavered in his view that people needed to stop gathering in large numbers, to wash their hands, isolate if ill and otherwise to take personal responsibility to avoid spreading the virus. Those positions earned him the ire of some Americans, who felt public health guidance infringed on their personal freedom. It was also inconsistent with Trump's false claim that the pandemic was being overblown. Fauci had amassed a powerful following among people committed to a science-based response to COVID-19. His face popped up on T-shirts, coffee mugs and yard signs \u2014 and on Tony Fauci bobbleheads. He was even invited to throw the ceremonial first pitch at the start of the Washington Nationals' 2020 home opener, five months short of his 80th birthday. Suffice it to say it was outside the strike zone, a fact which the president noted among his complaints about Fauci's performance. (He redeemed himself two years later throwing a cleaner pitch this month in game between the Seattle Mariners and the New York Yankees, in Seattle.) Fauci threw the ceremonial first pitch before a game between the Seattle Mariners and the New York Yankees at T-Mobile Park on Aug. 9 in Seattle, Wash.\n                \n                    \n                    Alika Jenner/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Fauci threw the ceremonial first pitch before a game between the Seattle Mariners and the New York Yankees at T-Mobile Park on Aug. 9 in Seattle, Wash. With Biden's election, Fauci became the president's chief medical adviser. Fauci admitted in the administration's very first press briefing that it was a relief to work for a president who took the science seriously. \"I can tell you I take no pleasure at all in being in a situation of contradicting the president,\" he said. \"So, it was really something that you really feel you couldn't say something and there wouldn't be any repercussions. The idea that you can get up here and talk about what you know, and what the science is and that's it. Let the science speak. It is somewhat of a liberating feeling.\" Fauci's gift for communication made him a media star and a household name. But his fame also made him a target for critics of the federal government's COVID response and even for death threats. In January, at a Senate hearing on COVID, Fauci blamed rhetoric from Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., for sparking death threats against him and his family. Paul and other congressional Republicans have raised the idea of investigating Fauci after the midterm elections, if they win back control of the House or Senate. Throughout the COVID pandemic, and the nonstop media attention he received, Fauci continued to run one of the major institutes at the NIH. \"He in his very soul was a laboratorian, was a bench scientist,\" said Dr. Georges Benjamin, longtime head of the American Public Health Association. \"Here was a guy who loved that kind of work. And while he handled the administration and the bureaucracy well, that wasn't necessarily what he got up for every morning to do.\" Indeed, under Fauci's guidance, scientists at his institute aggressively pursued a vaccine for COVID-19. And, in an astonishing span of less than a year, they brought one into being, in partnership with the drug company Moderna.

The Jan. 6 committee held a prime-time hearing on Thursday \u2014 the last of its planned summertime hearings. It focused on the more than 3 hours between when former President Donald Trump's Ellipse speech on Jan. 6 ended and when his prerecorded video asking protesters to go home posted to Twitter later that afternoon. This story was updated throughout Thursday's hearing. Update 11:12 p.m. ET Cheney closes: The Wyoming Republican closed the hearing by focusing on Trump's actions despite the absence of evidence of fraud or conspiracy in the 2020 election. \"There was no evidence of fraud or irregularities sufficient to change the election outcome. Our courts had ruled. It was over,\" she said, adding that it didn't matter because Trump was looking for a way to stay in office. The committee played audio from a meeting former Trump political adviser Steve Bannon held with associates four days before the election, surfaced last week in a Mother Jones report, which included comments about Trump claiming victory and that the election was stolen if he saw that he was losing. \"What the new Steve Bannon audio demonstrates is Donald Trump's plan to falsely claim victory in 2020, no matter what the facts were, was premeditated,\" she said. \"Perhaps worse, he believed he could convince his voters to buy it, whether he had any actual evidence of fraud or not.\" Cheney turned back to the oath of office \u2013 emphasizing the argument that he broke the oath when he did not act during the violence to proactively call off the mob. \"Let me assure every one of you this: Our committee understands the gravity of this moment and the consequences for our nation. We have much work yet to do and we will see you all in September,\" she said right before adjourning. Update 10:37 p.m. ET Trump officials say they stayed in office to right the ship: Some Trump administration officials felt that choosing not to resign was a better way forward. Former White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and Eugene Scalia, then the labor secretary, both called to convene a Cabinet meeting. In a memo addressed to Trump, Scalia advised that the president no longer publicly question the election results, adding that, after Jan. 6, \"no one can deny this is harmful,\" wrote Scalia. Update 10:34 p.m. ET McCarthy blamed Trump, Republicans for violence: In a recording of calls with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, he is heard discussing a House resolution that called on Pence and the Trump Cabinet to remove the president from power. \"I've had it with this guy, what he did was unacceptable. Nobody can defend that and nobody should defend it,\" McCarthy said. In a separate call he said he asked Trump if he holds responsibility for what happened on Jan. 6, to which, McCarthy said, Trump said he had some responsibility. Luria said that private call between Trump and McCarthy is the only time Trump has allegedly claimed any responsibility for the insurrection and violence. Update 9:46 p.m. ET Pottinger and Matthews resigned after Trump tweet: Shortly before witness former Deputy National Security Adviser Matthew Pottinger returned to the White House from another unrelated meeting, he said an aide handed him a printed sheet of paper showing the 2:24 p.m. Trump tweet condemning Vice President Pence for lacking the \"courage\" to prevent the Electoral College votes certifying Joe Biden's victory. \"I was disturbed and worried to see that the president was attacking Vice President Pence for doing his constitutional duty,\" he said, describing Trump's tweet as the opposite of a \"de-escalation\" that he said was needed at the moment. \"That's why I'd said earlier that it looked like fuel being poured on the fire,\" he said. That was the moment, he told the committee, that he decided that would be his last day at the White House. \"I simply didn't want to be associated with the events that were unfolding on the Capitol.\" Former Deputy White House Press Secretary Sarah Matthews, who resigned hours after the insurrection, told the panel she remembered thinking that the tweet \"was essentially him giving the green light\" to the Trump supporters storming the Capitol and that it inappropriately justified their anger. She added that Trump's words have a strong influence over his supporters, something she said she's noted having worked as a spokesperson on his reelection campaign before becoming a deputy press secretary in his administration. \"They truly latch onto every word and every tweet that he says,\" she said. She called Trump's refusal to call off the mob \"indefensible.\" Update 9:21 p.m. ET Pence's Secret Service detail members feared for their lives: National Security Council staff were listening in real time to Secret Service radio traffic on Jan. 6 as agents were making active decisions of where to move Vice President Mike Pence and as they made calculations about the level of danger. Some even began making calls to family, fearing for their lives, said a security professional, whose identity was protected and who was working out of the White House that day. NSC chat logs from just after 2 p.m. show live updates on the breach of the Capitol: \"Service at the Capitol does not sound good right now,\" one reads at 2:24 p.m. \"The members of the VP detail at this time were starting to fear for their own lives,\" the security professional said in a recorded interview. \"There was a lot of yelling, a lot of very personal calls over the radio, so it was very disturbing...there were calls to say goodbye to family members.\" The panel then turned to recorded interviews of Jan. 6 protestors recalling anger towards Pence and disappointment in his decision to move forward with certifying the election. Update 9:13 p.m. ET 'In a state of shock' about Trump's plan to go to Capitol: Retired D.C. police Sgt. Mark Robinson, who was in the presidential motorcade on Jan. 6, testified that he and other law enforcement officials waited roughly between 45 minutes to an hour before the Secret Service gave word about whether or not Trump would go to the Capitol. Robinson said Trump was \"upset\" about not going to the Capitol and that there was a \"heated conversation,\" though he did not corroborate details about a physical altercation between the former president and his lead Secret Service agent Bobby Engel, as was relayed second-hand in testimony from Cassidy Hutchinson. An unidentified White House aide testified that Deputy Chief of Staff Tony Ornato said that Trump was \"irate\" when Engel refused to take him to the Capitol, and Engel did not refute that. Another unidentified former White House security official said in a recording that \"we were all in a state of shock\" over Trump's plan to go to the Capitol. \"We all knew what that implicated and what that meant, that this was no longer a rally. That this was going to move to something else if he physically walked to the Capitol. I don't know if you want to use the word 'insurrection,' 'coup,' whatever \u2013 we all knew that this would move from a normal, democratic, you know, public event, into something else.\" The official said that this was before the Capitol was breached but that Trump's intent to lead tens of thousands of people to the Capitol \"was grounds to be alarmed.\" Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va., discussed committee efforts to obtain information from the Secret Service, which deleted many text messages from Jan. 5 and 6. Some Secret Service witnesses have retained private counsel, according to Luria. Update 8:42 p.m. ET Opening statements: Rep. Elaine Luria opened her presentation with a recap of the past few hearings, detailing the events of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, including the two pipe bombs that were found in Washington, D.C., and the breaching of the Capitol barriers. Luria said the \"ways Trump tried to stop the peaceful transfer of power\" was a betrayal of his oath of office to swear to \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" The hearing, she said, will focus on what the former president was doing in the meantime, following his speech on the Ellipse. \"Virtually everyone told president Trump to condemn the violence in clear and unmistakable terms,\" said Luria in opening statements, adding that the former president did not do so until 4:17 p.m. \"President Trump refused to act because of his selfish desire to stay in power.\" Rep. Adam Kinzinger, one of two Republicans on the panel and like Luria a military veteran, opened his statements by making the argument that the mob was \"accomplishing president Trump's purpose\" by delaying the count of the ballot certification. \"He chose not to act,\" Kinzinger said. Update 8:20 p.m. ET More hearings in the fall: The House Jan. 6 committee will reconvene in September for additional hearings, according to Chair Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., and Vice Chair Liz Cheney, R-Wyo. \"As we've made clear throughout these hearings, our investigation goes forward,\" Thompson said at the start of Thursday's hearing. Cheney said, \"In the course of these hearings, we have received new evidence and new witnesses have bravely stepped forward. Efforts to litigate and overcome immunity and executive privilege claims have been successful and those continue. Doors have opened, new subpoenas have been issued, and the dam has begun to break.\" Original story is below: The Jan. 6 committee is expected to piece together what the former president was doing while he was out of the public eye on Jan. 6 and will zero in on the argument that \"he was the sole person that could have called off the mob but chose not to,\" according to committee aides. During those 187 minutes, pressure mounted for him to call off the mob and tell rioters to stop. For the committee, which has argued that Trump welcomed the violence, what he said to aides and what he was thinking is key. Plenty of timelines have sketched out how most of the day unfolded, but for more than 3 hours, Trump went dark as a mob attacked the U.S. Capitol. The committee has had to work to put together an account of what he was doing then because public records have been hard to come by. Two former White House officials who served under Trump will testify at Thursday's hearing \u2014 former National Security Council member Matthew Pottinger and one-time Deputy White House Press Secretary Sarah Matthews \u2014 three sources familiar with the committee's work told NPR. Both resigned shortly after Jan. 6. Reps. Elaine Luria, a Democrat, and Adam Kinzinger, one of two panel Republicans, are expected to take a lead at the hearing, and Rep. Bennie Thompson will chair the hearing remotely due to his COVID-19 diagnosis. Over the last seven hearings, the Democrat-led committee has laid out its case that the former president was at the center of an election fraud conspiracy that ultimately led to the deadly insurrection at the Capitol. Witnesses, including former Trump and White House officials and staff, have appeared in person and in previously taped interviews to provide details on how the then-president knew he lost but pursued efforts to pressure state officials, lawmakers and the Justice Department to overturn the election in his favor. Although this is the last scheduled hearing, the panel has left the door open for more. The panel had originally envisioned six hearings throughout June but extended them into July as it collected more information. The committee is planning to issue a first report this fall followed by a final report later in the year.",

Dozens of prospective jurors filed into a federal courthouse just down the street from the U.S. Capitol on Monday on the first day of  the trial of former Donald Trump political adviser Steve Bannon, who's charged with contempt of Congress for flouting subpoenas from the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection. They were asked a lot of questions about Bannon, a conservative media star,  such as whether they've written or said anything about him, and also about the committee, which is expected to wrap up its summer hearings on its investigation into the Capitol attack this week. As spectators and press crammed into the courthouse for the high-profile case, the potential jurors patiently waited in hallways, reading their phones, or books or magazines. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols said the final phase of jury selection would conclude Tuesday morning, when lawyers pare down the pool of 22 prospective jurors to 12 jurors and two alternates. Then, opening statements will begin in what appears to be a speedy trial. \"You are not permitted to discuss this case with anyone,\" the judge said as he excused the smaller group of possible jurors. He asked them to avoid reading anything overnight about the Bannon prosecution and told them not to tweet, text, blog or email. The whole government case could take just one day, as prosecutors have only a few witnesses, including an FBI agent and the general counsel of the House Select Committee on January 6th. It is still not clear if Bannon will testify in his defense. Bannon faces two counts of criminal contempt of Congress for blowing off the House panel's demands for documents and testimony about the Jan. 6, 2021, siege on the Capitol. Trump supporters, including members of extremist groups, broke through barricades that day with the aim of overturning the 2020 presidential election, which Trump lost. Bannon has said that when he did not honor the subpoenas he was following orders from Trump, who asserted executive privilege. But Nichols, a Trump appointee, didn't see it that way.  First, Trump's lawyer says that isn't what happened and Trump did not assert the privilege when it came to Bannon. The privilege is supposed to protect confidential conversations among people in the government, but Bannon had been gone from the White House for over a year. Also, President Joe Biden has said that the privilege should not shield information about the Capitol rioters or those who may have helped plot the worst attack on the government since the war of 1812.Even though he didn't comply with the subpoena, the Jan. 6 committee has still shown footage of Bannon and discussed him at its hearings this summer. The House panel found phone records suggesting Bannon had at least two calls with Trump on Jan. 5, 2021, the day before the attack. The panel wants to dig into remarks he made on his podcast after the first conversation, when he said that \"all hell is going to break loose tomorrow\" and called Jan. 6 \"game day.\" The committee also is looking into  whether he was more involved in the planning of the riot, which left more than 140 law enforcement officers injured and several people dead in the days that followed.",

Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), vice chair of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol, says Cassidy Hutchinson showed great patriotism when she testified about inner workings of the White House that day. Former President Donald Trump poses a \"domestic threat\" to the U.S. unlike any other, Rep. Liz Cheney said, telling her fellow Republicans that if they choose to back Trump's lies about a stolen election, they're also undermining the country. Her party is facing an existential choice, she said. \"Republicans cannot both be loyal to Donald Trump and loyal to the Constitution,\" Cheney said in a speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in Simi Valley, Calif. Cheney, R-Wyo., is the vice chair of the House Jan. 6 committee.  She spoke one day after Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to Trump White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, shared shocking details about Trump's actions on the day of the insurrection, including demanding that metal detectors be taken away so his armed supporters wouldn't have to worry about surrendering their weapons. \"We are confronting a domestic threat we have never faced before,\" Cheney said. \"And that is a former president who is attempting to unravel the foundations of our constitutional republic. And he is aided by Republican leaders and elected officials who have made themselves willing hostages to this dangerous and irrational man.\" \"Some in my party are embracing former President Trump. And even after all we have seen, they are enabling his lies,\" she said. But the threat is too great to condone or ignore, Cheney added. Hutchinson \u2014 whose testimony also detailed Trump's temper tantrums, and an account of the president attempting to take control of his limousine \u2014 is just one of the young women who have come forward to testify, Cheney said. They include people who worked on the Trump campaign, in the Trump White House and on Capitol Hill, she added. Cheney contrasted Hutchinson's patriotism and bravery in speaking out to \"her superiors, men many years older. A number of them are hiding behind executive privilege, anonymity, and intimidation.\" Cheney also urged girls and young women to aspire to leadership roles, saying they're vitally needed. \"These days, for the most part, men are running the world,\" she said with a wry smile. \"And it is really not going that well.\" Acknowledging policy differences she has with Democrats, Cheney criticized President Biden's administration for its handling of the economy and other issues. But, she said, the country now stands at the edge of an abyss, \"and we must pull back.\" \"One of my Democratic colleagues said to me recently that he looked forward to the day when he and I could disagree again,\" she added. \"And believe me, I share that sentiment. Because when we can disagree again about substance and policy, that will mean that our politics have righted themselves\" and toxicity, racism and anti-democratic forces have been rejected. The American people should demand excellence from their elected officials, Cheney said, echoing an idea from earlier in her speech: \"We must not elect people who are more loyal to themselves or to power than they are to our Constitution.\" The sentiment, which once might have seemed a matter of course in U.S. politics, drew a round of cheers and sustained applause.",

            "article_content": "The House Select Committee investigating the Capitol siege will focus on efforts by former President Donald Trump to pressure the Justice Department to pursue baseless claims of election fraud.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Each day of hearings on January 6 explores a different way that a former president tried to undermine this republic. LEILA FADEL, HOST: On Tuesday, Republican state officials testified that Donald Trump asked them to violate their oaths of office. Today, the hearings focus on the Department of Justice. Trump's own appointees to run the department have said he wanted them to promote election lies. INSKEEP: NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson is covering the hearings. Carrie, good morning. CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: Why do the former president's own appointees say that he went too far at DOJ? JOHNSON: Well, the Justice Department is not supposed to do the personal political bidding of the president, but that's exactly what we're likely to hear today from the committee, that the former president misused this department to try to cling to power, doing things like trying to get Justice to appoint a special counsel to probe nonexistent fraud. We know former Attorney General Bill Barr told Trump all these claims about election fraud were nonsense. Barr resigned in December 2020, but right after that, former President Trump started putting the squeeze on other top officials at Justice. There were something like nine calls or meetings demanding DOJ officials investigate fraud claims over the course of just a few weeks. Here's how the acting deputy attorney general, Rich Donoghue, put it in a deposition. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICH DONOGHUE: And I said something to the effect of, sir, we've done dozens of investigations, hundreds of interviews. The major allegations are not supported by the evidence developed. JOHNSON: Donoghue says he told the former president he was dead wrong when he made claims about fraud in Georgia, for example. INSKEEP: Yeah, we've already seen the video of that deposition. Now he testifies in person before the committee today. Is he the only person who is saying this? JOHNSON: No. We expect to see former acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and Steve Engel, who led the Office of Legal Counsel at Justice. It's unusual for lawyers at this level to testify in public about interactions with the White House, but the current president, Joe Biden, decided that executive privilege should not apply to shield these conversations about an effort to overthrow the 2020 election. One person we're not going to be hearing from today is former DOJ official Jeffrey Clark. He's described as being sympathetic to Trump's baseless claims of fraud and also drafting a letter to officials in Georgia to try to help Trump's cause. Clark did appear for a deposition, but he invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination there. INSKEEP: Now, why would Clark need to invoke the Fifth Amendment? JOHNSON: Well, an investigation by the Senate Judiciary Committee found Clark was going around his boss at the Justice Department, taking private meetings with the White House and at least one Republican member of Congress, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania. Trump had seriously considered whether to fire Jeff Rosen and install Jeff Clark as the acting attorney general. Steve, this all came to a head only three days before January 6. In a bizarre meeting at the White House some people have likened to Trump's old reality TV show \"The Apprentice,\" virtually the entire DOJ leadership team threatened to resign if Trump gave Jeff Clark the job. Here's again what Rich Donoghue told the committee. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONOGHUE: The president said, suppose I do this. Suppose I replace Jeff Rosen with him, Jeff Clark. What do you do? And I said, sir, I would resign immediately. There is no way I'm serving one minute under this guy, Jeff Clark. JOHNSON: The prospect of Justice Department officials resigning in protest, of course, has a historical precedent, Steve. It happened 49 years ago during Watergate. We call it the Saturday Night Massacre. That was avoided here narrowly by some of the men we're going to hear from testify today. INSKEEP: OK. We'll be listening. Carrie, thanks so much.

The fifth hearing of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol will focus on former President Donald Trump's pressure on the Department of Justice to help him overturn the 2020 election. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, one of two Republicans on the committee, will lead Thursday's hearing, set for 3 p.m. It is expected to last roughly two hours like previous hearings. This hearing was supposed to take place last Wednesday but was postponed for what panel member Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., called \"technical issues.\" Former acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and former acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue are among Thursday's witnesses. Both refused to give in to Trump's efforts to get the DOJ to advance his fraudulent claims of voter fraud and overturn the election. When former Attorney General Bill Barr announced his resignation in December 2020, Trump badgered Rosen and Donoghue in at least nine calls and meetings, according to a report by the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen,\" Trump told the two men, according to their testimony. Also to appear in Thursday's hearing is Steven Engel, who headed DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel. Engel was one of the officials who told the former president he would have no choice but to quit if Trump replaced the acting attorney general with environmental lawyer Jeffrey Bossert Clark. Clark was reportedly more willing to go along with Trump's fraudulent claims of a stolen election. Several other DOJ lawyers, including Donoghue, also threatened to quit if Clark was appointed. \"The President said 'Suppose I do this. Suppose I replace him, Jeff Rosen, with him, Jeff Clark. What do you do?' And I said 'Sir, I would resign immediately. There is no way I'm serving one minute under this guy, Jeff Clark,'\" Donoghue said in a piece of video testimony played at Tuesday's hearing. Clark appeared before the House committee in February for a deposition, but pled the Fifth dozens of times. It's unusual for DOJ lawyers at this level to testify in public about interactions with the White House, but President Biden said that executive privilege should not apply to conversations involving Trump's efforts to overthrow the 2020 election. The committee plans to outline several ways in which Trump pressured the DOJ and tried to use it for his own personal agenda. Committee aides said in a call with reporters that the hearing will lay out how Trump wanted the DOJ to publicly state there was election fraud. More testimony from Barr and other officials is expected. The committee will also show how Trump asked the DOJ to file lawsuits with his campaign on behalf of his election fraud claims. He also pressured the DOJ to appoint a special counsel to look into his claims and he wanted it to issue letters to states to question the sanctity of their elections. Thursday's hearing will also detail a Jan. 3 meeting in the Oval Office between Trump and senior DOJ officials as the former president tried to place Clark as the head of the department. In the last four hearings, the committee has laid out the case against Trump and how he was at the center of the election fraud conspiracy which ultimately led to the deadly insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The committee has presented evidence for how Trump ignored several in his circle who said his claims of election fraud were false, and then proceeded to pressure Vice President Mike Pence and state election officials to overturn the election in his favor. Thursday's hearing is the fifth of several that were supposed to take place in June. But now committee members are saying the process could go into July. Committee Chair Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., told reporters that today's hearing will be the last for this month with more hearings to come after Congress' July 4th recess. The House will reconvene the week of July 11, and Thompson indicated that's the earliest hearings would  resume. Thompson said the new evidence the committee has includes hours of video footage handed over by a British documentarian who followed Trump, his family and aides, and conducted interviews with them, for weeks before and after the 2020 election. Thompson also said there is \"a lot of information to the tip line\" that the committee has set up. You can watch the hearing starting at 3 p.m. ET on NPR.org.

They later went on to break in and attempt to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election results. The House select committee on Jan. 6 holds its first hearing on Thursday, in prime time at 8 p.m. ET, promising to weave together a narrative from the findings of its year-long probe with \"previously unseen material\" about the attack on the Capitol. Some committee members have teased that there will be \"bombshells\" and that the public will be surprised by what is revealed. Pressed about the risk of overhyping the news, given that many details have already leaked out, committee member Jamie Raskin, D-Md., told reporters this week: \"We're not in the business of entertainment. We're in the business of trying to communicate to the American people the gravity and the immensity of these events.\" The majority-Democrat committee, charged with investigating the insurrection that pro-Trump extremists hoped would help overturn the 2020 election, has interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses, including members of former President Donald Trump's family and administration, as well as law enforcement officials and aides who were under siege for hours on Jan. 6, 2021. Thursday's hearing, the first of six, will feature two live witnesses: Caroline Edwards, a U.S. Capitol police officer and the first law enforcement member injured by rioters on the West Front plaza; and Nick Quested, a filmmaker who accompanied those who breached the building and captured the chaotic scene. Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., and Vice Chair Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., will make opening statements and the panel will also show videotaped depositions from senior Trump White House, campaign and administration officials. The committee is expected to issue a voluminous report with recommendations in September. Some members have already indicated they back changes to the Electoral Count Act, the law governing the process for Congress to count and certify electoral votes. While the committee has the power to make legislative recommendations, it cannot bring any criminal charges and can only make a criminal referral to the Justice Department. Here are key areas the committee will discuss during the hearings. Cheney has repeatedly raised questions about the lack of information about what then-President Trump was doing at the White House when violent protesters breached the Capitol. The rioters threatened lawmakers and the vice president, chanting to \"hang Mike Pence,\" and there was a period of time with no response from Trump. Hours earlier he told his supporters on the Ellipse outside the White House, \"We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\" Trump suggested he would walk with his supporters to the Capitol but instead returned to the White House.

Trump supporters then marched to the Capitol and some violent protesters attempted to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 election. Several committee members point to 187 minutes that afternoon, where it's unclear what the president was doing, as a key focus of their investigation. They have worked to fill in the gap through interviews with multiple witnesses, including Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner. They've also subpoenaed documents, including the president's daily schedule and phone log. According to select committee aides, Thursday's hearing will feature testimony from those inside the White House and the Trump campaign, including family members. These will be video clips of taped depositions. The committee issued at least 20 publicly announced subpoenas tied to a wide-ranging scheme across several states to submit a slate of fake electors to Congress as a way of altering the results of the 2020 presidential election in the hopes of keeping Trump office. The subpoenas included Kelli Ward, the chair of the Arizona Republican Party, in addition to two GOP political candidates in swing states. Committee demands for testimony and records were also issued to the Republican nominee to be Pennsylvania's next governor, Doug Mastriano, and the GOP candidate Mark Finchem, who is running to be the next secretary of state in Arizona. In some cases, state officials helped organized events where members of Trump's legal team and others shared false claims of voter fraud. The effort continued up to the day of the attack. For example, Finchem said he had to deliver \"evidence\" to Pence to postpone the certification of the election results. The committee also obtained details that then-Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani pressured state lawmakers to reject election results in Michigan. Giuliani also has testified before the committee. The efforts have also drawn the attention of prosecutors in multiple states. What the committee has learned about the financial story behind the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol has remained one of the most closely held parts of the probe. However, it has shared some clues through publicly announced subpoenas and court filings. For example, a Republican National Committee lawsuit revealed the panel was looking into a push by Trump for donations after he lost his 2020 bid for reelection. The committee's Feb. 23 subpoena of RNC vendor Salesforce said the company hosted Trump emails asking for new donations that included false claims of election fraud. It was part of a central question the panel hoped to answer: Did Trump find new ways after his loss to keep the money coming by shifting to a \"Stop the Steal\" effort? The panel has also issued subpoenas for banking records and shared in letters to certain subpoenaed witnesses that it's trying to track down appearance fees for the Jan. 6 rally \u2014 that is, whether any of the speakers collected payment that day. A combination of dark-money groups, nonprofits and super PACs funded the rally before the attack, but the panel has also probed whether any of that money help aid the insurrection.

The committee has also taken strong interest in the extreme right-wing groups that breached the Capitol. Among their publicly announced subpoenas, the panel last year demanded testimony and documents from the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers. It also demanded testimony for Henry \"Enrique\" Tarrio, who on Jan. 6 was chairman of the Proud Boys; Elmer Stewart Rhodes, president of the Oath Keepers; and Robert Patrick Lewis, chairman of 1st Amendment Praetorian, a less well-known group that provided security at multiple rallies leading up to Jan. 6. The groups were part of a larger organized network that helped launch the attack on the Capitol, the committee's members have said. The interest in the groups and their leaders has also escalated in recent months in the criminal probe led by the Justice Department. Several members of the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys have also been charged with seditious conspiracy, and some have led to convictions with guilty pleas. Select committee aides emphasize the \"vast majority\" of witnesses have cooperated and helped the committee amass \"a mountain of new evidence.\" But some senior former officials in the Trump administration and House of Representatives refused to appear or provide documents. Former adviser Steve Bannon refused to cooperate and was ultimately charged with contempt of Congress by the Justice Department last November. His trial is slated for this summer. Last week Peter Navarro, former trade adviser, faced a similar charge. Former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows initially cooperated and turned over a trove of emails and text messages, but then reversed course and refused to a closed-door interview and to turn over remaining materials the panel requested.  Meadows sued the panel, and his attorney raised concerns about executive privilege, even though the Biden White House has waived any claims to that protection. Former senior aide Dan Scavino also defied a subpoena. The House referred the refusals from both him and Meadows to the Justice Department, which informed the committee last week they would not pursue contempt charges against them \u2014 news the panel criticized, arguing they had central information to provide in the investigation. In a rare move, five sitting House Republicans were also subpoenaed for testimony and documents. Most notably, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who publicly talked about his phone conversation with Trump on the day of the attack, was asked to appear voluntarily and then given a subpoena. McCarthy \u2014 along with Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., and Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz. \u2014 have all pushed back against the subpoenas and demanding details about evidence and questions they would face, making it all but certain they will not participate in any fashion. It's unclear whether the panel would vote to hold any in criminal contempt, and if it did that dispute could end up in court.

A federal grand jury has indicted Peter Navarro on two counts of contempt of Congress after he failed to comply with a subpoena from the House of Representatives select committee investigating the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Navarro, former President Donald Trump's trade adviser, had refused to appear for a deposition and to produce documents for the committee investigating the siege of the Capitol that was intended to stop Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 election. The indictment was returned on Thursday and unsealed on Friday. Navarro appeared in court on Friday afternoon, where he accused prosecutors of \"playing hardball\" and blasted the government for his public arrest.

Two sources told NPR on Friday that the Justice Department would not prosecute former Trump White House aide Dan Scavino and former chief of staff Mark Meadows. Legal experts said such a case would be difficult given that both had partially cooperated and worked much more closely with Trump. Navarro has argued he should be immune from testimony because he is shielded by executive privilege through former President Trump. President Joe Biden has argued the violent protest on Jan. 6, 2021, where pro-Trump rioters stormed through barricades and injured law enforcement officers, was a severe attack on democracy that doesn't deserve those legal shields. The Democrat-led U.S. House voted in April to hold Navarro and Scavino in criminal contempt of Congress for defying subpoenas. Only two Republicans, Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, who both serve on the committee, voted for the referrals. The panel had issued a 34-page report and two dozen exhibits documenting attempts get both Navarro and Scavino to cooperate. The House has also approved referring contempt charges against Meadows and former White House aide Steve Bannon to the Justice Department. DOJ has indicted Bannon and his trial is set for this summer. Navarro's indictment comes less than a week before the committee's major prime-time hearing laying out what it has uncovered so far in its nearly year-long investigation.  Altogether, the panel is expected to hold about a half dozen public hearings in June and release a report on its findings in September.",

            "article_content": "In the early 1970s, Forest Hills, Queens, became a national symbol of white, middle class resistance to integration. Instead of public schools, this fight was over public housing. It was a fight that got so intense the press called it \"The Battle of Forest Hills.\" How did a famously liberal neighborhood become a hotbed of reaction and backlash? And how did a small group of angry homeowners change housing policy for the entire country? The story of housing within Forest Hills begins in an enclave within the neighborhood called Forest Hills Gardens. The Gardens looks like an American's imagination of an English village: most of the houses are Tudor-style, instead of a grid, the streets are curved and unlike most of New York City, you need to have a permit to park here. Station Square in Forest Hills Gardens, Queens.\n                \n                    \n                    Cassandra Giraldo \n                    \n                \nhide caption Forest Hills Gardens was built in the first decade of the 20th century as an urban oasis \u2013 to prove that you could live the good life within the city limits, away from the chaos and the \"riff raff.\" It was designed by city planners not just for the people who were going to live here, but to serve as an example of a model neighborhood for the rest of the country. The Gardens had always been an intentionally exclusive community. You had to go through a background check and an interview to get in, and everyone who got in was white Around the time the Gardens was created, the field of city planning was beginning to take off in the United States. One of these early city planners was a man named Clarence Perry, who lived in Forest Hills Gardens \u2013 and was inspired by the Gardens to create something called the Neighborhood Unit. Clarence Perry's neighborhood unit.\n                \n                    \n                    Regional Plan of New York and Its Environs (New York: Regional Plan Association, 1929), Vol. VII, 88. \n                    \n                \nhide caption The Neighborhood Unit was a little map of what Perry believed was the ideal neighborhood. It certainly looked like Forest Hills Gardens: curved streets, clear boundaries on the outside and a school at the center. The central idea of the diagram was that the school is the thing that sets the geographic parameters for the neighborhood. Additionally, Perry also advocated for a high degree of \"sameness\" in communities. He claimed that \"the great foe to community life is heterogeneity. The new method to which I refer produces homogeneity. Put like people together and give them common facilities to care for and associations among them are bound to spring into existence.\" P.S. 101 in Forest Hills Gardens, Queens.\n                \n                    \n                    Cassandra Giraldo \n                    \n                \nhide caption The Neighborhood Unit turned out to be so successful that one planning historian called it \"The most influential diagram in American city planning.\" Over the following decades, hundreds of cities and towns across the U.S. used the Neighborhood Unit as a template to define neighborhood boundaries in relation to schools, then use those boundaries to preserve racial separation. The homogeneity of Forest Hills Gardens was not only about race. For decades, Forest Hills Gardens remained elite, white, and Christian. But the Gardens was only one part of Forest Hills. Ironically, as the rest of Forest Hills grew up around the Gardens, it became famously Jewish. A treelined street in Forest Hills Gardens, Queens.\n                \n                    \n                    Cassandra Giraldo \n                    \n                \nhide caption Like other groups of so-called \"ethnic whites,\" many Jewish New Yorkers saw higher incomes after World War II and started to leave their old neighborhoods in Brooklyn and the Bronx. If you couldn't yet afford the suburbs, you moved to Queens. And for many Jews, that meant Forest Hills. By 1970, the neighborhood was estimated to be two-thirds Jewish and 97 percent white. It's not that all Jews were like the anarchists and labor organizers who moved to Rochdale Village (as described in episode two), but there was a connotation of liberalism associated with American Jews at the time. This put Forest Hills on the city's radar when they went looking for places to build new public housing. Previously, the New York City Housing Authority had gotten into a pattern of building almost exclusively in neighborhoods that were in the throes of white flight and disinvestment, places like South Jamaica. However, when John Lindsay became the mayor in 1966, he wanted to change things up. In his first year in office, Lindsay announced his intention to build 11 \"scatter-site\" housing projects \u2013 essentially build projects in neighborhoods scattered throughout the city, which didn't yet have public housing. One of them would be in Forest Hills. Although the program had good intentions, to break down the walls of racial and social segregation in the city through housing, it wasn't very popular with the neighbors. The initial plan for Forest Hills was that NYCHA would build 840 apartments, with 40 percent of them reserved for the elderly. Once word got out, the resistance started. At the forefront of the opposition was a man named Jerry Birbach. Jerry Birbach.\n                \n                    \n                    Eddie Hausner/The New York Tim\u200bes/Redux\n                    \n                \nhide caption Birbach worked in real estate. One journalist back in the day described his business like this: \"He buys old tenement buildings, evicts the tenants, renovates the buildings and rents them at a higher rate. He says that he is thereby helping to improve the city's housing stock.\" His enemies called him a \"slumlord.\" Galvanizing his fellow middle class, tax paying neighbors, Birbach headed the Forest Hills Residents Association. Not a week went by without his Association putting on some kind of protest or parade. They would interrupt public meetings, shouting and chanting and marching around. They'd storm the stage, commandeer the microphone. On the other side of this fight was the chairman of the New York City Housing Authority: Simeon Golar. When Golar's father lost his job, his family came to New York \u2013 part of the Great Migration of Black people moving north, looking for opportunity. One of the opportunities they found there was public housing. In fact, Simeon Golar was the first person ever to run the Housing Authority who had actually lived in public housing. Simeon Golar.\n                \n                    \n                    Neal Boenzi/The New York Times/Redux\n                    \n                \nhide caption Golar took his job seriously. If NYCHA had been its own city, it would have been bigger than Pittsburgh \u2014 and Golar was like the mayor. When he took over the agency in 1970, there were 600,000 people living in public housing. And 150,000 more trying to get in. The scatter-site housing program may have started with Mayor Lindsay, but Simeon Golar became its public face. So it was up to Golar to take the heat from the press, counter all the misinformation flying around and try to make some friends in Forest Hills. But Jerry Birbach and his constituents made things pretty difficult for Golar. On November 18, 1971, the Housing Authority announced that construction of public housing in Forest Hills would begin. That night, Birbach rallied hundreds of his followers in a march through the neighborhood. They blocked traffic in the streets and on the highway, armed with picket signs and flaming torches. Forest Hills residents protest Mayor John Lindsay's administration's plans to put three 24-story towers for mostly Black and Puerto Rican residents in their largely white, Jewish enclave in Queens, Dec. 19, 1971.\n                \n                    \n                    Michael Evans/The New York Times/Redux\n                    \n                \nhide caption One of their signs read, \"Lindsay is trying to destroy Queens. Now Queens will destroy Lindsay.\" When they got to the project site, they started throwing rocks and bricks and even hurled their torches over the chain link fence. The next day, Jerry's Torchlight Parade was on the front page of the New York Times. Mayor Lindsay called the demonstrators \"deplorable.\" Forest Hills was now, officially, a national story. This was a national story because it had national stakes. If New York City gave into these protests, Forest Hills could become a template for other middle-class communities who wanted to stop any use of government housing for the purpose of integration. Birbach and his allies swore this had nothing to do with racism. It wasn't Black people they were afraid of; it was poor people. As one demonstrator put it, \"I want to live with decent people, whether they be Black, white, yellow or what have you. But I don't want to live with welfare recipients that are leeches that live from decent, hard working people. And I don't want to live here, so I'm moving.\" This was a constant theme: people talked about public housing like an infection. So-called \"welfare people\" move in, everybody else moves out. There goes the neighborhood. Just like in South Jamaica after World War II, there were vultures circling in the sky over Forest Hills, ready to profit off of people's fears. In late 1971, it was reported that \"blockbusting\" had already begun in Forest Hills. That is, real estate agents were going around the neighborhood, trying to scare people into selling their property for cheap. Even so, that doesn't fully explain the intensity of these protests. You just can't separate all this talk about welfare and crime from race. Jews were supposed to be synonymous with liberalism and Forest Hills was supposed to be a liberal neighborhood. So where were all the liberals? In fact, there were some people in the neighborhood who supported the plan, but the opposition had stifled their voices. Some local Jewish leaders claimed that Forest Hills was proof that the Mayor was targeting Jewish communities for destruction \u2013 that hardworking, middle class Jews were under attack by what might now be called the \"woke\" liberal establishment. Picket signs referred to the mayor as \"Adolf Lindsay.\" At seemingly the final moment before the project would begin, Mayor Lyndsay shifted. Facing increasing opposition, Lyndsay had called in Mario Cuomo, who was then a lawyer in private practice, to negotiate in Forest Hills. When Cuomo finally published his report, he called for cutting the size of the project in half. Twelve-story towers instead of 24; 400 apartments instead of 800. \"Forest Hills Diary: The Crisis of Low-Income Housing,\" a published account of the diary Mario Cuomo kept while working in Forest Hills.\n                \n                    \n                    N/A\n                    \n                \nhide caption Cuomo made a lot of different arguments for reducing the size of the project, but one was strategic: if the Housing Authority didn't cut the number of units in Forest Hills, the backlash might, \"jeopardize scatter-site housing in this city for many years to come.\" After a 10-hour public hearing, the \"Cuomo compromise\" was finally approved. Policy dictated by fear has consequences. Sure, those buildings went up in Forest Hills, but the devil's in the details. After 10,000 people applied for 432 apartments, they found ways to cherry-pick the first crop of tenants such that 70 percent of them were white. And the example of Forest Hills had ripple effects across the country \u2013 just as many civil rights leaders had feared. At the end of 1972, President Nixon froze all federal funds for new public housing construction \u2013 which brought the scatter-site program in New York to a grinding halt. Then he announced that in the future, instead of building homes for poor people, the federal government would give them subsidies, and let them find housing for themselves. Nixon's top housing official in New York said this would allow for integration at a more \"gradual\" pace, and prevent battles like the one in Forest Hills. Forest Hills didn't just mark the end of attempts to use public housing to integrate neighborhoods. It marked the beginning of the end of large scale public housing, period. In the 30 years before Forest Hills, 150,000 units of public housing had been built in New York City. In the 30 years after Forest Hills, only about 30,000 units were added \u2013 and most of those were renovations or reserved for the elderly. Listen to Code Switch on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.

            "article_content": "Jerome Adams, who served as Trump's U.S. surgeon general, says he hopes that coming out of the pandemic, people can have a healthier respect for the scientific process.\n                \n                    \n                    Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jerome Adams, who served as Trump's U.S. surgeon general, says he hopes that coming out of the pandemic, people can have a healthier respect for the scientific process. Before there were mask requirements or recommendations or candle tests or homemade mask drives, in the very early days of the pandemic, the U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams published what would become a notorious tweet: \"Seriously people \u2014 STOP BUYING MASKS! They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if health care providers can't get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!\" As the supply increased and science emerged showing masks were effective in stopping the spread of the virus, Adams encouraged the use of masks. These days, no longer in his federal government role, Adams is still tweeting about masks in the post-transportation mandate world. He's sharing his anger at how a Delta pilot suggested he take his mask off to breathe free, and describing the challenges of a rideshare driver with a double-lung transplant whose customers no longer needed to mask in his car. NPR called up Adams to get his thoughts about masking in this moment of the pandemic: how he stands by his original tweet on masks, being in the room when Trump administration officials declined to institute a transportation mandate, and how to practice \"compassion\" toward each other in this mask-optional world. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. What do you think about the federal transportation mask mandate going away? It's been a little over a week now. I'm frustrated that it's going away, because there are still many people out there who can't protect themselves. From a scientific point of view, it's important for people to know that masking isn't the be-all and end-all, but it is incrementally effective as a public health mitigation measure in helping to slow the spread of the virus. Two-way masking \u2013 when we both wear a mask \u2013 is better than one-way masking, but one-way masking can be effective if you're wearing a high-quality mask like an N95. One of the challenges is that there are a lot of people who either can't get, or who can't wear, a tightly fitting mask. A key example would be kids under the age of five. We just don't have good-fitting masks for that population, so they rely on people around them to protect them. Which leads to mandates. It's clear that mandates are something that stokes a lot of energy, excitement and controversy in this country. What people don't realize is that mandates are the reason why you can swim safely in a public swimming pool. They're why we can eat safely in restaurants without fear that the person preparing our food hasn't washed their hands. These are all public health mandates, and the idea that, 'Hey, everybody is on their own, mandates are inherently bad' is something that scares me, because it's going to have unintended consequences down the road. When I'm in the grocery store, when I'm on public transportation, I personally still wear a mask to protect me and my family, but also to protect the families of people I may encounter on the way who may not be able to protect themselves. You've been tweeting about your experiences in travel since the mask mandate has gone away. You were told to unmask by a pilot. You have had discussions with a medically vulnerable rideshare driver. So how are you thinking about masks in our tired and politically polarized society right now? I am hopeful that now we can actually have a real conversation about when and where and why we should mask. So my tweets lately have illustrated examples of, quite frankly, one of my neighbors not being so kind and compassionate toward me \u2013 the Delta pilot who came up to me unsolicited and told me to take my mask off, without recognizing why I was wearing a mask. One of the reasons I wear a mask is because my wife is being treated for cancer. You don't know by looking at someone what type of situation they're in. And it's important for us to understand that that's why we need to be compassionate for each other. I've talked about Mr. Melvin, who's a rideshare driver who I met, who had a double-lung transplant. Mr. Melvin was working a job, which is what we say we want Americans to do. He actually had a mask on. It wasn't an N95, but he didn't have access to high quality masks, so I actually gave him a five-pack of new N95 masks that I had on me \u2013 something the federal government, in my opinion, should be doing. We need to emphasize that not everyone has the tools that they need to protect themselves. We need to make sure everyone has an equitable chance to protect themselves, and recognize that in situations where they may not have that opportunity, they're relying on us to be compassionate and to protect them. I want to talk about your time in the Trump administration as surgeon general during the pandemic. First of all, your famous tweet at the very beginning when supplies were low and there wasn't good data on mask efficacy. I'm sure you've thought about that message a lot \u2013 what are you thinking now, looking back on it? I still come to the conclusion that I made the best recommendation I could to the American people based on the information that I had in the circumstances that were taking place at the time. The WHO and the CDC were saying the same thing that I was saying, so the science supported me. We knew that supplies weren't there for health care workers, so there was a further crisis being created because of hoarding of masks. And we didn't have the information that we needed from China about asymptomatic spread. The fact is, once that information trickled out of China and we then knew that it might be helpful for people to wear masks, we changed those recommendations. That's how science is supposed to work. People are very uncomfortable watching the sausage actually get made, particularly when it has immediate implications on their day-to-day lives \u2013 we've seen this play out over and over again during the pandemic. But I hope that coming out of the pandemic, we can have a healthier respect for the scientific process, and that people are more comfortable with what they say they want, and there's a more rapid translation of the science into reality. When you were surgeon general, masks became a political and public signal of how someone felt about the pandemic. Looking back, do you think there's more that public health officials could have done to prevent masks from becoming this political symbol? We had one of the most divisive presidential elections of modern times superimposed on top of a once-in-a-century pandemic that would have been difficult to deal with, no matter what. And that resulted in everything being politicized. Certainly, conservatives politicized masking to the detriment of society. But we also have people on the other side \u2013 liberals \u2013 who politicized masking. This was used as a tool to say either you're for Biden or you're for Trump, and that made it difficult. One of the things that I always tried to do was fall back on the science. I would screen every question through the lens of: What is the science saying? For example, I was asked whether or not people should go to Trump rallies in 2020. And my answer was that people need to understand their risks. They need to understand the environment they're going into, and they need to understand the tools that are available to help them stay safe. But it is not my place \u2013 as a scientist \u2013 to tell someone they shouldn't go to see the president of the United States any more than it's my place to tell them they shouldn't go to a George Floyd rally, because the science is the same. It's a risky situation, and it's riskier depending on your particular factors. I think we need to, as scientists, always fall back on the science and not let our biases and judgments about the worthiness of people's decisions enter into how we communicate the scientific risk. You were on the White House Coronavirus Task Force. I understand that in the fall of 2020, there were discussions about having the same kind of transportation mask mandate that the CDC ended up implementing under Biden. Do you remember those conversations? If the Trump administration had implemented the mask mandate on public transit, would masks have become as politically polarized? We had continual questions about what we should do from a scientific perspective, what we could legally do and what the public would accept. Those are the components that went into every calculation that we made. During our administration, there were certainly debates about whether or not we should have a federal transportation mask mandate. We had much greater limits on [mask] supply \u2013 that was a bigger variable for us than what it has been for the Biden administration. It was a [higher] bar for us to cross because we had limited amounts to be able to say, 'OK, we're going to mandate everyone do this, but we're not going to give you the tools that you need to actually be able to comply.' The other thing is that there are several judges out there who are of the opinion that such a mandate was not legal. We had legal advice that we couldn't do it or that it would be likely overturned. So for those two reasons, the Trump administration chose not to go ahead with a federal mask mandate [on transportation.] What are your thoughts or advice on how to be kind about masks in this particular moment? What I want people to understand is that many of us are privileged in different ways. Sometimes we're privileged because of the color of our skin. Sometimes we're privileged because of how much money we make. Sometimes we're privileged because of where we live. I live within 10 minutes of two major hospitals. But I grew up in a rural community where the nearest tertiary care center was over an hour and a half away. If we don't recognize those privileges, then we may not understand that other people don't have the same opportunities to make healthy choices that we do. When they don't have those opportunities, that's where society has to step up and say, 'We're going to provide you those opportunities or we're going to protect you.' What I say to people is remember the Mr. Melvins out there \u2013 the people who are trying their best to do the right thing but may not have the resources that you have to be able to do those things. I just hope that we can all understand how fortunate many of us are in different ways and how unfortunate other people are, and just have a little bit of compassion for those individuals who might not have the same opportunities to make a healthy choice as we do.",

Between fights over mask mandates and new legislation dictating how history should be taught, schools have become a battleground for America's culture wars. Recently, the Florida Department of Education announced that it was rejecting dozens of math textbooks because they incorporated \"prohibited topics\" or \"unsolicited strategies,\" such as critical race theory. New York Times national correspondent Dana Goldstein says Florida officials have given little evidence to back up these claims. Goldstein and her colleague Stephanie Saul reviewed 21 of the rejected math textbooks and found very little mention of race. Instead, Goldstein theorizes the objections related to the inclusion of topics concerning social-emotional learning. Goldstein says the rejected textbooks addressed social-emotional learning in a variety of ways. \"Some of them were quite awkward,\" she says. \"There was one fifth grade math textbook from McGraw-Hill that had sort of a simple fractions question, and then right underneath it said, 'How do you understand your feelings?'\" Other social-emotional lessons were more seamlessly integrated. One high school textbook asked students to rate from 1 t0 4 how much they struggled with a concept. Another included cartoon figures encouraging students to ask a friend how they solved a problem. \"And then there were lots of references to this idea of grit, this idea of perseverance, and reminders to children that math is hard and they should keep going to find the answer,\" Goldstein says. The goal of social-emotional learning is to provide kids with a set of skills that they can draw on when they face challenges later in life, Goldstein explains. But, she notes, some conservatives see it as something that opens the door to larger discussions about race, gender and sexuality. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis recently signed what critics have dubbed a \"Don't Say Gay\" bill, which prohibits school personnel from discussing sexual orientation or gender identity in kindergarten through third grade. He also signed the so-called \"Stop W.O.K.E. Act,\" which proponents say was designed to prevent both students and employees of private companies from feeling discomfort or personal guilt because of historical wrongs that have to do with race, gender or national origin. Ultimately, Goldstein says, the convergence of politics and education is nothing new: \"I'm the author of a history book about fights and debates about education since the 19th century till today, and one of the themes I draw out in my book is that there are always these moral panics over what goes on in schools, and we are definitely in a moment like that right now.\" But, she adds, our current battles over education are coming at a particularly critical time, when many kids have lost a year and a half of in-person schooling due to the pandemic. \"Instead of coming back with a huge focus on getting kids up to par emotionally [and] academically, and bringing parents in as a support for kids who have lived through a lot the past two years, instead, we're seeing this huge focus in many communities on these culture war issues,\" she says. \"It does call into question, for me, whether the classroom is just another front in this deeply divided and partisan political reality that we're all living through.\" On how right-wing activist Chris Rufo has made social-emotional learning a flashpoint for conservatives Rufo ... has been instrumental in sort of putting out the idea that any discussion of racial inequity is, in fact, \"critical race theory.\" Sort of introducing that terminology to conservative media and then, you know, pushing these laws that a third of states have passed, limiting how race, gender and sexuality are taught. ... From the critical race theory conversation, he then moved on to [a] LGBTQ set of issues and creating a real movement there to limit how those are talked about. ... Mr. Rufo stated to me that while social-emotional learning \"sounds positive and uncontroversial in theory, in practice, SEL serves as a delivery mechanism for radical pedagogy, such as critical race theory and gender deconstructionism.\" He continued to say that the intention of SEL is to \"soften children at an emotional level, reinterpret their normative behavior as an expression of repression, whiteness or internalized racism, and then rewire their behavior according to the dictates of left-wing ideology.\" I think one thing that really jumped out at me here was his notion that it would \"soften children\" to, you know, talk about their feelings and to encounter this social emotional learning content at school. A few people responded to my reporting on this saying like, this sounds really misogynist. Like it's almost it's too touchy-feely or too feminine for kids to talk about their feelings. But there's also an even more nefarious reading of this, you know, this idea of progressives or teachers as \"groomers,\" which is circulating very widely in right-wing social media right now. The idea that somehow by talking about these different subjects and school teachers are sort of actively almost converting kids to gayness or to transgenderism. On how many states in the U.S. choose their own textbooks It's fewer than half that, at the state level, reject or accept textbooks for use. But Florida is one of the three big states that does do a process like this of accepting or rejecting textbooks at the state level. The other two are California and Texas. These three states really have a huge influence on what kids will see in textbooks, because the big publishers ... really want these states to approve their books so that they get out to more kids and more districts buy the books. On how one rejected Florida math textbook addressed racial inequity There's a lot of research showing that math anxiety is very real and that girls and kids of color feel it more than white males do. And another way that this is addressed was one of the few places where we did see race in the books. One high school math textbook had these mini biographies of mathematicians and all but one of them were of mathematicians through history who were women or nonwhite. Obviously, probably the majority of mathematicians through history were white men, so that was clearly a very purposeful decision, I think, to show kids that might have more anxiety about math, that, hey, this could be a career for you. Although that is in no sense critical race theory, as theorists would understand the term, I have seen throughout the country that any time that sort of white male achievement is underplayed in the curriculum, it can become a target of this movement. On comparing a textbook used in California to an edition used in Texas Just to talk about LGBTQ issues for a moment, the Texas textbooks do reference them in a few places, mostly in regard to contemporary debates over something like marriage equality. That is totally different than what you will see in California, which passed a law in 2011 that actually required schools to teach the contributions of LGBTQ Americans throughout history. In response to that 2011 law, the big publishing companies created thousands of words of new historical material on LGBTQ issues all throughout American history. So if you pick up a California book, you will learn about non-binary gender identities among Native American tribes in the 19th century. You will learn about same-sex families living as enslaved people. None of this would be covered in a Texas textbook. Perhaps most controversially, in California, you will learn about early gender reassignment surgeries in the 1950s. It's simply inconceivable that the state of Texas would ask publishers to include something like that in books. ... The book looks the same, the cover's the same, the title's the same, the author is the same, but you turn the pages and you find these small differences, a paragraph here or there, but they can really give a really different view. On Florida's Parental Rights in Education Law (which critics call a \"Don't Say Gay\" law), requiring parents to be notified if students go to mental or physical health services Quite a lot of it is an attack on counseling services or social-emotional services that may be provided by schools. It requires schools to do this new bureaucratic thing, which is to create a list of all of the mental health or physical health services that are available on campus and provide that to parents and let them opt out of any element of it. And it also requires schools to immediately notify parents if students come to them for mental or physical health services. Again, it's very broadly and vaguely written. ... The intention of those that wrote the bill would be to allow parents to object to schools affirming children's gender identity. So, for example, if a child who is assigned female at birth goes to a counselor and says, \"I'm not sure I want to use she/her pronouns anymore. I want to maybe dress a little bit differently,\" the national standards of the counseling profession in the United States is to affirm that these are normal questions to have for that child. And if the child would prefer different pronouns, to use different pronouns, and to explore having the child dress in a way that feels right to that child. Now, what those that wrote this bill would like to see happen is that immediately upon a kid raising any issue like this, parents would be immediately brought into the discussion, and it would be parents who would be allowed to drive what the response would be. So if mom or dad feel that, no, the message here is you're a girl, you're born a girl, you will always be a girl, and we are not affirming this questioning for you, that would be what the counselor would do and what the school would do. That is the intention here. But there is nothing in the bill limiting this parental control over counseling to gender issues. And I think that's really important to point out. On the \"Stop W.O.K.E. Act,\" (Stop the Wrongs to Our Kids and Employees) which Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis just signed into law This is an act that's supposed to prevent both students and employees of private companies from feeling discomfort or personal guilt because of historical wrongs that have to do with race, gender or national origin. And what it says is that that type of instruction or diversity training in workplaces cannot occur. ... So discussions of white privilege, the idea that all white people, even those that may suffer from other forms of discrimination in their own lives, carry some privilege due to their skin color. That would certainly seem to be off limits by the way this bill has been written. Diversity trainings, which are popular in corporate workplaces and also popular at many schools, would not be allowed here. On how the \"Stop W.O.K.E. Act\" makes it difficult to connect history to current events Learning history can be very difficult, very emotional, and can bring up very hard discussions and personal feelings. And so it seems very difficult for a teacher to broach some of these topics in their classroom while guaranteeing that students would not feel those feelings. I will say that the bill does include language guaranteeing the right to bring up those subjects that you just mentioned, such as slavery or segregation or discrimination against women throughout history. But I think what it really is taking a target on is tying those historical topics to the present day, and specifically the framework that we are still living with the historical impacts of those discriminations, and we can still see that discrimination around us in various ways. That's the through line that is really targeted here. Take the issue of segregation, for example. You'd have to be blind in America of 2022 to think that school segregation is over, or housing segregation, in which we have neighborhoods that are predominantly Black or predominantly white or predominantly Latino, is not here. Obviously, we are still living with the results of our history. And so it does seem to be that the purpose here is to not talk about that, to pull a shroud over the fact that history is not just in the past, but something that we live with today. On how educators are responding to the debate over what they can teach In some of the more conservative communities, where these fights have been really heated over the past year or so, teachers are really scared to speak out. It's not uncommon for me to come across a teacher who is commenting anonymously on some of these controversies, but who hesitates to speak out with their name attached. But you do see teachers who are brave, who go to the microphone at board meetings and who do speak to the press about why they disagree with these attempts to control what they do in the classroom. I think there's no doubt that it's a scary time to broach subjects from American history, subjects from contemporary American life, or that are in the news in the classroom. I very often talk to teachers who hesitate to talk with their students about something like the Jan. 6 insurrection in the halls of Congress or talk about who won the 2020 presidential election because they know that it's just a super-charged issue in their communities.

The U.S. House voted Wednesday to hold former Trump White House aides Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino in criminal contempt of Congress after they defied subpoenas from the select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. The move comes after the Democratic-led panel last month approved a contempt report against Navarro, the former trade adviser, and Scavino, a former deputy chief of staff. The 220-203 floor vote, cast largely along party lines, triggers a series of steps to send the criminal referrals to the U.S. attorney's office, leaving the Justice Department to decide whether it will pursue prosecution. Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, the only two Republicans appointed to serve on the select committee, were the only two from their party to vote for the referral. \"To run into this kind of obstruction, this kind of cynical behavior, as we investigate a violent insurrection, is just despicable,\" select committee Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said on the House floor ahead of the vote. \"It can't stand. Dan Scavino and Peter Navarro must be held accountable for their abuses of the public trust. They must be held accountable for their defiance of the law. They are in contempt of Congress, which is a crime.\" The vote came after a day of heated debate on the House floor as Republicans attacked the committee's work and used stalling tactics to divert attention to immigration concerns instead. For example, more than 60 Republicans asked during earlier debate to take up a border security bill instead. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy railed against the committee for putting on a \"political show trial\" using the insurrection as a \"blank check\" for its investigation. McCarthy also called its work a \"disgusting betrayal of the Constitution\" and said the referrals were about \"criminalizing dissent.\" McCarthy vowed to shut down the panel if Republicans take over control of the House next year \u2014 which many projections show they have a good chance of doing. \"Do we really want to live in a country where politicians can seize your phone records, compel your testimony and ignore your rights because they disagree with your politics?\" McCarthy asked. \"Most Americans don't want to live in a country like that. That happens in Russia, communist China and North Korea and it should never happen in America. But, Mister Speaker, under one party rule it is. But to all Americans, when we take back the House, it will stop.\" Then-President Donald Trump and former Trade Adviser Peter Navarro check out an Endurance all-electric pickup truck on the South Lawn of the White House on Sept. 28, 2020.\n                \n                    \n                    Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Then-President Donald Trump and former Trade Adviser Peter Navarro check out an Endurance all-electric pickup truck on the South Lawn of the White House on Sept. 28, 2020. That did little to dissuade Cheney, the panel's ranking Republican. She highlighted the committee's more than 800 interviews and depositions with witnesses, including more than a dozen ex-Trump White House staffers. \"When you hear my colleagues make political, partisan attacks on the select committee, I hope all of us can remember some basic facts,\" Cheney said. \"Through these interviews, we have learned that President Trump and his team were warned in advance, and repeatedly, that the efforts they undertook to overturn the 2020 election would violate the law and the Constitution,\" Cheney added. \"They were warned that January Sixth could and likely would turn violent.\" Scavino and Navarro have repeatedly refuted the claims of the committee, saying executive privilege has prevented their cooperation with subpoenas from the Democratic-led committee. The subpoenas compelled them to produce documents and testify. However, President Biden waived executive privilege claims in both cases. The panel had issued a 34-page report and two dozen exhibits documenting attempts get Navarro and Scavino to cooperate. Scavino's deposition date was scheduled and rescheduled six different times, Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Jan. 6 panel member, said during Wednesday's debate. Navarro was subpoenaed in February, while Scavino was among the first wave of ex-Trump officials subpoenaed last September. Wednesday's floor vote marks the third for a criminal contempt referral effort tied to the Jan. 6 committee's work. Previously, the House has approved criminal referrals for ex-Trump adviser Steve Bannon and former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. So far, the Justice Department has only pursued prosecution for one of those cases, Bannon, who is now battling related criminal charges. In each case, a subpoenaed witness could face up a year in jail for each contempt charge, plus fines of up to $1,000 each.",

Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and his wife, Ginni, find themselves increasingly in the eye of an ethics storm over her repeated texts urging then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows to take steps to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. Those texts have raised questions about what Justice Thomas knew about his wife's activities, and when he knew it. Each day seems to bring another piece of bad news for the couple \u2014 from reports that the House Jan. 6 committee intends to invite Ginni Thomas to testify, to Monday's decision by a federal judge in California finding that it is \"more likely than not\" that former President Donald Trump violated the law and \"corruptly attempted to obstruct\" Congress in his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. The decision came in a dispute between pro-Trump attorney John Eastman and the Jan. 6 committee, which was seeking a discrete set of documents. Eastman asserted that the documents were protected by attorney-client privilege, but U.S. District Judge David Carter largely rejected those arguments, ruling that Eastman must turn over 101 of the disputed 111 documents. The ruling could well end up before the Supreme Court, providing yet another instance in which Justice Thomas will have to face a recusal decision. The modern day code of judicial conduct assumes that married couples have separate careers and opinions. Legal ethics experts have long taken the view that while Ginni Thomas is an outspoken conservative activist, her husband is able to act as an independent judge on matters that come before the court, even  matters that may touch on subjects of interest to Ginni Thomas. But in the aftermath of the 2020 election, while Ginni Thomas was actively strategizing with the White House chief of staff on overturning the election results, Justice Thomas repeatedly participated in cases that came to the court directly or indirectly involving those election results. One of these was the court's decision in January, requiring that Trump's White House records be turned over to the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Only one justice disagreed: Clarence Thomas. Ginni Thomas's newly released texts and her husband's failure to recuse himself in the congressional subpoena case have pulled the couple into an ethics vortex. \"The subpoena of documents when his wife's own texts are among the pile of documents responsive to the subpoena \u2014 that's a slam dunk,\" says Richard Painter, who served as ethics counsel for the George W. Bush White House. \"He had to recuse. He didn't. I'd want to know why,\" he continued. NYU law professor Stephen Gillers, author of a leading text on judicial ethics,  agrees. \"It was his obligation as a justice under the recusal statute to ensure that nothing she had been doing warranted his recusal,\" he says, adding that  Justice Thomas \"could not maintain a kind of false ignorance, closing his eyes and ears.\" Why didn't Thomas recuse? James Alfini, dean emeritus of South Texas College of Law and also a judicial ethics expert, speculates that Thomas \"didn't want to embarrass his wife\" or himself for that matter. Each of these experts on judicial ethics previously argued that Ginni Thomas's political life did not create a conflict of interest requiring Justice Thomas to recuse. But this time, they all agree that Ginni Thomas crossed the line, and so very likely did her husband in not recusing himself from cases that came to the court involving election challenges brought by Trump and his allies. \"I think this is different,\" says Charles Geyh, a legal ethics professor at Indiana University, Bloomington. \"There's a difference between having a spouse who has an active interest\" in seeing the law changed and \"someone who is actually part of the story\" of the case, he explained. \"I don't know how someone could be impartial when their spouse is part of the record that may be before the judge.\" Geyh notes that the federal recusal statute requires a judge to step aside when he or she has knowledge of disputed facts in the case, and Ginni Thomas' texts were part of the larger factual record that was produced pursuant to the Jan. 6 committee's subpoena. Former Bush ethics adviser Painter, who is now an ethics professor at the University of Minnesota, is blunter: \"He should make it clear that he's going to recuse from all of these Jan. 6 cases at this point.\" There is, however, no way to force Justice Thomas to do that. The Supreme Court has made clear it considers the judicial code of conduct as guidance that it tries to follow, but is not obligated to do so. It is different from other courts because it is a court of nine. Unlike the lower federal courts, where there are lots of other judges to step in when a judge is recused, nobody can substitute  for a recused Supreme Court justice; a tie vote leaves the case unresolved, and unnecessary recusals may undermine the interests of justice. Moreover, under longstanding practice, each justice decides for him or herself when to recuse. So, what is the remedy if a judge goes rogue? The Constitution provides for just one remedy: impeachment. But that would be \"a folly,\" says professor Alfini. Only one justice has ever been impeached, and he was subsequently acquitted. What's more, as professor Geyh notes, \"Judges make innocent mistakes all the time,\" and they get reversed on appeal. \"The only time they get disciplined\" is \"if they willfully failed to disqualify\" in violation of the judicial code of conduct. The fact is that there are some 25,000 judicial officers in the country, just nine of whom are not subject to the code of conduct, and those nine, Geyh observes, are \"the most powerful judges in the country, if not the planet.\" The Clarence Thomas recusal conundrum is the most vivid example of a court that has neither a system of accountability nor a system of transparency when it comes to recusal. There is no requirement for justices to disclose why they are recusing, nor is there a requirement that they provide an explanation on the rare occasion when one side in a case formally requests recusal and the justice declines to recuse. The Thomas recusal matter, though, appears to have arisen at just the wrong time for the court. It comes at a time when  justices have been desperately trying to persuade the public that the court is not a partisan institution. As professor Geyh observes, justices are going on an \"I am not a political hack tour\" at the same time that Thomas is \"part of the problem he is being called upon to resolve as a justice,\" all of which provides for \"uniquely bad optics.\"  Indeed, public opinion surveys indicate that approval of the court has dropped precipitously, from 68% approval in a 2019 Annenberg survey to 40% in a Gallup poll last fall. Legal ethics experts seem to agree that now is the time for the court to write its own ethics rules. If the justices did that, they could create a mechanism for a justice who is unsure about recusal to submit the question to the other members of the court. It may not be an ideal solution, but neither is the status quo.",

Liz Cheney, R-Wyoming, listens as Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., chairman of the Jan. 6 committee, reads from a statement before the panel met to consider contempt charges for Dan Scavino, former President Trump's deputy chief of staff for communications, and Peter Navarro, Trump's former trade adviser, for refusing to cooperate with subpoenas. The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol voted unanimously Monday to recommend criminal contempt of Congress against former Trump White House advisers Dan Scavino Jr. and Peter Navarro. \"They are obligated to comply with our investigation. They have refused to do so. And that's a crime,\" Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said of the committee's recommendation. Scavino and Navarro have said executive privilege prevents their cooperation with subpoenas from the Democratic-led committee. The subpoenas compel them to produce documents and testify. Navarro, the former White House trade adviser, was subpoenaed in February, while ex-Deputy Chief of Staff Scavino was among the first wave of ex-Trump officials subpoenaed last September. For Scavino's part, his attorneys have released a letter sent Friday to White House Deputy Counsel Jonathan Su raising alarms about the plan. \"The Select Committee's approach calls into question whether it seriously considered the concerns articulated by Mr. Scavino at all,\" reads the March 25 letter from Scavino's lawyers Stan Brand and Stanley Woodward shared with NPR. Navarro, on the other hand, issued a statement once again attacking the panel as conducting a \"witch hunt\" and accusing the panel of spreading lies. \"My position remains this is not my Executive Privilege to waive and the Committee should negotiate this matter with President Trump,\" Navarro said in a statement to NPR. In other business Monday, Thompson will recommend that it invites Ginni Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, to appear after reports last week that she had exchanged text messages with White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows attempting to overturn the election in the days before the attack. And as the panel investigates people closer and closer to Trump, his son-in-law and trusted adviser Jared Kushner is expected to appear on Thursday, according to two sources familiar with the committee's discussions. Ahead of the committee's Monday public business meeting, it issued a 34-page report and two dozen exhibits documenting exchanges with Navarro and Scavino. It showed multiple failed attempts to draw their cooperation, and argued that executive privilege claims were waived in their cases by President Biden. In Scavino's case, the panel said he was part of several meetings involving  Trump focused on efforts to challenge the 2020 presidential election. The committee said Scavino also helped manage social media accounts for Trump and tracked a defunct website, TheDonald.win, where users discussed Jan. 6 violence. \"Mr. Scavino may have had advance warning about the potential for violence on January 6th,\" the panel said. The report also documents Navarro's ties to ex-Trump adviser Steve Bannon and others as part of efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, as well as details he shared in his book In Trump Time: My Journal of America's Plague Year released last year. In the book, Navarro describes a procedural strategy to overturn the 2020 election based on false claims. Navarro calls it the \"Green Bay Sweep,\" and, he writes, it is the \"last, best chance to snatch a stolen election from the Democrats' jaws of deceit.\" The committee said Navarro released a three-part report called the \"Navarro Report\" on his website that shared misinformation and ties to false claims of election fraud. The panel said in its report it has also obtained additional information regarding Navarro's role. \"In the days leading up to January 6, 2021, according to evidence obtained by the Select Committee, Mr. Navarro also encouraged Mark Meadows (and possibly others) to call Roger Stone to discuss January 6th,\" the report said. The committee's referral now goes to the full House to take up a vote. If the House also approves the referrals, it would then move onto the Justice Department for potential prosecution. A conviction could result in up to one year in jail, and up to a $1,000 fine. The panel has previously approved criminal contempt referrals for Bannon, ex-Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark and Meadows. Both referrals for Bannon and Meadows were approved by the full House, with the final referral before the House in December for Meadows. But so far, the Justice Department has only pursued prosecution for one of those cases, Bannon, who is now battling related criminal charges. Already, the committee has issued more than 90 publicly announced subpoenas. In all, the panel has interviewed more than 750 witnesses, the vast majority voluntarily, and received about 87,000 records. NPR's Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The House panel probing the Capitol riot holds its first public meeting since December to consider referring two senior Trump White House officials to the Justice Department for criminal contempt.  A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: The House committee investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol tonight will hold its first public meeting since December to consider referring two senior Trump White House officials to the Justice Department for criminal contempt. Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino have refused to comply with subpoenas to appear before the panel and produce documents. NPR's Deirdre Walsh covers Congress. She's here to tell us where this sprawling investigation stands. All right, so why is the committee focused on Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino? DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Good morning, A. The House committee put out a report last night, and it details the evidence about these two individuals and their roles. Navarro was former President Trump's top trade adviser. He's talked publicly in a book that he wrote about his involvement in trying to delay the certification of the electoral count. The committee sent him a subpoena in February, but he's been arguing that he's covered by executive privilege. In his book, Navarro described working closely with Trump's adviser, Steve Bannon, and he claimed that more than a hundred members of Congress were trying to support efforts to overturn the 2020 election. In terms of Scavino, the committee says it has evidence that he spoke with the former president several times on January 6. It also talks about how he had credentials to post on the president's social media channels and listed several tweets leading up to January 6. They also say Scavino had a history of monitoring websites that openly advocated and planned violence in the weeks leading up to the insurrection. MART\u00cdNEZ: What is the process once the committee votes to approve a criminal referral resolution? WALSH: Well, we expect tonight the committee may reveal more details about what they've learned, from others who are cooperating, about the roles Navarro and Scavino played. Once the committee approves the report, it goes to the House floor for a vote, and that could happen soon. Then it's up to the Justice Department to decide if they're going to prosecute. The committee's referred three other individuals for criminal contempt of Congress - Steve Bannon, who was indicted, former justice official Jeffrey Clark and Mark Meadows, the former White House chief of staff. MART\u00cdNEZ: And speaking of Mark Meadows, last week there was news that the committee had nearly 30 text messages between Meadows and Ginni Thomas, the wife of Clarence Thomas, with Ginni Thomas urging Meadows to take steps to fight the election results. So what's been the fallout? WALSH: Yeah, I mean, those messages and the content were pretty stunning. NPR confirmed the content of them. They were first reported by The Washington Post, CBS and CNN. We've reached out to Ginni Thomas and Justice Thomas through the court but have not received any response. We've learned, talking to sources familiar with the committee's discussions, there hasn't been a decision yet now about whether to ask Ginni Thomas to appear or send a subpoena. But we could hear more about that tonight. MART\u00cdNEZ: One more thing. I mean, any sign of when we'll see a report with results from the investigation or hearings about what the committee has learned? WALSH: It's going to be a while. You know, public hearings were supposed to start in April, but the committee is still very much in fact-finding mode. They've interviewed about 800 people so far. They have 87,000 records from a broad range of sources. Now we're hearing that public hearings are expected to start in May, and they could stretch into the summer. But the political reality and sort of the unofficial deadline for this committee's report is the midterm elections. Democrats could lose control of the House, and Republican leaders who have boycotted participating in this committee so far are likely to disband the January 6 committee.

And a recap of the Academy Awards ceremony.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: More than a month into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, there are signs that the Kremlin's objectives may be changing. A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: Even as Russia continues its air artillery and missile strikes over much of Ukraine, Moscow may be shifting its focus towards securing control over the eastern part of the country. Ukrainian officials, meanwhile, are warning that Russia could be trying to split the country in two, like North and South Korea. MARTIN: Joining us now from Lviv, Ukraine - NPR's Elissa Nadworny. Elissa, can you start off by just giving us more detail about what exactly is being said inside Ukraine on Russia's potential new strategy here? ELISSA NADWORNY, BYLINE: So the head of the Ukrainian military intelligence said this new strategy is basically splitting Ukraine in two. You know, they called it, quote, \"a Korean scenario\" by creating a separate political entity in the Russian-occupied regions in the east. But Ukrainian officials are pushing for more negotiations with Russia, including over this disputed territory. MARTIN: And the argument there being that there are - there's a significant Russian population in the east... NADWORNY: Exactly. MARTIN: ...And that Russia would seek some kind of referendum to take those regions into their own control. Can you tell us, what is the state of the war at this point? NADWORNY: Yeah. Well, the Russian assault on Kyiv, at least for now, seems to be on hold, but they are still hitting the cities like Mariupol in the south and Chernihiv in the north really hard. I mean, both places have been bombarded in the first month of fighting. MARTIN: We saw over the weekend, though, an attack in the west, which has really been a safe haven for the Ukrainian diplomats, foreign diplomats, journalists. NADWORNY: That's right. MARTIN: And this seemed to breach that security. NADWORNY: That's right. You know, they hit several strategic locations in the west, mainly a number of fuel storage facilities, a military repair facility. Those are places in Lviv, where it's been relatively safe. You know, and the missile strikes also happened as President Biden was just across the border in Poland. The Lviv mayor actually called it a hello to Biden. So that's kind of going on in the background of this shift of strategy. MARTIN: I want to ask about the repercussions from President Biden's speech that he gave in Warsaw when he uttered these - this phrase wasn't in the prepared remarks, but he essentially said that Vladimir Putin needed to go. What's been the reaction to that? NADWORNY: Well, you know, most Ukrainians are actually more focused on the substance of his speech. They're actually a little disappointed. They want a no-fly zone to close the air so that the Russian military can't bomb. You know, after that speech, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, appealed to Western leaders again for more help. He wants better, more sophisticated anti-aircraft systems. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY: (Non-English language spoken). NADWORNY: Here he is saying, you know, \"you can't shoot down missiles with machine guns.\" Zelenskyy has long pleaded for a no-fly zone. That's not really - that's a no-go area for NATO, you know, because in part they don't know what the response will be like from a nuclear-armed Russia. MARTIN: Meanwhile, it's just a humanitarian disaster there. The numbers coming out of the U.N. are staggering. Upwards of 3 million people now have been forced to flee. Ten million displaced from their homes - is that right? NADWORNY: That's right. You know, Ukrainian officials are working to establish more evacuation routes with some success over the weekend from places like Mariupol. Alina Beskrovna recently fled Mariupol, where she was trapped there for weeks. She spoke to my colleague Debbie Elliot. ALINA BESKROVNA: We would haul water from a well about three miles away. We would cook on open fires. Under very heavy shelling, we stayed in the most inner part of the basement, just hoping to survive. NADWORNY: She says there were 36 people down in that basement, 12 kids. They ate lunch by flashlights. She says her hands are scratched and burned from cooking over that open fire. She's here now in Lviv, but she's looking to leave Ukraine soon. MARTIN: All right, NPR's Elissa Nadworny reporting from Lviv. Thank you so much. NADWORNY: You bet. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: The House committee investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol is recommending that two senior Trump White House officials, Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino, be held in contempt of Congress. MART\u00cdNEZ: Both have refused to comply with subpoenas to appear before the panel and produce documents. MARTIN: NPR's Deirdre Walsh covers Congress, and she's with us this morning. Hi, Deirdre. DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: Why is the committee focused on Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino? WALSH: Well, the committee released a report last night, and they say that both individuals have information about what happened leading up to and on the day of the insurrection. Navarro was Trump's top trade adviser. He actually wrote a book and publicly talked about his involvement in a strategy to try to delay the certification of the electoral count that day. The committee sent him a subpoena in February, but he's been arguing that he's covered by executive privilege. In Navarro's book, he describes working very closely with Trump adviser Steve Bannon, and he claims that more than a hundred members of Congress were supporting his efforts, along with others, to overturn the election. The committee also said in its report last night, in terms of Dan Scavino, that they have evidence that he spoke with the former president several times on January 6. They also say he had the credentials to post on the president's social media channels. They listed a bunch of tweets leading up to the attack. And the committee also says that Scavino had a history of monitoring websites that were openly advocating and planning violence in the weeks leading up to the insurrection. MARTIN: So if they - if Congress wants to hold them in contempt, what's the process look like here? WALSH: Well, the committee will meet tonight. We could learn some other details of evidence they have from others who've cooperated about the roles of Navarro and Scavino. Once the committee approves a criminal contempt report, it goes to the House floor for a vote. That could happen very soon. Then it's up to the Justice Department to decide if they're going to prosecute. The committee has referred three other individuals - Steve Bannon, who was indicted; former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clar; and Mark Meadows, Trump's former White House chief of staff. MARTIN: A name that's been in the news recently because, as you know, there was this news that Mark Meadows had been involved in a text message exchange with Ginni Thomas, the wife of the Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, and Ginni Thomas urging Meadows to take steps to fight the 2020 election results. You've been monitoring this, Deirdre. What's been the fallout on the Hill? WALSH: I mean, the messages have been pretty stunning. Members have all been talking about it. NPR's confirmed the content of them. They were originally reported by The Washington Post, CNN and CBS. We've reached out to Ginni Thomas and Justice Thomas through the court, but we have not received any response. According to sources that we've talked to with the committee's discussions, there hasn't been a decision yet now about whether to ask Ginni Thomas to appear or send a subpoena, but we could hear more about that tonight. MARTIN: Is there any sign yet, Deirdre, of when the committee is actually going to put out a final report or have some kind of hearings about what the committee has learned over this time? WALSH: Well, it's going to be a while. I mean, public hearings were supposed to start as soon as April, but the committee is still talking to a lot of people, and they're very much in fact-finding mode. They've interviewed almost 800 people so far. We do expect hearings to start in May, and they're going to stretch into the summer. But the reality is the midterm elections are really the unofficial deadline for the January 6 committee. Democrats could lose control of the House, and Republican leaders who boycotted the committee will likely disband this committee. MARTIN: NPR's Deirdre Walsh. Thank you so much. WALSH: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: Oh, my. It was the slap seen around the world. MART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah, in one of the most surprising moments in Oscars history, actor Will Smith walked on stage and slapped Chris Rock for a joke that Rock made about Smith's wife's hair. The altercation unfolded while Rock was presenting the Oscar for best documentary feature. MARTIN: NPR's Mandalit del Barco was inside the Dolby Theatre, and she joins us now. Mandalit, I still sort of can't believe that this happened (laughter). MANDALIT DEL BARCO, BYLINE: Yeah. Yeah. MARTIN: So this whole altercation between Chris Rock and Will Smith, I mean... DEL BARCO: Yeah. MARTIN: ...It was hard for us to absorb. You were actually there. So how'd it go down? DEL BARCO: Yeah, it seemed like everybody inside the Dolby Theatre - we were confused. We didn't know if it was a gag. But then we realized it was real, and we just had our mouths hanging open and holding our breath, watching what was happening. We could hear what the TV viewers couldn't hear, and that - those were the words of a very angry-looking Will Smith sternly yelling at Chris Rock with the F word to stop talking about his wife. And, you know, I was up in the nosebleed section, in the balcony, so I couldn't see it, really, that close up. But I spoke to a photographer from Shutterstock who was an eyewitness, and he said Smith walked up and swung his arm back and used his open palm to smack Chris Rock upside his face. And because Chris Rock had a mic, the slap was amplified. You know, the Academy of Motion Pictures sent out a statement on Twitter saying that it does not condone violence of any form. And the LAPD says Chris Rock declined to file a police report. MARTIN: Wow. So then - super awkward because then after all this goes down, Will Smith wins an Oscar. He wins for best actor, and he has to get up and do an acceptance speech. I mean, we should just say, the joke that Chris Rock had made was about Jada Pinkett Smith's hair. She has had to shave her head because she suffers from alopecia. So what did Will Smith say in his acceptance remarks? DEL BARCO: When he went on stage, he was still very shaken by the whole thing, and he had tears streaming down his face. And during his six-minute-long speech, he didn't say anything about his wife's condition. This is what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF 94TH ACADEMY AWARDS) WILL SMITH: I want to apologize to the Academy. I want to apologize to my - all my fellow nominees. DEL BARCO: Smith said he hoped the Academy would invite him back in the future. And, you know, in \"King Richard,\" Smith played Richard Williams, the father of tennis superstars Venus and Serena Williams, a man who had been vilified in the press for some of the things he did to protect his daughters, and Smith seemed to say that what he did was to protect his family. (SOUNDBITE OF 94TH ACADEMY AWARDS) SMITH: Now, I know to do what we do, you got to be able to take abuse. You got to be able to have people talk crazy about you. In this business, you got to be able to have people disrespecting you, and you got to smile, and you got to pretend like that's OK. DEL BARCO: You know, Smith said love can make you do some crazy things. MARTIN: OK. So, you know, we don't want to overshadow all the actual other headlines that came out of that because there were some other historic firsts besides this crazy slap, right? DEL BARCO: Right, right. So Troy Kotsur became the first deaf actor to win an Oscar. He got it for his supporting role in the film \"CODA,\" which was crowned this year's best picture. Apple TV+ was the first streaming service to win this award for \"CODA.\" And Ariana DeBose, who is Afro Latina, was the first woman of color who identifies as queer to win an Oscar. She got her award as best supporting actress for playing Anita in Steven Spielberg's remake of \"West Side Story.\" She thanked her co-star, Rita Moreno, the first Latina to win an Oscar in 1962 for playing the same role - Anita. MARTIN: NPR's Mandalit del Barco. Thanks for all this, Mandalit. We appreciate it. DEL BARCO: Sure. Thanks. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "One morning in 2017, New York Times columnist Frank Bruni woke up to find that everything looked blurry and smeared. \"There was a fog, a dappled fog over the right side of my field of vision,\" Bruni says. \"And I thought for hours that there must be some gunk in my eye, or maybe I'd had too much to drink the night before. Then I thought, Oh, no, it's my eyeglasses. I just have to clean them. And on and on, until deep into the day, I realized there was something wrong beyond all of that.\" Bruni, then 52, soon learned that he'd experienced a rare kind of stroke that had irreparably damaged his optic nerve. The prognosis: His vision in that eye would never return. What's more, there was a 20 to 40% chance that another stroke would impact his good eye. The news was devastating. \"I had some emotional, psychological and really spiritual work to do to accept this and figure out how to go on in the most productive and constructive fashion,\" he says. But after going through a period of shock and terror, Bruni saw himself at a decision point: He could fixate on what had been lost, or he could focus on what remained. He chose to do the latter. \"I feel like once you've recognized what's happened,  ...  it is so important and so constructive and so right to focus instead on all the things you can still do, all the blessings that remain,\" he says. \"I ended up determined \u2014 determined to show myself that I could adapt to whatever was going to happen.\" Frank Bruni is a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times and a professor at Duke University.\n                \n                    \n                    Duke University Sanford School of Public Policy\n                    \n                \nhide caption Frank Bruni is a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times and a professor at Duke University. In the memoir, The Beauty of Dusk, Bruni chronicles the changes to his vision and the adaptations he's had to make in his work, personal life and attitude. The book also profiles a number of other people who've survived and thrived in ways that Bruni says are profoundly instructive. \"I decided it was time to learn about how human beings at their most resilient survive and make the most of these situations,\" he says. \"And that was my personal journey and also the journey that I ended up describing in the book.\" On experiencing how nimble and plastic the brain is through this experience I was terrified of the idea that I would lose [all of] my eyesight, I'm not anymore. I hope I never do. I wish what had happened to me so far didn't. But you learn quickly that the senses that remain often become sharper in compensation for the sense that has been compromised. You learn how nimble the brain is. I've been shocked at the fact that sometimes, in certain situations, I can take in visual information I didn't before because I'm optimizing what's available to me. I'm focusing on certain details with my one good eye in a way that I never had with my two good eyes. And that's both a physical promise of sorts, but also an example ... of just how nimble our brains and our bodies can be when circumstances demand it. And when you realize that, when you see it in practice, in your own life, it takes away a lot of the anxiety and fear of what's coming down the road and frankly, of aging. Because as we age, we're all going to lose certain physical potencies and be asked to make certain adjustments and compensations. On becoming single when a long-term relationship ended, around the time of his stroke The possibility of being blinded in the second eye was actually one of the reasons \u2014 when we had to decide whether to try to repair this relationship or not \u2014 I decided not to. And I know that almost sounds like the opposite reaction or counterintuitive, but I felt like the question was whether I was loved faithfully enough or just loved enough. I worried very much that my partner was making his decisions and calculations in the context of \"I can't abandon someone who may find himself soon in great need,\" and I did not want to be in that kind of relationship. I did not want to feel like a drag or a burden on anyone. But I had a great privilege and blessing there, which is that I have an enormously close family. I have three siblings with whom I could not be closer. And so I never had to worry \u2014 nor do I worry now \u2014 that in a worst-case situation, I'll be alone and without a support system. Lonely, sure. And I felt very lonely when ... [we] broke up, and sometimes I'm lonely, still, but lonely is endurable and ... I want to live as truthfully as possible, and that's more important to me than little pockets of loneliness. On trying to have an optimistic outlook, modeling after his mother who had cancer [My mother] survived with cancer \u2014 a very rare and potent cancer \u2014 for much longer than she was supposed to. Like her, I decided to be as active as possible. I decided to try to do as much as I could do, rather than to kind of say, \"Oh, wow, I have to do less now.\" I probably read more books a month since losing vision in one eye than I did beforehand. \"Read\" has become a different verb. I listened to two-thirds of them and I've trained myself to do that in a way I had never imagined possible. I listen to these books at 1.7/1.8 speed ... and I realized there's so much power and agency I still have. And focusing on that, making sure that is always where I point myself and steer myself \u2014 that's been a real lesson for me, and I hope it's a lesson for other people, too. On how the vision loss has changed his feelings about aging I used to be extremely fearful of aging. I used to think, \"Oh, you know, when I lose the ability to do X, I'm going to be inconsolable. When I lose the ability to do Y, it is going to plunge me into a deep depression,\" because I just assumed the loss of ability would be the kind of event that one could not get comfortable with or spin in any sort of positive direction. I've seen that there are many dimensions to losing something, to being physically limited. I've seen that you can be left with enough ability and agency to feel completely whole and to feel completely happy. Frank Bruni I've seen through this ordeal, adventure \u2014 I call it more of an \"adventure\" now with my eye \u2014 I've seen that there are many dimensions to losing something, to being physically limited. I've seen that you can be left with enough ability and agency to feel completely whole and to feel completely happy. And so when I think about what will happen down the line, and I know now more than ever before that I'm not going to be able to predict it, I don't dread it the way I used to, and I also accept it as just part of the process. I think people who have had a kind of vision episode like I did at 52, people who have been diagnosed with serious diseases in their 30s and 40s, I think, in some ways, they get an accelerated and advanced course in aging, and they learn early what we all eventually learn, which ... is that our bodies are time bombs, but each detonates in a different way. The certain thing, though, is the detonation, and the other certain thing is that you control your response to that, in a way that can leave you with plenty and that can leave you with a lot of joy. On struggling with binge eating, and how his relationship with food changed once he became the New York Times restaurant critic in 2004 That proposal came along to me at a time in my life when I had just felt like I'd turned the corner in my relationship with food, where I'd gotten healthy again after a period of enormous weight gain, where I was living in a manner that felt kind of disciplined and healthy. And I somehow knew in a really counterintuitive way that if I accepted the restaurant critic job and every day was about dealing with food, that I would kind of approach it in a methodical and conscious enough way that it would be sort of the best recipe for not being undone by food. That was possible. It's difficult to describe ... but I was probably at my food healthiest at my trimmest and all of that during the five and a half years when I was the New York Times restaurant critic than I ever was before or since. I'm heavier now than I was when I was eating professionally. ...  I ate steadily as a restaurant critic, but I finished nothing on my plate. And being a restaurant critic is about tasting, not gorging. And that is, in fact, one of the healthy ways to eat that is often encouraged. And so it kind of kept you on a schedule and kept you to a discipline that wasn't so different from what some nutritionists' advice would be.

That day the Kremlin said it pulled back some Russian troops but the U.S. and NATO have rejected the claim.\n                \n                    \n                    Mikhail Klimentyev/Sputnik/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during a joint news conference with Germany's chancellor following their meeting at the Kremlin, in Moscow, on Tuesday. That day the Kremlin said it pulled back some Russian troops but the U.S. and NATO have rejected the claim. Brett Bruen was a U.S. diplomat for 12 years and served as director of global engagement in the Obama White House. He now teaches crisis communications at Georgetown University and runs Global Situation Room, a public affairs firm. When is the crisis in Ukraine going to end? According to the White House, it's largely up to Russian President Vladimir Putin. I fail to understand why we are letting him decide the timeline, let alone the terms and trajectory of the security situation in Europe. The United States and our NATO allies need to start imposing some of our own deadlines. Congress is currently considering a series of preemptive punishments against Russia. Yet, I fear that would be a major mistake. Why would we want to give up what little leverage is available for us to try and change the Kremlin's calculus? Moscow likes lists. So, we should give them one: Russian troops need to be back in their regular barracks by March 1. The country returns to direct negotiations and implementation of the Minsk agreement process for resolving the crisis in Ukraine by that date. It does not recognize the separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine as independent. It also stops flying within 5 feet of American fighter jets, as Russian military aircraft did last weekend. Lastly, we must draw a big red line around meddling in the midterm elections. Sanctions and some other serious steps would be triggered if any of these timelines or terms are violated. I remain highly skeptical that simply expanding the existing economic penalties we have imposed on Russia will deter or force a deviation from an invasion they've already undertaken. Instead, we need to focus on what really worries Putin: increasing domestic disgruntlement. Biden needs to deliver a direct message to Moscow. You either start acting like a normal nation or we are going to steadily turn up the temperature on some politically and personally sensitive points. We will begin by dropping a new batch of intelligence about the Kremlin's corruption and mismanagement each month. Even something as simple as sharing the truth about Russian soldiers who have died during the occupation of Ukraine would help to stir public sentiment against Putin. As imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has already demonstrated, these revelations can be really damaging, especially coupled with costly foreign adventurism. Putin may undertake a ground invasion, but the United States can launch an information invasion of his country. We should focus on piercing his propaganda with biting satire and amplifying brutal critiques of his leadership from Navalny, along with other democracy activists. As we did during the Cold War, mass translations of books, movies and information into Russian would help to counter the Kremlin's official, closely controlled narrative. While the Russian government may try to shut down civil society organizations and media, we now have tremendous technology to help activists and journalists circumvent censors and monitors. We ought to also take a page from the International Olympic Committee's playbook. Because of Russia's systematic efforts at cheating, it is competing in the Winter Games not as a country, but a mere sports organization. Similarly, if the Russian government continues cheating in its interactions with other nations, it should be stripped of the privileges and protocols accorded to those who follow the rules. No invitations to summits. No high-level meetings with American officials. Like with Iran and North Korea, restrict Russian officials' travel in New York City, as well as Washington, D.C. Putin wants prestige. Yet, if he so blatantly flouts fundamental principles of international law, the United States should make every effort to deny him those opportunities. There is certainly a great deal that depends on the Russian leader. Nonetheless, the Biden administration has got to stop putting Putin in the driver's seat so often. Such a reactive response has enabled him to dominate the global agenda and distract us from other critical priorities. Yes, we may lose ground on the very limited areas where Russia has played a somewhat constructive role, like talks around Iran's nuclear development. But I would argue Russia's brazen breach of international laws is an even greater threat. It is beyond time for us to start setting some of our own expectations and expedite the process of bringing this crisis to a close.",

Jan. 6 panel subpoenas former Trump White House trade adviser Peter Navarro.  AMART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: More and more Democratic-led states are pulling back their requirements on masking. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: But the federal government is saying that's too soon; people still should mask up. Here's White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki during yesterday's briefing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JEN PSAKI: What our responsibility to do is to abide by what the president committed to on the campaign, which is to listen to scientists, listen to data. That doesn't move at the speed of politics; it moves at the speed of data. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is here with more on how the politics is interacting with the science. Now, Mara, Democrats have been steadfast about public health measures to control the pandemic, but now we see Democratic governors more every day moving out ahead of the CDC. What is happening here? MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: What's happening is that the virus is declining, at least as measured by the number of hospitalizations and deaths, and even - even though it's still high - the number of cases. So one after another, you see the Democratic governors of New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, California, yesterday - New York and Illinois - they've all announced they're easing some of their requirements, although New York and Illinois are still keeping mask mandates for schools. They're hearing from voters in their states, mostly vaccinated, that COVID is here to stay, and they want to get back to their normal life, which, by the way, was one of the most important promises that Joe Biden made - a return to normalcy. But yesterday, as you played that clip, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said that people should still follow the CDC guidance, which is mask in areas of high transmission, which is almost everywhere in the country, when they are indoors. But the CDC said yesterday that they're reviewing the data. They're working on revising the guidance. So it's possible the White House will catch up to those governors pretty soon. MART\u00cdNEZ: Now, I know last year President Biden talked about freedom from the virus, only to see it raging back. How is the White House talking about where the country is headed? LIASSON: Well, that's right. You know, Joe Biden has two different imperatives. He campaigned on listening to the science, which in this case, at least so far, is the CDC, and they're not ready to move. So he can't really throw them under the bus. But he's struggling to make the transition to the new normal, which would mean not trying to get to COVID zero, where you're trying to eliminate all infections, but it would mean instead trying to keep the number of hospitalizations and deaths low, get daily life back to normal with COVID in the background, at least if you are vaccinated. MART\u00cdNEZ: Thing is, though - we all know this - much of the virus response is political. So how do you think the two sides are positioning themselves with voters in all this? LIASSON: Well, that is the million-dollar question here. Republicans hope that voters will be mad at Democrats, that they kept these mandates on at all and for as long as they did and that they kept schools closed. Democrats hope that voters will reward them for taking science into account. Remember; Joe Biden really shifted over the last year from trying to unify everyone, bring them along voluntarily. For a long time, he eschewed mandates, but then he switched to mandates and to blaming Republicans, who he says have prolonged the virus by resisting vaccinations, resisting mandates. And the problem is, when you have a low-trust, highly polarized society, people don't do the thing that's good for everyone voluntarily, which in this case, the only way we know to control the virus is to get vaccinated. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR's Mara Liasson. Thanks a lot. LIASSON: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MART\u00cdNEZ: Russia has planned a major military exercise in Belarus today involving thousands of Russian troops and weapons systems. Russian warships have already made their way into the Black Sea. MARTIN: Yeah, and all that military posturing poses a threat to diplomacy efforts in this standoff between Russia and the West over Ukraine. One of the strongest levers the U.S. and its allies have against Moscow right now is sanctions, particularly oil and gas, which prop up Russia's economy. And earlier this week, President Biden warned that if Russia invades Ukraine, the Nord Stream 2, this multibillion-dollar natural gas pipeline, wouldn't become operational, which would be a big hit to Russia. MART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah. Here to explain, NPR's international affairs correspondent Jackie Northam. Jackie, is it possible for President Biden to do as he promised and bring an end to Nord Stream 2? JACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: Well, he certainly was unequivocal about doing just that if Russia invaded Ukraine when he met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz earlier this week. And this would be a big deal. Nord Stream 2 is an $11 billion project designed to pipe natural gas directly from Russia to Germany. It's about 750 miles long. And it runs under the Baltic Sea, which means it would avoid Ukraine, which other pipelines pass through. The construction on Nord Stream 2 is complete, but it still hasn't been certified, so it isn't pumping any gas yet. MART\u00cdNEZ: But this pipeline deal is between two independent countries, Germany and Russia. So how exactly can the U.S. stop it? NORTHAM: Well, that's a question that came to a lot of people's minds. And, you know, to try and understand that I called up James Waddell, and he's head of European gas at the London-based Energy Aspects. And he said it would have been better if the U.S. had done something while the pipeline was being built. Waddell says now there are a few things the U.S. could target that could stop the pipeline's operation. Let's have a listen. JAMES WADDELL: Things like companies being able to do maintenance and providing insurance. But I think the real option and the sort of worst-case scenario for anyone buying gas, which is the big sort of five European backers to the pipeline, is if they were directly sanctioned, the financiers of the project. NORTHAM: And I have to say, some of the holdup to get Nord Stream 2 online is believed to be political. MART\u00cdNEZ: All right, that's interesting. There's a raft of sanctions, though, that the U.S. and its allies are drawing up should Russia invade. Why go after a pipeline that hasn't even started pumping gas yet? NORTHAM: Well, the U.S. has always been opposed to this pipeline because it could give Moscow too much leverage over Europe, and Europe relies heavily on Russian natural gas to, you know, heat homes and run factories. And there's a lot of pressure on President Biden to take a hard line on Nord Stream 2, particularly from congressional Republicans. I spoke with Matthew Bey, and he's an energy specialist at RANE, which is a risk consultancy company. MATTHEW BEY: You can probably make the argument that it is just as much about the domestic audience as it is the international audience, whereas if there is an invasion of Ukraine, President Biden will be basically forced to do something. And what is the do-something that right now the Republicans are asking him to do? It's sanction Nord Stream 2. NORTHAM: And of course, this runs the risk of alienating European countries and particularly Germany, which has always been a big backer of the project. MART\u00cdNEZ: And there's always a possibility at this point that Russia could retaliate and shut off the flow of natural gas to Europe. How serious would that be? NORTHAM: It would be a lose-lose situation. Russia relies on revenue from sales to Europe, and Europe relies on Russia for natural gas. MART\u00cdNEZ: That's NPR's Jackie Northam. Jackie, thanks. NORTHAM: Thanks so much. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MART\u00cdNEZ: Another member of former President Donald Trump's inner circle has been subpoenaed by the House committee investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. MARTIN: Yeah. Peter Navarro - he was a trade adviser in the Trump administration, and he's been pretty out in the open about his efforts to overturn the presidential election. In fact, Navarro detailed those attempts to delay the certification of results in a memoir about his time in the Trump White House. MART\u00cdNEZ: Joining us to discuss all of this is NPR congressional reporter Claudia Grisales. I know you've been tracking all of these subpoenas from the January 6 committee, and according to your tally, Navarro is the 80th subpoena. So why does the panel want to talk to him? CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Navarro has boasted in multiple forums, including his own book as we mentioned, about this plan to delay certification of the 2020 election results. He even put together a three-part report making false claims of election fraud. Committee Chair Bennie Thompson said Navarro has not been shy about his role and even discussed former President Trump's support. So now the panel is asking Navarro to turn over documents in about two weeks and testify in about three weeks. In a statement, Navarro attacked the committee as, quote, \"domestic terrorists\" and signaled he would not testify. Rather, he claimed executive privilege prevents him from doing so. And this is despite Trump losing a Supreme Court ruling on a related argument earlier this year. MART\u00cdNEZ: All right, so how does the committee see Navarro fitting into its larger investigation? GRISALES: They see him as a key figure, connecting a network of individuals who tried to overturn the election result. In his book, Navarro described a, quote, \"Green Bay sweep\" as the, quote, \"last, best chance to snatch a stolen election from the Democrats' jaws of deceit.\" And he also talked about this plan in multiple interviews, including during an appearance on MSNBC last month. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PETER NAVARRO: We had over a hundred congressmen and senators on Capitol Hill ready to implement the sweep. We were going to challenge the results of the election in six battleground states. GRISALES: And then Navarro, in separate interviews, mentioned the names of some of those congressional members, including Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz. And he also said Trump was, quote, \"on board\" with the effort. MART\u00cdNEZ: OK. Now, what are we expecting next with the investigation? GRISALES: The focus now is chasing multiple efforts to overturn the elections results, from fake electors to various attempts to seizing voting machines. The committee wants to present their findings perhaps as early as April, but they are drowning in a new wave of evidence, with the National Archives recently turning over thousands of new Trump documents to the committee, and that's as the committee has interviewed more than 500 witnesses. This marks a large scale of voluntary cooperation that includes key figures tied to former Vice President Mike Pence. Thompson recently said they're weighing prime-time hearings. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BENNIE THOMPSON: But I think it's important that the information we are receiving, the testimony we're receiving, we digest it, and then we put it where the public will understand clearly the work and information that we've received. GRISALES: And Thompson said it is important that the panel shares a new narrative of how January 6 unfolded, working through the subplots that fueled the attack, to where the public will better understand the players and the forces at play. And it's becoming clearer as this investigation progresses that January 6 was not a one-off but a buildup of a pattern driven by Trump and his allies and supporters that culminated in this siege. And this is expected to be followed by an interim report perhaps this summer and a final report this fall. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR's Claudia Grisales. Thanks a lot. GRISALES: Thank you much.

Leaders say the history of violence against people of color should be passed on to new generations so the lessons of the past can be applied. From her office in Birmingham, Ala., DeJuana Thompson looks across the street and sees a daily reminder of terror. Her window overlooks the 16th Street Baptist Church, where a bomb in 1963 killed four young Black girls.\"Living in the era of bomb threats is not new to people of color,\" said Thompson, president and CEO of the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute.Nearly six decades after that  bombing by the Ku Klux Klan, the FBI is now investigating last week's bomb threats against at least 17 historically Black colleges and universities across the U.S. Thompson said the threats underscore the need to teach new generations the history of violence targeting people of color so the lessons of the past can be applied to the present. The FBI said the hate crimes probe involves more than 20 field offices and \"is of the highest priority.\" Investigators have identified at least five \"persons of interest,\" a law enforcement official told The Associated Press. The official could not discuss details of the investigation publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.In one of the cases, a caller claiming to be affiliated with the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division described a plot at Bethune-Cookman University in Florida involving seven bombs hidden in bags, Daytona Beach Police Chief Jakari Young said.University campuses are considered \"soft targets,\" but \"they're not as soft as they used to be,\" said Robert McCrie, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. Universities have traditionally been easily accessible to the public, but many hardened their security after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. Now, picture IDs are needed to enter buildings on McCrie's campus and others, he said. Though no devices were found at the schools threatened last week, \"people of color don't have that privilege to think it's not real,\" said Lance Wheeler, director of exhibitions at the National Center for Civil and Human Rights in Atlanta. The bomb threats against Black institutions are deeply rooted in U.S. history. In Alabama, people used to call Birmingham \"Bombingham\" because of how many bombs and bomb threats occurred, Thompson said. Among the many victims: the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, a civil rights leader whose home was damaged on Christmas Day in 1956 by 16 sticks of dynamite placed beneath his bedroom window. When a KKK member suggested he leave town, Shuttlesworth responded that \"I wasn't saved to run,\" U.S. Rep. John Conyers Jr. told the House of Representatives after Shuttlesworth died in 2011.\"How we responded then is how we are responding now,\" Thompson said. \"We will not stand for these hate crimes, we will not stand for this intimidation, we shall not be moved.\" A man speaks with a police officer in a patrol vehicle outside the Spelman campus earlier this month after 17 historically Black colleges received bomb threats.\n                \n                    \n                    John Spink/Atlanta Journal-Constitution/via AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption A man speaks with a police officer in a patrol vehicle outside the Spelman campus earlier this month after 17 historically Black colleges received bomb threats. The Congressional Bipartisan HBCU Caucus' statement on the latest bomb threats recalled 1969 racial segregation protests at North Carolina A&T that prompted an armed response by the National Guard and police. One student was killed, dozens injured and more than 300 people arrested as gunfire was exchanged from campus buildings. The protests followed the first sit-in at a whites-only lunch counter by four Black men, later known as the Greensboro Four.\"We know from history that in spite of external threats, HBCUs are resilient institutions that will persist through all forms of adversity,\" the statement said. Universities in Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, and other states targeted last week have resumed operations since the lockdowns. But many still worry about future threats and efforts to prosecute those responsible.Maurice Mitchell, national director of the Working Families Party and strategist for the Movement for Black Lives, said HBCUs and independent Black institutions are targeted because they represent independence and resilience for African Americans, which is a threat to a white supremacist ideology.\"The mere existence of Black schools, Black churches, Black political organizations and Black business are a threat,\" he said. \"We see upswings in these attacks as backlash to Black resistance, the exercising of independent Black political power, the influence of Black social movements.\"The attacks are \"ways to try to put fear into communities that are trying to obtain freedom,\" Wheeler said.The impact of the Black vote this last election has been felt at the ballot box, such as Georgia flipping two Senate seats for Democrats including the election of Raphael Warnock as the first Black senator to represent the state. And the Black Lives Matter movement has led a national push for protests against police violence and injustice, including murder convictions for the men who killed Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia and George Floyd in Minneapolis.There is a \"culture of fear of Black independence, of Black people building our own institutions, our own power and setting out our own direction politically, economically. There's always efforts to suppress that, and I think that is what's happening right now,\" Mitchell said. \"The best way to challenge these white supremacists and haters is by doubling down and investing in HBCUs long term and strengthening them as institutions.\" National Urban League President Marc Morial called the latest bomb threats \"part of the poisonous tree of hate,\" putting them in the same category as legislative proposals that would suppress the vote, the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, a spike in hate crimes and backlash against affirmative action.\"Terrorism is always about creating discord, creating unrest and fear \u2014 it's about disrupting society,\" said Warren Eller, who also teaches at John Jay.Delaware State University President Tony Allen said students and community members shouldn't let threats disrupt their spaces. Sharing in Thompson's message, Allen wrote a letter to the university community shortly after a bomb threat on his campus.\"Here is what I say to these bullies, these fearmongers of our day: 'We shall not be moved,'\" he said.",

Researcher Jeffrey Sachs says that since January 2021, 35 states have introduced legislation limiting topics that schools can teach.\n                \n                    \n                    Mary Altaffer/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption A third-grade teacher conducts class in Rye, N.Y. Researcher Jeffrey Sachs says that since January 2021, 35 states have introduced legislation limiting topics that schools can teach. Across the U.S., educators are being censored for broaching controversial topics. Since January 2021, researcher Jeffrey Sachs says, 35 states have introduced 137 bills limiting what schools can teach with regard to race, American history, politics, sexual orientation and gender identity. Sachs has been tracking this legislation for PEN America, a writers organization dedicated to free speech. He says the recent flurry of legislation has created a \"minefield\" for educators trying to figure out how to teach topics such as slavery, Jim Crow laws or the Holocaust. One proposed law in South Carolina, for instance, prohibits teachers from discussing any topic that creates \"discomfort, guilt or anguish\" on the basis of political belief. \"That means that a teacher would have to be very, very careful about how they discuss something like, let's say, fascism or racism or antisemitism,\" Sachs says. \"These are political beliefs, and it means that teachers are going to have to second-guess whether they can describe that political belief in as forthright and honest a way as we wish for fear of falling afoul of this bill.\" Critical race theory, an academic approach that examines how race and racism function in American institutions, has inspired a backlash in conservative circles across the United States. In one of his first acts in office, Glenn Youngkin, the Republican governor of Virginia, established a hotline to allow parents or members of the community to report critical race theory in the classroom. Meanwhile, in New Hampshire, a conservative mom's group is offering a $500 bounty to catch teachers who break a state law prohibiting certain teachings about racism and sexism. \"I think it must be a very terrifying time to be an educator at any level in higher ed or in K-12,\" Sachs says. \"You have, unfortunately, the kinds of daily stressors that we've all become used to because of COVID,\" he says. \"And now on top of that, these educators are trying to negotiate outraged parents and media pundits. ... When you listen to what educators are saying, they're burned out, and many of them, I think, will head for the exits.\" On how some of the proposed bills would be impossible to comply with Some of the bills \u2014 I would say many now \u2014 include a provision that says something to the effect of: Teachers cannot be compelled to discuss a controversial contemporary issue, but if they do, they must do so evenhandedly and without any kind of favoritism. However, many of those same bills also would require teachers to denounce, in the strongest possible terms, ideas like Marxism or socialism. For instance, a bill in Indiana that is currently under consideration would require, among other things, that in the run-up to any general election in the state, students must be taught \"socialism, Marxism, communism, totalitarianism or similar political systems are incompatible with and in conflict with the principles of freedom upon which the United States was founded.\" And it goes on to say as such, \"socialism, Marxism, communism, totalitarianism or similar political systems are detrimental to the people of the United States.\" The issue there, among many others, is that it's a bill requiring students to be exposed to this litany of claims about different ideologies. And it also requires that in doing so, teachers cannot show favoritism or bias in any one direction. In other words, it's a bill that can't possibly actually work. Teachers are being pulled in two different directions, and the consequence is going to be a kind of self-censorship. Another Indiana bill ... prohibits teachers from including in their class any \"anti-American ideologies.\" Now that term is never defined, and again, it's not that teachers can't endorse or promote anti-American ideologies \u2014 they're just simply forbidden from even discussing them. On bills that address sexuality, gender and LGBTQ issues It differs bill to bill. But again, many do include language prohibiting teachers from discussing concepts like gender fluidity. It prohibits them from discussing \"nontraditional gender identities\" and in many cases forbid[s] teachers from discussing controversial events that would presumably include, in many cases, ones like gay marriage or LGBTQ rights. We see as well many bills requiring teachers to report to parents if their children are asking questions about their gender identity, and in many cases as well \u2014 for instance, in a Florida bill \u2014 that prohibit teachers from \"encouraging any conversation about sex and sexuality.\" So it really puts teachers in an impossible situation. In a contemporary high school or middle school, even earlier in elementary school, these sorts of topics arise. And in particular, it would put LGBTQ teachers in a really difficult situation where they're forced, essentially, to disguise their identity or the status of their relationships in order to fend off running afoul of these bills. On how these laws are similar to what's going on in authoritarian countries It often gets dismissively described as \"woke ideas,\" and more broadly, I think we would just describe these ideas that we're talking about as socially liberal ideas. And unfortunately, what we're seeing is in countries like Russia, China, in Turkey, in Hungary, we are seeing these regimes targeting educational institutions and other sites of cultural production like museums or the media, [as] an attempt to drive these ideas out \u2014 to signal that to be a \"real\" Russian or to be a \"true\" Hungarian, one must be straight, one must be socially conservative. These efforts underway in these regimes, that are either authoritarian or unfortunately trending in that direction, all signal the kind of political energy that leaders believe they can get by attacking these ideas. On a new law that addresses the concept of systemic racism The law now is saying that whenever a teacher talks about racism, they may only describe it as a product of an individual's own biases or prejudices. They cannot describe it \u2014 even when the facts command them to \u2014 as something more endemic or embedded within American society. Jeffrey Sachs There's a law currently on the books in North Dakota that was passed last November after just five days of consideration that has me up at night. This is a law that attempts to prohibit critical race theory in K-12 schools, and I just want to reemphasize here this is not a law that prohibits people from endorsing or promoting critical race theory. It's a law that forbids them from even including critical race theory in the classroom. And the way that that law defines critical race theory is what has me so concerned: ... \"critical race theory, which is defined as the theory that racism is not merely the product of learned individual bias or prejudice, but that racism is systemically embedded in American society and the American legal system to facilitate racial inequality.\" In other words, the law now is saying that whenever a teacher talks about racism, they may only describe it as a product of an individual's own biases or prejudices. They cannot describe it \u2014 even when the facts command them to \u2014 as something more endemic or embedded within American society. It's a way essentially of preventing teachers, I think, from being honest about a lot of the uglier sides of American history and contemporary society. Whenever you discuss slavery, your teacher would have to essentially say, \"These slaveholders were racist.\" The system that they were in, the laws that supported them, the economy that made that business profitable, you'd have to separate those institutional features and describe slavery purely as a product of individual bias, which does violence to the topic. It fails to educate students, and I think might discourage students from thinking critically about contemporary institutions and identifying whether or not they also might be guilty of systemic racism. On how the idea for these restrictive teaching bills first came about The origins here ... go back to that summer of 2020. There's a researcher there named Christopher Rufo, who was then with the Discovery Institute in Seattle. This is in a conservative educational institute centered around the promotion of intelligent design. And Christopher Rufo wrote a series of articles for an online website called City Journal. And in his City Journal articles, he detailed what he described as indoctrination in K-12 schools or in employee training programs in businesses or state agencies, programs that he said were training people to become critical race theorists. Those articles caught the attention of Tucker Carlson, the Fox News host, and Rufo appeared on his program in early September of 2020. The very next day, he received a phone call from Mark Meadows, then chief of staff for the Trump administration. Apparently, Trump had watched the program that evening. He'd seen what Rufo had to say, and within a matter of days, Rufo was in conversation with the Trump administration on some sort of legislative or executive response. The product of that conversation was Trump's executive order in late September, where he prohibited any state agency from discussing certain ideas as part of employee training or [training for] a state contractor that wishes to do business with the federal government. Amy Salit and Thea Chaloner produced and edited the audio of this interview. Bridget Bentz, Molly Seavy-Nesper and Lauren Migaki adapted it for the web.",

The U.S. Supreme Court has delivered a blow to former President Donald Trump, rejecting his request to block release of White House records being sought by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The court's order paves the way for the release of records from the National Archives. The records could shed light on the events that led to the riot by Trump supporters protesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, which was won by Democrat Joe Biden. In its decision Wednesday, the Supreme Court noted that the question of whether a former president can claim executive privilege need not be answered in this case, because a lower court had already decided. \"Because the Court of Appeals concluded that President Trump's claims would have failed even if he were the incumbent, his status as a former President necessarily made no difference to the court's decision,\" the court said in its order. Conservative-leaning Justice Clarence Thomas was the lone public dissenter in the order. \"The Supreme Court's action tonight is a victory for the rule of law and American democracy,\" House panel Chair Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., and Vice Chair Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said in a statement. \"The Select Committee has already begun to receive records that the former President had hoped to keep hidden and we look forward to additional productions regarding this important information.\" Added Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.: \"Reviewing documents that former President Trump sought to hide from the American people is essential to understanding the events leading up to and during the deadly insurrection and its aftermath, and to ensuring it never happens again.\" The decision Wednesday comes as the Democratic-led committee is moving closer into Trump's inner circle.

JERUSALEM \u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu's incoming hard-line Israeli government put West Bank settlement expansion at the top of its priority list on Wednesday, vowing to legalize dozens of illegally built outposts and annex the occupied territory as part of its coalition deal with ultranationalist allies. The coalition agreements, released a day before the government is to be sworn into office, also included language endorsing discrimination against LGBTQ people on religious grounds, contentious judicial reforms, as well as generous stipends for ultra-Orthodox men who prefer to study instead of work. The package laid the groundwork for what is expected to be a stormy beginning for the country's most religious and right-wing government in history, potentially putting it at odds with large parts of the Israeli public, rankling Israel's closest allies and escalating tensions with the Palestinians. \"What worries me the most is that these agreements change the democratic structure of what we know of as the state of Israel,\" said Tomer Naor, chief legal officer of the Movement for Quality Government in Israel, a watchdog group. \"One day we'll all wake up and Netanyahu is not going to be prime minister, but some of these changes will be irreversible.\" The guidelines were led by a commitment to \"advance and develop settlement in all parts of the land of Israel,\" including \"Judea and Samaria,\" the biblical names for the West Bank. Israel captured the West Bank in 1967 along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem \u2014 territory the Palestinians seek for a future state. Israel has constructed dozens of Jewish settlements home to around 500,000 Israelis who live alongside around 2.5 million Palestinians. Most of the international community considers Israel's West Bank settlements illegal and an obstacle to peace with the Palestinians. The United States already has warned the incoming government against taking steps that could further undermine hopes for an independent Palestinian state. In response to a request for comment, the Palestinian leadership emphasized that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can be resolved only through the establishment of a Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital. Without a negotiated two-state solution, \"there will be no peace, security or stability in the region,\" said Nabil Abu Rdeneh, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. There was no immediate U.S. comment. Netanyahu, who served 12 years as prime minister, is returning to power after he was ousted from office last year. His new government is made up of ultra-Orthodox parties, a far-right ultranationalist religious faction affiliated with the West Bank settler movement and his Likud party. In the coalition agreement between Likud and its ally, the Religious Zionism party, Netanyahu pledged to legalize wildcat settlement outposts considered illegal even by the Israeli government. He also promises to annex the West Bank \"while choosing the timing and considering the national and international interests of the state of Israel.\" Such a move would alienate much of the world, and give new fuel to critics who compare Israeli policies in the West Bank to apartheid South Africa. The deal also grants favors to Itamar Ben-Gvir, a far-right politician who will be in charge of the national police force as the newly created national security minister. It includes a commitment to expand and vastly increase government funding for the Israeli settlements in the divided West Bank city of Hebron, where a tiny ultranationalist Jewish community lives in heavily fortified neighborhoods amid tens of thousands of Palestinians. Ben-Gvir lives in a nearby settlement. The agreement also includes a clause pledging to change the country's anti-discrimination laws to allow businesses to refuse service to people \"because of a religious belief.\" The legislation drew outrage earlier this week when members of Ben-Gvir's party said the law could be used to deny services to LGBTQ people. Netanyahu has said he will not let the law pass, but nonetheless left the clause in the coalition agreement. Among its other changes is placing Bezalel Smotrich, a settler leader who heads Religious Zionism party, in a newly created ministerial post overseeing West Bank settlement policy. In an op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal, Smotrich said there would be no \"changing the political or legal status\" of the West Bank, indicating that annexation would not immediately take place. But he leveled criticism at the \"feckless military government\" that controls key aspects of life for Israeli settlements \u2014 such as construction, expansion and infrastructure projects. Smotrich, who will also be finance minister, is expected to push to expand construction and funding for settlements while stifling Palestinian development in the territory. Netanyahu and his allies also agreed to push through changes meant to overhaul the country's legal system \u2014 specifically, a bill that would allow parliament to overturn Supreme Court decisions with a simple majority of 61 lawmakers. Critics say the law will undermine government checks and balances and erode a critical democratic institution. They also say Netanyahu has a conflict of interest in pushing for the legal overhaul because he is currently on trial for corruption charges. \"Since (the new government's) intention is to weaken the Supreme Court, we're not going to have the court as an institution that would help guard the principles of freedom and equality,\" Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem think tank, told reporters. Two of Netanyahu's key ministers \u2014 incoming interior minister Aryeh Deri and Ben-Gvir \u2014 have criminal records. Deri, who served time in prison in 2002 for bribery, pleaded guilty to tax fraud earlier this year, and Netanyahu and his coalition passed a law this week to allow him to serve as a minister despite his conviction. Ben-Gvir was convicted in 2009 of inciting racism and supporting a terrorist organization. Israel's figurehead president, Isaac Herzog, on Wednesday expressed \"deep concern\" about the incoming government and its positions on LGBTQ rights, racism and the country's Arab minority in a rare meeting with Ben-Gvir, one of the coalition's most radical members. Herzog urged Ben-Gvir to \"calm the stormy winds.\" The government platform also mentioned that the loosely defined rules governing holy sites, including Jerusalem's flashpoint shrine known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, would remain the same. Ben-Gvir and other Religious Zionism politicians had called for the \"status quo\" to be changed to allow Jewish prayer at the site, a move that risked inflaming tensions with the Palestinians. The status of the site is the emotional epicenter of the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In an interview with CNN published Wednesday, King Abdullah II of Jordan warned that his country would respond if Israel crossed red lines and tried to change the status of the sacred Jerusalem site, over which Jordan has custodianship. \"If people want to get into a conflict with us, we're quite prepared,\" he said.",

            "article_content": "Ayesha Rascoe talks with journalist Eve Fairbanks about her book: \"The Inheritors: An Intimate Portrait of South Africa's Racial Reckoning.\" It focuses on the lives of three ordinary people.  AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: It's been 28 years since apartheid ended in South Africa and the celebrated election of Nelson Mandela. But the country's people are still wrestling with the after-effects of white minority rule. A new book details how deeply decades of institutionalized racism etched itself into the psyches of South Africans. It's called \"The Inheritors.\" It's by journalist Eve Fairbanks, a white woman who grew up in Virginia but spent years in South Africa getting to know the people whose stories are told in the book. I did ask her if she had any apprehension about writing about the lives of Black South Africans and white Afrikaners. EVE FAIRBANKS: I absolutely thought about that, I mean, which is part of why at times I thought, oh, I should I should really mainly write about white South Africans. I still don't know if I have the right to have written this book. I will say that people told me that it was a big frustration that people from other countries seemed to want their story to have ended, one way or another. But there were a lot of people who really wanted to express the complexity and the ambiguity and the kind of multiple stories that were happening there and to have their - to have the country seen in a way that was more complex. RASCOE: I mean, you make this observation in the book. You say South Africans all seem to have this kind of survivor's guilt over apartheid. Can you talk a bit about that? FAIRBANKS: Yeah. You know, apartheid persisted long after the vast majority of other African countries freed themselves from colonialism, and the justification that the white regime used was that, look; maybe this actually honestly isn't that just, but frankly, we can't give it up, or else we'll be rounded up and killed in revenge. And I realized, you know, it was one of the most surprising things, was how burdensome and painful psychologically it could be to white South Africans that that did not happen. You know, these people policed South African Black townships in this very - pretty brutal way, and they justified it as necessary to themselves. And if it turns out that it wasn't necessary, it just makes you look, like, not only immoral, but foolish. And it really deepens the kind of gravity of the sin that was committed. RASCOE: Part of what happened and what I did find fascinating about the book is, like, when you go into after apartheid is over, there was this kind of magical thinking on the behalf of, you know, even Black people in South Africa that once white minority rule is over, everything is going to be great and that Black South Africans would be able to get land. They would be farming. They would be able to enjoy the riches. And that is not what happened. FAIRBANKS: I talk in the book to a government - a South African government official. And he said to me that when he and his colleagues and friends were fighting white minority rule, that they were looking at the white parts of the country as what would be coming to everyone. RASCOE: Mmm hmm. FAIRBANKS: And that on some level, they didn't really allow themselves to contemplate the fact that, in his words, it was going to be the whole country, meaning the parts that had never been given any resources, the parts that were extremely poor, the parts that had been deprived intentionally. They were getting the whole problem, in a sense, and not only the part that the white government had made really nice for white people. And, you know, he said it's a little embarrassing. RASCOE: Once the racial segregation changed, that, the economic part of it, did not change. FAIRBANKS: Mmm hmm. RASCOE: You know, this book is \"The Inheritors.\" Like, what do you think that, ultimately, South Africa has inherited when it comes to this issue of race? And what do you want the audience to take from that? FAIRBANKS: The psychology of a segregationist system, and a kind of sense of a psychological chess game. One thing that I describe in the book is Malaika, who is incredibly accomplished. She's now studying geography, but she really wrestles in herself with whether to vote for Mandela's party, for the historic anti-apartheid party, the African National Congress. On the one hand, she's completely disappointed in them and disillusioned by the fact that they haven't really undone more than they have, and that some of them have stepped into, almost, the roles of the old white oppressors, it can seem at times. And then the other part of her reacts to what can be a pretty vicious white South African criticism of them and wants to defend them and wants to support them because of that. And then she asks herself, well, why am I still sculpting my political opinions based on what white people think? So it's a - kind of a hall of mirrors that you end up going down. RASCOE: Eve Fairbanks, author of \"The Inheritors,\" thank you so much for joining us. FAIRBANKS: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "The U.S. student body is more diverse than ever before. Nevertheless, public schools remain highly segregated along racial, ethnic and socioeconomic lines. That's according to a report released Thursday by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO). More than a third of students (about 18.5 million of them) attended a predominantly same-race/ethnicity school during the 2020-21 school year, the report finds. And 14% of students attended schools where almost all of the student body was of a single race/ethnicity. The report is a follow up to a 2016 GAO investigation on racial disparity in K-12 schools. That initial report painted a slightly worse picture, but findings from the new report are still concerning, says Jackie Nowicki, the director of K-12 education at the GAO and lead author of the report. \"There is clearly still racial division in schools,\" says Nowicki. She adds that schools with large proportions of Hispanic, Black and American Indian/Alaska Native students \u2013 minority groups with higher rates of poverty than white and Asian American students \u2013 are also increasing. \"What that means is you have large portions of minority children not only attending essentially segregated schools, but schools that have less resources available to them.\" Loading... \"There are layers of factors here,\" she says. \"They paint a rather dire picture of the state of schooling for a segment of the school-age population that federal laws were designed to protect.\" Segregation has historically been associated with the Jim Crow laws of the South. But the report finds that, in the 2020-21 school year, the highest percentage of schools serving a predominantly single-race/ethnicity student population \u2013 whether mostly white, mostly Hispanic or mostly Black etc. \u2013 were in the Northeast and the Midwest. School segregation has \"always been a whole-country issue,\" says U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., who heads the House education and labor committee. He commissioned both the 2016 and 2022 reports. \"The details of the strategies may be different, but during the '60s and '70s, when the desegregation cases were at their height, cases were all over the country.\" The GAO analysis also found school segregation across all school types, including traditional public schools, charter schools and magnet schools. Across all charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately run, more than a third were predominantly same-race/ethnicity, serving mostly Black and Hispanic students. Nowicki and her team at the GAO say they were not surprised by any of the report's findings. They point to historical practices, like redlining, that created racially segregated neighborhoods. And because 70% of U.S. students attend their neighborhood public schools, Nowicki says, racially segregated neighborhoods have historically made for racially segregated schools. \"There are historical reasons why neighborhoods look the way they look,\" she explains. \"And some portion of that is because of the way our country chose to encourage or limit where people could live.\" Though the 1968 Fair Housing Act outlawed housing discrimination on the basis of race, the GAO says that in some states, current legislation reinforces racially isolated communities. \"Our analysis showed that predominantly same-race/ethnicity schools of different races/ethnicities exist in close proximity to one another within districts, but most commonly exist among neighboring districts,\" the report says. One cause for the lack of significant improvement, according to the GAO, is a practice known as district secession, where schools break away from an existing district \u2013 often citing a need for more local control \u2013 and form their own new district. The result, the report finds, is that segregation deepens. \"In the 10 years that we looked at district secessions, we found that, overwhelmingly, those new districts were generally whiter, wealthier than the remaining districts,\" Nowicki says. Loading... Six of the 36 district secessions identified in the report happened in Memphis, Tenn., which experienced a historic district merger several years ago. Memphis City Schools, which served a majority non-white student body, dissolved in 2011 due to financial instability. It then merged with the neighboring district, Shelby County Schools, which served a wealthier, majority white population. Joris Ray was a Memphis City Schools administrator at the time of the merger. He recalls that residents of Shelby County were not satisfied with the new consolidated district. They successfully splintered off into six separate districts. As a result, the GAO report says, racial and socioeconomic segregation has grown in and around Memphis. All of the newly formed districts are whiter and wealthier than the one they left, which is now called Memphis-Shelby County Schools. \"This brings negative implications for our students overall,\" says Ray, who has led Memphis-Shelby County Schools since 2019.  \"Research has shown that students in more diverse schools have lower levels of prejudice and stereotypes and are more prepared for top employers to hire an increasingly diverse workforce.\" The GAO report finds that this pattern \u2013 of municipalities removing themselves from a larger district to form their own, smaller school district \u2013 almost always creates more racial and socioeconomic segregation. Overall, new districts tend to have larger shares of white and Asian American students, and lower shares of Black and Hispanic students, the report finds. New districts also have significantly fewer students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, a common measure of poverty.",

The nation's premier tool to protect voting rights is in mortal danger, threatened on multiple fronts by the Supreme Court and lower-ranking federal judges, scholars and civil rights advocates say. The latest blow to the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 came this week in Arkansas, where a federal judge appointed by former President Donald Trump dismissed a case over new statehouse maps. The NAACP and the American Civil Liberties Union argued that the maps diluted the power of Black voters. But the judge said he found no way for the outside advocates to proceed. \"Only the Attorney General of the United States can bring a case like this one,\" wrote  Judge Lee Rudofsky. The ACLU said the decision flouts decades of precedent and vowed to appeal. \"This ruling was so radical that there was no choice but to appeal it,\" said Sophia Lin Lakin, deputy director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project. \"Private individuals have brought cases under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act to protect their right to vote for generations.\" The Arkansas ruling followed comments made by Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch only seven months ago in an unrelated case over the scope of the Voting Rights Act, where he expressed doubts about private rights to sue. \"They are teeing up statutory and constitutional questions for the Court with the justifiable belief that the Court will welcome the narrow interpretation and the opportunity to further narrow the statute,\" said Guy-Uriel Charles, an election law professor at Harvard Law School. The Arkansas case is the latest in a string of defeats for civil rights advocates, as conservative-leaning judges slowly dismantle key provisions of the law. \"The reality is that we're in a period right now where things are in flux; there is a new majority on the Supreme Court and defendants are throwing things out there to see what sticks,\" said Deuel Ross, senior counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, on a recent Election Law Blog podcast.

When the Supreme Court gutted a key part of the voting rights law eight years ago, Roberts said laws must pertain to current circumstances. Barrett is part of the court's conservative majority. More than eight years ago, a closely divided Supreme Court gutted the most potent part of the voting rights law, known as Section 5, by taking away the Justice Department's authority to pre-approve ballot changes in places with a history of discrimination. The ruling put government lawyers in a position of constantly playing catch-up to a series of changes, large and small, in mostly southern states. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the law imposed \"extraordinary measures\" to fight racial discrimination. But, he said, circumstances changed in recent decades, citing rising voter turnout among Black voters. \"Our country has changed, and while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions,\" Roberts wrote, pointing out the permanent ban on racial discrimination still exists in Section 2 of the law. Then, in July 2021, the high court made it more difficult for people to sue under Section 2, which bars states from passing laws that result in \"a denial or abridgement\" on voters \"on account of race or color,\" by requiring plaintiffs to show they'd shouldered a significant burden or faced other hurdles. Charles, of Harvard Law School, said that ruling is a clear signal of how the Supreme Court will review future voting rights challenges. The court has already agreed to hear another case next term involving the scope of Section 2 and new maps in Alabama. As a preliminary matter, earlier this month, the justices paused a lower-court ruling that the maps put Black voters in Alabama at a disadvantage. Roberts and three liberal justices dissented. \"[I]t does a disservice to Black Alabamians who under that precedent have had their electoral power diminished\u2014in violation of a law this Court once knew to buttress all of American democracy,\" wrote dissenting Justice Elena Kagan.

Robert Driscoll, who served in the Justice Department's Civil Rights division under former President George W. Bush, a Republican, said it's far too soon to sound a death knell for the Voting Rights Act and that racially discriminatory voting practices, whether intentional or not, are still illegal. The real risk is that the political parties will weaken confidence in elections generally, as they \"energize their activist bases with hyperbolic references about the realities of voting,\" Driscoll said. \"Voter turnout is as as high as it's ever been in this country and it is easier to vote than ever, as Democratic activists complain about 'voter suppression,' \" he said. \"At the same time, it is harder to cheat in an election than it ever has been and Republicans complain about voter fraud.\" Charles, of Harvard, however, said a chill wind is blowing from the federal courts. \"I would be very surprised if the Court does not interpret the statute in such a way as to take away the authority of states to draw majority-minority districts under the Act, except in cases in which the states have engaged in blatantly clear racial discrimination,\" he said.",

            "article_content": "NPR's Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep talks with former Vice President Mike Pence about his new book, \"So Help Me God,\" and how his faith informed his political career.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Former Vice President Mike Pence is considering a presidential run. He would seek the Republican nomination against Donald Trump, the president he once served. In a memoir, he's telling his story of January 6, 2021, when he ignored demands to overturn Trump's election defeat. He discussed his role in that election on today's Morning Edition. Pence also talked about his life with our own Steve Inskeep. STEVE INSKEEP, BYLINE: We met at the Indiana State Capitol, where Pence once served as governor. He grew up in the small city of Columbus, Ind. And his book, \"So Help Me God,\" describes his youth. He was overweight and unhappy about it, he writes, a kid out of place but also eager to rise. MIKE PENCE: That kid will always be in me. And he's one of the reasons I have a fundamental distrust of my own ambition. INSKEEP: He lost the weight and won speech competitions sponsored by the Optimist Club. He also says he grew full of himself and struggled to reconcile his ambition with his evangelical faith. He ran for Congress, lost and later publicly recanted negative campaigns. In 2016, he agreed to serve as Donald Trump's running mate and vouched for him to other evangelicals. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PENCE: Donald Trump is a good man, and he will... INSKEEP: In our talk this week, he no longer called Trump a good man but says he is still praying for him. Much of Pence's memoir dwells in the way that his faith shaped his conservative politics and view of the world. One of the most interesting chapters in this book is called \"Blessed.\" PENCE: (Laughter). INSKEEP: You laugh, but it's an interesting chapter. PENCE: Do you like the title? INSKEEP: It's a fascinating title. And it begins with a quote, a biblical quote, about persecution. And in the course of the chapter, which is about your faith and people's responses to your faith, you say you have been mocked, that you were the focus of a mania about your faith, that you faced hostility and intolerance and that Christians generally were insulted and demeaned and also that your faith had been misunderstood. What is it that people misunderstood? PENCE: Well, let me say, Steve, I've never heard any of that from you. But when my wife was attacked for teaching at a Christian school, when one media outlet after another ridiculed our Christian faith from time to time, I was always struck by that because, you know, as I traveled around America, the words I most often heard were - people would reach out across a rope line or stop me on a street corner and say, I'm praying for you. I mean, this is a nation of faith, of different faiths. But the American people cherish faith in the overwhelming majority. And yet it seemed to be a subject of fascination by some in the liberal media. But it was always a blessing to me because the net effect of it was, as I would learn traveling around the country, I was always reminded that some of the criticism from those on the left about my deeply held religious beliefs would invariably remind people that I - who shared those values and those beliefs that we shared something in common. INSKEEP: When you said you were misunderstood in the chapter, I believe you were talking about people in the LGBTQ community. Is there something on issues having to do with sexual orientation and gender that people misunderstand about you? PENCE: Well, I write an entire chapter in the book about our experience here in Indiana with the passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. You know, I believe President John F. Kennedy said to lead is to be misunderstood. INSKEEP: In 2015, the Supreme Court affirmed a right to same-sex marriage. Pence was then governor of Indiana and signed what was seen as a response. The state religious freedom law said no person or church or company should have to bear a, quote, \"substantial burden on their religious beliefs.\" Critics asserted that that allowed discrimination for religious reasons, though Pence tried to defend the law on ABC. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes or no. Should it be legal to discriminate against gays and lesbians? PENCE: George, you're following the mantra of the last week online, and you're trying to make this issue about something else. What I am for is protecting, with the highest standards in our courts, the religious liberty of Hoosiers. INSKEEP: Facing overwhelming public pressure, the governor signed follow-up bills that assured protection. PENCE: I don't support discrimination against gays or lesbians or anyone else. INSKEEP: Pence still insists the original law did not discriminate. He adds that, in recent years, the Supreme Court has supported religious concerns like the ones he raised. A Colorado baker, for example, who famously declined to make a cake for a gay wedding won his case. And that was even before the Trump administration added three justices to the court. PENCE: I will tell you I have been encouraged that the Supreme Court has been striking a balance on the issues of religious liberty and individual rights. But if there's anything people don't understand well about the Pences is to know Karen and Mike Pence - to know our family. We love everybody. My faith tells me to love your neighbor as yourself. And that's something we aspire to do every day, whether we agree with every view or every value of the people that we meet. INSKEEP: One thing that occurred to me as I read that chapter is that some of the words you use to describe the way you've been treated, I feel that I've heard from people who identify as lesbian or gay or trans, that they faced hostility or a mania, that they'd been mocked, that they faced intolerance, that they were insulted, they were demeaned. You probably followed the news of the nightclub shooting in Colorado just in the last few days. PENCE: Heartbreaking. INSKEEP: What would you say to reassure your fellow citizens who feel that way? PENCE: Well, I do believe that it adheres to the American character to show tolerance - it's just who we are. For many Bible-believing Christians, we perceive what I call the intolerance of tolerance - that in the name of tolerance, people are intolerant of... INSKEEP: Toward people like you. You feel... PENCE: ...Traditional views. And I don't argue for a moment that people on the other end of that debate have felt the same way. It's why one of the reasons is that I think we need to get to a place where we recognize, again, what really the First Amendment is all about. And that is it's the right to live, to work, to worship according to the dictates of your conscience and to respect one another. INSKEEP: How do you grade your party, particularly this year, on that issue of tolerance? I'm thinking of the governor of Utah, a Republican who vetoed a bill having to do with trans sports and was overridden and, as part of that, issued a message in which he said, I want to show compassion for people even if I don't agree with them. And also, it seemed to me, he was saying, I don't understand why this is even important. Why are we legislating on something that involves so few people, the suggestion being that a small number of people were being demonized. How would you grade your party on that? PENCE: I think our party has made it clear that the doors of the Republican Party are wide open. I mean, I remember being at the Republican National Convention when the president acknowledged the support of the LGBT community. And there was rousing applause at that Cleveland convention, Steve. You remember. You were there. You know? INSKEEP: The administration reversed trans issues in the military, for example, programs that were attempting to encourage tolerance there. PENCE: Well, and I respect and support that decision. I just think we always need to put military readiness and the mission of our military first. INSKEEP: The Trump administration prevented trans people from openly serving, arguing their presence would interfere with military readiness, though the Pentagon found their service consistent with that. The Biden administration now allows them to serve. Former Vice President Mike Pence is considering his future. His memoir, \"So Help Me God,\" is seen as a possible preliminary to a presidential run. KELLY: That's NPR's Steve Inskeep in conversation with former Vice President Mike Pence. (SOUNDBITE OF BADBADNOTGOOD AND GHOSTFACE KILLAH SONG, \"GUNSHOWERS\") Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

            "article_content": "NPR's Mary Louise Kelly talks with former Attorney General Eric Holder about the Supreme Court hearings in the Alabama redistricting case which could weaken protections held by the Voting Rights Act.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Is the Supreme Court poised to deliver another blow to the landmark Voting Rights Act? The court has done so more than once in this last decade. Yesterday, justices heard arguments in a case that could weaken the act once again. At issue, an Alabama congressional redistricting plan drawn by that state's Republican-controlled state legislature in which only 1 of 7 districts is majority Black even though more than a quarter of Alabama's population is African American. With me to discuss is Eric Holder. Attorney general under President Obama, he's now chair of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, which supports the plaintiff in this Alabama case. Welcome. ERIC HOLDER: Well, thanks for having me. KELLY: The Voting Rights Act, as you well know, was designed to protect racial minorities from discrimination in voting - Section 2 of that act. A lower court has already ruled this Alabama map violates the act because it dilutes the power of Black voters. You think it does. HOLDER: Oh, absolutely. I mean, and I think it's very significant that that three-judge panel included two Trump-appointed judges that said that the map drawn by the Alabama Republican legislature violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965 because it failed to provide Black voters in the state the opportunity to participate equally in the political process and to be represented accordingly. This is a textbook - a textbook example of a violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. And I think very, very importantly, you know, in dissent - the Supreme Court took the case, and in dissent, Chief Justice Roberts wrote - and I quote - \"the district court properly applied existing law.\" And then he added - and again, I quote - \"an extensive opinion with no apparent errors for our correction.\" This is a case that is, as Justice Kagan said in oral argument yesterday, a slam dunk. KELLY: So... HOLDER: And the only question is whether or not the Supreme Court is prepared to, in essence, redo, undo further harm the Voting Rights Act of 1965. KELLY: Let's lay out the gist of the argument that Alabama is making in court 'cause I want to let you respond. The state solicitor general, Edmund LaCour, says that the law, the Voting Rights Act, was meant to cover only intentional discrimination. He argues Alabama is not intentionally discriminating here. On the contrary, it is taking a race-neutral approach to redistricting. What do you think? HOLDER: Well, first, that states the law in an inappropriate way. It's not a question of intent. It really is a question of effects. What is the impact of what the state legislature did? And I think it's also interesting that this nonracial approach that they are taking has a disproportionate negative impact on people of color in Alabama. Alabama is a state where you could draw districts - two districts where African American citizens would have the opportunity to pick who they wanted to have represent them. There is - there are sufficient numbers of African Americans in Alabama. They are geographically compact so that you could draw two districts there instead of the one in which they have all been placed quite easily and have districts that look like normal, regular districts. KELLY: What about - he went on to argue - this is still Edmund LaCour, the state solicitor general - that the bigger, broader goal of the Voting Rights Act was to transform us to a society no longer fixated on race. He said the plaintiffs - and you're backing them - would transform that statute into one that, quote, \"requires racial discrimination in districting.\" And the goal is, of course, to take us to a political system in which race no longer matters. That seemed to be an argument that maybe some of the conservative justices might be considering. HOLDER: Yeah, except it flies in the face of that which they are confronted. They - again, this, quote-unquote, \"race-neutral approach\" has resulted in the disenfranchisement of the African American community in Alabama. You know, so they say they want to do things in a race-neutral way. Well, their race-neutral way has a very race-negative impact. And that is just a fact. I mean, just look at these statistics. You know, 27% of the population, only about 14% of the congressional representation. You know, this notion of, you know, high-handed arguments about trying to do things in a race-neutral way while ignoring the racial impacts of their approach is hypocritical. KELLY: This question of intent came up over and over yesterday. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson weighed in and spoke to the history of the 14th and 15th Amendments, which, as you know, were enacted after the Civil War to guarantee political power to formerly enslaved people. Here's what she said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KETANJI BROWN JACKSON: I don't think that the historical record establishes that the founders believed that race neutrality or race blindness was required. KELLY: Eric Holder, what do you make of that reasoning? HOLDER: The rookie got it exactly right. You know, with all due respect to - I shouldn't have said that, but I mean, the newest justice got it exactly right. The post-Civil War amendments are infused with the desire to make fair for the newly enfranchised, newly freed American citizens to fully participate in our democracy. The statutes that we're talking about, the 1965 Voting Rights Act, is based, in fact, on the 14th Amendment, which is a post-Civil War amendment. And so I think her analysis is spot on. KELLY: So let's broaden this beyond Alabama. What do you see as the potential effects of this case on voting rights across the U.S.? Because there are related fights underway in Ohio, Wisconsin, I could go on. HOLDER: Yeah. I mean, a negative decision in this case will absolutely result in fewer voting protections around the country, less representation in Congress for communities of color around the country. It will allow politicians to draw and then to enforce even more extreme gerrymanders to prevent voters from having the opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice. People should understand that if you extrapolate from this case, it will have impacts far beyond just African American citizens in Alabama. KELLY: And what about the impact on the Voting Rights Act? Can it survive another body blow? This was a case - a point that Justice Kagan was making yesterday. HOLDER: And that's a very legitimate question. After the Shelby County decision in 2013 that essentially took away from the justice... KELLY: That has your name on it, we should mention. This was Shelby County, Ala., v. Holder. HOLDER: Yeah, I just call it the Shelby County case. But the (inaudible) of the Shelby County case took away the preclearance capability or capacity of the Justice Department. That really gutted in a substantial way the impact - the power of the Voting Rights Act. And we relied then to say, all right, well, you still have Section 2. If you now take that away, the Voting Rights Act will essentially be hollowed out and will really mean - make more important congressional action to put in place a new Voting Rights Act. KELLY: We just have a minute or so left. If the court rules in Alabama's favor - not the outcome you want, I know - but where do you take the fight from here? HOLDER: It'll be difficult. You know, we'll have to - all things are about elections in the United States of America, and it means getting more people to the polls in as many ways as you possibly can. But at some point, you can only do so much against structural things that are upheld by the courts, whether they be racial or partisan gerrymanders. Those things at some point are ultimately hard to to outvote, hard to out-organize. You know, but we'll find ways. You know, other generations of Americans have faced difficulties and always found a way to protect our democracy. I suspect we'll be able to do so as well. KELLY: Eric Holder was attorney general of the United States from 2009 to 2015, the first African American to hold that office. Eric Holder, thank you. HOLDER: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

            "article_content": "In Brackeen v. Haaland, the Supreme Court will decide the future of the Indian Child Welfare Act, which prioritizes placing Native children in the foster care or adoption system with Native families.  ELISSA NADWORNY, HOST: What started as a custody battle over a foster child heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. And the decision may have implications for the sovereignty of all Native American tribes. The case is Brackeen v. Haaland. The Brackeens, who are white, adopted a Native child after a prolonged fight with the Navajo Nation. Haaland is Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, who also happens to be a member of the Pueblo of Laguna. The Department of the Interior helps administer the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act, often called ICWA, which says that when a Native American child is in the foster system, the government should try first to place that child with a blood relative, a citizen of that child's tribe or any tribal citizen looking to adopt. If the U.S. Supreme Court finds that the Indian Child Welfare Act is unconstitutional, that could dismantle other legal protections for all Native Americans. Rebecca Nagle is a citizen of Cherokee Nation and host of the podcast \"This Land,\" whose second season dives deep into the details of this case. Welcome. REBECCA NAGLE: Thanks so much for having me. NADWORNY: So the Brackeens have already adopted their child. What's their argument? NAGLE: They are saying that ICWA, while it didn't prevent them from adopting this toddler, that it made that adoption more difficult. You know, it's kind of like a white student suing a university over the affirmative action policy, but then that student was actually admitted to the school. NADWORNY: So we're talking about racial discrimination in their argument? NAGLE: Yeah, and that's really why this case is a really big threat to really the legal foundation of the rights of Indigenous nations in the United States. So the Brackeens and their co-plaintiffs claim that their constitutional rights were violated because they experienced racial discrimination because they are not Native, even though, again, for the most part, the non-Native foster parents did win custody. And so what is scary about that argument - and it takes a couple steps to understand - but basically, the way that the law works in the United States is that there's a whole host of laws that treat tribes and tribal citizens differently. And that difference in the law isn't based on race, but is based on our unique political status as sovereign Indigenous nations. And so if ICWA discriminates based on race, well, then what about, like, the health clinic where I go and get my teeth cleaned? If you're not a tribal citizen, you can't get your teeth cleaned there. What about gaming regulations that allow tribes to operate casinos where non-Native casino developers can't? If we're just a racial group, what racial group in the United States has its own courts, its own police force, its own land base, its own water rights, its own government, its own elections? And so the thinking or the fear is, is that the Brackeen case is the first in a series of dominoes. And if they can topple ICWA, then everything else will go with it. NADWORNY: Why does the Indian Child Welfare Act exist in the first place? NAGLE: So in the 1950s and the 1960s, the U.S. federal government systematically removed Native children from their families and their tribes. And I think it's important to note that the removal of children from a racial or ethnic group is an internationally recognized form of genocide. And so an organization did a big national survey, and they found that 25- to 35% of all Native children had been taken out of their home. And, you know, a lot of times, people just focus on, you know, the placement preferences - that first, kids should go to a blood relative and then another member of their tribe. But the law actually does a lot of stuff. It's kind of like a set of guardrails so that when a Native child either enters foster care or enters an adoption, like a private adoption, it works to keep that child connected to their family and connected to their tribe. If you look at who is talking about whether or not ICWA is good for Native kids or bad for Native kids, on the ICWA is bad side, you have a small handful of right-wing organizations that have no expertise or track record in child welfare and the private adoption industry. And then on the side of saying that ICWA is a good law that benefits Native children, basically every leading national child welfare organization in the United States. And so when we look at what people who are invested in the well-being of children in child welfare have to say, it's almost unanimous that ICWA is a good law. NADWORNY: And yet the Indian Child Welfare Act has been challenged a lot over time. What are the chances that it gets struck down? NAGLE: I think very high. I think, unfortunately, when it comes to federal courts, there's a lot of misunderstanding about how tribal sovereignty and even just this particular area of the law even works. I think it's quite likely that the Supreme Court will disregard precedent, will disregard even just the rules of civil procedure and whether or not these individual plaintiffs even have standing, even disregard, you know, just facts and the truth. That's absolutely a test for the Supreme Court, and whether or not those things of precedent, of the underlying facts still matter to this court or if it's just politics. NADWORNY: That is Rebecca Nagle, host of the podcast \"This Land\" and citizen of Cherokee Nation. Thanks. NAGLE: Thank you for having me. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "NPR's Mary Louise Kelly talks with Washington Free Beacon editor-in-chief Eliana Johnson and Washington Post politics reporter Amber Phillips about the overturning of Roe and developments on gun laws.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: We're staying with our top story, the Supreme Court reversing Roe v. Wade and eliminating the constitutional right to abortion. And I want to get context and perspective from two journalists who have tracked the abortion debate in this country for years - Eliana Johnson, editor-in-chief of the Washington Free Beacon - that's a conservative online newspaper - and Amber Phillips, politics reporter at The Washington Post. Welcome to you both. AMBER PHILLIPS: Hi there. ELIANA JOHNSON: Thank you. KELLY: And I want to also give fair warning. I am going to carve out a couple of minutes at the end to talk about developments from this week on gun control and gun rights, which I think would in any other week would be our top story, but here we are. We are going to start with Roe v. Wade. And, Eliana, you kick us off. I wonder what leapt out at you as you read this opinion in which Justice Alito argues that the reasoning in Roe was, quote, \"egregiously wrong from the start.\" JOHNSON: It's interesting. I actually don't think that that's a controversial view. I think that's a view pretty widely held among constitutional scholars. Whether or not they agree with the decision to overturn it, Roe was a pretty weak opinion. But from a purely political perspective, I think on the right, we're in a moment where we see institutions under attack. Certainly, we saw that with the January 6 hearings this week. This is hands-down the biggest and most important ruling and victory for the conservative movement in the seven years that it's existed. And it's the product of major institutional forces. The right has put an enormous amount of emphasis on the courts in the form of the Federalist Society, which was founded in 1982. But it got help from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and from an anti-institutionalist, President Donald Trump, who put three of the five justices in - who joined the majority opinion today. And so that confluence of forces join together to deliver - I don't think very many people would disagree - the biggest victory for the conservative movement in its existence. KELLY: Well, and it's interesting. You're saying that you think that there's consensus that Roe was perhaps egregiously wrong or weakly argued from the start. But a majority of justices have upheld that reasoning in the five decades since. Amber, what struck you? PHILLIPS: Yeah. I think what struck me is that Justice Samuel Alito, the author of this opinion, didn't back down from being really controversial and kind of in your face about what - why he thought Roe should be denounced. He compared it to - just like he did in the draft opinion - a case upholding racial segregation and saying both were egregiously wrong. And he used that to argue why he thought the court should overturn legal precedent, something that a generation, even more, of Americans have come to take for granted as a right. He said, listen. If I'm going to read the Constitution really literally, and he even said, I don't care how this plays out politically, but I think this is the right way to read into whether abortion should be protected, which is that the Constitution doesn't specifically mention it, and then therefore, I think we should overturn it. And he essentially said it doesn't matter to me that the Supreme Court twice, in two really big cases, as you point out, upheld abortion rights. He said... KELLY: Well, sorry to jump in. I just - let me turn us to where this goes politically. We've heard Nancy Pelosi, we've heard Joe Biden say, this fall, Roe is on the ballot. Senator Durbin, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, says he's going to hold hearings next month. Amber, what can Democrats do? PHILLIPS: Well, this is an emotional moment for them. Some Democrats were singing on the House floor today. And President Biden and top House Democrats talked about how we need to rally voters, and we're going to support abortion rights. But there's not a lot they can do, other than to urge Americans who support abortion rights to vote in these November midterm elections. And it's not clear to me that's going to happen. Abortion rights supporters have rarely, if ever, been motivated to go to the polls on these issues. Of course, that could change now that this isn't a protection that many Americans can take for granted. KELLY: Eliana, what do you think? Where does this go legislatively? JOHNSON: I do think it's an issue that will be on the ballot. We're going to see 26 states enact pretty quickly laws that will restrict abortion. And if, in fact, pro-choice activists or abortion rights activists are correct that this is not democratically popular, we will see the legislators who enacted those laws removed from office. And we will see legislators put in their place who will write new laws. So I certainly think that we will see a lot of churn in the democratic process around this issue. KELLY: Quick take from each of you. Justice Thomas, in his concurring opinion today, suggested that other landmark decisions, including same-sex marriage, including contraception, that should be in play. Do you believe these are now in play? Eliana. JOHNSON: I'm not sure. I found it notable that he was the only justice among the five who joined the majority who said that, and that Justice Alito, the author of the majority opinion, did not say that. In fact, he specifically said this applies to abortion and nothing beyond abortion. But it's hard to know if, given the political blowback that the justices are seeing - we've seen protest. They - you know, these guys go home and there are protests. Guys and gals go home and there are protests outside their homes. Whether that was stated to blunt the political blowback and to calm the waters and whether, in fact, we'll see more or not, I'm not sure. KELLY: All right. I promised I would save a couple minutes to talk guns. So we had two seismic developments on guns this week. The Supreme Court, in a different ruling, saying there is a constitutional right to carry a handgun in public for self-defense, and then the Senate and now today the House voting to pass a bipartisan gun safety bill. To what extent does this reframe our national conversation about guns? Amber. PHILLIPS: Well, I think - let's start with what Congress did. This is the first significant gun control legislation in 30 years. And it's not much from a gun safety point of view. But when I talked to gun control experts after the Uvalde and Buffalo massacres, they were almost certain nothing bipartisan would come out of this. They said don't even try. They were really pessimistic, every single person I talked to. Well, Congress did do something. And that's huge. But at the same time, I talked to legal experts who point out that even when there's a political will, both in Congress and then, say, liberal states, to really restrict, like in New York, who can carry a gun in public, you have a conservative legislature doing what they did this week, which is restricting that severely. And so now it's much easier to carry a gun in public in many liberal states. KELLY: Eliana, last word. JOHNSON: I do think that the bipartisan deal was overshadowed by the Supreme Court ruling that came out earlier in the week in which Justice Clarence Thomas handed down the majority opinion, indicating that there is a constitutional right to carry guns in public and that it is likely to be quickly overshadowed - already has been overshadowed by that ruling. KELLY: That is Eliana Johnson of the Washington Free Beacon and Amber Phillips of The Washington Post helping us break down a bunch of seismic developments in this week in politics. Thanks to you both. JOHNSON: Thank you. PHILLIPS: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "For years, Evangelical Christian political groups have mobilized around limiting access to abortion. But Evangelicals were not always so involved in this fight.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: As the current Supreme Court session is winding down, the country is still waiting for the final decision on a case that could result in overturning Roe v. Wade. When Justice Samuel Alito's draft opinion was leaked last month, many anti-abortion advocates gathered near the Supreme Court to celebrate the draft, which would overturn Roe v. Wade. For years, evangelical Christian political groups have helped lead the charge around limiting access to abortion, but that was not always the case. Evangelicals were not always so involved in this fight. NPR's podcast Throughline traced that history, and we're going to return to that story now. Throughline host Rund Abdelfatah says opposition to abortion has become so associated with evangelical Christians that it seems like that's the way it's been all along. But... RUND ABDELFATAH, BYLINE: The Southern Baptist Convention - they actually passed resolutions in 1971, 1974 and 1976, after Roe v. Wade, affirming the idea that women should have access to abortion for a variety of reasons and that the government should play a limited role in that matter, which surprised us. The experts we talked to said white evangelicals at that time saw abortion as largely a Catholic issue. CHANG: So why the shift? Well, in short, she says desegregation. In 1971, two years before Roe v. Wade, there was a Supreme Court case that began to pull white evangelicals into politics. Rund and her co-host Ramtin Arablouei dove into the story of that case, known as Green v. Connally, and how it ties to the efforts to overturn Roe. ABDELFATAH: Segregation in public schools had been outlawed since 1954, but changes on the ground were really slow... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DWIGHT EISENHOWER: Southern states have instituted public school plans... ABDELFATAH: ...And complicated. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) EISENHOWER: ...For gradual progress in the enrollment and attendance of school children of all races. LISA HARPER: White supremacy is threatened at the deepest level. It's an existential threat. ABDELFATAH: This is Lisa Harper. She's written several books on Christianity, including \"Left Right & Christ: Evangelical Faith In Politics.\" RANDALL BALMER: In Holmes County, Mississippi, the first year of desegregation, the number of white students in the public schools decreased from 700 some to 28. RAMTIN ARABLOUEI, BYLINE: This is religious historian Randall Balmer. BALMER: The second year of desegregation, the number of white students in the public schools in Holmes County decreased to zero. ABDELFATAH: So where were these white students going? Well, they enrolled in private so-called segregation academies run by evangelical leaders as tax-exempt religious schools. BALMER: And a group of parents in Holmes County, Mississippi, said, this isn't right. ABDELFATAH: And they won. BALMER: And the gist of the decision was that any organization that engages in racial discrimination or racial segregation is not, by definition, a charitable institution. Therefore, it has no claims on tax-exempt status. ARABLOUEI: Many white evangelical leaders relied on those tax exemptions to operate their private, segregated schools in places like Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama and Virginia. And they felt entitled to those tax exemptions on religious grounds. BALMER: The alarm begins to grow among various evangelical leaders, including Jerry Falwell, who, of course, had his own segregation academy in Lynchburg, Va. ABDELFATAH: The name Jerry Falwell might sound familiar because he'd go on to become a leading figure of the religious right and one of the architects of the Moral Majority, a Republican political action group that would come to play an important role in American politics. ARABLOUEI: Randall Balmer says the Green v. Connally loss mobilized a lot of evangelical leaders like Falwell. HARPER: They lost the bid to protect white space once again. ARABLOUEI: Around this time, a conservative political activist named Paul Weyrich was trying really hard to grow the Republican Party base. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PAUL WEYRICH: So many of our Christians have what I call the goo-goo syndrome - good government. They want everybody to vote. I don't want everybody to vote. BALMER: And he's the person who understood the electoral potential of white evangelicals. And he set out to mobilize them. ARABLOUEI: The question was, how? BALMER: Weyrich understood that racism - and let's just call it what it is - was unlikely to be a galvanizing issue among grassroots evangelicals. ABDELFATAH: So he needed to find another issue. At the time, evangelicals were concerned about all sorts of things - government overreach, for one, and also social changes around roles of women, gay rights and free speech. Then in 1976, something unexpected happened. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Good evening. Shortly before dawn, Jimmy Carter reached the end of his... ARABLOUEI: Jimmy Carter, a Southern Baptist evangelical and Sunday school teacher, was elected president of the United States. Yet even as Carter became the face of evangelicals, he quickly began to lose support among them. BALMER: This is the great paradox surrounding Jimmy Carter in his career, is that he's the person who begins to mobilize evangelical voters, or at least to awaken them about the political process. And then, of course, through the machinations of Paul Weyrich and Jerry Falwell and others, this same group of people turn radically against Jimmy Carter four years later. ABDELFATAH: Carter didn't share a lot of their conservative views. So during Carter's presidency, Randall Balmer says that Weyrich continued searching for that holy grail of issues, the thing that had the potential to really unite evangelicals around the Republican Party. And in 1978, five years after Roe v. Wade, it finally hit him. BALMER: I was reading through Weyrich's papers, midterm election, 1978, and it's almost like the papers begin to sizzle because Weyrich's - I found it. This is the issue that's going to work for us in order to mobilize grassroots evangelical voters. ABDELFATAH: Abortion. ARABLOUEI: Because while many evangelicals weren't initially all that bothered by Roe v. Wade, a few years on, the number of abortions had begun to climb, which made some evangelicals kind of uneasy. Weyrich saw that uneasiness as an opportunity. ABDELFATAH: He teamed up with some prominent anti-abortion activists and helped amplify resistance to abortion among evangelicals. It worked. In 1979, the Moral Majority was formed. They threw their support behind Republican candidate Ronald Reagan, and Reagan won. This began the close relationship between the Republican Party and white evangelicals. CHANG: Rund Abdelfatah and Ramtin Arablouei are the hosts of NPR's Peabody-winning history podcast Throughline.

            "article_content": "After a tumultuous term that ended in June, the U.S. Supreme Court returns Monday to officially open a second potentially stormy term. It may be hard to beat last term's sustained and dramatic turn to the right, which included most prominently the overturning of a half century of precedents that had guaranteed women the right to terminate most pregnancies. But the court may well rock the boat again, despite the fact that it finds its approval ratings plummeting to historic lows. So much so that Chief Justice John Roberts sought to defend the court's legitimacy while speaking to a conference of judges and lawyers in Colorado. \"Decisions have always been subject to intense criticism, and that is entirely appropriate,\" he said, \"but lately, the criticism is phrased in terms of ... the legitimacy of the court.\" That, he said is \"a mistake.\" It is the job of the court to say what the law is, he said, \"and that role doesn't change simply because people disagree with this opinion or that opinion.\" After all, he said, \"You don't want the political branches telling you what the law is, and you don't want public opinion to be the guide of what the appropriate decision is.\" But Justice Elena Kagan pointedly disagreed with some of what Roberts said, noting in three separate appearances that in her view a court's legitimacy has to be earned. Precedent should only be reversed in the rarest of cases, she said at Northwestern's Pritzker law school. Precedent, she said, is a \"foundation stone of law,\" a doctrine of stability that \"tells people they can rely on the law.\" But if, \"all of a sudden everything is up for grabs, all of a sudden very fundamental principles of law are being overthrown ... then people have a right to say, 'You know, what's going on there? That doesn't seem very law-like.'\" Or as she put it at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island: \"The court shouldn't be wandering around just inserting itself into every hot-button issue in America, and it especially shouldn't be doing that in a way that reflects one set of political views over another.\" Kagan can see, probably better than the rest of us, that there may well be more dramatic right turns again this year on everything from affirmative action to voting rights, clean water regulations and an asserted First Amendment right to discriminate against same-sex couples in public accommodations. Indeed, the conservative court's appetite for hot-button issues appears unabated. The question of precedent will rear its head again this term in a case challenging the affirmative action programs at Harvard and the University of North Carolina. For more than four decades, the court has ruled that race may be one of many factors considered in college admissions. But the issue is back this term before a very different court. The starkest question is whether the previous decisions were grievously wrong, the same rationale the court majority used last term in overturning Roe v. Wade. In the affirmative action case, the challengers' case rests heavily on the Supreme Court's 1954 decision outlawing segregation in public schools. In other words, affirmative action, they say, is a form of discrimination. Race is also at the heart of a new challenge to a provision of the Voting Right Act. Since 2013, the court has struck down or neutered key provisions of the landmark 1965 law. And it appears poised to do it again in a case that involves allegations that Alabama engaged in racial gerrymandering to limit the influence of African American voters. Race is also central in a challenge to the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act. Texas and a group of white adoptive parents are challenging the law because it mandates that where at all possible, Indian children are to be adopted or fostered in Indian homes. There are two other huge cases before the court that will garner lots of attention. One is a test of civil rights laws that exist in most states requiring that when a commercial entity offers products or services to the public, the business may not discriminate based on race, religion, national origin or gender. Challenging these laws is Lorie Smith, a web designer in Colorado who doesn't want to make designs for same-sex couples because she asserts that would violate her religious principles. But the Supreme Court is not hearing the challenge on the basis of Smith's claim to the free exercise of religion. Instead, the court has limited the case to Smith's claim that the law violates her right to free expression. As Georgetown University's Kelsi Corkran puts it, because the court has limited the argument, \"if Smith is correct that there's a free speech right to selectively choose her customers based on the messages she wants to endorse,\" the law would also permit a white supremacist to deny services to people of color because that, too, \"would be a message of endorsement.\" Last but certainly not least, the court will hear a major election law case involving the so-called independent state legislature theory. In the current case, the North Carolina Supreme Court struck down a congressional redistricting plan on the grounds that it was an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander barred by the state constitution. The Republican leaders of the state legislature challenged the state court decision. They contend it violates Article I of the U.S. Constitution, which states that \"the times, places, and manner\" of congressional elections \"shall be prescribed in each the state by the [state] legislature.\" That argument, in its most extreme form, would mean that that no state court and no state agency could interfere with the state legislature's version of election rules, regardless of the rules set down in the state constitution. Opponents contend that would mean that state legislatures would be free to do almost anything they want, without any supervision by state courts, and without being able to delegate to local officials rules on how to run elections. While state judges across the country frequently disagree, in this case the national Conference of Chief Justices, representing all the chief legal officers in the 50 states, has filed a brief opposing much of North Carolina's argument. State judges, they say, do have the power under the U.S. Constitution to review state election laws.",

Joseph McCarthy, R-Wisc., during Senate hearings in 1954. In March of 2017, as clashes with the FBI director and attorney general were erupting just weeks into his presidency, Donald Trump was asking out loud: \"Where's my Roy Cohn?\" In December of 2020, with just weeks left in his term, Trump still had not had his question answered. He was surrounded by lawyers. But none could play the role \u2014 or take the place \u2014 of the controversial counselor who decades earlier had changed his life. Cohn was already a legend when Trump met him in 1973. Cohn had been in the news for decades, prosecuting nuclear espionage or searching for communists or defending celebrity clients. Among those he represented were Cardinal Francis Spellman, New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner and the New York crime bosses Carmine Galante and John Gotti. Trump met him in the high-fashion Manhattan bar called Le Club and was soon relying on him for advice in dealing with lawsuits and legal orders and life in general. He drew up four versions of a prenuptial agreement prior to Trump's first marriage. (His first wife, Ivana Trump, died Thursday at 73.) Cohn was known for telling clients to fight all charges, to counter-sue when sued and to never concede defeat. Trump has followed his formula for half a century, and that has come to matter a great deal to the nation. While the former president has left office, he has not left the stage. He continues to trouble the political waters by denying he was defeated in 2020 and teasing a new candidacy for 2024. Moreover, he may yet face criminal charges for what he did in an attempt to stay in office after his defeat. This past week, the hearings of the House Select Committee to Investigate the Jan. 6 Attack on the Capitol took us back to the day that attack was set in motion. It was Dec. 18, 2020, four days after the Electoral College had met in the 50 state capitols and elected Joe Biden the 46th president, obeying the results of the election as conducted in each state. So even though his defeat was by then official, Trump was still trying to find some way to remain in power. His efforts to overturn the 2020 results had made no headway in state or federal courts, even where the judges were Trump's own appointees. Law firms that had signed on to fight election fraud had found none and signed off. Trump could not even find a willing warrior within his White House legal team. Yet the frustrated incumbent still would not acknowledge reality. He went looking for someone else \u2014 outside lawyers, freelancers \u2014 who might be open to his claims of a stolen election or ready to take his case and suggest strategies. That's what led to the Dec. 18 meeting in the White House when two such lawyers \u2013 Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell \u2013 and other supporters talked to Trump about declaring martial law, using the military to seize voting machines or making Powell a \"special counsel\" with subpoena powers. When White House Counsel Pat Cipollone heard that meeting was underway, he and others from his office intervened and objected strenuously. They said the moves under discussion lacked legal basis or justification, especially given the utter lack of evidence of fraud. There was no \"steal\" to stop. But the outside team had another view. \"I would categorically describe it as: 'You guys aren't tough enough,'\" reported Giuliani in videotaped testimony to the Jan. 6 committee. Yet the brawl of the barristers continued, according to testimony, for six hours. It began in the Oval Office and continued upstairs in the personal residence. At one point, the committee was told, Trump gestured to his White House team and asked: \"Do you see what I have to put up with?\" Trump was still looking for someone who would fight by another set of rules. All-in, no holds barred, no holding back. Someone for whom the only consideration was winning for the client. Someone like Roy Cohn. Cohn was a prodigy, the son of a New York judge well acquainted with street politics as well as those of City Hall. Young Roy grew up immersed in both worlds. He would later be known for saying \"Don't tell me what the law is, tell me who the judge is.\" After rocketing through college and Columbia Law School, he was appointed an assistant U.S. attorney in New York at 20 (not old enough to vote at the time). Four years later he prosecuted Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, accused of helping the Soviet Union access nuclear weapons secrets. Both went to the electric chair. In the early 1950s, Cohn would be lead counsel for Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy when the first-term Republican from Wisconsin was chairman of a Senate committee looking for communists in government. Cohn was at his side as McCarthy was dominating the news and being mentioned for the Republicans' national ticket in 1952. Although McCarthy never actually unmasked any actual communists, he destroyed many careers and lives. Along the way his name became synonymous with an era and with the tactic of making baseless but damaging accusations that did real damage despite being untrue. Cohn was still with him when the senator took on the Army in 1954, claiming the Pentagon was protecting \"reds\" and Soviet sympathizers. That led to televised hearings that backfired and cost McCarthy much of his support in the GOP. McCarthy was censured by his colleagues in a highly unusual vote on the Senate floor. He left the chamber, never spoke there again and died a few years later. Cohn, however, went back to New York and flourished. He had established a reputation for being tough to the point of being ruthless. And in the world of high-stakes lawsuits and prosecutions, that reputation was gold. And it was earned many times over. Along the way, he met a young real estate developer on the move who would, improbably, turn out to be his most famous client of all.

Images) In her 2017 profile of Trump and Cohn's relationship in Vanity Fair, journalist Marie Brenner quoted Trump recalling his first meeting with Cohn at Le Club in 1973. She quotes Trump saying he brought up a racial discrimination lawsuit the U.S. Justice Department had filed against the real estate company he and his father ran. He asked Cohn if they should comply or try to compromise. Cohn shot back: \"Tell them to go to hell and fight the thing in court and let them prove you discriminated.\" The Trumps hired Cohn and soon announced they were suing the Justice Department for $100 million for \"defamation.\" They later dropped that suit and stipulated to measures designed to prevent future discrimination at their properties. Running for president, Trump would respond to questions about all that by emphasizing there had been \"no admission of guilt.\" As successful as he was over his 40-year career, Cohn eventually ran afoul of the law himself. He was investigated by federal authorities for perjury and witness tampering, among other charges. In 1986, a panel of the New York State Supreme Court's Appellate Division disbarred him for unethical and unprofessional conduct. A short while later, Cohn died of complications of AIDS (although he always insisted in public that he was suffering from liver cancer). What no client of Cohn's was ever left to wonder was whether or not Cohn was their champion. This may have been what shocked Trump most about being president. He expected the lawyers around him to be working for him, to be his champions. He discovered they saw their loyalty as being to their jobs, their oaths of office or the Constitution. Sometimes they agreed with him, sometimes they pushed back. In his first weeks in office, Trump met with the FBI Director James Comey and asked repeatedly for a pledge of personal loyalty. Comey demurred and was soon fired. Trump had appointed Jeff Sessions, the Alabama Republican who had been his first supporter in the Senate, to be his attorney general. So he was stunned and enraged when Sessions recused himself from the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Nearly four years later, after countless confrontations with the law and his own obligations to uphold it, Trump was still looking for a way around it. After the six-hour donnybrook of Dec. 18 had ended, and Chief of Staff Mark Meadows had personally escorted Giuliani out after midnight, Trump did not even wait for dawn to go on Twitter. \"Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,\" the president tweeted. \"Be there, will be wild.\"",

In 2018 just after he announced his retirement, Justice Anthony Kennedy, who sat at the ideological center of the court for much of his 30-year tenure, met with a small group of reporters. Was he worried that some of the precedents he helped establish--the right to abortion and LGBT  rights, for instance--might  now be in jeopardy? No, he replied. He was confident that  constitutional  rights, once established would remain in place. It took just four years, and the addition of one more Trump appointee to the Supreme Court, to prove him wrong. There is simply no way to overstate what the Supreme Court did this term. No journalist or scholar alive can remember a term  with so many earthquakes in the law. The data tell the story. The court produced more conservative decisions this term than at any time since 1931, according to statistics compiled by professors Lee Epstein of  Washington University in St. Louis and Keven Quinn of the University of Michigan. In an astounding 62% of the decisions, conservatives prevailed, and more importantly, often prevailed in dramatic ways. The sweeping nature of the court's decisions, and the sheer number of them amounted to a dream fulfilled for hard-line conservatives and a nightmare for liberals and moderates. It's not really a nightmare \"because you wake up from a nightmare and its over at some point,\" says Supreme Court advocate Tom Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog. \"The problem for the American left,\" and more centrist conservatives too, is that \"they are stuck with\" this court \"for the next quarter century. And you have a conservative majority that is... moving the goal posts...on every conceivable issue that you can imagine.\" Goldstein, who has followed the court's work for nearly three decades, admits it it is hard form him to believe what is happening. In overturning Roe v. Wade, the court erased a half century of court precedents and eliminated the constitutional right to abortion. Just weeks after the shootings in Uvalde, Texas, the court issued a broadly worded opinion making it more difficult to regulate guns. In a major environmental case, the court curbed the EPA's ability to deal with climate change, and in so doing signaled that other government assertions of regulatory power in the name of health and safety could be on the chopping block. In two religion cases, the court barely mentioned the concept of  separation between church and state; rather, it   expanded public funding options for religious schools and ruled in favor of a high school football coach who wanted to pray on the 50-yard line, a significant expansion of teachers' rights to public, even ostentatious,  religious expression  while on the job. One of the many things that distinguishes this court from any other court of the last 90-plus years is that the current court has no center. Chief Justice John Roberts very occasionally takes a more incremental approach than fellow conservatives, as he did in the abortion case. But the other five conservatives can and did in that case prevail without him. At the same time, Justice Brett Kavanaugh's voting pattern this term moved 20% to the right. So instead of this now being \"the Roberts Court,\" or a court dominated by any one justice,  professor Epstein says, it is \"the Trump court,\" because half of the 6-to-3 conservative majority was appointed by the former president. As for the liberals, says Epstein, they have become \"bit players,\" drowned out by a conservative symphony. SCOTUSblog's Goldstein points to more data that underlines the conservative supermajority's hard turn to the right.  There were more 6-to-3 decisions this term than at any time in the court's modern history, fewer unanimous decisions, and \"every single one of the more liberal justices was in dissent more times this year than in any year of their careers, including Justice Stephen Breyer,\" who has served on the court for twenty eight years. Some of the effects of the court's work were immediate, with the doors of abortion clinics closing in large swaths of the country. Other effects are already in the works, cases challenging a government regulatory structure that since the New Deal has enabled Congress to give agencies broad power to deal  with major health and safety problems--from regulations that protect that air and water, to those aimed at protecting  pharmaceuticals, food, car safety, and even the stock market, to name just a few. Even the government's attempt to mandate a vaccine-or-test regime for large private employers was shot down by the court this term, the exception being vaccine mandates for health care workers and the military. And those exceptions were by a divided vote, 5-to-4 to uphold the mandate for health care workers, 6-to-3 for the military. Conservative and liberal scholars alike describe the current court as unusually aggressive. The \"YOLO court\"--You Only Live Once-- said University of Michigan professor Leah Litman. \"A court in a very big hurry,\" said Case Western Reserve professor Jonathan Adler.  \"Heedless, \" said the ACLU's legal director David Cole. \"Reactionary, as distinguished from conservative,\" said Columbia law professor Jamal Greene, noting that the court is going backward in overturning generations of modern law and returning to legal understandings in the seventeen and eighteen hundreds. While most of the public usually pays only occasional attention to what the court does, it seems to have noticed this time. The court's public approval ratings have plunged, to a new low of as little as 25% in a recent Gallup Poll. The new conservative juggernaut has hardly finished. It has already agreed to review more hot-button issues next term. Perhaps the most important of these is a case that could radically reshape the rules for federal elections, giving state legislatures almost unfettered control over voting rules, and over the drawing of  congressional districts. If the theory prevails, state legislatures could be free to execute all manner of partisan mischief, freed from oversight by state courts, state constitutional provisions, governors,  and potentially allowing legislatures a free hand to name electoral college electors in presidential elections. In addition, the court, after gutting much of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act, now seems focused on weakening or eliminating the few remaining protections for minorities in states with a history of racial discrimination. And that, says Columbia's professor Greene, is going to have \"a lot of effects, some of them unpredictable.\" The court also looks headed to reverse another major precedent on the books for nearly a half century. Since 1978 the court has allowed colleges and universities to use race as one of many factors considered in admissions decisions. In the upcoming term, the court will revisit the issue in cases from Harvard University and the University of North Carolina. Yet another hot-button social issue that the court has accepted for review is framed as a free-speech case, but is also a test of the right to discriminate against LGBTQ members of the public in commercial services.  At issue is whether a woman who designs websites for weddings  can refuse to work for  for same-sex couples. If this term's past is prologue,  there are seemingly endless questions about where the court  might go next.  The majority opinion in the abortion case, written by Justice Samuel Alito, is based on reasoning also included in the court's precedents on same-sex marriage, the rights of couples to use and have access to contraception, and even the rights of interracial couples to marry.  And while Alito sought to rebut any notion that those decisions are in jeopardy, his abortion opinion mocked a previous abortion decision that was based in part on  those very decisions. Then too, this term's abortion decision left many questions unanswered. For instance, can a state ban a person from receiving abortion pills, approved by the FDA, and sent through the U.S. postal system?  Can states ban telemedicine appointments with doctors out of state?  In states where abortion is outlawed, can states ban advertisements and other information about how to obtain an abortion? Nor is it clear how far the court is prepared to go in its religion jurisprudence. In upholding a football coach's right to pray on the 50-yard line, surrounded by willing players, the conservative majority discarded one precedent, and seemed to leave room for more precedents to be shattered--among them the court's repeated decisions since 1962 barring teacher-led prayer in the classroom. University of Virginia law professor Douglas Laycock, a strong supporter of the free exercise of religion clause in the First Amendment, wonders how school officials, or lower court judges, are going to differentiate between prayer on the football field and prayer in the classroom. The court's decision in the prayer case is among many in recent years in which the court has dismantled prior rules that sought to draw a clear line separating church and state. Among them: The court has ruled that the constitution bars federal anti-discrimination laws, including those requiring accommodations for sick or disabled employees, from applying to lay teachers at religious schools; it ruled that a Catholic social services agency could refuse to abide by its contract with Philadelphia, a contract which required it to work with same-sex couples applying to take in foster children; it ruled that closely held for-profit corporations could refuse, on religious grounds, to abide by a federal law requiring insurance to cover contraception for their employees; it ruled that city councils and other public boards are free to open their meetings with explicitly Christian prayers. It ruled that a 4o-foot cross honoring soldiers who died in World War I could remain on state property at a busy intersection in suburban Maryland. This is far from a complete list, but it is an indication of more such decisions to come, and because religious overtones reach so many aspects of American life--from abortion to gay rights to what we want children to read or know--these decisions will have implications for millions of people.  The current court is the most pro-religion of any court in nearly 70 years, according to statistics compiled for an upcoming article in The Supreme Court Review, written by professor  Epstein  and professor  Eric Posner of the University of Chicago. While the number of pro-religion outcomes edged up to 58% overall when William Rehnquist was chief justice (1986-2005), the rate has skyrocketed to over 86% in the years since then with John Roberts as chief justice and the court's composition growing steadily more conservative. Whatever one thinks of the court's decisions in these and other cases, it quite clearly is not a court that shrinks from controversy or contention. And the subjects it is likely to take on  often pit the young against the old,  rural against urban, and even black against white--in other words the most polarizing subjects of our times. Abortion, the right to vote, affirmative action in school admission and in employment,  the rights of  LGBTQ people, the content of history taught in public schools,  and even book banning in public libraries--all of that will eventually, in all likelihood,  end up in the lap of a very conservative Supreme Court.",

Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., introduces Vice President Harris at Delta Center Stage in Greenville, Miss., on April 1. Mississippi Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson is facing one of the most high-profile moments in a political career spanning more than 50 years \u2014 leading this month's hearings intended to show Americans what fueled the violence of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Some who tune in to Thursday's prime-time hearing will encounter for the first time the chairman, a political leader from rural Mississippi with deep roots in civil rights activism. \"I'm a passionate believer that, in a democracy you have to follow the rule of law,\" Thompson told NPR. \"It has nothing to do with individuals, it has nothing to do with wealth. It has nothing to do with status in the community. It's the law. The law is colorblind.\" That personal history, said Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, made Thompson the perfect fit to chair the select committee investigating the insurrection. \"We have so many people over here who are much more interested in the headline than they are in making headway,\" Clyburn recently told NPR. \"Bennie is not interested in making the headlines.\" While Thompson's work as a small town leader taught him how to listen, a skill  critical for getting to the bottom of the insurrection, Clyburn said the most important quality he brings to his role leading the committee is his search for a more perfect union. \"Here he is, growing up, under the imperfections of this country \u2014 being affected adversely by this country's imperfections. Yet he is one being looked to now to do what is necessary to preserve it,\" Clyburn said. The Mississippi town where Thompson grew up, Bolton, had a whites-only pool and park. As a teen, he traveled 51 miles past two schools for whites to attend one for Black students. \"I never saw my hometown of Bolton when I was in high school during the day, because I caught the bus at night. It was so early in the morning, I got back so late, it was dark,\" he told a national civil rights symposium in 1989 as he was fighting for equal access for Black people in education and at the ballot box. By then, Thompson had defied racial barriers to become an alderman in that same town, followed by roles as a mayor and then county supervisor. In 1993, he won a special election to represent his majority African American district in Congress, which is anchored by the state capital in Jackson. Three years ago, he became chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. \"It's kind of interesting that somebody like Bennie Thompson, with the experiences he had growing up in Mississippi, would be the one that was out there trying to keep this democracy on track,\" said Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat who is a bit of a kindred spirit and is often seen having extended conversations with him during hours-long floor votes.

When House Democrats moved last year to create the select committee to investigate how the deadly siege on the Capitol originated and transpired, Clyburn saw Thompson as a perfect fit to lead it. He made the case to Speaker Nancy Pelosi that Thompson's civil rights work and unflappable nature positioned him to face off against powerful opponents, including former President Donald Trump and a vast share of the Republican Party. Pelosi appeared to agree, selecting him as chairman after the panel was created. \"Chairman Thompson is the chair of one of the committees of jurisdiction, Homeland Security, and this was an  assault on our homeland security and he commands a great deal of respect in our caucus and I'm very proud of what he is doing,\" Pelosi told NPR.

Now, Thompson is readying his committee of seven Democrats and two Republicans for hearings starting Thursday. The hearings draw from interviews with more than 1,000 witnesses and more than 100,000 pieces of evidence. The committee's makeup has brought about new connections with Republicans for the lifelong Democrat. The committee's vice chair, Wyoming Republican Liz Cheney, said she did not really know him before the committee was formed a year ago. She's been watching how he manages the committee and the issues and she's been \"really impressed with him,\" particularly as Thompson steers clear of partisan arguments and debate that could slow down the committee's work, Cheney said. \"He's very focused always on the substance and on the facts,\" she said.

And he says he's gained a new education about the danger the country faced that day, which he aims to share through the hearings. For Thompson, preserving democracy today means telling the full story of the attack on the Capitol and ensuring its moment in history is one that Americans never forget. \"I have learned a lot about how perilously close we came on January 6 to losing this democracy as a lot of us have come to know and love it.\"",

At its core, the abortion debate is between those who regard the fetus as a person and those who regard abortion as a rightful option for pregnant women. While there are religious and non-religious people on both sides of the argument, the loudest voices are often those of religious traditionalists on one side and contemporary secularists on the other. The discussion also entails biology, medical technology, policy questions and constitutional issues such as state's rights and a personal right to privacy. As the decades have passed, the discussion has also become saturated with partisan politics as the mix of opinion in the major parties has shifted dramatically. But through it all, there is no denying the centrality of religion. It is not so much a matter of identification with one faith or church, but of the degree of intensity of an individual's involvement. In a report issued Friday, Gallup senior scientist Frank Newport wrote: \"The pattern among Protestants and Catholics reflects the general pattern in the U.S. \u2014 the more religious the individual, the more likely that individual is to say that abortion should be illegal in all circumstances.\" Newport noted that such an outright ban was favored by \"only 9-10% of all Americans who seldom or never attend religious services,\" but that jumps to 19-23% among those who attend once a month or almost every week, and to 40% of those who attend church once a week.\" To be sure, surveys also find differences in attitude that reflect gender, age, education, party preference and geographic residence. But all of these reflect the relative religiosity of individuals within these groups.  The belief that abortion is morally wrong is embraced by 75% of those who attend services weekly, but less than half of those who seldom or never attend. \"In short the relative religiosity of Americans (that is how religious they are) is more predictive of their abortion attitudes than their broad religious identity,\" according to Newport. Going all the way back to the Supreme Court's landmark Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, which invalidated the anti-abortion statutes in effect in 46 states, the objections heard have come first and foremost from religious organizations and activists. There have been secular institutions that criticized Roe as well, including some academic and legal organizations. The biggest, ultimately, has been the Republican Party, which had been neutral on abortion in the 1970s but has since aligned in opposition. But that has reflected the rising role of religion in that party, particularly the role of evangelical and Catholic traditionalists. Many Americans, particularly those born since Roe, may find all this rather mystifying. The question arises: Since when did so much of our politics have to do with religion? And the answer is, since the beginning \u2013 and even before. Religion was a driving and determinative force in politics on this continent even before the \"United States\" had been formed. And it has been brought to bear in widely disparate causes. Religion has been invoked to condemn slavery and segregation, to ban alcohol and the teaching of evolutionary science and to bolster anti-war movements. Persecution of religious minorities in the British isles and Europe drove many of the original white settlers of the American continent across the Atlantic in the 1600s. In New England colonies, one could find the origins of both tolerance and intolerance. Rhode Island had religious freedom for all, including Jews. But in Massachusetts there were witch trials and an emphasis on religious conformity. The split tradition was in evidence at the founding of the Republic, with a mix of attitudes mainly devoted to minimizing religious rivalries and antagonism. The Constitution banned any religious test for office and the First Amendment barred the establishing of an official church. In the early 1800s, there were waves of religious feeling and new formats emerged, from the transcendentalist movement in New England to the rise of the Latter-day Saints led by Joseph Smith, who eventually found a home in Utah. But the main thrust of religion in the period was the challenge that the abolitionist movement, often led by preachers, made to the institution of slavery. The movement often adopted the language of liberation from the Bible and cast the \"peculiar institution\" of the South as not just wrong but sinful. Note the religious language in the \"Battle Hymn of the Republic,\" which speaks of Christ's death as the model for the Union's mission in the Civil War. (\"As He died to make men holy / Let us die to make men free / His truth is marching on / Glory, glory hallelujah!\") Clarence Darrow, left, and William Jennings Bryan speak with each other during the monkey trial in Dayton, Tenn., in July 1925.\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Clarence Darrow, left, and William Jennings Bryan speak with each other during the monkey trial in Dayton, Tenn., in July 1925. Appropriating biblical images was also a habit for the populist hero William Jennings Bryan, who came out of Nebraska to lead a national movement against the gold standard used to establish value at the time. His \"Cross of Gold\" speech at the 1896 Democratic National Convention led to his first nomination for president at the age of 36. (\"You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind on a cross of gold.\") He was nominated \u2014 and lost \u2014 three times. But he later served as secretary of state and became a champion of those religious traditionalists opposed to the teaching of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution in public schools. He appeared as both an attorney and a witness in the famous Scopes trial in Tennessee in 1925, arguing for a literal reading of the Bible's six-day story of creation. Bryan was also influential in the temperance movement, largely a project of Protestant activists. Supported largely by church leaders, the movement found enough support in a still-largely rural America to ban the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages in the U.S. Backed generally by rural representatives from both parties, Prohibition was achieved in 1920 by constitutional amendment (the 18th) and ended by another (the 21st) in 1933. After the repeal of Prohibition, many religious white people in the U.S. turned away from politics. While distressed at many trends in the culture, they did not see a clear path to addressing them in the public sphere. But something quite different was happening in the churches of African Americans, especially in the South. Much as the symbols of Exodus had been used a century earlier, they reappeared in the civil rights movement in the post-war American South. Songs with words such as \"Tell old Pharaoh let my people go\" were sung with new meaning, their words incorporated in sermons by preachers in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference led by the Rev. Martin Luther King.

Also borrowing from the Bible were some exponents of anti-war sentiment in both the Protestant and Catholic traditions who opposed the war in Vietnam in the 1960s and 1970s. While there had been \"conscientious objectors\" in the two world wars who cited Christ's non-violent teachings to resist military service, their numbers were few and had little impact. That changed with Vietnam, and priests and preachers were often involved in encouraging such objections. But after Vietnam, active engagement on major public issues more often came from the more conservative elements of the religious community. Some were mobilized by the Supreme Court's 1962 ruling that prayer in public schools violated the Constitution's establishment clause. Others were disturbed when courts began ruling against religious displays in official places, such as monuments to the Ten Commandments in courthouses. As the 20th century came to a close, much of the traditional religious community shifted its focus to the rising gay rights movement and \"the homosexual agenda.\" This activism had support in both parties, and President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, signed the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, his reelection year. He later said that had been a mistake. In the early years of the new century, resistance to gay rights and gender identity issues focused on same-sex marriage. In the 2004 presidential election year, Republican activists were able to include bans on such unions as ballot measures in a number of swing states \u2013 notably the bellwether state of Ohio. Robust turnout among religious conservatives in those states that year contributed to narrow wins for Republican President George W. Bush, who would the following year nominate two conservative Catholics (Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito) to the Supreme Court. That was not enough to prevent the court from reaching a historic decision in the 2015 case of Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015. With both Roberts and Alito dissenting, along with two other Catholic members appointed by earlier Republican presidents, the high court on that occasion overturned all state laws blocking same sex marriage. But the reasoning found in Alito's draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson is regarded by some as applicable to Obergefell as well, raising the possibility of another precedent being overturned. Some legal scholars think the same could be said of the 1967 ruling in Loving v. Virginia, which struck down laws against interracial marriage. Alito wrote in his draft opinion that overturning Roe would not imperil other precedents. It may seem surprising, or contrary to expectations, that contentious religious issues are gaining importance in the Republican Party at this point in U.S. history. The rising influence of religious conservatives in the GOP coincides with a steady decline in the percentage of Americans identifying with either Catholic or Protestant churches. That decline in percentage terms had begun in the latter half of the 20th century but it has accelerated since, according to periodic surveys by the Pew Research Center. Pew also found the percentage of Americans who claimed no particular religious connection (including self-described agnostics or atheists) has risen from 17% to 26% since 2009. Despite all this, or perhaps in part because of it, political activism has risen among those who do prioritize a religious connection. And that activism, including a heightened propensity to vote, has had substantial and sustained political impact over the last 40 years \u2014 owing in part to the issue of abortion and the force of Roe v. Wade. When Roe was decided, four of the seven justices who voted for it had been appointed by Republican presidents (three by Richard Nixon). Only one Republican appointee dissented. But since then, and particularly since the presidency of Ronald Reagan, the GOP has courted religious conservatives and promised them judges attuned to their causes \u2014 particularly opposition to Roe. The five current Supreme Court justices prepared to overturn Roe (according to the leaked version of the draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson) were all appointed by Republican presidents, three by Donald Trump alone. Trump had been more explicit than any of his predecessors in promising to appoint justices committed to ending Roe. Most of the voters for Republican presidents have not been Catholic but Protestant, especially white evangelical Protestants. The Catholic vote, which was overwhelmingly Democratic for nearly two centuries, is now split about evenly nationally in presidential elections. But Trump got about three-fifths of the white Catholic vote each time he was nominated. Republicans who get to the Oval Office have found the most likely nominees to please social conservatives with their eventual votes on the bench are the Catholic nominees. Non-Catholics named by Republicans since Reagan took office have not been as likely to oppose Roe. Of the seven justices they named who were Catholic, five are still on the court and four of them were named as supporting the draft of the Alito ruling overturning Roe.",

            "article_content": "White Lies author A.J. Baime tells the story of Walter White, a light-skinned Black man whose ancestors had been enslaved. For years White risked his life investigating racial violence in the South.  DAVE DAVIES, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. When lynchings and other violence against Black people were a regular occurrence in the first half of the 20th century, details of many of those crimes were reported by an intrepid, mixed-race investigator with blue eyes and straight hair who could move with ease among rural white communities. His name was Walter F. White, and he worked for the NAACP in its early years, eventually becoming chief executive of the organization. As executive secretary, White developed legal strategies to fight discrimination and recruited top litigators for the effort, including future Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. White also built the political power of the NAACP, becoming a regular visitor to the White House in the Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Truman administrations, winning important changes in federal policy. Our guest, journalist and author A.J. Baime, tells the story of Walter White in a new biography. He explains that while White was known and admired by millions of Black people across the country in his day, his legacy and influence were in the end diminished by a secret in his personal life that would undermine his authority within the NAACP. A.J. Baime is the author of five previous books, including \"Dewey Defeats Truman\" and \"The Accidental President.\" His latest is \"White Lies: The Double Life of Walter F. White And America's Darkest Secrets.\" A.J. Baime, welcome to FRESH AIR. Walter White grew up in Atlanta. He had blond hair and blue eyes. What do we know of his ancestors? A J BAIME: Firstly, thank you for having me. Walter called himself, quote, \"the enigma of a Black man occupying a white body.\" And when you see pictures of him, you see - you know, you think, well, this can't possibly be a Black man. But he did identify as Black. His parents were of the last generation of Black Americans born into enslaved families. And, you know, his complexion represented a shameful truth about our nation's history, that generations of enslaved families were born out of illicit encounters between Black women, who had no rights to their bodies, and white male slave owners, who had full legal impunity. Now, Walter's great-grandmother on his mother's side, in fact - she birthed six children in that 1830s fathered by her owner, William Henry Harrison, who later became president of the United States. So that explains - you know, we don't have Walter's face on the cover of the book, but there's a frontispiece. So his complexion is one of the first things you see. And that sort of explains why he thought of himself as an enigma. And he realizes this early in life. And he realizes that he could live a future life as a white man, a Black man or both. And he is able to sort of do both and go back and forth throughout his life. DAVIES: He chose to identify as Black, and he wrote later that his first introduction to the race question was in the September 1906 Atlanta race riot. What happened? BAIME: Well, this was a harrowing event. Walter is - he grows up during a relatively progressive period in the city of Atlanta, where white people, Black people got along well. The economy was doing really well. But the Jim Crow era arrived right as he's starting to come of age. And his father is a mail carrier. And every day after school - Walter goes to a Black school and attends a Black church. And everybody knows the family in town. So nobody thinks this is odd that a kid who has - you know, looks Caucasian, goes to this Black school and this Black church. So every day after school, he goes with his father on his father's mail route. And on this day in 1906, they knew it was coming. There had been this situation boiling up in the city, all of this racial tension that came on with - along with the Jim Crow era. And on this day in September 1906, Walter sees the outbreak of the 1906 Atlanta race riot, which was reported in newspapers all over the country, all over Europe. And he says himself that he witnesses - he's 12 years old, and he witnesses a number of people who were killed. And on the second night of the riot, Walter's in his house with his family. And he's on the second floor looking out the window when a mob of white people carrying torches approaches the house. And he can hear the screaming. And they're talking about burning this house down because they believe that this house that the Whites are living in is too nice a house for a Black family to live in. According to Walter's story, his father hands him a gun, and he's 12 years old, and he's looking out the window. And his father says, Walter, don't shoot until the first man puts his foot on our lawn, and then keep on shooting as long as you can. And this is the sort of foundational moment of Walter's mythology, his whole life story. And he says himself, after that night, I knew I never wanted to be a white man. I knew which side I was on. DAVIES: It's fascinating that when he wrote about this, much later in his life, some members of his family said, wait a minute, I don't remember you with a (laughter) shotgun. What do you make of that? BAIME: Well, that's a fascinating point. Now, as you go through the book, I mean, there's a sort of element of psychological thriller because you realize you are reading about a man who is highly ambitious, can be slightly manipulative and has this goal in his mind of changing the world. He wants to be famous. But most of all, he wants to be the man remembered as the person who got rid of the color line in America. And he's willing to do anything to achieve his goals. And one of them is to lie about this foundational moment of his childhood. To his deathbed, he always claimed that he had the shotgun in his hand. His sisters said, you know, actually, he might have made up that part. But in the end, it sort of matters only much as you want it to matter because it is the foundation of this man's mythology and what he creates himself to be, and not just who he is, but what he creates himself to be. DAVIES: The fact is that, you know, there was this race riot in Atlanta in 1906. We call it a race riot, but really it was white mobs attacking Black people pretty much. So Walter White - it's a relatively affluent Black family in Atlanta. He gets an education, attends Atlanta University. And there was a civil rights struggle that erupted over a proposal to eliminate seventh grade in the public schools. He gets active. And they contact the NAACP, this new organization in New York. They send a guy down, James Weldon Johnson, who's a charismatic fellow. He is so impressed with Walter White that he invites him to move to New York to take a full-time job with the NAACP. And after some soul-searching with his family, he moves to New York. Tell us a little about the NAACP in this period. This is, what, 1918? BAIME: He gets to New York on this freezing cold day in - early in 1918. And at the time, most Americans, a vast portion of Americans had never heard of the NAACP. It was a relatively new group. It was founded by a group of wealthy white intellectuals and Black intellectuals, notably W.E.B. Du Bois and James Weldon Johnson. So these are the two most respected literary and intellectual figures in Black America. Now, the NAACP at this time - they're just beginning to grow. The organization is 15 years old. But it's small. There's a few chapters spread out around the country. And when Walter gets there, there's very little money. And what this organization is trying to do is organize Black America all over the country to begin demanding civil rights and demanding that the Bill of Rights in the Constitution should actually mean something. But really, what it was - it was an intellectual organization set on making change through activism and literature. DAVIES: Right. And it's fascinating that the board was all white. The executive secretary was a white Irishman, John Shillady, right? But the staff was Black. Two weeks after he gets there, there's a horrific incident in Tennessee where a Black man is attacked by a mob and burned at the stake, and the organization wondered what to do about it. Somehow, the idea came up that Walter White, because he could easily pass as white, go down to Tennessee and investigate. Whose idea was this (laughter)? BAIME: Well, of course, it was Walters. But let me set the scene for you. So Walter's - it's his 12th day in New York. So he's brand new. He wants to impress his bosses. And he has this new routine where he and James Weldon Johnson take a bus from Harlem down to the NAACP office, which was on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 14th Street. And they're on the bus and reading the newspaper. And they read about this - the torture and killing of a man named James McIlherron in a small town in Tennessee, and the article is all of, you know, one paragraph long. And they get to the office, and they sit around, and they gather together, and they say, what are we going to do about this? And John Shillady - Irish American - he's the CEO of the NAACP at this time. And what they decide to do is what they always did, which was they're going to write a letter to the attorney general in that state. They're going to write a letter to the governor. And they're going to make those letters available to the press and send it to the White House in hopes of pressuring somebody to do something. Because when these cases happened, these lynchings happened at this time, invariably, no one would ever be charged with any crimes. So Walter's sitting there in the office. It's his 12th day. And he says, wait a minute. What if I went down there and got the facts myself? I grew up in the South. I've been exposed to white America in the South and Black America. I can easily slip in there and get the facts posing as a white man. And everybody disagrees. They think this is too dangerous. But Walter presses on, and they relent. And so on this spring day in 1918, Walter gets on a train, and he goes to Chattanooga, Tenn., poses as a white man so he could check into a hotel. And then the next morning, takes a train to this tiny town of Estill Springs, Tenn. And he begins his first undercover investigation - the first of over 40 of these - posing as a white man. And he makes up this persona. He says he is the traveling salesman with the, quote, \"Exelento Medicine Company.\" He - a completely fictitious person. And he goes into the town store, and he begins this investigation. It takes him one day - one day - to uncover all of the facts of what happened to James McIlherron, which was this horrendous event rendered before a large crowd of white people. DAVIES: Right. So he gets this information, comes back to New York, gets all the details about this horrific story. What happens? What does he do with it? BAIME: Well, Walter writes this article in The Crisis. So the NAACP has a magazine called The Crisis. It's distributed nationally through the branches of the NAACP, and it's edited by W.E.B. Du Bois. Walter writes this story, and it causes what he calls a mini-sensation. People are shocked that he was able to get all of the facts of this story and publish them. And it riles people up. And this is a very good thing because the NAACP is trying to recruit. And so suddenly, you have people writing into the office saying, this story is incredible. We want to help. What can we do? How can we help? Can we give money? It caused a sensation. And so Walter - you know, he realizes. This light bulb goes off in his head and in the heads of the other people working with him that we can do something with this. This is extraordinarily effective. DAVIES: We need to take a break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with A.J. Baime. His new book is \"White Lies: The Double Life Of Walter F. White And America's Darkest Secret.\" We'll be back after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF THE ROOTS SONG, \"PROCEED (A.J. SHINE MIX)\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. Our guest is author A.J. Baime. His new book is about an influential but little-known civil rights leader of the first half of the 20th century. His name was Walter White, and he led the NAACP through some crucial battles and built the organization's clout. And because he was fair-skinned and could pass as a white person, he traveled to the South dozens of times to investigate lynchings and other violence against Black people. A.J. Baime's book is called \"White Lies.\" There was another case where he looked at a county in Arkansas of violence against sharecroppers. In that case, his report didn't just go in the NAACP's publication. It was also published in The New York World, the newspaper owned by Joseph Pulitzer. What did that do for the NAACP's profile? BAIME: Well, it caused even larger sensation. So what you're talking about is the Phillips County massacre. What happened was in this rural town, in this rural county in Arkansas on the Mississippi Delta, there was a group of sharecroppers who wanted to unionize. And it's important that we understand what sharecroppers were at that time. So sharecroppers were basically Black farmers who worked these farms on land owned by white owners, wealthy white landowners. And the sharecroppers got to keep 50% of what they produced. But the landowners could charge anything for the rent, right? And they could charge anything for the equipment. So essentially, sharecropping was a way to keep the status quo in places like Phillips County as close to the slave era as possible. So what happened was a group of sharecroppers wanted to unionize, and the landowners really didn't like this. And so one night, a group of sharecroppers were meeting in a church in a very rural place. And three white law officers showed up outside, but they did not identify themselves as law officers. And some gunfire broke out. And no one can agree who shot first, but it didn't really matter. What happened was there was this murderous rampage throughout these rural communities in Phillips County. And Walter White went down there to investigate. He found that - according to him, in excess of 200 Black people had been killed in Phillips County due to this horrendous rioting and massacre. And what happened was the local authorities actually arrested 67 Black people, charged them with crimes, and put 12 of them on death row, even though over 200 Black people had been killed and relatively few white people at all. So Walter goes down there. He investigates. He gets the facts. He writes this shocking report that gets newspaper headlines across the country. And the NAACP decides to gather money and try to defend these death row inmates. And that actually results in a Supreme Court case called Moore v. Dempsey, which is handed down on June 25, 1923. And Oliver Wendell Holmes, actually - he wrote the court's majority opinion, which found that if, in fact, a trial is dominated by a mob so that there is an actual interference with the course of justice, there is a departure from due process of the law. So these 12 death row inmates were released because, essentially - because - a campaign that began with the Walter White investigation. Now, this is the end of 1919 and starts to make Walter really famous, even though he's still only a young guy. He's been at the NAACP for not even 18 months. DAVIES: You know, you told us that that case went all the way to the Supreme Court. By and large, that was not the case, was it? In most of these cases, despite shocking information developed by Walter White and spread around the country through various newspapers, by and large, the perpetrators of this violence went scot-free. Why? BAIME: Let me just say this. Walter conducted over 40 of these undercover investigations. Yes, he was a Black man. He identified as Black, but he looked white. So he could go undercover and get the facts in all of these cases. And he would write these articles - he wrote them in The Nation, in The New Republic, in the New York World and, of course, in The Crisis, which was the NAACP's magazine. In none of those over 40 cases, even though Walter got the facts, he was able to give documentation to attorney generals and governors of the names, the addresses and the professions of people who were involved in these murder cases. And there were zero convictions, zero indictments. And so ultimately, what happens is Walter realizes that the way to affect change in America is to gain enough power to go into politics. DAVIES: And that becomes a new focus of the NAACP. You know, one of the best-known massacres, I guess, of this kind occurred in Tulsa, Okla., where there was this murderous assault on the community of Greenwood, which was called Black Wall Street back then. Walter White also went there, again posing as a white person, and investigated. What did he discover? What did he see? BAIME: Tulsa is one of many, many of these types of cases. It might have been the biggest and certainly getting the most publicity today. But it all started with a man named Dick Rowland who had to go to the bathroom. He was a 19-year-old Black guy. And he went into a public building. And the interesting thing about the Jim Crow era in the South that people should understand is that in public places, there were signs all over the place - colored only or whites only. So Black people had their own bathrooms, water fountains. They were supposed to sit in a certain place in a train car. But elevators were tricky because elevators were a place where you might have Black and white in proximity. And what happened was Dick Rowland accidentally stepped on the toe of a young white woman who cried rape. And in the end, he was totally innocent. There weren't even any charges against him. But this little incident was reported in the newspaper and caused a rampage at Black Wall Street. There were two days of violence. This rampage - there were people flying around in crude airplanes over Greenwood and dropping - basically firebombs onto this neighborhood and burning 30 blocks of Tulsa to the ground. So soon after, Walter White gets word of this, and he has to go to Tulsa. And something incredible happens when he's there. He actually gets embedded with a group of white people who are deputized to patrol and make sure there wasn't going to be a Black uprising after the event. So Walter's actually patrolling in a car with armed white men throughout Tulsa, and that's his exposure. That's how he first sees what happened to Black Wall Street. And obviously, he's shocked. There's a moment during this investigation where he's cornered by some white people who question his identity. And he's so nervous, he pulls out a cigarette. He tries to smoke it without his hand shaking because he realizes that if these people know who he is, he's not going to just - it's not just that he's not going to make it out of Tulsa alive, but he's going to be tortured horrendously. And he convinces these people that he is, in fact, this, you know, reporter from a Northern newspaper, a white man. And so they take him to patrol Tulsa. Walter goes back and writes an article. DAVIES: This one was, I think, published in The Nation. Is that right? BAIME: It was published in The Nation, which was a vastly read magazine, mostly by white America. And that's an important point, because he was trying - he didn't need to educate Black America about what was happening. He needed to educate white America. So he wrote this article in The Nation, which got tremendous attention and is one of the reasons - is one of the reasons - why Tulsa is on the map today as this moment in our nation's history of - you know, of shame. DAVIES: We need to take another break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with A.J. Baime. His new book is \"White Lies: The Double Life Of Walter F. White And America's Darkest Secret.\" He'll be back to talk more after this short break. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF WYNTON MARSALIS' \"DOIN' (Y)OUR THING\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. Our guest is journalist and author A.J. Baime. His latest book is about Walter F. White, an influential though little-remembered leader of the NAACP in the first half of the 20th century. White had a major impact on civil rights litigation and built the NAACP into a powerful political force during the Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Truman administrations. And because White had fair skin and straight hair and was often assumed to be white, he traveled through the South dozens of times to investigate lynchings and other violence against Black people. A.J. Baime's book is \"White Lies: The Double Life Of Walter F. White And America's Darkest Secret.\" So Walter White had come to New York to join the NAACP in 1918 at the age of - what? - 25 or so? By 1929, he is, in effect, the de facto leader of this growing national organization. He was acting secretary but then got the full-time job. And I think what's remarkable is that he was a real strategic thinker. And he realized that they weren't going to stop this, you know, by exposing facts and asking local authorities to prosecute. That wasn't going to happen. And he said, you know, Black Americans needed real political power. And he began talking about Black Americans reconsidering their unquestioned loyalty to the Republican Party, because he felt that the Republican Party had ignored them. And one of the interesting things that he did was got the organization involved in a Supreme Court nomination fight in 1930. This happens nowadays. But he thought this was an important battle to fight. And tell us what happened. BAIME: So Walter opens up his newspaper one day. And he's just become the leader of the NAACP. He's acting secretary in 1929. And in 1930, Herbert Hoover decides that he's going to try to appoint this North Carolina judge, federal judge, to the Supreme Court to fill a vacant seat. Walter does a little bit of research. And he finds that at one point, this judge ran for governor. And when he did so, he made some surprisingly racist statements. And I can read them to you. This judge, Parker - his name is Parker, John J. Parker. He said, the participation of the negro in politics is a source of evil and danger to both races and is not desired by the wise men in either race. The judge also said at one point, if I should be elected governor of North Carolina and find that my election was due to one negro vote, I would immediately resign my office. So Walter decides the first thing he's going to do as head of the NAACP is to fight against this confirmation. And so he launches a nationwide fight. No Supreme Court pick by a president had been blocked in the entire 20th century. So when this happens in 1930, it makes news. And so Walter leads this fight to block the confirmation of Judge Parker. And he wins. And that's the beginning of his role as chief executive of the NAACP. DAVIES: Yeah. It was just remarkable that that happened. And then afterward, there was a senator in Ohio who had - I guess Roscoe McCulloch was his name - who had voted to put Judge Parker on the bench despite these racist statements. And he mobilized the NAACP to defeat this Republican senator for reelection - in effect, kind of making the point that you're not going to ignore our interests and simply be assured reelection. It worked. BAIME: It worked. Walter and the NAACP led a fight to defeat any, any - anyone in Congress who supported the confirmation of Judge Parker. So this went on for years. And what he was doing, wisely, politically, was saying, listen; just because you're Republican doesn't mean Black people are going to vote for you. You have to - you know, if you want the Black vote, which is becoming more and more powerful during this time, you need to step up and meet some of our demands. DAVIES: You know, the other part of the story is that Walter White, you know, he built the organization, the NAACP, had many, many more chapters around the country, began raising money for important litigation - for, you know, equal rights to attend schools, for voting rights in some cases, with some victories. And he became a player in national politics. He developed a relationship with Franklin Delano Roosevelt and especially with his wife, Eleanor, who actually entered the board of the NAACP. He was unable to get Roosevelt to support an anti-lynching bill. But there's another moment that you describe when the United States had entered World War II. And he wanted Roosevelt to desegregate the military, had a meeting with him. What happened? BAIME: Well, this is a fascinating meeting. Firstly, there were a few of them. But there's one in particular that we're talking about. When the war began and it became clear that the United States was going to get involved in World War II, two things happened. Obviously, we had a massive ramp up of the military. But we also had a massive ramp up of industry. We're coming out of the Great Depression. Franklin Delano Roosevelt creates this thing called the arsenal of democracy. His idea is to join the military, politics and private industry into this one massive military force. And that's the only way we're going to defeat Hitler, right? And so tremendous amounts of money are going into the military and into industry with government contracts. And Walter White decides, this is a really important opportunity. Nothing can do more to erase the color line in America than desegregation of the military. So he's trying to convince Roosevelt to do that. The other thing is he's trying to convince Roosevelt to have a fair practice, like, basically, fair employment. So if the government is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on factories to turn out tanks and planes, those factories should be hiring not just white people. And so he begins this pressure campaign on the White House. DAVIES: Roosevelt was not willing to desegregate the military. But Walter White and the NAACP had another idea, which was to end discrimination in civilian employment among defense industries, which were really gearing up because of the war effort. And they set upon a tactic which was quite effective. Tell us about this. BAIME: Walter showed up at the White House with a man named A. Philip Randolph, very influential Black leader at this time. And they come to the president with this idea of a march on Washington. And they say they're going to have 100,000 Black people march on Washington, demanding that the administration do something about employment. They're coming out of the Depression. People are hurting. They're desperate for jobs. Millions of jobs are being created through the defense industry. And Walter and A. Philip Randolph demand that Roosevelt do something about this, that, you know, he put some executive order or law in - you know, on the books saying, if the federal government is going to spend millions and millions of dollars hiring people that they can't just hire all white people. And Roosevelt is terrified of this idea, of this march on Washington. He thinks there could be a race riot in front of the gates of the White House. He thinks that he could lose any hope of ever getting the Black vote during the next election. And so he has this dramatic meeting. He turns to Philip Randolph and says, Philip, how many people do you plan to bring? And Randolph says, 100,000, Mr. President. Roosevelt turns to Walter and he says, Walter, how many people will march? And Walter's eyes (unintelligible) blank. He said, 100,000, Mr. President. And FDR is so unnerved, that six days later, he signs Executive Order 8802, which, quote, \"provides for the full and equitable participation of all workers in defense industries.\" And this is a massive victory for Walter. This is the first time ever that the government had a program saying, yes, we are required to not just hire white people. DAVIES: And was it effective? Did Blacks get jobs, as you know, welders and riveters and factory floor jobs? BAIME: It was extraordinarily effective in basically integrating the assembly lines during World War II. It didn't always go well, but the results were extremely important, and a huge victory for Walter, who was at this time building his national political platform. DAVIES: Let me reintroduce you. We're going to take another break here. We are speaking with author A.J. Baime. His new book is \"White Lies: The Double Life Of Walter F. White And America's Darkest Secret.\" We'll be back after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. Our guest is author A.J. Baime. His book is about an influential but little-known civil rights leader in the first half of the 20th century named Walter White. He led the NAACP through some crucial battles and built the organization's political clout. And because he was fair-skinned and could pass as a white person, he traveled to the South dozens of times to investigate lynchings and other violence against black people. A.J. Baime's book is called \"White Lies.\" Walter White was also very effective with Harry Truman, who became president after Roosevelt died in 1945. Tell us a little bit about Truman and why it's a little surprising that he had such an open mind towards Walter's appeals. BAIME: Well, you're seizing on a really fascinating point. Harry Truman came into office on April 12, 1945, at the climactic moment of World War II. Very few people knew anything about him. He was very much a mystery. I wrote a whole book about this called \"The Accidental President.\" People were shocked because they thought after all of these years with Roosevelt, there were some people in the military who were - couldn't even remember a time in their life when FDR hadn't been president, the first four-term president. And when he dies on April 12, 1945, Truman comes into the office. And he's from Missouri. He's from a border state. Both of his parents supported the Confederacy during the Civil War. Both of his parents came from slaveholding families. People who knew Truman knew that he might use the N-word. And so a lot of the Southern Democrats who were, you know, white supremacists believed they had their guy with Truman, that he was going to support them. And Truman proved them vastly wrong. And part of that was his relationship that he formed with Walter White. DAVIES: White had a meeting with Truman, and he brought up the case of - a terrible case of a Black soldier who was returning from his duty in World War II to a South Carolina town, got involved in a verbal altercation with the bus driver about using the bathroom, ends up getting attacked by some local law enforcement and blinded by a sheriff who beat him with a baton. This wasn't the only incident of returning Black soldiers suffering violence. It's interesting that Walter managed to get Orson Welles, who had a Sunday night radio show, to talk about this. So he got attention to it. But he brings this and other cases to the Oval Office with Harry Truman. How does Truman react? BAIME: Well, Truman is shocked. And this is a very dramatic meeting. The NAACP, Walter White, they knew at the end of World War II - you had hundreds of thousands of Black soldiers who had fought in the war, and they weren't going to come home and just be OK with the Jim Crow South. They weren't going to come home after fighting for their country and be told that they can't sit next to a white woman or a bus, that they could only use certain bathrooms to drink from certain water fountains. And Walter knew that a lot of white America was going to resist and that there was going to be a crisis - and, in fact, there was. And Isaac Woodard was the guy you're talking about. And his case was the - became the cause celebre, became the sort of George Floyd and Black Lives Matter case of that era. And right after it happens, and before this whole media campaign about Isaac Woodard, Walter White goes to the White House, and he tells Harry Truman the story of Isaac Woodard, who had been blinded while in a fight with a white policeman while still wearing his Army uniform, a decorated soldier. And Truman is shocked. And the very next day, Truman writes a letter to the attorney general, Tom Clark of Texas, and says, we have to do something about this. And really, that document, to me, is the beginning of the civil rights movement from within the White House, in mainstream politics. DAVIES: Right. He later asks Truman to speak at the NAACP convention in 1947. And we should say this is time when Truman is about to run for reelection and needs the support of Southern whites. Despite that, well, what does he say when Walter White says will you speak at our convention? BAIME: Walter has this meeting with Truman, and he asked Truman to address the NAACP in person. Walter believes, and he uses these words, that if Truman agrees to do this, it's political suicide. This is 1947. Already, nobody believes that Truman has any shot at winning the 1948 election. And if he comes out in support of any civil rights programs, he's going to shatter the Democratic Party, his own party, because the solid - so-called Solid South is going to ditch him. And he's going to be just - his - this - it would be political suicide. Shockingly, Truman agrees to do this. And historians have always argued, you know, why did Truman come out and get behind civil rights the way he did? He becomes the first president to campaign in the spiritual home of Black America in Harlem, becomes the first president to address the NAACP in person at this massive meeting on the National Mall by the - on the foot of the Lincoln Memorial. And indeed, Truman is the one who desegregates the military, and he goes out, and he wins the 1948 election, getting a huge portion of the Black vote in the process. DAVIES: So what's the answer why Truman did - why Truman was the guy that did this? BAIME: Was it a political move? - because, you know, it was a moving target at the time. And I think the answer is really to be found in a letter that Truman wrote to Walter White where he says, it's my moral duty as the president of the United States to make sure that if Black soldiers are returning from war and they're beaten here in America, that the federal government has an obligation to do something, and that the Bill of Rights - the 14th Amendment, the 15th Amendment - they should actually mean something, and that the documents that are the spine of our country should mean something. And so he goes out and, you know, becomes the first civil rights president for moral reasons. DAVIES: And I imagine the persuasiveness of Walter White figures in, too? BAIME: Without a doubt, without a doubt. The two men saw eye to eye, and they remained friends for the rest of their lives, even after Truman was out of office. DAVIES: Let me reintroduce you. We need to take another break here. We are speaking with A.J. Baime. His new book is \"White Lies: The Double Life Of Walter F. White And America's Darkest Secret.\" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF SAINT SINNA FEAT. CREEBO LODI SONG, \"REAL FLOW\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with journalist and author A.J. Baime. His new book is about an influential but little-known civil rights leader in the first half of the 20th century named Walter White. He led the NAACP through some of its crucial battles and built the organization's clout. And because he could pass as a white person, he traveled to the South several times to investigate lynchings and other violence against Black people. A.J. Baime's book is called \"White Lies.\" So Walter White achieved a lot as head of the NAACP - built its national clout, built this relationship with the White House, and got some things done. But in his later years, events in his private life and marriage would affect his standing in the movement and his legacy. You know, just tell us what happened here. BAIME: It actually began for Walter at a party in the late 1920s when he was still a young man. Now, Walter identifies as a Black man, and he really - by the - you know, by the late 1930s, he's literally the face of Black power. He is - and I'm quoting a newspaper article about him. \"As a go-getter, Mr. White's record is unparalleled in Negro life.\" That was basically - not basically. That was his reputation at the time - unquestioned in the - starting in the late 1930s all the way to his death. Now, Walter had a secret. He had a Black wife, and his children were Black. But he had a loveless marriage, and he was desperately in love with a woman named Poppy Cannon. And he was, you know, a public figure. He was married. And she was white. And so for many years, he struggled with this love, knowing that if it was exposed, his reputation would be utterly destroyed. So for most of those years, he had no relationship and not even any contact with them - with her. There's this moment where during World War II, he goes overseas to find out how democracy is functioning on the front line. And he's in a military plane, and it crashes. And he nearly dies. And he has this what you might call a come-to-Jesus moment where he knows he's getting older, and he wants to be in love. And he decides that he's going to do something about it. And he knows that when the world finds out about this, he's going to be - his reputation will be shattered. DAVIES: It wasn't handled particularly well from a communications point of view. I mean, life is messy. And we saw sort of that had a heart attack in 1947, another one in 1948. And he eventually tells his wife, Gladys - she's on her way to Mexico - and that she can get a divorce there. And it sort of comes out that he has had a quiet marriage with Poppy Cannon in Manhattan. How did the NAACP react? How did Black Americans across the country - how did his family react to this union? BAIME: He knew going into this it wasn't going to go well, so he took a leave of absence from the NAACP. He at this time, had been chief executive for almost two decades. And he goes on this around-the-world radio news program tour without telling anyone that he obtained a divorce and that he had married this woman in a private ceremony. So while he's traveling abroad, this story explodes. It becomes a gossip sensation, headlines all over the place. And people are very, very upset. And in my research, I've really dug into all of the letters that were written between members of the NAACP leadership and powerful Black Americans what their opinion was of this move. And without a doubt, they were devastated. Eleanor Roosevelt was on the board of the NAACP. She resigned. He eventually - Walter convinced her to rescind her resignation. But essentially, Walter's leadership was destroyed. His reputation was destroyed. His children refused to speak to him. And they never spoke to him again. His son even dropped the name White from the end of his name because he didn't want to be associated with his father because he was so hurt by what his father did. And that's one of the main reasons why people don't know who Walter White is today. DAVIES: It's interesting, you know, that - you quote a couple of letters from two of Walter White's sisters. And it wasn't just the immorality of it. It wasn't just betraying Gladys, his wife. It had to do with the way people see Black men and their relationship with white women and how that played into American racism, didn't it? BAIME: It did, because all of these times where Walter was testifying on the floor of Congress for a federal antilynch law, you had this white Southern senator saying, Black men are after our white women, and so lynching should be OK. You know, he - Walter knew that he had - was setting himself up to be brutally attacked by all of his enemies, who throughout his life said, well - that this is going to happen. And it did. And, yes, his family - the letters that his sisters wrote to him were just so devastating. But really, what they came down to - and it was expressed best by his sisters, who were condemning him - they said, you know, for all of these years, you have been the face of Black America. You have been the person whose picture is, you know, hung on these cracked mirrors in, you know, homes all over the country. You are the NAACP. You are hope for all of these people. And you have abandoned them. And again, you know, many people believe this. DAVIES: Is that why we don't know who Walter White is today, do you think? BAIME: Yeah. There are two reasons why. One is because, yes, he had the scandal at the end of his life - really shattered his reputation, destroyed his base of power. And the other reason is, really, he died in 1955, right at the same year of the Montgomery bus boycott, right at the very year where Martin Luther King Jr. came on the scene as a national political figure but also right at the same time that television cameras arrived. And there was no way this new generation of Black civil rights leader was going to have a man with white skin, you know, be the foundation, the face of their movement. That wasn't going to happen. And so in remarkable speed after Walter's death in 1955, of not one but numerous heart attacks, he - his legacy disappeared from the history books and from the American scene. DAVIES: You know, there's a lot of discussion these days in news organizations about diversity and a sense of the importance of having journalists of color to tell stories because their own life experience informs their reporting in a way that is really important. You know, you're a white guy researching and telling this story. I wonder if you think that matters in any way or whether you encountered any reluctance from sources to be informative or candid maybe because you're white. BAIME: It did not inform any sources or anything like that. I was concerned throughout the writing of this process 'cause it took years. And when I say I had to roll up my sleeves - I mean, this book was a tremendous amount of work. And it was a tremendous emotional journey - at times, really painful. And I worried throughout the writing of it, the book would come out and I would be attacked to writing a story about this because I was a white guy. And so your question is important. That hasn't happened. And I think one of the reasons why is because this is a story of a man who lived a double life as white and Black - was sometimes lauded for and sometimes criticized for it. And that's something I had to be very, very careful with throughout the writing of it. And I understood that I might get dinged about it, and that's OK. DAVIES: Well, A.J. Baime, thanks so much for speaking with us and sharing the story. BAIME: It's been a pleasure to be with you. Thank you. DAVIES: A.J. Baime's new book is \"White Lies: The Double Life Of Walter F. White And America's Darkest Secret.\" A national antilynching bill, one of the unmet goals of the NAACP under White's leadership, was finally enacted by Congress earlier this month and was signed yesterday by President Biden. On tomorrow's show, how Ukraine is fighting the digital war against Russia. We'll speak with Time Magazine's Vera Bergengruen. She says Ukraine's 31-year-old cyberchief is recruiting a citizen IT force to help blunt Russian disinformation, galvanize international support and get tech companies to block services in Russia.

The Supreme Court hears a case this fall that could have implications for gerrymandering across the country.\n                \n                    \n                    Andi Rice for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Alabama's state Capitol has been the location of fights over redistricting. The Supreme Court hears a case this fall that could have implications for gerrymandering across the country. Alabama is ground zero for what could be this year's highest-profile legal fight over voting rights and representation. Just over 25% of Alabama's active registered voters are Black, as is 27% of Alabama's population. But Alabama will only have one majority-Black congressional district, out of seven in the state, for elections this year. Progressive and civil rights groups say the congressional map should be redrawn \u2014 there should be two majority-Black districts. \"Creating a second district would basically bring our congressional representation further in line with the actual realities of our population growth over the last 10 years,\" says Evan Milligan, the executive director of Alabama Forward, a nonprofit coalition formed to encourage civic engagement and advocate for progressive policies. Milligan and others sued Alabama to draw a new map. In January, a federal three-judge panel agreed with them, saying that \"Black voters have less opportunity than other Alabamians to elect candidates of their choice to Congress.\" The panel ordered Alabama lawmakers to come up with a new map with two majority-Black districts, \"or something quite close to it.\" But last month, the Supreme Court let Alabama's newest district map stand for now while it prepares to hear the full case this fall. Loading... The case could have major implications for the future of gerrymandering in states around the country. To examine how we got here, NPR traveled to Alabama to talk to people involved in the case and to hear their perspective on the fight over Alabama's political future. Evan Milligan is one of the parties in the lawsuit against Alabama's redistricting. It's headed to the Supreme Court this fall.\n                \n                    \n                    Andi Rice for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Evan Milligan is one of the parties in the lawsuit against Alabama's redistricting. It's headed to the Supreme Court this fall. Milligan grew up in Montgomery, a majority-Black city divided among three congressional districts in recent years. He describes himself as six generations removed from slavery in Alabama. In his work with the nonprofit Alabama Forward, Milligan has already been working to mobilize people to vote and doing voter education. He's been involved in the fight over redistricting for the last few years. The core of his argument in the case, he says, goes back to Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965: a ban on voting practices that deny or limit people's voting rights on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group. \"The Voting Rights Act really requires that where you have patterns of discrimination against nonwhite voters that there should there should be an opportunity for voters in that area to have to be able to elect the candidate of their choice,\" he says. He asked to be a part of the lawsuit when he heard that the ACLU of Alabama and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund were challenging the newest map, drawn by Alabama's Republican-majority legislature last year. He joined the case \u2014 now called Merrill v. Milligan \u2014 not even expecting the lower court to take his side. \"Doing activist and advocacy work in Alabama, it's about making the case, building the record and still calling the country and the state to account on what our stated values are as far as democracy,\" Milligan says. \"So it was important to challenge it. And then you never know. Like, it's like weather sometimes ... something might surprise you.\" Republican state Sen. Jim McClendon is one of the chairs of the state's redistricting commission, the group that helps draw up the state's voting maps. He says the courts haven't provided much guidance on drawing districts.\n                \n                    \n                    Andi Rice for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican state Sen.

He says the courts haven't provided much guidance on drawing districts. Republican state Sen. Jim McClendon is one of the chairs of the state's redistricting commission \u2014 the group that helps draw up the state's voting maps. \"When we drew the districts, we drew the districts race-blind. In other words, as our computer \u2013 as the lines moved on the screen, the numbers changed. We didn't have race up there because we couldn't. You're not supposed to use race. Voting Rights Act tells you very clearly: You can't use race in doing this,\" he says. \"Then the three-judge panel comes along and says, you need to redraw these,\" he says. \"You need to draw two districts that are majority African American districts or two that are very close to that, which means you've got to use race.\" The Supreme Court has found that outright racial gerrymandering is unconstitutional. But contrary to McClendon's argument, it has also interpreted the Voting Rights Act as actually requiring race to be considered when redistricting under certain conditions \u2014 when white voters vote as a bloc against Black candidates and when a small enough majority-minority district or districts can be drawn so that minorities have a good chance to elect their chosen candidates. The Supreme Court intervened in the case before any new maps were completed. Loading... McClendon rejects the idea that the maps were gerrymandered and argues that gerrymandering is subject to interpretation. \"I say gerrymandering is like beauty. It's in the eye of the beholder. If it's my district and you didn't draw it like I wanted it drawn, that's gerrymandering. But if you draw me a district that I'm really happy with, that's not gerrymandering. That's a fair district.\" McClendon says the redistricting process is fair, because any state lawmakers who want to can comment on the map \u2014 and they are the ones who vote on it. He also says there isn't much guidance from the federal government on what exactly makes for an equitable map. \"One of the difficulties we have, the courts have never told us what is a safe percentage to put in a district to allow someone in a minority district \u2013 they've never given us a guideline,\" McClendon says. \"Is it 55%? Is it 49 1/2? Is it 51? It's pretty hard to do that and assure that you're going to get minority representation.\" Terri Sewell has represented the 7th District since 2011. She says Black voters have been packed in her district.\n                \n                    \n                    Andi Rice for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Terri Sewell has represented the 7th District since 2011. She says Black voters have been packed in her district. The new map continues what had been the case previously, with Black voters heavily represented in the 7th District, which includes heavily Black portions of Birmingham and Montgomery as well as rural parts of the Black Belt. The 7th District is now about 56% Black. Some proposals, including one from the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, demonstrate a way to reconfigure the lines so that Black voters would be a few percentage points lower in the 7th but close to or slightly more than 50% in another. Terri Sewell, a Democrat, has represented the 7th since 2011. She says that the maps crowd Black voters into her district and then spread them out across others, weakening their ability to be a sizable influence in any other single district. \"Packing my district means that my other colleagues don't have to even listen to the issues and concerns of African Americans in their district,\" she says. \"And that's not fair. It's about voter dilution, is what it is.\" Alabama's Republican secretary of state, John Merrill, says those upset at being the minority in a district should simply move.\n                \n                    \n                    Andi Rice for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Alabama's Republican secretary of state, John Merrill, says those upset at being the minority in a district should simply move. Alabama's Republican secretary of state, John Merrill, was not involved in drawing the maps. But he's responsible for running elections. He says those upset at being the minority in a district should simply move. \"People get to move where they choose to in our state,\" he says. \"So if you live where you want, then you get to vote for the people that are in that district. That's the way the process works.\" That idea, of course, requires people being potentially willing to move every 10 years if the district changes when new districts are drawn. Milligan also rejects the idea of moving. \"This is where I grew up,\" he says. He has a reverence for Montgomery's history in the civil rights movement. \"It's home. And I think I just have this interest in wanting to move the needle forward and want to be disruptive enough to buy my kids some time should they choose to stay here.\"",

Rick Scott, R-Fla., released a blueprint for a sweeping conservative reimagining of the federal government.\n                \n                    \n                    J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., released a blueprint for a sweeping conservative reimagining of the federal government. Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott has a sweeping vision for a conservative takeover in Washington that echoes the dark and fearful image of America in decline painted by former President Donald Trump during his inauguration in 2017. Scott opens the blueprint by asking \"Is this the beginning of the end of America?\" and goes on to outline a vision he hopes will unite Republicans against Democrats. The plan includes major federal intervention in social policies like gender identity and racial equality, to a broad remaking of federal policies on education, taxation, immigration and crime. \"The militant left now controls the entire federal government, the news media, academia, Hollywood, and most corporate boardrooms \u2013 but they want more,\" Scott wrote in a letter introducing the plan. \"If Republicans return to Washington's business as usual, if we have no bigger plan than to be a speed bump on the road to America's collapse, we don't deserve to govern.\" The opening letter also attempts to preempt any criticism of the plan by predicting the plan will be mocked by \"Washington insiders,\" and Scott proudly welcomed any fallout. \"It will be ridiculed by the 'woke' left, mocked by Washington insiders, and strike fear in the heart of some Republicans,\" Scott wrote. \"At least I hope so.\" He released the document from his personal campaign but currently serves as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Scott is also widely regarded within Republican political circles as a potential presidential hopeful, and the plan is specifically intended to be a blueprint for Republicans if they win majorities in the House and Senate in the midterm elections in November. Democrats panned the outline, focusing much of their ire on a portion of the plan that would impose new taxes on the millions of people who currently earn too little to owe income taxes. \"Senate GOP candidates have found their midterm bumper sticker: raising taxes on Americans, seniors and working families.\" said Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Communications Director David Bergstein in a statement. Scott's foreboding message comes as divisions within the country are driving fears about the stability of American government. A recent NPR/Ispos poll found that 64% of respondents believe U.S. democracy is \"in crisis and at risk of failing.\" Political violence is also a major concern. More than 1 in 5 respondents in the same poll said violence is sometimes justified to protect democracy or American culture and values. The framework revives many of the themes of the Trump presidency on crime and immigration and wades further into current culture war battles over identity. Scott presents an existential battlefield vision for a midterm election where Republicans are predicting major gains in both chambers of Congress. Scott's social vision is built around issues like parental control in schools, gender identity and racial education that have energized GOP voters in recent state and local elections while enraging Democrats.  Many of the proposals include ideas for federal interventions into social policies that Congress typically does not control. Simply releasing the document represents a major break from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has declined to release a unifying framework for how Republicans would govern. McConnell has not weighed in on Scott's vision, but other GOP figures, like Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel, have endorsed the outline. The education section is built around the premise that \"children are being poisoned by a false political agenda in their schools.\" The plan would close the federal Department of Education, implement school choice and eliminate teacher tenure at public schools. The education section is framed around increasing parental control over what children learn in school, a huge motivator for GOP voters in recent polls. However, the plan also includes prescriptions for what should be taught in public schools. The plan calls for teaching children \"to love America\" and requiring students to \"say the Pledge of Allegiance, stand for the National Anthem, and honor the American Flag.\" Scott would also ban teaching children that \"they are inherently racist because of the color of their skin, or that some Americans are oppressors and others are oppressed.\" That message closely mirrors the campaign pledges that helped propel the successful campaign of Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin last year. Youngkin promised to ban teaching critical race theory in Virginia \u2014 even though it's not part of the state's public school curriculum \u2014 roll back mask mandates and COVID protocols in schools, and give parents greater control over their children's education. The plan also includes positions on abortion and gender, including denying the existence of transgender people, banning gender reassignment surgeries for minors and doing away with government forms that acknowledge gender identity and sexual preference. Those positions represent a threat to current federal anti-discrimination laws based on Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex. Scott stops short of calling for a federal abortion ban. The outline instead declares \"abortion stops a beating heart,\" a clear reference to \"heart beat bills\" that ban abortion after a \"fetal heartbeat\" can be detected. That often occurs around six weeks, before many women know they are pregnant. But reproductive health doctors say the term \"fetal heartbeat\" is not a medical term and can be misleading at that stage of pregnancy. Dr. Jennifer Kerns, an OB-GYN and associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco, told NPR the electrical activity on an ultrasound does not represent \"a functional cardiovascular system or a functional heart.\" The plan also refers to ensuring federal programs and tax laws do not \"reward people for being unmarried\" and discusses helping low-income women choose adoption over abortion. Other sections of the proposal deal with cracking down on Big Tech, reforming the federal government, imposing term limits on lawmakers and requiring all legislation to sunset after five years. The plan would also end talk of comprehensive immigration reform in favor of enhanced border security and cutting off federal funds for \"sanctuary cities.\" The plan would also deny immigrants access to social safety net programs for seven years after their arrival in the country. Scott closes by directly embracing Trump's America First approach to foreign affairs. The plan involves cutting off aid to any country that opposes the U.S. at the United Nations, ending dues payments to \"any international organization that undermines the national interests of the USA\" and ending all imports from China.",

Six girls refused and sued \u2014 their fight has drawn attention to discrimination against Muslims in India.  A MARTINEZ, HOST: In India, a controversy is brewing over school dress codes and Muslim headscarves. Six girls are suing their state for the right to keep their heads covered in the classroom. Their case has drawn global outrage about discrimination against Muslims. NPR's Lauren Frayer reports from Mumbai. MUMTAZ KHAN: Different colors. All different colors. We have all designs also in it. LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: Mumtaz Khan (ph) runs a boutique in Mumbai that sells Muslim headscarves or hijabs. Most of her customers, as you might expect, are Muslim women - until two weeks ago. KHAN: We have Hindus. We have Christians also. They also come and ask for scarf. Yes, Hindu also. FRAYER: When women from other religions started coming in, they told her they wanted to show solidarity with women like Mumtaz, who wears the hijab, because of something going on 500 miles south in the Indian state of Karnataka... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Karnataka has erupted over some Muslim girl students insisting they will wear a hijab. FRAYER: ...Protests two weeks ago over a hijab ban in some of the state's high school classrooms. The whole thing has perplexed Mumtaz because school dress codes are not unusual. Her high school in Mumbai also required her to take off her headscarf in class. KHAN: It was not a problem in any point. And we never felt anything bad in that or anything odd in that. FRAYER: But the change at this one school in Karnataka came abruptly, without warning, during election campaign season in parts of India. And it confirmed some people's suspicions of what's been happening to Muslim minorities under India's Hindu nationalist government. GHAZALA WAHAB: This is what we've been seeing, marginalization of the Muslims from public spaces. FRAYER: Ghazala Wahab wrote a book called \"Born A Muslim,\" chronicling anti-Muslim prejudice in India. She says Muslims absolutely suffer discrimination here, but that this Karnataka incident... WAHAB: To my mind, was a very local incident. But because the girls - one of them contacted one organization, which is, in popular perception, labelled as a radical Muslim organization, it was blown out of proportion. FRAYER: The involvement of Muslim activists triggered a backlash by Hindu activists and rival protests, marches, sloganeering. All of it then went viral on social media. The high court in Karnataka has now temporarily banned all religious garb in the state's public schools. No hijabs, no saffron Hindu scarves, nothing until it can rule on a lawsuit by six Muslim girls. Jyoti Punwani is another writer who spent decades chronicling Hindu-Muslim tensions in India. And she says, yes, this is a religious issue. But... JYOTI PUNWANI: It's also a issue of bullying young women. FRAYER: What's lost here, Punwani says, is that the women at the center of this controversy are 14 and 15-year-old girls in the middle of their high school semester. PUNWANI: Since they go to government schools, they are not, obviously, very well-off. For them, the education itself is like a way for a better life. FRAYER: And whether these humble students are being lionized as heroines or demonized as troublemakers, they are being used by political parties and by activists on both sides, Punwani says, to prove something about India. (SOUNDBITE OF VEHICLES HONKING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Non-English language spoken). FRAYER: Back in her hijab shop, Mumtaz is wearing a lovely, black abaya, studded with pearls. But she's shaking her head about the news from Karnataka. KHAN: It's just dirty politics, nothing else. FRAYER: Dirty politics, she says, nothing else. Lauren Frayer, NPR News, Mumbai.

            "article_content": "\"Rough as hell.\" That's how one high school principal in Nevada describes the 2021-'22 school year, when conflicts with parents and community members were all too common. \"Something needs to change or else we will all quit,\" says another principal, in California. Those voices are part of a new, nationally representative survey of 682 public high school principals, many of whom describe a level of tension and division within their broader school communities that is not only high but, in the words of one Utah principal, making the job harder \"than any other era in my 20 years of administrative experience.\" John Rogers, a professor of education at UCLA, helped lead the survey effort and says, while an earlier, 2018 survey of principals revealed conflicts spilling into schools, \"what's different in 2022 is that a lot of the political conflict is being targeted at public schools,\" especially in narrowly divided \"purple\" districts. More than two-thirds (69%) of principals surveyed report \"substantial political conflict\" with parents or members of the community last year over several controversial topics: The survey was conducted during the summer of 2022 by the Institute for Democracy, Education and Access at UCLA and the Civic Engagement Research Group at UC Riverside. The resulting report is rich with detail and gut-punch quotes that school leaders offered researchers in exchange for anonymity. NPR was not able to independently verify educators' stories or identities. Below are a handful of the survey's biggest takeaways. Nearly half (45%) of principals surveyed say the level of parent/community conflict they saw last year was either \"more\" or \"much more\" than anything they'd seen before the pandemic. Just 3% say they felt less conflict last year. Principals cite many stressors, including a kind of ambient anxiety created by the pandemic that was then exacerbated by the spread of misinformation on social media, the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, the divisive tenure of former President Trump, and, most importantly, the role of national, largely conservative organizations in galvanizing parents and turning schools into culture war battlegrounds. In fact, the more politically divided a community is, the more likely principals are to say their schools have been riven by conflict. Researchers found that schools in purple congressional districts (where Trump won 45\u201354.9% of the vote in 2020) were more likely to experience \"acute\" levels of political conflict than schools in blue districts (where the vote for Trump dipped below 45%) or in red districts (where Trump support exceeded 55%). And those political conflicts can also play out between students. Almost seven of 10 (69%) principals report \"students have made demeaning or hateful remarks towards classmates for expressing either liberal or conservative views.\" \"I had to come down and help the teacher, like a veteran teacher, who's never had problems having discussions,\" remembers one Iowa principal. \"And the kids were just so stuck in their trenches, they weren't willing to be open to even listen to the other side.\" In many places, according to the survey, misinformation sparked fires of conflict. \"We had a group of parents that went bananas on us on the masking, and believed that we were encouraging kids to get a shot that surely had a microchip in it because the government wanted to control their brains,\" remembers one Nevada principal. This same principal, who says he is a registered Republican in a predominantly conservative district, worries that parents' belief in misinformation has had a chilling effect on schools' ability to talk about current events and even recent history. \"You can't [use newspapers] anymore. You can't use CNN because the parents will go nuts on you. You can't use Fox because it's so out there. It's hard to teach kids about what's going on in any kind of context, because there is no context anymore.\" Nearly two-thirds (64%) of principals report that parents or community members pushed back against information used in classrooms. And this tug-of-war over facts \"grew almost three-fold in purple communities between 2018 and 2022,\" according to the report. \"The only way I think we're going to get out of a situation like this is teaching kids, and maybe even the greater public at large, what is good information,\" opines one Nebraska principal. The bitter, politicized fight around critical race theory has been well-documented. But this survey sheds new light on just how pervasive those conflicts were in schools. Roughly half of principals, according to the report, say parents or other members of their communities tried \"to limit or challenge ... teaching and learning about issues of race and racism\" last year. In purple districts, nearly two-thirds (63%) of principals noted that kind of community pressure. Not only that, many district leaders gave in. Nearly a quarter (23%) of principals in purple communities told researchers that district leaders, including school board members, \"took action to limit teaching and learning about race and racism.\" That was higher than in both red communities (17%) and blue communities (8%). \"My superintendent told me in no uncertain terms that I could not address issues of race and bias...\" one Minnesota principal remembers. \"He told me, 'This is not the time or the place to do this here. You have to remember you are in the heart of Trump country and you're just going to start a big mess if you start talking about that stuff.' \" Another principal, in Ohio, says when a group of angry parents found no evidence of CRT in his school's social studies curriculum, they accused him of \"teaching undercover CRT.\" \"We are trying to weather this storm and see if we can get through it,\" the Ohio principal says, even as his staff \"has become scared ... worried that ... if I talk about the Civil Rights Movement and Jim Crow, am I going to be accused of telling White people they are bad?\" Nearly half (48%) of principals say they faced outside efforts, from parents or the broader community, to \"challenge or limit LGBTQ+ students' rights,\" with principals in purple communities almost twice as likely as those in more conservative or liberal areas to say they faced multiple such efforts. A California principal says, \"one counselor described to me how a parent screamed at her on the phone\" and used an anti-gay slur. \"It's quite disheartening to work so hard and care for all our students when so many people are being hateful and threatening.\" The survey results also reveal a mirroring effect \u2013 where adult efforts to curtail LGBTQ+ students' rights parallel rising rates of students themselves harassing LGBTQ+ classmates. \"The percentage of principals indicating multiple attacks on LGBTQ+ students grew across all schools,\" according to the report, \"from 15% in 2018 to 24% in 2022.\" In purple communities, however, that number more than tripled. In spite of the pressure and its toll, many principals say they believe the vast majority of parents do not support the conflicts that have so divided their schools, that many of these fights are driven by \"small clusters of hate,\" as one North Carolina principal puts it. Principals believe this silent majority remained silent last year \"because they're too busy or overwhelmed or are afraid that if they become engaged, they're going to face danger,\" UCLA's Rogers says. Rogers' collaborator, Joseph Kahne, a professor of education at UC Riverside, warns that silence isn't healthy for a school system that is meant to serve all children. \"If the vast majority of folks are quiet, then folks who have very strong opinions or who are willing to engage in very contentious politics will have an outsized influence,\" Kahne warns. \"If all parents and community members speak up, and if they have reasoned and focused conversations, that dialogue will be good for schools.\" And, Kahne and Rogers argue, good for democracy.",

After three long days of confirmation hearings, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Biden's pick to be the next Supreme Court justice, largely acquitted herself well. She was controlled and calm and mostly needed to reassure Democrats so they stick together in voting for her. If they do, she would be confirmed as the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court, and there's no reason to think that won't happen at this point. The White House remains hopeful some Republicans might cross over to vote for her, though it's pretty clear by the bitterness displayed among GOP members of the Senate Judiciary Committee toward their Democratic colleagues these last few days that the votes won't likely come from Republicans on the committee. There was a lot more from the hearings, so let's dig in with these four takeaways: Saying something controversial in a nomination hearing before Congress is one of the easiest ways to land yourself in a political cauldron. So the answer for Supreme Court nominees over the better part of the last 20 years has become to say nothing or to say things the other side can't disagree with on the face of the statements. Supreme Court nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson participates in her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday.\n                \n                    \n                    Doug Mills/Pool/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supreme Court nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson participates in her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday. Jackson pulled from that playbook: \"I do agree with both Justice [Brett] Kavanaugh and Justice [Amy Coney] Barrett on this issue,\" Jackson said. \"Roe and Casey are the settled law of the Supreme Court concerning the right to terminate a woman's pregnancy.\" Conservatives on the Supreme Court have either already upheld or are expected to uphold strict restrictions that states have passed on abortion. It's highly unlikely that a justice appointed by Biden would hold the same view. That should tell you everything you need to know about how not forthcoming the potential justices, perhaps necessarily because of politics, have become in these confirmation hearings. Republicans homed in on Jackson's time as a judge and the sentences she gave out. They painted her as a judge who was lenient in sentencing, particularly in child pornography cases. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and others spent significant amounts of time on why, in some instances, Jackson sent people to jail for shorter lengths of time than federal guidelines or prosecutors recommended, particularly in child pornography cases. \"I am questioning your discretion, your judgment,\" Hawley said at one point. \"That's exactly what I'm doing.\" Supreme Court nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson answers questions from Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., during her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supreme Court nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson answers questions from Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., during her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday. Jackson defended herself multiple times against the allegation. \"I looked at the law and the facts,\" she said. \"I made sure that the victims, the children's perspectives, were represented, and I also imposed prison terms and significant supervision and other restrictions on these defendants.\" Democrats on the committee also defended Jackson's decisions, noting that most prison sentences handed out by judges in these kinds of cases were below the guidelines. An opinion piece in the National Review, a conservative magazine, called Hawley's allegations a \"smear\" and \"appears meritless to the point of demagoguery.\" The White House and others have accused Hawley of employing a \"QAnon-signaling smear.\" What is clear is the line of attack seemed to not be merely about sentencing, but about labeling a Democratic nominee as soft on crime in an election year. In addition to the soft-on-crime allegation, which comes with violent crime on the rise in the country, Sen. Ted Cruz went after Jackson for her time on the board of the elite Georgetown Day School in Washington, D.C. He tried to tie her to what he sees as the school teaching critical race theory, which has become code for how children are taught in schools about racism. He came armed with poster boards and even books from the school. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, gestures toward a poster during the confirmation hearing for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson on Tuesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, gestures toward a poster during the confirmation hearing for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson on Tuesday. Jackson pointed out she has little control over the school curriculum, does not believe \"any child should be made to feel as though they are racist\" or \"oppressors,\" and that it doesn't have any bearing on how she judges cases. \"It doesn't come up in my work as a judge,\" she said, \"and it's never something I've studied or relied on, and it wouldn't be something I would rely on if I was on the Supreme Court.\" But the point seemed less about Jackson's views and more about the GOP's midterm messaging. This is one area Republicans believe they can use to appeal to suburban, particularly white, moms. At one point, during the hearing, the Republican National Committee sent out an image of Jackson and with \"KBJ,\" her initials, crossed out and replaced with \"CRT.\" That also highlights the line the party has to walk in criticizing a Black nominee, though Republicans like Graham were more than happy to point out past conservative nominees of color who were either blocked or would be blocked by Democrats. The most animating moments for Republicans during Jackson's questioning actually had little to do with Jackson herself, but rather about how Democrats have treated past nominees. \"There are two standards going on here,\" Graham thundered. \"If you're an African American, conservative woman, you're fair game to have your life turned upside down, to be filibustered no matter how qualified you are, and if you express your faith as a conservative, all of a sudden, you're an effing nut. And we're tired of it.\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., questions Supreme Court nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson during her Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing on Wednesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., questions Supreme Court nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson during her Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing on Wednesday. And that is just a taste, because what we saw from almost every Republican on the committee was an airing of grievances against how Democrats have treated past nominees put up by Republican presidents. They are clearly still smarting from the Kavanaugh and Barrett confirmation hearings; they even brought up how Justice Samuel Alito was treated (he was confirmed 17 years ago) and even asked Jackson for her thoughts on Democrats' past conduct. She declined to comment. Republicans know they can't stop Jackson's nomination, but they were going to make sure that with all the attention and TV time being given to these hearings, they were going to try to make Democrats as uncomfortable as possible. There's certainly an argument that the Judiciary Committee is in need of a reset. A lot of the senators have been around for a very long time, and with all this bitterness, it raises the question of what happens when a nomination comes up when the president's opposing party is in charge of the Senate. What if Republicans take over the Senate after this fall is midterm elections and there's another vacancy for Biden? What happens then?",

            "article_content": "Journalist Maggie Severns explains how the Conservative Partnership Institute helped push the Republican party further to the right and became what she calls a \"clubhouse\" for insurrectionists.  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. A soapbox for the far right, the insurrectionists' clubhouse - that's how the Conservative Partnership Institute is described in an investigative article co-authored by my guest, Maggie Severns, a domestic policy reporter for the startup online publication Grid, which is about putting the news in context. The CPI is little known outside Trump circles, but according to the article, it's quickly become among the most powerful messaging forces in the MAGA universe. Several of its affiliated groups are headed by ex-Trump aides. One of the CPI's leaders is Mark Meadows, who was Trump's final chief of staff. The CPI was founded by Jim DeMint, a Republican from South Carolina who served in the House and Senate, was closely aligned with the Tea Party movement and helped push the Republican Party further to the right. He left the Senate to become president of the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation and then went on to start CPI. Maggie Severns is a former national affairs reporter for Politico, where she covered money and politics and the 2016 election. We recorded our interview yesterday. Maggie Severns, welcome to FRESH AIR. So what is the Conservative Partnership Institute - CPI? MAGGIE SEVERNS: Yeah. The Conservative Partnership Institute, I think, is a group that really speaks to the state of Trump in Washington now that he's not in power. It is an organization that under it has nearly a dozen other groups, all of them focused on kind of furthering pro-Trump Republicans in Washington. And as you mentioned, they employ some of the highest profile people from the Trump administration, folks like Mark Meadows and Cleta Mitchell. GROSS: It sounds like it's a whole MAGA universe - a, like, one-stop shopping place for all your MAGA needs if you're somebody in the political world. So describe some of the organizations affiliated with the CPI and how this is - how this can be a whole, like, infrastructure for the MAGA universe. SEVERNS: Yeah. And infrastructure is a word that we were using a lot when we were talking about this story because that's something that the MAGA universe hasn't really had a lot of - right? - is groups that really exist to support it. So running out of one townhouse on Capitol Hill just a few blocks from the Capitol - like I said, you have nearly a dozen different groups, and they include things like the Election Integrity Network, which is an organization run by Cleta Mitchell that is really aimed at training poll watchers and observers and people to file public records requests to really kind of watchdog the upcoming midterm elections. You also have the American Accountability Foundation, which is very different. It's focused on nominees. So they have been doing a lot of shopping opposition research and kind of furthering narratives about people, including Ketanji Brown Jackson when she was nominated to the Supreme Court, you know, basically digging up opposition research. So with Jackson, that was the notion that she had been soft on child porn sex offenders. GROSS: Doesn't it also have, like, accounting services and public relations and messaging? SEVERNS: Oh, yeah. (Laughter) So they really have everything. You know, those are examples of some of the kind of more meaty programs from CPI, but it really is a full-service shop, I would say, for pro-Trump Republicans, including several members of the Freedom Caucus in Congress. You know, there are several PACs, for example, that run out of CPI, including the Freedom Caucus' PAC. There is a PR firm that runs out of CPI. There are podcast and recording studios in the building. People like - Lauren Boebert records her podcast there. So they really provide all kinds of backup to both folks on the Hill like Lauren Boebert or Marjorie Taylor Greene and to folks who served in the Trump administration. GROSS: Why does the MAGA world think it's necessary to have this institute that's basically an infrastructure for the political and money end of MAGA? SEVERNS: I think that they probably looked to the rest of the Republican Party and Democrats and the things that they have had in the past that Trump really didn't have. So when Trump was in office, he didn't have that kind of institutional support in Washington. You know, Heritage, where Jim DeMint was president for quite a while, really tried to provide that kind of backing to Trump, but other organizations didn't. You know, the Koch network didn't really support Trump the way I think some would have expected. You know, AEI or Cato, the other think tanks in Washington, were never supplying a wealth of staff and ideas to the Trump administration. The Chamber of Commerce at one point sued Trump over immigration policies. So a lot of these longstanding Republican institutions that really help a president with ideas and staff and support on the public sphere, you know, on cable, really didn't exist for Trump, and I think that that made the administration have a harder time in Washington than it needed to. So going forward for this pro-Trump movement, what do they need? They need that kind of infrastructure if they really want to grow and thrive and, frankly, if they want to exist outside Trump, right? We don't know what's going to happen in 2024. We don't know if he'll be president again, but building something like CPI is in a way building something that could last a while. GROSS: So it's about the people who were in Trump's orbit but who want to be able to survive and carry on whether Trump is in the White House or not. So it's not specifically about Trump. It's a whole infrastructure that was kind of created in the Trump era but will exist independently of Trump. SEVERNS: Yeah, I think it's about supporting... GROSS: Or at least eventually it will. They hope it will exist independently of Trump. SEVERNS: Yeah. I was just going to say I think it's very much about supporting Trump and his policies. He's just not quite on the scene right now, right? So if he were president again, this would be a great help to him to have a organization that trains staff, that, you know, has a crew of people that get on cable and help push Trump's talking points for the day, you know, helping organize folks in Congress. So this could be very helpful to a Trump administration. But at the same time, I think one thing that was kind of striking to me about doing this story is that you have to wonder where is this Trump movement going, right? And I think that one thing that CPI got me - and my colleagues who I worked on this story with - thinking about is kind of how this ideology, if you want to call it that, or how this movement could really be here to stay. GROSS: Is the CPI in part meant to be a home for former Trump aides who perhaps are having a hard time finding a place for themselves within the Republican Party? SEVERNS: I think that in the weeks after January 6, that definitely was true for a while. You know, there was a lot of talk of folks from the Trump White House not being able to find jobs after we saw everything that happened at the Capitol, and then you saw Mark Meadows move over to CPI just several weeks later. And so I think there was this understanding that this was kind of employment. This was a place that was going to offer employment for people who had been in the Trump White House, and I think that that's definitely still the case. We see a number of people like Jeffrey Clark, Kash Patel who had worked for Trump, are now over at CPI. I mentioned Cleta Mitchell before. But also, you know, it is something that's more than that, right? It's really kind of taken on a lot of different functions both in terms of advocacy, in terms of PR, so I think that it's a lot of different things at this point. GROSS: Tell us about Mark Meadows' role in CPI. He was Trump's last chief of staff. He handed over a trove of documents to the January 6 House committee and then later refused to testify, and the House voted to hold him in contempt of Congress. So what is his role in CPI now? SEVERNS: So Mark Meadows is one of the leaders of CPI. And, you know, he isn't focused on a specific policy area as much as he is presumably focused on helping grow the organization, which has grown rapidly in recent years. It went from having a few million dollars coming in a year to, after Meadows and other folks from the Trump administration joined, you know, at least $20 million in - recently. We don't know what they are bringing in this year, but it's becoming a larger and larger organization. They actually just acquired a townhouse next door, which really speaks to the ambitions of this group and how it's trying to grow. GROSS: Let's talk about Cleta Mitchell, who runs the Election Integrity Network at the CPI. And she is a lawyer who was closely connected to Trump and was one of the lawyers advising him on how to overturn the results of the election. Describe her role in that, in the election. SEVERNS: Yeah. Mitchell was someone who was out after Trump, making the case that the election had been stolen. And, you know, what we've seen at CPI is that she's been able to, in some ways, really carry out that work as leader of this Election Integrity Network. She's been traveling around the country holding trainings with volunteers who seem to agree with Mitchell. And they are doing trainings in poll-watching and observing and in filing public records requests. You know, I recently - actually, for another story - spoke to someone who had worked in Fairfax County, Va., and the elections office in 2021. They have these odd off-year elections in Virginia, and that's one place that Mitchell and her organization had been working that year. And he said it was unlike anything he'd ever seen, that the number of people requesting to come in and observe the work of the election officials, the number of public records requests they were getting - they had a person basically tasked five days a week to just respond to these requests - and that in the past, he said that most people who were interested in doing these kinds of things and monitoring the elections process seemed to be kind of driven more by curiosity. You know, he said that he would really try and explain to people what's going on and that in 2021, it was the first time he really felt that folks were looking over his shoulder, trying to find something they were doing wrong. So I think that we're seeing a real shift in the way that a lot of people who feel there was something that happened wrong during the 2020 election, how they're approaching these upcoming elections. GROSS: So part of the work of this Election Integrity Network is to keep challenging votes, to challenge the administration of voting. Is it almost a form of harassment? SEVERNS: You know, I think that we'll learn more after the midterm elections. I think that it's certainly - so, you know, it's so funny 'cause a public records request sounds so administrative. But when you are a small bureau of elections and you have just hundreds and hundreds of requests coming at you, it can really gum up the works, right? - same with if you have tons of people coming in, trying to kind of observe you every day and look for any little thing that they think you could be doing wrong. And so I think local elections officials in the past have had really quiet jobs, and now there's a lot going on. And we're going to learn a lot more about kind of the effects of these programs that I should say not just Mitchell, but others in the Republican Party are running as we go into the midterm elections. GROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk more about the CPI. If you're just joining us, my guest is Maggie Severns, and her latest article is called \"The Insurrectionists' Clubhouse: Former Trump Aides Find A Home At A Little-Known MAGA Hub.\" And Maggie Severns writes for Grid, which is a new online journalism site. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF CUONG VU AND PAT METHENY'S \"SEEDS OF DOUBT\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday with Maggie Severns, who writes for the online publication Grid, which is an online startup that's dedicated to putting the news in context. And her latest article is titled \"The Insurrectionists' Clubhouse: Former Trump Aides Find A Home At A Little-Known MAGA Hub.\" And this home is called the Conservative Partnership Institute, and nearly two dozen alleged members of the January 6th plot are connected to this group. Stephen Miller, a former Trump aide and speechwriter who's a hard-liner on immigration and had a strong influence on Trump's anti-immigration policies - he runs a group linked to CPI, America First Legal. So tell us about Miller's association with CPI and what America First Legal does. SEVERNS: Yeah, so like we've discussed, CPI really is a network of different groups, and it's a kind of complicated arrangement. And one of the sister groups, as we could call it, America First Legal, is run by Stephen Miller, and they're really focused on bringing lawsuits. So they sued the Biden administration over the border, for example, saying that letting people into Texas was going to help the spread of COVID. Another example of America First Legal's work is that they have sued Loudoun County, which was a real center of the critical race theory debate over diversity policies in Loudoun County, saying that there should be kind of these special operators over the school board. The school board shouldn't be allowed to function normally anymore. So a lot of Stephen Miller's work, you could say, is bringing especially these culture war issues, which is something we see a lot at CPI, really bringing these cultural issues to the fore via lawsuits. GROSS: And let me ask you about Jeffrey Clark. Now, he worked at the DOJ, and Trump wanted to replace the acting attorney general with Jeffrey Clark because the acting attorney general wouldn't go along with Trump's plans to overturn the results of the election. So what's Jeffrey Clark's role at the CPI? SEVERNS: Yeah. Jeffrey Clark works over at the Center for Renewing America, which is another sister group that is run by Russ Vought, who was a longtime Jim DeMint aide. So we see a lot of these - one thing that I think is interesting about CPI is you see this real mixing of people who have been involved with DeMint and involved with the Tea Party for a long time, who then are kind of paired up with people like Jeffrey Clark at the Center for Renewing America. And Center for Renewing America is really focused, in no small part, on critical race theory and other of these cultural issues that we've seen really come to the fore in recent years. So, for example, Center for Renewing America has bragged about getting model legislation focused on CRT introduced in a lot of different states and introduced in Congress. GROSS: Let me read something from the CPI website. This is about their messaging capabilities. It says, CPI Studios, our state-of-the-art media center, is now home to 15 podcasts, eight constituent video projects and constant visits by members of Congress and allied groups. In less time than it takes to eat lunch, members can conduct media and TV interviews from our studios and still make it back to the U.S. Capitol for an important vote. OK. So this says members of Congress work out of CPI for their media work. They're home to 15 podcasts. Who are some of the people who host their podcasts from CPI Studios? SEVERNS: There seem to be a number of people who host podcasts from CPI Studios. I think I mentioned Lauren Boebert as being one of them; Andy Biggs, who's another major Freedom Caucus member. Jenna Ellis records her podcast there. She was very involved with the stop the steal movement. So we see a lot of people. And I think it really speaks to one of the core functions of this organization and something that, in general, Trump world is really focused on, which is messaging. So when you have a podcast and a television studio - the TV studio, I should mention, you know, there was a whole documentary shot about January 6 - you can really get your message out better and more clearly when you can work in collaboration with all these other people. I think it's really interesting to see - because CPI is fractured into so many different parts and is kind of a home base for the Freedom Caucus, it's interesting because you look at all these media clips as an outsider, all these tweets or interviews or podcasts, and they're all coming from different people in Trump world. But, really, it's more kind of a chorus of folks - right? - who are all connected to each other, all operating out of the same house. And so a relatively small number of people can seem to have a very big effect when it comes to messaging and public relations. GROSS: And these podcasts and other messaging, the video projects, they go right to the base. They bypass the mainstream media. SEVERNS: Oh, absolutely. And that's something that we've seen in recent years both parties really try and do. But the Republican ecosystem, of course, has become kind of something of its own, especially since January 6, because a lot of what people are saying is just not true. So I think that it helps to reinforce these things that a lot of Trump supporters are being told about the legitimacy of the last election. GROSS: I think that the American Accountability Foundation, which is affiliated with CPI, takes credit for finding a note in the Harvard Law Review in which they claimed that Ketanji Brown Jackson had argued that America's judicial system is too hard on sexual offenders. And they tweeted that she had been soft on sex offenders when she was a judge, and that really got traction during her hearings. SEVERNS: Yeah. And this is, again, a story about messaging - right? - and what gets said in the public sphere, but now we're talking about what happens behind the scenes. And the American Accountability Foundation focuses on nominees - some of them lower-level nominees and some of them people like Ketanji Brown Jackson - and spreading opposition research and, in some cases, what seems like misinformation about these people. When it came to Jackson, there was a narrative that AAF and some other conservative groups really tried to put forward that she had supported lighter sentences for people who had been involved with child pornography. And I think that it was fact-checked a lot by the media who found that that idea was severely lacking context, that what she did was very mainstream, the positions that she had taken, and that in some cases it wasn't her that took the position but an entire commission that she was a part of. So that idea wasn't necessarily true, but it got a lot of traction on the right. And I think that the lasting effect on something like that - you know, Jackson was confirmed, but now this idea about her has been placed with a lot of people that's not necessarily going to go away. GROSS: You describe the CPI as a base for the Freedom Caucus, and the Freedom Caucus is the far-right caucus in the House. So in what way is the CPI a home base for the Freedom Caucus? SEVERNS: Yeah. You know, people who have really been following the January 6 hearings might remember there was this text that came out from Marjorie Taylor Greene to Mark Meadows where she said, we need to get organized for the 6. And then she says, I'll be at CPI this afternoon. And to me, that's such a good example of the kind of function that CPI is trying to provide for folks who are in the Freedom Caucus and seems to successfully be doing. The Freedom Caucus hosts meetings at CPI. Their PAC is run out of the CPI building. People record podcasts out of CPI. So it really is providing a lot of functions. And, you know, we called it a clubhouse in some ways. I think it wants to be a clubhouse for the Freedom Caucus. GROSS: Let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Maggie Severns, and she writes for the start-up online publication Grid. She was formerly with Politico. Her latest article, the one she co-authored, is called \"The Insurrectionists' Clubhouse: Former Trump Aides Find A Home At A Little-Known MAGA Hub.\" And that hub is the Conservative Partnership Institute. We'll talk more about it after a short break. I'm Terry Gross. And this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF ANDRES VIAL, RODNEY GREEN, PETER BERNSTEIN AND DEZRON DOUGLAS' \"BLUEHAWK\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I am Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday with Maggie Severns about the article she co-wrote titled \"The Insurrectionists' Clubhouse: Former Trump Aides Find A Home At A Little-Known MAGA Hub.\" The article is about the Conservative Partnership Institute, CPI, which is described in the article as having quickly become among the most powerful messaging forces in the MAGA universe. Several of its affiliated groups are headed by ex-Trump aides. One of the CPI's leaders is Mark Meadows, who was Trump's final chief of staff. The CPI was founded by Jim DeMint, a Republican from South Carolina who served in the House and the Senate, was closely aligned with the Tea Party movement, and helped push the Republican Party further to the right. Maggie Severns covers domestic policy for the online startup journalism publication Grid and is a former national affairs reporter for Politico where she covered money and politics and the 2016 election. In just a few years, CPI has grown from being a new organization to raising - what? - 19-, like, nearly $20 million. Is that total? Or is that per year? SEVERNS: That's per year, and that's that we know of. GROSS: So what were you able to find out about who funds CPI and its affiliates? SEVERNS: Yeah. So you have a dark-money network, which means that it doesn't have to disclose any of its donors. But we were able to figure out some things. Now, Trump himself is probably CPI's most noteworthy donor. He gave the group $1 million out of his PAC, and that was money that he had, in part, raised following January 6th when he was sending a lot of messages to supporters about the election having been stolen and raising millions and millions of dollars off of that concept. He later gave $1 million to CPI not too long after Meadows joined. There are several other donors who have been people who supported several far-right candidates or were big Tea Party supporters like Foster Friess, who recently passed away but, until then, had been a donor to CPI. Richard Uihlein is another. He's given millions and millions of dollars to conservative candidates in recent years. So there are some pretty heavy hitters in the Republican Party who are helping this organization grow. GROSS: It's funny 'cause, you know, I think of Trump as taking money and not giving money - you know, raising money, but not donating to other groups. SEVERNS: Which raises the questions of, why did he give that money to CPI? You know, one thing that was really interesting to us but didn't quite make it into the story was that shortly after Trump gave the money to CPI, there was a group that kind of sprang out out of nowhere. And Cleta Mitchell appears to have given roughly $1 million to the audit in Arizona that was looking into whether there had been abnormalities in the 2020 election. So there is some possibility that the money kind of passed through CPI to Cleta Mitchell to the Arizona election audit. We don't know. We can't definitively say what happened. But it's interesting to see how once you have a network of dark-money groups and advocacy groups, all interconnected money can go in really unexpected directions. GROSS: I want to ask you about the Tea Party, which is a kind of far-right group - political, kind of populist - that formed in response to Barack Obama - to his election and then his presidency. Do you see any connection between that group and what's evolved into MAGA or the CPI? SEVERNS: Yeah, I'll give you kind of a big-picture answer and then a more specific one. The big picture is that when you look at the Tea Party and how it's evolved over time, it is striking to think about how some of these folks who were involved with the Tea Party have carried through and become key leaders on the right today. You know, Mark Meadows was an original Tea Party figure, but he is someone who helped co-found the House Freedom Caucus, which grew out of the Tea Party, and now he's over helping lead CPI. Jim DeMint, who was a congressman and then a senator, was really crucial to helping drive the Tea Party when he was in the Senate. And he actually started a PAC that helped promote Tea Party candidates. Jim DeMint then went to the Heritage Foundation. He helped found a whole political arm of Heritage that, again, was really helping kind of antagonized, centrist Republicans by funding challenges to them from the right and, in some ways, was successful at doing that or was successful at least at becoming a very vocal player. Heritage, at one point, decided, you know what? We've become too political. We've become too closely aligned with Trump. We want to go back to really our roots as a think tank. And so board members at Heritage decided to kick DeMint out, and he went on to found CPI. So he's a really good example of someone who's kind of ridden through these various waves on the right and how, I think, some of what we see today in MAGA world or in pro-Trump politics is really a continuation or a new iteration of the Tea Party. GROSS: On the CPI's website, it talks about its ability to help with staffing. And here's a paragraph about that - we don't stop at simply training great staffers. Personnel is policy, which CPI identifies, interviews and places proven conservatives on the Hill and in organizations throughout Washington. To date, we've pitched hundreds of top-notch candidates for positions in key House and Senate offices. We recently expanded our team to prepare to staff new offices after the 2022 midterm elections. So if you take that at face value, it makes it seem like the CPI wants to place its people throughout the places of power in Washington. I have no idea how much power they really have or how successful they'll actually be at getting their people - and we're talking about MAGA people - as staffers in key offices. What is your evaluation of how much power they have to accomplish their goals and to make this a much bigger and even more powerful movement? SEVERNS: Yeah, I think that one thing that we learned during the Trump administration is that personnel is policy, like CPI says, and kind of the importance of that. You know, Trump, when he came to Washington, had really railed against the machine and then, I think, had problems filling out a lot of his administration, right? I think that finding people who are well-trained and equipped to work in offices for lawmakers like Marjorie Taylor Greene isn't as easy always as you would think. And so there is a need there, I would imagine, to provide a lot of young but, you know, very bright, kind of the traditional Capitol Hill aide for these MAGA folks. So I think there really is something to that. I think that it's the kind of thing that can really help wheels turn and help avoid dysfunction that we've seen sometimes from the Trump White House or other parts of Washington. GROSS: One of the greatest threats to democracy is when people lie about an election and say that the winner didn't win and that the loser really did win. And that's what we've been seeing now with a lot of the MAGA people. So do you consider the CPI, which is a MAGA organization - their election integrity network is run by an election denier. Do you see this group as a threat to democracy if they accomplish their goals of getting their people in powerful positions, getting their people as staffers in political offices? SEVERNS: I think that, like you said, the argument about whether the 2020 election was won or lost is a dangerous one because it shouldn't be an argument. And looking at CPI and other groups for other reporting that we've been doing, the intense focus on future elections and whether those will have some kind of election fraud, you know, that's something that can really rally a base. But it's also something that can, of course, be very, very dangerous when you're undermining public confidence in an election. So yeah, for that reason, I think that groups like CPI should be taken very seriously. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Maggie Severns. The article that we're talking about that she co-authored is titled \"The Insurrectionists' Clubhouse: Former Trump Aides Find A Home At A Little-Known MAGA Hub.\" And the hub is the Conservative Partnership Institute. We'll talk more about it after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF RHYTHM FUTURE QUARTET'S \"IBERIAN SUNRISE\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview that we recorded yesterday with Maggie Severns. The article we're talking about that she co-authored is called \"The Insurrectionists' Clubhouse: Former Trump Aides Find A Home At A Little-Known MAGA Hub.\" The hub is called the Conservative Partnership Institute. And the article is published in Grid, which is a new online publication whose goal is to put the news in context. Are there any models for the CPI? Or is this something new? SEVERNS: It is. You know, I spent several years covering money in politics. Before that, I was on Capitol Hill. This is not like anything that I've seen. I think it is an extension of a lot of things that we've seen. So for example, the Trump universe has always been very focused on kind of messaging over policy, right. One interesting thing about CPI and all the affiliated groups is they're not actually that focused on policy despite CPI being a think tank. They're more focused on the message and helping further some culture war issues to the extent that there is policy. So I think that that is - it's very natural for the MAGA think tank to have this focus on getting the message across. I think another thing about CPI that felt a little bit familiar to me is - we've talked about the structure and the way that it's a group of a bunch of different dark money organizations. That hearkens back to groups like the Koch network, to donor funds, places where donors pool money like Wellspring or Arabella on the left. So we've seen - since Citizens United, we've seen campaign finance and dark money organizations get more complicated and harder to understand. And this also feels, to me, like an extension of that. GROSS: What are you going to be looking at as we approach the midterms? SEVERNS: I think this is something people know, but it's hard to internalize - that the next election, and probably 2024, too, there's going to be a lot of talk from the right about the vote being unfair, you know, about stop the steal, about the 2020 election having been stolen and that this isn't just something that happened in the past. You know, we're still having a lot of conversations about January 6. But in a lot of ways, we kind of got lucky during the 2020 election that all the electors behaved as you would expect, that there weren't any problems certifying the vote, that more people didn't die at the Capitol. There were a lot of disasters averted by our system, you know? And the system exists and works for a reason. But I think that going forward, this is going to continue. And it could get more extreme or more harrowing. And that's - when I really think about the next couple elections, it's not even about who wins and loses. It's about, how much faith do people have in the electoral system? GROSS: In our basic democracy. SEVERNS: Yeah. And, you know, the extension there is our basic democracy. So I think that that's something that - it isn't going away. And that one thing when you look at a group like CPI is, that's building a lasting infrastructure - right? - to be making some of these same points to support lawmakers on the far-right, regardless of whether Trump wins. So you know, maybe - you never know what's going to happen in politics. It's - elections in particular can be a grand, you know, surprising story. Who would have anticipated Trump before he became the nominee? So we don't know what's going to happen. But I think that there's something very serious going on. And that's really where my attention's at. GROSS: You cover policy, domestic policy. Do you have a sense - I mean, the Republican Party does not have a platform for the presidential election, which is, like, pretty unusual. And the Republican Party has become famous for being an oppositional force as opposed to, you know, having real policies laid out. Though, abortion is an exception. They drove really hard on getting abortion overturned by appointing anti-abortion justices and creating laws on the state level that limited or now overturned abortion. Do you have a sense of what Republicans want policy-wise in the future? SEVERNS: I think it really depends on what you - who you talk to, you know? The Supreme Court, I think, is set to, really, fulfill a long-held conservative dream of, really, reinforcing states' rights, which is what we saw in abortion, and kind of a new era of federalism. I think that that's something that has been on the agenda for a long time. I think that during the Trump administration, you also saw some people who weren't necessarily, really, aligned with Trump really try and get their policy priorities accomplished through him - tax cuts being a major example. You know, there were folks like the Kochs, who weren't really Trump supporters, but they had really wanted tax cuts for a long time. And they were very thrilled when Congress and Trump cut taxes. So I think that there are definitely policy priorities there for the Republican Party. I think that one thing that Trump did very brilliantly and that the party seems to be kind of coalescing about is that most voters don't really vote based on your policy platform. You know, there might be people who vote based on whether or not you want to cut taxes, but really, voters vote on kind of the identity, the message, the vision that you're presenting. And so pivoting to that over having really detailed policy platforms, I think that they feel that's successful because that really worked well for Trump. Trump is a great communicator. You know, people can have problems with him, but he is very good at drawing in a crowd and drawing people into kind of his Make America Great Again. You know, that's not a policy platform, but it is a vision. GROSS: Do you have a sense of where leaders of the Republican Party stand on whether they want Trump to run in the next election or not? I really have no idea whether they see him, at this point, as a liability or as a plus. Certainly, they want his base, but do they want him? SEVERNS: I think that really depends on who you talk to. You know, you get the sense over time among leaders, Republican leaders in Congress sometimes, that it's like their lives would be easier if this whole thing went away, right? If things were kind of back to the pre-Trump days when, in some ways, it was a lot easier to be Mitch McConnell and not be negotiating all of these really tricky things like denial of the last election. You know, I think that at the same time, it's - Trump is the Republican Party now. And I think that that's something that a lot of people have accepted and embraced even if - you know, I'm based in Washington. There are a lot of Republican aides in Washington who wish that Trump would disappear, but he's running next election. You know, there might be folks who are also running, but the fact is right now, he is the standard-bearer for the Republican Party. GROSS: So you're confident that he's going to run? SEVERNS: I mean, he's saying he's going to run. I don't - you know, and he's (ph) has seemed to, in every indication, be intending on running. You can't quite predict the future or what's going to happen, and you don't know how much of that posturing is him trying to kind of insulate himself from potentially being investigated by DOJ. GROSS: Yeah. How much - I know if he was president, that would offer some protection. But what if he's a presidential candidate? Does that offer any protection from being investigated or being subpoenaed to testify? SEVERNS: I think that one thing that's going to be really important for DOJ is this question of, what are the optics of investigating someone who's running for president? There's nothing in the law that says they can't do it, but it really would look like political persecution to a lot of Trump's base. And so there are people who say they can't not, you know? Nobody is above the law. You have to bring a case against Trump if you think you have one and it's winnable. And then there are people who say this would be very destructive to trust and democracy, and it shouldn't be done. So we're just going to have to see what DOJ decides to do. GROSS: Maggie Severns, thank you so much for talking with us. SEVERNS: Thanks so much for having me, Terry. GROSS: Maggie Severns co-wrote the article \"The Insurrectionists' Clubhouse,\" which is in the new online publication Grid where she covers domestic policy. After we take a short break, David Bianculli will review the new documentary series about Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, their acting careers, and their marriage.

            "article_content": "Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson finishes her testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings for her Supreme Court nomination.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson faced another day of questions during her confirmation hearing for the U.S. Supreme Court. And things got a little heated today, so we'll warn you that there may be some profanity ahead in the conversation we're about to have with NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg and senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro. Good to have you both here. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Thanks for having us. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: Nice to be here. SHAPIRO: Before we get to today's hearing, Nina, could you just briefly bring us up to speed on Justice Clarence Thomas, who has been hospitalized since last Friday night? TOTENBERG: Well, we really don't know anything more than we were told initially. He has an infection and is being treated with intravenous drugs. But initially, the court's press office said that he was expected to be discharged on Monday or Tuesday. And now it's Wednesday, so he's been there five days, suggesting that perhaps there's something fairly serious going on. And that underlines the importance of these hearings. SHAPIRO: And let's talk about what happened at these hearings today. Judge Jackson's sentencing record for child pornography cases once again became a focal point of questions from some Republican senators. TOTENBERG: That's exactly right. Judge Jackson again got hammered over a handful of child pornography cases in which she sentenced defendants to less time than recommended by prosecutors or that would have been required under the sentencing guidelines or were at the low end. Now, this record, we should note, is the same as some 70 to 80% of other judges. And that's because when the law was written in 2003, almost all pornography was traded by mail. And one of the sentencing enhancements was based on the amount of pornography purchased or distributed by mail. Today, of course, on the internet - and that's how everybody does this - one click can transmit thousands of images. So most judges don't necessarily consider one or two or three clicks as an aggravating factor. But some Republicans see things differently, like Lindsey Graham. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think the best way to deter people from getting on a computer and viewing thousands and hundreds and, over time, maybe millions - the population as a whole - of children being exploited and abused every time somebody clicks on is to put their ass in jail, not supervise their computer usage. TOTENBERG: So you can see the kind of rhetoric that was on display from Graham, as well as Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz and Tom Cotton. SHAPIRO: Rhetoric and also tone. Domenico, what was your takeaway from the Republicans on the committee? MONTANARO: Yeah. I mean, overall, Republicans on the committee really were in the business of airing a lot of grievances and giving us kind of a healthy dose of some midterm messaging. You know, they pledged to treat Judge Jackson respectfully from a personal standpoint, not bring in a lot of these outside affiliations which they're upset Democrats have done to past nominees. That was mostly true, with the notable exception of Senator Cruz, as Nina mentioned. You know, he brought up her sitting on the board of the Georgetown Day School here in Washington, an elite school. And that turned into really a discussion about critical race theory, how children are taught about racism, which, as we know, has been a huge issue for Republicans in political campaigns over the past year or so. And at one point during the hearing, the Republican National Committee even sent out an image of Judge Jackson with her initials, KBJ, crossed out and replaced with CRT. But I have to say, the biggest area where Jackson obviously was on defense over these last three days, including this afternoon, again, was on sentences that she meted out, as Nina had mentioned. The implication is that she's lenient and she's soft on crime, which also has been a huge part of the Republican messaging heading into this election year midterms. SHAPIRO: Do you think this is all going to mean she won't get any Republican votes? MONTANARO: Well, you know, look; it was contentious. I'm not sure if anybody on the committee will vote for her. We'll see. But the White House is still hopeful that some Republicans could cross over. I mean, think about people like Mitt Romney of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine. Murkowski and Collins, we should say, voted for her to her current position. And so did Lindsey Graham, by the way, but he seems more doubtful this time since he was among the most animated questioners, as you could hear there - angry at Democrats' conduct in past confirmation hearings. Overall, though, what matters is whether Democrats stick together since they narrowly control the Senate. And, really, her calm and steady performance likely helped with that. You know, Republicans know they can't stop her nomination, so they were going to make sure that with all the attention and TV time that they are being given to these hearings, that they were going to get in their political points, stress their political values and try and make Democrats as uncomfortable as possible. SHAPIRO: Nina, you've covered confirmation hearings for every justice on the court and then some. How is Judge Jackson doing? TOTENBERG: She did fine. She wasn't, you know, the best nominee ever. That would go to Chief Justice Roberts. But she did fine. SHAPIRO: And, Domenico, what do you think all of this tells us about the tenor of future hearings? MONTANARO: Well, look; it's been bitter on this confirmation hearing. You can hear it from Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, who criticized the tone of the questions being posed by Senator Graham to Judge Jackson. Let's take a listen to that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PATRICK LEAHY: I don't know what the motivation might be, what political motivation it is, but to see the badgering of this woman as she's trying to testify I thought was outrageous. MONTANARO: It makes you wonder whether a president will ever be able to get through a nominee to the court when the opposite party holds the chamber. We haven't seen that before. We got a glimpse of it when President Obama - former President Obama nominated Merrick Garland to the court and Republican Leader Mitch McConnell didn't even give Garland a hearing. The job of the Senate is to advise and consent. But right now, with tensions being what they are, we really have a broken system in the Senate. It's unclear what's going to happen in the future with that. SHAPIRO: Nina, what are your takeaways from the hearing so far? TOTENBERG: Well, you know, we had an enormous amount of posturing and grievances from senators - Republican senators - this week, and some Democrats, too, I suppose. And occasionally, there was some honest reflection. To my surprise, Republican Senator Ben Sasse seemed to disassociate himself from some of the questioning of Judge Jackson on his side by urging the Supreme Court not to allow cameras in the court chamber. Take a listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BEN SASSE: For intellectual discourse, it is not a friend. And I think we should recognize that the jackassery (ph) we often see around here is partly because of people mugging for short-term camera opportunities. SHAPIRO: And there is the vulgarity we promised you in the intro. TOTENBERG: (Laughter). SHAPIRO: NPR's Nina Totenberg and Domenico Montanaro, thank you both. MONTANARO: You're welcome. TOTENBERG: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

As journalists, a story about angry parents trying to stop change sounded like something we had all heard before. It's the kind of thing that always gets a lot of play in the media with no help from us. That instinct was only confirmed in the following weeks, with the coverage of those ugly meetings of the District 28 Community Education Council. But the more we started looking into this story, the more layers we found that weren't just about the naysayers. In fact, these meetings activated people all over the district, on both ends of the political spectrum. In talking with them, we tapped into the rich history and complicated present of a place both very diverse and deeply segregated. We set out to make sense of why a school district in the most diverse place on the planet would need a diversity plan \u2013 and why that plan went off the rails. We found ourselves returning, time and time again, to a north-south divide, not just in schools, but in housing. And given all the disparities, we asked, how do you build an education system that works for everybody? Over the course of this season, we've explored a rich history and complicated present, but what about the future? In this episode, we catch up with parents who became activated on both sides of the debate over the diversity plan. And, since the diversity plan never came to fruition, we ask...what now?

After an abrupt recall and a two-month delay - along with the threat of possible legal action - the election denial book 2,000 Mules has reached bookstores, though with a few significant changes. Most notably, a passage in the recalled version of the book that accused specific, named nonprofit organizations of involvement in illegal \"ballot trafficking\" has been rewritten, softening certain claims and outright removing the names of the groups. Separately, sections of the book that purported to link election fraud to antifa and the Black Lives Matter movement have also been deleted. 2,000 Mules is based on the film of the same name, which alleges a vast conspiracy between unnamed left-wing nonprofit groups and paid ballot \"mules\" to stuff vote-by-mail dropboxes and steal the 2020 election. Law enforcement officials and fact-checkers have thoroughly discredited the film's allegations, and the filmmakers have declined to make key evidence for their central claims public. Nonetheless, 2,000 Mules has remained highly influential in the pro-Trump election denial movement. And in response to a viewer of the film who wanted to see more evidence, filmmaker and author Dinesh D'Souza said in July that the follow-up book based on 2,000 Mules would name names. \"I am going to reveal the names of several of these nonprofit stash houses in my book '2000 Mules,'\" D'Souza tweeted in July. The initial version of the book set to be published in August did just that. D'Souza accused five nonprofit groups of acting as illegal ballot \"stash houses.\" Copies of the book had already reached bookstores, when, just before the release date, the publisher Regnery issued a recall, though they did not catch every copy. NPR managed to find the book on the shelf at a Barnes & Noble bookstore. D'Souza and Regnery did not give a reason for the sudden recall. Instead, they blamed an unspecified \"publishing error,\" and declined to answer further questions about the mistake, which was significant enough to cause Salem Media, Regnery's parent company, to lower its corporate earnings estimate. When NPR contacted the five groups D'Souza had accused of involvement in election fraud, two went on the record to condemn the accusations as \"trash,\" \"lies,\" and \"malarkey.\" One of those groups described the allegations as potentially \"libelous.\" Even True the Vote, the controversial election denial organization that executive produced the 2,000 Mules film, distanced themselves from the book. \"True the Vote had no participation in this book, and has no knowledge of its contents,\" the group said in a statement to NPR back in September. \"This includes any allegations of activities of any specific organizations made in the book. We made no such allegations.\" Now, D'Souza and Regnery have officially released the 2,000 Mules book, and changed that section. D'Souza had previously described left-wing nonprofits as \"doing vote trafficking.\" The newly-released book tones down that phrase to \"potentially storing ballots.\" And the names of specific nonprofits that D'Souza accused of election fraud have all been removed. Now, in lieu of listing specific groups, D'Souza writes, \"True the Vote shared their names with me and has offered to make them available as needed to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.\" The New Georgia Project, a group that focuses on registering and mobilizing young voters and voters of color, was one of the groups named in the recalled book. \"We're always happy when someone who has been discredited takes our name out of their mouths,\" said a New Georgia Project spokesperson in a message to NPR. Given the absence of evidence supporting the allegations, NPR is not naming the other groups cited in the recalled version of the book. In September, when NPR obtained a copy of the recalled book, Regnery said they would \"be happy to talk to you more about 2,000 Mules once it is published.\" But when asked about arranging an interview this week, Regnery president Thomas Spence declined. \"At this point, Regnery is not offering any comment on the book 2,000 Mules,\" Spence wrote in an email. D'Souza did not respond to NPR's request for comment. The official release of the book also completely removes a claim that True the Vote was able to determine the supposed ballot \"mules\" had links to antifa and the Black Lives Matter movement. The film and the recalled version of the book said that True the Vote used a database from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) to make this connection. ACLED objected to that characterization, and requested a correction from D'Souza. \"This is not the type of analysis you can use ACLED data for, and it is highly unlikely that these conclusions have any basis in fact,\" a spokesperson for ACLED previously told NPR. The spokesperson said every reference to ACLED in the recalled version of the book was \"incorrect or misleading.\" Now, ACLED does not appear anywhere in the book. Several paragraphs that attempted to rebut NPR's earlier fact-check about the ACLED data have been removed. And claims that the \"mules\" had connections to antifa or BLM are gone, too. \"ACLED requested a correction from the publisher based on the incorrect references included in the recalled version of 2,000 Mules, and we are happy to see that these references have ultimately been removed from the final copy of the book,\" said Sam Jones, ACLED's head of communications. \"Our data do not support any of the claims or conclusions that were previously linked to ACLED.\" The changes to the book may reflect some concern by D'Souza and Regnery about possible legal trouble. D'Souza previously said he omitted the names of the nonprofits from the film after getting into a \"big fight\" with lawyers, who said he could not name them. Since the 2020 election, other prominent election deniers - and the channels that hosted them - have faced lawsuits from election technology companies and election workers, who say election-related lies cost them business, led to death threats, and upended their lives. There is some evidence that 2,000 Mules has inspired distrust and conspiracy theories around the use of ballot dropboxes, especially given former president Trump's embrace of the film. Arizona election authorities have issued warnings to people purportedly surveilling ballot dropboxes - possibly inspired by the film's claims - and said they referred complaints of possible voter intimidation to the U.S. Department of Justice. \"There's a group of people hanging out near the ballot dropbox filming and photographing my wife and I as we approached the dropbox and accusing us of being a mule,\" a voter wrote in a complaint to the Arizona Secretary of State's Office. \"They took photographs of our license plate and of us and then followed us out the parking lot in one of their cars continuing to film.\"",

For example: when invading British troops attacked Washington and set fire to the U.S. Capitol in 1814. Teachers across the country face a daunting challenge this week: how to talk with students about the anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Discussing it last year, as it happened or the day after, was hard, teachers tell NPR, but this year will likely be harder. Our nation's political divides persist, and polls show Americans still don't agree on basic facts about why a mob overran the Capitol, attacked police and threatened lawmakers. NPR spoke with a dozen educators and civics experts about how they're handling the anniversary in the classroom. This one may surprise you, but several educators tell NPR they plan to talk about the events of Jan. 6 as if their students know very little about what actually happened. Because many don't. \"We were talking about the burning of Washington, D.C., during the War of 1812,\" says Kristen Crews, who teaches high school American history outside Winston-Salem, N.C., \"and I was kind of surprised at how many kids don't realize or understand what happened a year ago and how serious it was. And I was like, 'No, this is one of those times where history is relevant!' \" We were talking about the burning of Washington, D.C., during the War of 1812, and I was kind of surprised at how many kids don't realize or understand what happened a year ago, and how serious it was. And I was like, 'No, this is one of those times where history is relevant!' Kristen Crews, high school American history teacher Teens get so much of their daily news from peers, social media and other unreliable sources that educators say it's risky to assume students know even basic facts about that day. That's why Emma Humphries, of iCivics, a national nonprofit devoted to improving civics education, recommends teachers \"start by asking students what they know about the events of Jan. 6 or what questions they might have about [that day].\" This allows teachers to gauge the depth of students' understanding, while also letting kids' own curiosity and interest guide the conversation. Classrooms are like grocery stores and movie theaters: They're full of people with diverse life stories and conflicting opinions, brought together for a common purpose. Unlike grocery clerks and ticket-takers, though, teachers have to engage their students in difficult conversations. That can't happen, teachers say, unless students feel safe sharing. That's why, before discussing the events of Jan. 6, it's important to establish some ground rules. Students must feel comfortable sharing without fear of judgment or embarrassment \u2014 from their peers but also from their teacher. Disagreement is healthy \u2014 but must be respectful and informed. That means questioning opinions, not the character of the student who holds them. \"Let your students know that their learning environment is a safe and brave space,\" recommends updated classroom guidance from Facing History & Ourselves, a global nonprofit that helps teachers use history lessons to combat bigotry and hate. The group even recommends students draft a formal contract, laying out the rules for classroom conversation. One of the most obvious ways students can begin to explore the events of Jan. 6 \u2014 or any other fraught moment in history \u2014 is by using primary sources to build a foundation of facts. Several teachers say, even before beginning a conversation about Jan. 6, it may be necessary to provide students with at least a baseline of truth. \"Even older kids can come in and really derail things in terms of what they think they know or, you know, some story they heard at home. And then it can all just be a big jumble,\" says teacher Gabby Arca, who has taught K-12 in Washington, D.C., and Oregon. She advises fellow teachers \"to get on the same page about the basic facts before you just open a discussion where it can just kind of go into a free for all.\" Start with the easy stuff. For example, we know from official records \u2014 videos of lawmakers' speeches and news stories leading up to the day \u2014 that Congress was meeting in a joint session, presided over by former Vice President Mike Pence, to officially certify the results of the 2020 presidential election. Those are all incontrovertible facts. It's also a fact that, at the same time, thousands of former President Donald Trump's supporters gathered for a planned rally near the White House to protest what Trump argued was a fraudulent election. Teachers say Trump's speech to the crowd, in which he encouraged them to \"stop the steal\" and \"fight like hell,\" is a valuable source to understand his motivations and those of the crowd. Then come the thornier facts, though facts nonetheless. Was the election corrupted by fraud? According to a new NPR/Ipsos poll, two-thirds of Republican respondents believe it was \u2014 despite trustworthy sources refuting those claims. This puts teachers in the difficult position of contradicting what some students are hearing at home. Several educators tell NPR their job is to teach students how to think, not what to think. Instead of simply saying, \"Trump's election fraud claims have been thoroughly debunked,\" some teachers say they would rather help students investigate the claims themselves \u2014 that it's a more meaningful (and lasting) learning experience if the truth requires a journey of inquiry. Challenging students to check their facts doesn't mean teachers step aside. Instead, they play a vital role helping students differentiate between a reputable source and propaganda; between an advocate who profits from falsehoods and a journalist or expert who traffics in facts. I like to play a lot of devil's advocate and just get the students to be, you know, almost get mad at me for asking too many questions. But then they get to use that 6 inches between their ears and think about what their own position is. James Fitzgerald, high school teacher \"I want my students to develop an appreciation for expertise,\" says Justin Christensen, a high school government teacher in San Jose, Calif. Even down to the weather, he jokes. \"Rather than me simply saying, 'It's sunny. Let's move on.' I would want [my students] to consult a meteorologist. I would want them to find the expert in the field.\" In Chicago, high school teacher James Fitzgerald says he enjoys pushing his students to always question their assumptions and to back them up with evidence. \"I like to play a lot of devil's advocate and just get the students to be, you know, almost get mad at me for asking too many questions. But then they get to use that 6 inches between their ears and think about what their own position is,\" Fitzgerald says. NPR spoke with teachers of history, civics, government and English, and all said, in these days of information overload, helping students develop these news literacy skills \u2014 and learn to meaningfully question everything that comes their way \u2014 is one of their top concerns. \"A true patriot is someone that questions and investigates,\" says Crews, in North Carolina. Inquiry is good, says Matthew Kay, a high school English teacher in Philadelphia, but teachers should also beware: There's a difference between rich inquiry, where students have to push and pull at the evidence behind a complex idea, and what Kay calls a \"cheap trick\" of the classroom. A true patriot is someone that questions and investigates. Kristen Crews, high school American history teacher That's when a teacher divides a class in half \u2014 or students into pairs \u2014 and asks them to argue different sides of a debate in which only one side is truly supported by evidence. Kay says asking students to debate climate change this way, or whether voter fraud helped Joe Biden win the White House, \"does our kids a disservice\" because it risks creating a false equivalence in students' minds. In both cases, it's not a 50-50 debate, he says. The evidence is clear. On the matter of Trump's election fraud claims, Anton Schulzki, a high school teacher in Colorado Springs, Colo., and president of the National Council for the Social Studies, says while student inquiry is important, \"it's also our responsibility to correct mistakes\" and to be clear with students: \"'You know, the evidence points in one direction, not to another.'\" Anthony Maida, a high school teacher in Eagleville, Pa., says he too worries about teachers short-changing the facts of Jan. 6 for fear of sounding political and potentially alienating some students (and perhaps angering their parents). Maida, who is also a former Marine, says it's clear to him that what happened that day wasn't simply a protest or demonstration, but an insurrection, and he's not afraid to say so in class. \"They want you to be apolitical. But being apolitical is a political choice, right? If I look at Jan. 6 and take an apolitical stance, that signals I'm OK with it ... and I'm not.\" Maida says part of his job as a teacher of U.S. government is to \"demystify it \u2014 because that helps defend democracy.\" And that, he says, requires that he not \"sugarcoat\" the facts. Several educators say exploring this tension, over the nouns and verbs we use to label events in history, will help them frame Jan. 6 for students and put it into historical context. \"Why was Shays' Rebellion called a 'rebellion,' and why was the Boston Tea Party called a 'tea party?' \" asks Humphries of iCivics. \"Why was John Brown's Raid called a 'raid?' \" For generations, the murder of as many as 300 innocent African Americans in Tulsa, Okla., at the hands of a white mob was known as the Tulsa Race Riot. Only recently have historians, and even President Biden, embraced a more accurate label: massacre. Along the same lines, students can follow the evolution of language in news reports describing the events of Jan. 6, with outlets, including NPR, turning quickly and consistently to \"riot\" or \"insurrection\" and publicly explaining their reasoning. Fitzgerald in Chicago says other language around Jan. 6 sparked important conversations with his students, some of whom have participated in Black Lives Matter protests. He says his teens noticed, in 2020, when BLM protestors were referred to as \"thugs\" and \"looters\" who were destroying property. \"[My students] are like, 'None of those terms were ever used for people that were literally inside the Capitol of the country.' \" Nina Sethi, who teaches elementary school in Washington, D.C., says some of her young students also took notice. \"They felt like people were clearly breaking the law and endangering others when they broke into the U.S. Capitol. But the reaction they got from the police and the media and other security forces was very different from Black Lives Matter protesters.\" The organization Facing History & Ourselves has just published a new Jan. 6 lesson plan for teachers that unpacks a common word used to describe the Capitol attackers: mob. And this gets to another key takeaway for the classroom: History is made by people, and not just famous ones \u2014 in this case, Trump and Pence \u2014 but by thousands. \"Our tagline is 'People make choices and choices make history,' \" says Abby Weiss, of Facing History & Ourselves. The new lesson plan includes multiple expert perspectives on mob psychology, and asks students: Why do people choose to participate in mob violence? The lesson also includes reporting by NPR and The Washington Post on two perpetrators of the insurrection, and challenges students to think about why they may have been motivated to participate in the day's events. \"We're asking students to consider why so many people, including those who apparently had no plans to commit violence, participated in the insurrection,\" says Weiss. The lesson encourages teachers to \"invite students to reflect on how even seemingly small choices that individuals make can contribute to larger acts of injustice and violence.\" Jenny Staysniak, a high school history teacher in Sudbury, Mass., says, \"What I don't want to ever do with my students is simply demonize or paint this portrait of the other.\" She plans to ask her students to explore, \"What do we know about those who stormed the Capitol? What do we know about those who spoke out afterwards? Why do we think those actions occurred? What about those people's identities made them believe that they were making the right choices at the time?\" Nothing happens without context, and teachers tell NPR, as shocking as the events of Jan. 6 were, exploring previous precedents can help students make sense of what happened. For example: when invading British troops attacked Washington and set fire to the Capitol in 1814. The election of 1876 was arguably the most contentious in U.S. history, ending Reconstruction and setting the stage for a century of oppressive Jim Crow laws across the South. In fact, several teachers suggest they may draw parallels between those 19th-century efforts to suppress Black voting and recent moves in many state legislatures that will essentially make it harder for some citizens to vote \u2014 new rules that will, in many states, hit communities of color the hardest.",

LAUREN HODGES, BYLINE: Hannah and I had kind of embedded with this group of the Proud Boys who were just starting to make their way down to the White House rally.

We looked down Pennsylvania Avenue and saw a huge stream of people, thousands coming toward us. It happened really fast.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: The people in this house who stole this election from us hanging from a gallow out here in this lawn for the whole world to see so it never happens again. That's what needs to happen - four by four by four hanging from a rope out here from trees. BOWMAN: You guys get in on the other side? NATALIE O'BRIEN: Yeah, we got in the other side. They're in the tunnels right now. BOWMAN: Who is? O'BRIEN: Our friends. BOWMAN: On the other side of the Capitol, I met Natalie O'Brien and Chris Scalcucci of Detroit. O'BRIEN: People are taking their flagpoles and other things and were busting in the window and the other door. BOWMAN: How many people would you say got in the building? O'BRIEN: Oh, God, hundreds. I don't know. Yep. BOWMAN: What brought you here? O'BRIEN: The Republic falling and becoming corrupt and unmanageable and our vote not mattering at all whatsoever. CHRIS SCALCUCCI: Because we love our country. O'BRIEN: Yeah. SCALCUCCI: We don't want to see it fall in the hands of these evil people. The stuff that they do - it's unforgivable. BOWMAN: But what do you think of what's going on right now? O'BRIEN: I think it's more a statement than anything. I think we - our tax dollars pay for this monument, you know? This is kind of our property. BOWMAN: (Unintelligible). O'BRIEN: We have no other recourse. Yeah. We have no other recourse. BOWMAN: So where do you take it from here? SCALCUCCI: We don't know. O'BRIEN: We keep coming. SCALCUCCI: We keep fighting. O'BRIEN: We keep coming. HODGES: Last month news broke that Mark Meadows, Trump's then-chief of staff, texted with Fox News hosts on January 6. They were asking Trump to call off the riot. But later that same day, this was the story on Fox News. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LAURA INGRAHAM: Now, they were likely not all Trump supporters, and there are some reports antifa sympathizers may have been sprinkled throughout the crowd. We'll have more on that later. HODGES: And that narrative spread. BOWMAN: Lauren and I went back to the Capitol grounds in September for the Justice for J6 rally. A lot of the people we spoke with had been there on the 6, and yet they had a new story. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: And those weren't Trump supporters. BOWMAN: Who were they? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: They were all wearing - I don't know. I didn't ask them their names. But they were blacked out in gear. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: So they were black helmets, black clothes, black backpacks who started bursting the windows first. There were some Trump supporters trying to fight them off. But initially, what I saw was what looked like either BLM or antifa. HODGES: Former President Trump has repeated that narrative that his supporters didn't instigate the violence. Here he is talking to Candace Owens on December 21. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: You have BLM, and you had antifa people. I have very little doubt about that. And they were antagonizing, and they were agitating. BOWMAN: But, of course, the whole point of the Justice for J6 rally was to protest the treatment of those in custody and awaiting their trials for what they did that day. We knew who was there. HODGES: So far, more than 700 people have been charged. The defendants are largely white, and 13% of them have ties to the military or law enforcement. Over 100 of them have alleged ties to known extremist or fringe organizations such as the pro-Trump conspiracy theory QAnon, the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers and the Three Percenters, a part of the anti-government militia movement. But the bulk had no ties to extremist groups. Tampa Bay attorney Bjorn Brunvand represents several people who were at the Capitol that day, including Robert Scott Palmer, who was recently sentenced to five years in prison for assaulting law enforcement officers with a fire extinguisher, a wood plank and a flagpole. His is the longest term yet. BJORN BRUNVAND: He believed in the lies that were being professed from President Trump and his accomplices. HODGES: Brunvand says the time in jail has been eye-opening for his client. BRUNVAND: This is 100% support for President Trump and the idea that the election was fraudulent at the beginning to a recognition after he's been incarcerated that he was misled. He's sitting in a detention facility here in Washington D.C., and this big powerful former president, you know, who said meet me at the Capitol, he's too busy playing golf and has no interest in any of the guys that have been arrested. HODGES: He says Palmer took President Trump's words that day as a directive, that he was doing this for him. And now he feels abandoned. BRUNVAND: Not only did he not show up - he's not there for anyone at this point who were there and supposedly were there to save democracy and save the country, when in fact they were most likely doing quite the opposite. HODGES: But the idea of January 6 did not die with the day. The University of Chicago project on security and threats has been tracking insurrectionist sentiment in the U.S. for a year now. It found that 21 million share the same beliefs that motivated rioters that day. In other words, millions of Americans support the idea of political violence. Researchers call it an American insurrectionist movement - one that a year after the attack on the Capitol is still alive and well. Lauren Hodges. BOWMAN: Tom Bowman, NPR News, Washington.

It's been a full year since the January 6, 2021 insurrection on the U.S. Capitol, perhaps the most shocking political event of the past year \u2014 or even this generation. But has our understanding of the insurrection changed with time? Sam chats with Hannah Allam, national security reporter at The Washington Post, and Tom Dreisbach, NPR investigative correspondent, about how the U.S. government has responded to the insurrection\u2014and how we've moved from political polarization into political radicalization. This episode of 'It's Been a Minute' was produced by Jinae West, Anjuli Sastry Krbechek, Andrea Gutierrez and Liam McBain. Our intern is Nathan Pugh. Our editor is Jordana Hochman.

The reform deal is one of many parts of this year's annual defense spending bill, the National Defense Authorization Act, which also includes raises for service members and a boost to federal firefighter benefits. A deal to fund the rest of the government remains elusive. Congress is expected to pass a stop-gap measure this week in order to provide time for negotiations to continue.
