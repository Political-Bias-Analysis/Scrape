            "article_content": "After a campaign unprecedented in its divisiveness and partisanship, faith leaders face great challenges in any effort to promote reconciliation and healing.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: President Obama has said unity is important for the nation and set an example yesterday by welcoming Donald Trump to the White House. As protesters have demonstrated this week, it's still hard for many people. Some Americans may seek unity in church, but faith leaders are divided, too. Here's NPR's Tom Gjelten. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE: After insulting his opponents endlessly and offending ethnic and religious groups, a President Donald Trump could have a hard time uniting the country on his own. In the end, America may have to unify itself, led by institutions for which the work of reconciliation is a core calling, like churches. The United States is still one of the most religious countries in the world. The problem is the faith community these days is, itself, divided. On one side or the white evangelicals, 80 percent of whom supported Trump, according to exit polls. Anne Graham Lotz, Billy Graham's daughter, prayed that Trump would be elected, and she now looks to God to heal the country. ANNE GRAHAM LOTZ: God has heard our prayer. He's answered our pray because God loves America. I know that he does. And as Mr. Trump governs in accordance with the values and principles that made this nation great, then God will bless America, and that's good for everybody. GJELTEN: On the other side are those liberal Christians for whom opposition to Trump was an article of faith. They believe God is on their side. About two dozen of them prayed together over the phone on the night after the election, and some of their prayers had a pretty political tone. JIM WALLIS: Lord have mercy. GJELTEN: Here's Jim Wallis, founder of the Sojourners Christian community. WALLIS: We ask you, Lord, to replace the white-identity politics that dominated this election with a faith-identity politics, which is our only faithful future. GJELTEN: It can be argued that pro-Trump conservative Christians, with their narrow focus on abortion and marriage issues, neglect other parts of the gospel message, like the importance of tending to the poor and the foreigner. But another argument is that liberals have unnecessarily alienated conservatives by dismissing their anxiety about growing secularism in American culture. Russell Moore, who heads the Ethics and Religious Liberty program for the Southern Baptist Convention, thinks politics has become too elevated in the nation's life. He was a critic of Donald Trump's candidacy, but his concern in this post-election period is that politics has, itself, become almost a religion. RUSSELL MOORE: Politics can't be that. And so I think what we're going to have to have right now is a cultural renewal that is rooted in something far greater than - than politics and ideology and arguments on cable news. GJELTEN: Faith leaders, he says, need to offer a moral compass on a whole spectrum of issues from the abortion and divorce culture to racism in order to help the nation regain its footing. No disagreement there from Bishop David Zubik of Pittsburgh, who presides over Roman Catholic parishes in western Pennsylvania, where Donald Trump ran strong. Zubik says he witnessed the ugliness this campaign season. And in the coming weeks, he wants Christians to reconsider their neighbors and try to see in them the person of Jesus. DAVID ZUBIK: Guess who's going to be looking at me across the table or who's going to be riding with me on the bus or who's going to be the person who's driving in the next lane next to me. And I think if we start looking for the person of Christ in others, then maybe that can be the first step to healing for a nation that has become so severely divided over so many things. GJELTEN: Increasingly, those other people will be non-white. They may be of another religion or no religion at all. Some will be immigrants. Some will be liberals. Some will be Trump supporters. They're likely to need help dealing with their differences. And this country's religious leaders could have an especially important role to play. Tom Gjelten, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

It was Nov. 4, 2008. My birthday. Election Day. I made my way uptown to Harlem, where my friend Rakia was going to be watching the election returns with friends. I almost never wanted to go uptown \u2014 from Brooklyn, it may as well have been a trip to Guam \u2014 but that night I felt that I really, really needed to be in Harlem. There were about eight of us, all brown, posted up in Rakia's living room, eating pizza and tweeting and watching the news coverage. When CNN called the presidential race around 11 p.m., a bunch of folks from other buildings in the neighborhood rushed out into the street and began cheering: \"OOOOOBAAAAAMAAAAAA!!!!\" Code Switch wants to hear from you:When you look ahead at race relations in the U.S. post-election, what do you see? Let us know. Barack Obama was going to be the 44th president of the United States. On TV, everyone in Chicago's Grant Park was cheering. Everyone outside on the Harlem streets was cheering. Everyone in Rakia's third-floor walkup was cheering. She looked at me and the other brother there and wanted to hear deep thoughts about this moment. \"Come on, black man!\" she said. \"Say something.\" Neither he nor I did. I was transfixed by the TV, blubbering like Jesse Jackson. On the long cab ride back to Brooklyn, there were people out all over the city celebrating, dancing and waving flags. The next day, YouTube was full of videos of joyous young New Yorkers clogging the streets, waving huge flags and singing the national anthem. I watched those clips and got choked up. This full-throated patriotism business was fun as hell, I thought. I could get used to it. Those of us inclined to pessimism about America's racial realities \u2014 and here, dear reader, is where I raise my hand \u2014 had to find some way of metabolizing this new, confounding data point. Damn, I thought. Maybe I need to rethink a bunch of what I understood to be true about this country. Perhaps we hadn't seriously considered the history that we wanted Obama's election to correct, but maybe we had the imagination to try. I felt genuinely hopeful. There were large swaths of America that were not on TV that night. There was not very much cheering, even as the white people in those places, we would later learn, were feeling similarly vertiginous. Maybe they were rethinking a bunch of what they understood to be true about this country, too. And that feeling seems to have gained momentum over the past eight years. You could hear it from the woman in Montana who told my Code Switch teammate Shereen Marisol Meraji that she was terrified of illegal immigrants and Muslims, even as she lived in an overwhelmingly white town with almost none of either. You could see it in the mainstreaming of the \"alt-right\" over the past year, the nebulous phobias and anxieties that were irritated in no small part by Obama's omnipresence. My old pessimism about America's willingness to grapple with its racist history has long since come back to me, even before the rancor and ugliness of the 2016 election cycle. That pessimism sits next to an understanding that symbolic victories \u2014 like, say, representation in our highest offices \u2014 still matter. But that symbolism tended to paper over something that is more plainly visible today \u2014 a toxic racial animus that has long been swaddled in euphemism. This election didn't create or resolve it. It's all hanging out there now, and I fear the viability of America is at risk. So now I toss it out to you, readers: When you look forward from here, what do you see? We want to hear from you. Let us know below.",

Americans spilled into the streets Saturday for a new day of protests against Trump, even as he appeared to back away from the fiery rhetoric that propelled him to the White House. There was a time when some people thought President Obama's election ushered in a post-racial America. Nobody is saying that now. Obama's administration was marked by protests against police shootings, among other events. Donald Trump questioned Obama's birth certificate for years, and now, after a profoundly divisive campaign, is preparing to replace Obama in the White House. Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery has witnessed a lot of this. Lowrey, whose new book is called They Can't Kill Us All, covered unrest after a police shooting in Ferguson, Mo., and the death of Freddie Gray who'd been arrested in Baltimore. On how conversations about race are different now than they were a week ago I think the conversations we're having today about race and will continue to be having about race have sparked a new sense of urgency. One thing that was remarkable about the election of President Obama was that he did so with a rhetoric and with an ideal that we were not a divided America. It's fundamental to his ideology of American exceptionalism. What's been remarkable is that Donald Trump ran on an ideology and a platform that we are in fact a divided America, that there is an us vs. them, that we need to take something back from people who have seized it from us. It speaks in many ways to the Newtonian every-action-has-an-equal-and-opposite-reaction [law]. Ferguson, Baltimore, and a New Era in America's Racial Justice Movement by Wesley Lowery Hardcover, 248 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? On how some voters would argue that it is Obama who is divisive That is not unlike the conversation we've had on race for the entirety of our history. When you go back ... and read interviews [about the lynchings of black people by white mobs] of the white residents who lived in the town that had just lynched a black man the day before, it was the media that didn't understand them: This wasn't really about race. Why is no one upset about the crime that guy committed? Why is everyone upset that we strung him up in the town square? These have been the contours of our conversation for the entirety of our existence because, as the president himself says very often, our American existence is very largely premised on an original sin of slavery. We have baked in these ideas to the fundamental structures of our society. President Obama himself was never going to be someone to usher in that type of post-racial reality. That wasn't something that was ever going to happen, and I think that part of our fallacy of understanding and thinking was expecting that in the first place. On the idea that not all Trump supporters are racist though they supported him even with his racially tinged rhetoric I don't accept the premise. To begin with, what we know is that human beings harbor prejudice. I think one of the fundamental battle lines in this conversation is: Do you believe that racism requires intent or do you believe that racism is about the outcome, the effect, that if a policy has the effect of racism, of creating a racial disparity, is that accurately described as racist \u2013 or does it require someone actively desiring to oppress a certain group of people? I think that is a part of this battle line we've seen. We see a lot of white Americans and certainly Trump supporters who would argue, \"No, I don't have hate in my heart for people who aren't like me.\" And you see the left \u2014 and largely the Black Lives Matter protest movement and many of the forces that have been driving this conversation for eight years under Obama \u2014 who would argue that no, racism and prejudice are what occurs when, whether intentional or not, a structure or system is put in place that leaves one group of people behind. On questioning whether voting matters, given that having a black president hasn't police shootings of unarmed black men \"I voted twice for Barack Obama and Trayvon Martin is still dead. I canvassed for Barack Obama, the Charleston Nine are still dead, Dylan Roof still shot up that church.\" These are the types of things we heard from ... activists and demonstrators [while researching the book]. There are certainly activists who didn't vote in 2016, because I think that there's a grapple: How do you effect change and what does political power look like? One of the things that I think is remarkable is this idea that a black presidency showed us the limitations of a black presidency. Of course a black presidency couldn't usher us in a post-racial world, we now deeply understand, but we couldn't comprehend the limitation upfront.",

Researchers seeking to predict how Americans will vote have for years identified an important clue: The more religious you are, the more likely you are to lean Republican. Conversations with more than two-dozen self-identified \"faith\" voters in Boone, N.C., suggest that pattern is holding this year, even while revealing the same high level of voter disenchantment evident across the country. \"I've always felt that the Republicans align with my beliefs,\" said Judith Martinez, 51, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Mexico. An evangelical Christian who leads the Spanish-language ministry at Mount Vernon Baptist Church in Boone, Martinez's opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage are decisive factors in determining which party and candidate to support. \"The Bible is very clear in telling us the way we should live,\" she said, \"and we are not respecting that.\" She expects to vote for Donald Trump. Among Hispanic voters, Martinez is in a minority. A recent ABC/Washington Post poll showed Republican candidate Donald Trump trailing Hillary Clinton by 25 to 40 points among Hispanic voters in various battleground states. That advantage, however, may diminish when religious beliefs are considered. Voting analyses carried out by the Pew Research Center on the basis of exit poll data in the 2000, 2004 and 2008 elections identified a strong correlation between religiosity and Republicanism. \"How often you attend church services is at least a good predictor [of how you vote] as your level of education, your gender, your age, your union membership, or the region where you live,\" said Alan Cooperman, Pew's director of religion research. \"The only thing stronger is race.\" (The recent ABC/Washington Post poll showed Trump drawing only about 5 percent of the African-American vote, regardless of religious affiliation.) How often you attend church services is at least a good predictor [of how you vote] as your level of education, your gender, your age, your union membership, or the region where you live. Alan Cooperman, director of religion research, Pew Research Center The pro-Trump \"faith\" voters interviewed in Boone, a small city in the western Carolina mountains, have decidedly mixed feelings about his candidacy, however. Judith Martinez says her religious beliefs ultimately may dictate a vote for Trump, but she is deeply troubled by his harsh characterization of Mexican immigrants. \"He's very crude,\" Martinez says. \"Mexicans are some of the people here who work the hardest. He doesn't value their efforts.\" Nationwide, nearly half of Trump's supporters are \"very enthusiastic\" about his candidacy, according to the ABC/Washington Post poll, with about a third of Clinton supporters saying the same of her. Of the religious voters interviewed in Boone, however, not one was a hard-core supporter of either Trump or Clinton. \"I will not vote for anybody,\" said Jack Lawrence, 67, a retired optometrist and founding member of an interdenominational church in Boone called The Heart. \"I will cast a vote, but it will not be for anybody. It will be a negative vote.\" In his case, he says, it will be a vote against Clinton. Lawrence was one of six members of The Heart congregation who agreed to meet with NPR to discuss how their Christian commitments are influencing their thinking about this year's presidential election. Three were undecided, including Kristine Martin, 36, who moved to Boone two years ago when her husband took a position at Samaritan's Purse, the evangelical Christian charity founded by Franklin Graham. \"It's a scary election for me,\" Martin says. \"There's part of me that wants to check out.\" NAACP volunteers Marjorie McKinney (left) and Joan Brannon sit at a booth to register people to vote at the Hospitality House, a community shelter in Boone, N.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Marisa Penaloza/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption NAACP volunteers Marjorie McKinney (left) and Joan Brannon sit at a booth to register people to vote at the Hospitality House, a community shelter in Boone, N.C. All six Heart members describe their Christian beliefs as central to their lives. \"That's where we find our identity, first and foremost,\" said David Cuthbert, 41, chief executive officer of Wine to Water, an organization in Boone that promotes access to clean water around the world. \"At the end of the day,\" he says, \"it's what shapes every aspect of our lives.\" That commitment, however, may be of little help in guiding the election decisions at The Heart this year. Cuthbert says he remains undecided. One of the two Heart members leaning to Clinton, 35-year-old Dejah Miranda-Huxley, says her preference is a reaction to what she sees as Trump's \"exclusivist\" attitude toward minorities and immigrants. \"Neither side reflects my faith,\" she said.

Whether the Republican advantage among religious voters in places like Boone will hold in future elections is unclear. Renee Miller, 34, who was raised in a strict Pentecostal household near Boone, found her loyalty to the Republican Party challenged after going through a yearlong addiction treatment program at Hospitality House, a community shelter in Boone serving people in the midst of poverty-related crises. \"I came here homeless and pregnant and addicted to drugs,\" Miller says. \"This place has been really helpful as far as getting treatment. I now have a healthy baby, a beautiful little girl, and I'm a completely different person.\" A registered Republican, she attributes her political identity largely to her religious upbringing. \"I definitely want a leader who believes in God,\" she says. A year at Hospitality House, however, has left her unsure of her political loyalties going forward. \"At this point, I would probably vote for Trump,\" she says, \"because I just have a lot of mistrust for Hillary.\" But she is not convinced her instincts are entirely correct. \"Being in this position has made me rethink my political values,\" she said. \"People ask me why I'm Republican, when it's the Democratic Party that mostly supports programs like this that help people. I'm conflicted.\" As are many religious voters in Boone, and voters around the country.",

But Donald Trump wants them to go further: Get out and vote, and then stake out polling places to watch for cheating. At a Friday campaign event in Altoona, Pa., the Republican presidential nominee said voting might not be enough for him to win. \"The only way we can lose, in my opinion \u2014 I really mean this \u2014 in Pennsylvania, is if cheating goes on,\" Trump said. \"We have to call up law enforcement. And we have to have the sheriffs and the police chiefs and everybody watching.\" He wanted the voters themselves to get involved as well. \"I hope you people can sort of not just vote on the 8th, go around and look and watch other polling places, and make sure that it's 100 percent fine,\" Trump said. These weren't just off-the-cuff remarks for Trump. On his campaign website, you can sign up to \"volunteer to be a Trump election observer.\" Critics have decried his call to voters as voter intimidation, which is illegal. This looks like a sign-up sheet for an Election Day goon squad. Our elders know about this kind of \u201cobservation.\u201d pic.twitter.com/rEtWDA4BhH If his remarks are found to be voter intimidation and if Trump is deemed an agent of the Republican National Committee, it would also violate a consent decree banning the RNC from such activity. That decree, which has been in place since 1982, was ordered in response to claims of voter intimidation against minorities in the 1970s and '80s, according to Politico's Josh Gerstein. The consent decree states that the RNC must \"refrain from undertaking any ballot security activities in polling places or election districts where the racial or ethnic composition of such districts is a factor in the decision\" to monitor those areas. It allows normal poll watching, like rallying supporters to vote, but not anything aimed at voter suppression, like posting armed guards at polling locations or questioning people in an intimidating way before they vote. \"It's possible Trump is trying to use this as a fundraising ploy to get people's names,\" says Richard Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine. \"If that's what this is, I'd be relieved, but he's playing with fire here.\" To be clear, liberals love to throw out the voter intimidation card. What we're advocating are open, fair and honest elections. Trump Spokesman Jason Miller, in a statement The U.S. Supreme Court rejected the RNC's plea to remove the decree in 2013, but added an expiration date of Dec. 1, 2017. If Trump is violating the decree, the DNC could ask for an extension of up to eight years, according to Hasen. Trump spokesman Jason Miller says claims that volunteer poll observers could be a form of voter intimidation are unfounded. \"To be clear, liberals love to throw out the voter intimidation card. What we're advocating are open, fair and honest elections,\" Miller said in a statement to NPR's Sarah McCammon. He also added that poll watchers are \"standard for professional campaigns\" and pointed out poll watcher guides from around the country, including New York and Texas. In his statement to NPR, Miller echoed Trump's concerns about a \"rigged system.\" \"As we've seen from Crooked Hillary's willingness to use \u2014 and outright lie about \u2014 government institutions for personal and political enrichment, there's a lot of cheating going on,\" Miller said. It's notable that Trump made these remarks in Pennsylvania. It's a key state he'll need to win in November, but Hillary Clinton has a big lead over Trump there. And according to a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, Trump is getting zero percent of the black vote in the state. Pennsylvania also notably struck down a voter ID law in 2014, a fact that Trump said was \"shocking\" in his Friday speech. Voter ID laws have long been criticized as a masked strategy to discourage minorities from voting. Last month, a federal appeals court threw out a voter ID law in North Carolina that, as Judge Diana Gribbon Motz wrote, targets \"African-Americans with almost surgical precision.\" Trump's suggestion that the election will be rigged is one he keeps making, even though proven cases of voter fraud are actually very rare. As of 2014, a law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who has spent years tracking fraud allegations had found only 31 instances of voter fraud out of more than 1 billion votes cast. In the absence of a Pennsylvania ID law that might deter certain voters, Trump's call to action could be seen as another strategy to deter voters: voter intimidation. And unlike voter fraud, voter intimidation has been a problem historically. It's what the RNC consent decree is trying to prevent, and it's not restricted to the GOP. During the 2008 election in Philadelphia, two members of the New Black Panther Movement were charged with voter intimidation after they stationed themselves outside of polling locations. The Department of Justice later dropped the case, which led to criticism that the Obama administration was unwilling to prosecute the black men for civil rights violations.",

The flamboyant, thrice-married mogul has never been an easy fit with the religious right. A newspaper correspondent observing Abraham Lincoln's second inauguration in March 1865 \u2014 delivered to a crowd \"as far as the eye could reach\" \u2014 noted that the president laid his right hand on a Bible and, facing Supreme Court Chief Justice Salmon Chase, swore to preserve, protect and defend the U.S. Constitution. \"Then,\" the reporter noted, \"solemnly repeating 'So help me God!' he bent forward and reverently kissed the Book.\" It was the first documented eyewitness account of a U.S. president asking for God's assistance at his inauguration. While the oath of office is laid out in the Constitution, it includes no reference to God. The founders barred any religious requirement for the office. The words \"so help me God\" have nevertheless become the standard conclusion of the oath. U.S. presidents have long understood that their fellow citizens want them to show some humility and demonstrate a faith in God as they perform their duties. Most have felt the need to attend church on occasion, talk of prayer and seek the counsel of ministers, if only for the sake of appearances. \"In the United States, religion serves as a proxy for morality,\" says Randall Balmer, a historian of religion at Dartmouth College. \"What we as voters want to know is that our presidential candidates have some sort of moral center or moral compass, and we really don't know how to ask the question other than to say, 'Are you religious?' \" This expectation of presidential religiosity, however, is being tested with the candidacy of thrice-married Donald Trump, who mangles his references to the Bible, says he doesn't often need forgiveness and when asked what he thought about Jesus, managed only to say he respected him \"in terms of bravery and in terms of courage.\" In the modern era, Balmer says, \"I think he would be the first president who really makes no credible claims to religiosity.\" By contrast, Hillary Clinton refers regularly to her devout Methodist upbringing and talks of her rootedness in the social gospel associated with the liberal wing of that church. Hillary Clinton has often emphasized her Methodist upbringing on the campaign trail. Here she speaks during church services at Greater St. Paul Church in Oakland, Calif., on June 5.\n                \n                    \n                    Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption For a Republican especially, Trump's lack of religious credentials is significant. Ronald Reagan's election in 1980 was boosted by his alliance with a newly formed Christian group calling itself the Moral Majority, and Republican candidates since then have gone out of their way to court Christian support. The evangelical vote remains important enough that Donald Trump felt the need to meet with conservative Christian leaders last week in New York. His awkwardness among religious leaders, however, clearly came through. The meeting was officially closed to the press, but some attendees recorded Trump's remarks and shared them on Twitter or elsewhere. In those recordings Trump does not mention the Bible or Jesus Christ. He calls himself a \"tremendous believer\" but doesn't say what exactly he believes in, other than himself and his own success. \"Christianity, I owe so much to it in so many ways \u2014 through life, through having incredible children,\" he told the group, without explaining what he meant. \"But I also owe it ... frankly ... because the evangelical vote was mostly gotten by me.\" To its credit, Christianity had made him a winner. As for prayer, Trump said, \"Pray for everyone. But what you really have to do is, you have to pray to get everybody out to vote, for one specific person. And we can't be politically correct and say, 'We pray for all our leaders,' because all of your leaders are selling Christianity down the tubes.\" Many of the people at the meeting came away with positive impressions of Trump, but that feeling is hardly universal among evangelicals. \"I think he is without a moral core,\" says Michael Farris, an ordained Baptist minister and one of the founders of the Moral Majority. Farris is now chancellor of Patrick Henry College in Purcellville, Va., and an activist in the home schooling movement. \"He doesn't keep his word in his business transactions,\" Farris says. \"He ridicules people. He doesn't believe anything about treating his neighbor better than himself. I mean, that's what the Bible teaches. We just don't see any semblance of honesty, decency, integrity.\" In a commentary for the Christian Post, Farris wrote that the evangelicals' meeting with Trump in New York \"marks the end of the Christian Right.\" He is dismayed by the extent of support Trump is getting from his fellow Christians. \"We have evangelical leaders saying, 'We're going to support this guy anyway,' \" he tells NPR. \"It means our principles don't mean anything at all.\" It may mean more than that. The country may no longer be demanding God-fearing presidents. \"Americans, I think, are looking for something else in their presidential candidates these days,\" says historian Balmer. A willingness to speak plainly, perhaps, even without religious overtones.",

At long last \u2014 the first episode of the Code Switch podcast! We decided to start off with a question we've been fixated on over the past few months: Why is it so hard to talk about whiteness? As we were trying to work this stuff out, we asked folks on Twitter if they'd ever taken a critical whiteness studies class in college \u2014 and yes, that's a thing \u2014 and we got a hundred variations of the same joke: I went to Indiana University \u2014 that whole experience was a graduate-level course in white people! Or: Is that, like, a full semester dedicated to Wes Anderson movies? Or even: And here I thought everything in American life is already about white people! That response wasn't too surprising. Nell Irvin Painter, the historian and author of \"The History of White People,\" once wrote that since we don't have very useful language around white identity, we mostly talk about it as a kind of empty space, defined by what it's not. This episode, we spoke to: \"Whiteness is on a toggle switch between 'bland nothingness,' and 'racist hatred,'\" she wrote. (Our own Kat Chow has made this point about the word \"vanilla\" \u2014 even metaphors for whiteness are, er, colored by the notion that they lack dimension or flavor, due to being so ubiquitous.) So, let's all agree that it's really hard to grapple with whiteness, both due to the slipperiness of the concept itself, and also thanks to the almost visceral discomfort people have with talking about white identity. The problem is, by shying away from talking about whiteness, we also fail to understand the profound ways that whiteness shapes our culture and politics. And right now, in a crazy election cycle when folks' feelings about their own white identities is a strong predictor of how they're likely to vote, that's especially dangerous. And that, y'all, is what we're taking up on our inaugural episode: how we talk (and don't talk about whiteness), and why it's really important we figure out how.",

Speaking to the graduating class of Washington, D.C.'s Howard University, President Obama emphasized that his election hasn't created a \"post-racial society\" despite improved race relations. Stressing the need to keep pushing for change, he gave the students at the historically black university impassioned advice on how to \"shape our collective future.\" Chief among that advice: Vote, \"not just some of the time but all of the time.\" He added: \"When we don't vote we give away our power.\" You can watch the full speech here: He described the university as a \"centerpiece of African-American intellectual life, and a central part of our larger American story.\" Arguing that the U.S. \u2014 and the world \u2014 is a \"better place\" than when he graduated from college in the early 1980s, he said there is still work to be done, citing employment, achievement and justice gaps for African-Americans. \"Be confident in your heritage. Be confident in your blackness,\" he told the graduates. \"There's no one way to be black. Take it from somebody who's seen both sides of the debate about whether I'm black enough.\" Obama told the graduates to remember the ties that connect African-Americans: \"That is our particular awareness of injustice, and unfairness, and struggle. ... That means we cannot sleepwalk through life. ... \"We have cousins, and uncles, and brothers, and sisters, who we remember were just as smart and just as talented as we were but somehow got ground down by structures that were unfair and unjust, and that means we have to not only question the world as it is, and stand up for those African-Americans who haven't been so lucky.\" That empathy should extend to \"all people who are struggling,\" he said. Finally, he advised the grads that creating change requires organization and strategy. That strategy has to include voting, Obama added: \"People try to make this political thing really complicated ... you know what? Just vote. It's math. If you have more votes than the other guy, you get to do what you want.\" Moreover, he said change requires compromise and \"listening to those with whom you disagree.\" As The Washington Post reports, \"The president was kicking off a series of three commencement addresses, which will continue at Rutgers University in New Jersey and the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs.\" The newspaper adds: \"His appearance at Howard, urging the graduates to embrace the future, came as he is becoming more reflective as his presidency winds down.\" Check out NPR's rundown of great commencement speeches for two more from Obama, and many others.",

In many of today's newsrooms, women and journalists of color remain a sliver of those producing and reporting stories. According to studies from the American Society of News Editors, the Women's Media Center and the advocacy group VIDA, gender and ethnic diversity in newsrooms have hardly improved in the last decade despite increasing demand for more inclusive journalism in the current round-the-clock news cycle. Nationally, Hispanic, black and Asian women make up less than 5 percent of newsroom personnel at traditional print and online news publications, according to 2016 data from the American Society of News Editors. The organization stopped requiring that news outlets reveal their identities in an attempt to increase participation in the yearly census. Numbers from 433 news organizations that participated in 2015 and 2016 show a 5.6 percent increase in the minority workforce, now at 17 percent at print and online news sites. But the numbers lag far behind demographic shifts in a country where nearly 40 percent of Americans are part of a minority group. Around the country, local newsrooms remain largely white by most measures. (In the spirit of full disclosure, NPR's latest diversity figures can be found here.) In March, the Women's Media Center released its annual report on gender representation in the media (print bylines, internet, broadcast and other outlets). The latest numbers show a tiny change \u2014 37.7 percent of the news was credited to female journalists, according to an analysis of over 24,000 pieces of news content. Major national outlets continue to be dominated by men, and women actually lost representation in broadcast news television. In a 2015 survey by the group VIDA: Women of the Literary Arts, magazines with a focus on news and culture, such as The New Yorker, The New Republic and Harper's, don't fare any better. VIDA's numbers show that women of color (and minorities in general) are virtually absent from the political commentary and investigative journalism these magazines provide. Though nearly 20 percent of the country's population is Hispanic, very few of these publications had a single VIDA respondent self-report as Hispanic. The implications of this generalized absence are manifold, and begin at the storytelling level. A September 2016 piece by Lonnae O'Neal in The Undefeated, a site that covers how sports, race and culture intersect, described how NFL Network reporter Steve Wyche \u2014 one of the country's leading African American national sports reporters \u2014 covered the story of Colin Kaepernick's refusal to stand for the national anthem as an act of protest. His refusal, Wyche learned, formed part of a larger outcry over police violence against black men and women. Initial reports by other outlets focused on Kaepernick as divisive and a potential distraction in the locker room. For O'Neal, who analyzed the coverage with a racial lens, the Kaepernick story raised questions \"about why the country is more brown than ever but mainstream journalism is so white.\" O'Neal herself rose through the ranks as a Washington Post reporter and columnist for 24 years before joining The Undefeated. She sees her race as providing an added edge in stadiums filled with mostly black players. \"Because I'm experienced, because I'm a woman, and because I'm African American, I can go right up to people and find an entry, a portal, a way to talk without layers and layers of translation,\" she said. Her common background with her sources, the \"cultural resonance\" between them, won't always carry the day, \"but it goes a long way.\" For O'Neal, hiring women, minorities and generally journalists of diverse backgrounds is not a luxury or a matter of \"different optics,\" or political expedience, as recruiters typically approach the matter, but essential to the profession's mission and longevity. A typical white, male-centric newsroom, means critical stories will continue to go unreported and news analysis will remain unbalanced. \"We need new and different lenses, people of different backgrounds thinking at the table. We'll only be richer for having that. Why is it so hard to set as an intention? Because many folks are going to be uncomfortable with what that looks like,\" O'Neal said. In the meantime, old narratives about race and identity don't change. Latinos are mostly U.S.-born and consist of dozens of sub-groups. But, says Dana Mastro, a professor in the department of communication at the University of California in Santa Barbara, they're seen only in one frame \u2014 immigration. \"The idea that there are other narratives just doesn't pan out,\" said Mastro, who researches racial and ethnic stereotyping in the media with a particular interest in Latinos. \"It's immigration and almost entirely threat-driven,\" she said. \"You just don't see other themes emerge, and Latinos are almost exclusively portrayed as undocumented Mexicans,\" she added. But without fundamental shifts in the news industry's modus operandi, simply hiring minorities won't change that, says Alex T. Williams, a doctoral candidate at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication, who studies media trends. \"The norms of journalism, and the routines of news organizations, are deeply ingrained,\" he wrote in an email. \"Expecting a handful (or often less) of non-white employees to improve news coverage places a lot of pressure on them \u2014 when it likely requires a larger commitment from the entire newsroom or organization. If we hope to see more widespread change, the commitment needs to be a lot deeper than 'diversity hiring.'\" Williams' research, published in the Columbia Journalism Review, also challenges the old view that persists in some places in the industry that a lack of qualified minority candidates is the problem. Using data from Grady College's Annual Surveys of Journalism and Mass Communication, Williams found a hiring disparity between white and non-white journalism graduates. Women of color, Williams added, referencing data from the American Society of News Editors, have been hit harder by recent layoffs in the news industry than any other group. The result for many journalists of color even at the top of their game is a fraught isolation and blatant stereotyping. Between 2009 and 2015, the number of black women in newsrooms dropped from 1,181 to 730; the number of Latinas in newsrooms dropped from 840 to 584; and the number of Asian American women dropped from 758 to 466. Indira S. Somani, a former television news producer who teaches in the department of media, journalism and film at Howard University, recently co-authored an unpublished study currently in the peer-review phase at an academic journal that looked at the professional challenges faced by African-American journalists working at ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN and FOX. She conducted in-depth interviews with 23 news producers, correspondents, anchors and assignment editors, both men and women, to whom she granted anonymity in order to get answers that were as candid and open as possible. Somani offered insights from her interviews without drawing any specific conclusions prior to completing the peer-review process. \"One of the people I talked to, a national correspondent, says she tried to make people she works with forget that she's black,\" Somani said. The subject described suppressing \"certain things\" in order to be seen \"as a human being,\" Somani said, quoting the subject. \"I know there's a barrier there,\" Somani quoted the woman as saying, \"But I don't want to draw attention to the barrier.\" Subjects often described receiving unwanted comments about their hairstyle and choice of clothes. They also described ambivalence about being confined to covering \"the black story.\" \"There's a frustration and appreciation in that,\" said Somani, who tries to prepare her mostly African-American students for an evolving profession. \"People are frustrated because they don't want to be assigned a story just because they're black. At the same time they realize they'll do justice to it.\" Without a wider range of reporters and a more layered approach to big stories, O'Neal says, the public's understanding is impoverished. Just one example she cites \u2014 the disproportionate impact of deep cuts in retail jobs on low-income women, particularly women of color, is not addressed much in major news outlets. \"When we talk job loss, the rust belt gets elegiacs,\" O'Neal wrote in an email after a phone interview. But the layoffs of thousands of retail workers is described as \"'creative destruction at its best,'\" with little probing. Somani and O'Neal emphasize that a diverse, institutionally supported corps of journalists takes time and vision to build. That includes the sort of advocacy and mentoring \u2014 old fashioned talent nurturing \u2014 that often eludes young minority journalists even before they get their degrees. As a news producer at a major network, Somani remembers being \"one of six people of color in the entire building, including the custodial staff.\" She loved the work, but had no mentors and tried to keep a steady focus as white, male executives promoted white producers. \"It was not a supportive environment at all for women and minorities at all,\" she remembers. O'Neal is grateful to her mentors during her career, editors who were all women or people of color. \"There's real power in somebody having a greater imagination for you than you do, who can make things happen,\" said O'Neal. \"The thinking goes that people will just bubble up and navigate their way to where they need to be,\" she said, disputing classical liberal notions of a meritocracy that prizes talent and perseverance. \"That's not enough in any field of human endeavor. You have to be seen, mentored nurtured. The patriarchal message is that with enough luck and individual pluck, things will happen. But it takes real intention. Do we want to leave coverage of the United States to luck?\" Tal Abbady's writing has appeared in several national publications.",

            "article_content": "A Mexican-American family considers how differences in generations, citizenship and upbringing affect what it means to be American, and how that's evolved during the Obama administration.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: We're about to bring you the first in an occasional series of stories that we'll be hearing over the next several months from our colleagues at NPR's Code Switch Team. That's our team reporting on race, culture and identity. Here in the studio is Code Switch's Adrian Florido.  Hey, Adrian. ADRIAN FLORIDO, BYLINE: Hey, David. GREENE: So let me just start with the title of the series. You're calling it \"The Obama Effect.\" Why is that? FLORIDO: Yeah, that's right. Well, the idea we wanted to get at was this. When President Obama was elected in 2008, there was all this talk about his election ushering in a new era of racial harmony in the U.S. And clearly, that didn't happen, right? You just have to look around to see that racial tension is alive and well in this country. But at the same time, as a nation we seem to be having much more open, nuanced conversations about race than we did before Obama's presidency. GREENE: And I suppose some questions about whether those different conversations are because you've had the nation's first black president or maybe some of the events that have happened. You know, I think of Ferguson; I think of Freddie Gray's death in Baltimore. A lot of things have triggered sort of conversation. FLORIDO: Yeah, and so what we're trying to do with this series is to explore how people in different communities of color all across the country are talking about race, and how that's changed over the last eight years, and whether Obama's presidency had anything to do with it - to what extent those events you just referenced had to do with it. And I started in San Francisco. GREENE: And why there? FLORIDO: Well, I went there because there was this big protest happening earlier this spring. Students were demanding more funding for the school's ethnic studies department - that's a field that focuses on the histories and contributions of people of color in the U.S. GREENE: This was at, like, at a college campus? FLORIDO: Yeah - oh, I'm sorry - yeah, this is at San Francisco State University. And so these are the black, Asian and Latino-American histories you don't really find in high school textbooks. And I went to this protest with Pablo Ramirez. He's a senior. PABLO RAMIREZ: We are the people. A little bit louder. We want justice for ethnic studies. FLORIDO: He is from Los Angeles. His parents are Mexican immigrants. And he'll be the first person in his family to earn a college degree. And one of the first classes he took in college was an ethnic studies course. P. RAMIREZ: And it really was the spark that lit the flame to just understand my history as a Latino male. FLORIDO: Before that, Pablo always thought of race as a black and white thing. When he started learning about Mexican-American protest movements and other civil rights struggles, he started noticing race in his own life - especially when he'd go back to LA to visit his parents. P. RAMIREZ: Noticing that my mother would be called wetback, noticing that people would say, like, oh, she's an idiot because she doesn't know English - oh, she's lazy. FLORIDO: But Pablo says when he would try to point these slights out to his parents, they'd warn him not to, saying things like... P. RAMIREZ: ...Oh, you don't need to talk about race. And I'm like, I'm not here to play nice to these ignorant people. I'm here to stand up for myself and my family and my heritage. FLORIDO: Pablo is an American. And he wants to be treated like one. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Thirty-one through 40. FLORIDO: Still, when he boards a Greyhound bus to head home for spring break, he's got three forms of ID - one from his school, his passport and his drivers license, even though he's a U.S.-born citizen. P. RAMIREZ: Because if you just look at me, I'm just a Latino male. I may or may not be undocumented. And my parents and I are scared that they'll just profile me and whisk me off. FLORIDO: Pablo gets home early the next morning. MARIA RAMIREZ: (Speaking Spanish). FLORIDO: His family owns a small stucco house in South LA. Its paint is a faded pink. His dad's got chickens in the back. When he walks in, his mom's making coffee. His parents and his older brother and sister, they sit and talk with me for a little bit. P. RAMIREZ: (Speaking Spanish). FLORIDO: Pablo's dad, Daniel, crossed the border illegally in the early '80s to work. His mom, Maria, came a little later. DANIEL RAMIREZ: (Speaking Spanish). FLORIDO: Mr. Ramirez says they'd only planned to come for a couple of years and then go home. But as so often happens to immigrants with this plan - well, life happens. They had kids. Their kids started school, started learning English, started growing up American. And at some point, Mr. Ramirez says they realized they couldn't really go back. In 1986, they got amnesty under Ronald Reagan. And in the late '90s, they decided to finally become citizens. Still, they've never felt truly American. M. RAMIREZ: (Speaking Spanish). FLORIDO: Mrs. Ramirez says for them, being American is more about respecting U.S. laws and knowing those laws also protect them. This feeling that even though they're U.S. citizens, it isn't really their country - this seems to get at the heart of this tension Pablo has felt with his parents, pushing them to be more assertive, but them resigning themselves to sort of second-class treatment. Mr. Ramirez chimes in. DANIEL RAMIREZ: (Speaking Spanish). FLORIDO: \"It's like if I go to a restaurant,\" he says, \"if I'm standing next to an American woman, she'll get served first.\" By the way, by American, he means white. (Speaking Spanish). I asked what he does when that happens. DANIEL RAMIREZ: (Speaking Spanish). FLORIDO: \"Nothing,\" he says, \"because you think, oh, I don't come here that often. So you just kind of take it in stride.\" His wife says there was a moment when this feeling of not really belonging sort of changed to her. It was when Barack Obama was elected. M. RAMIREZ: (Speaking Spanish). FLORIDO: She says she had never seen so many young brown people go to the polls. \"Obama felt like a president for us,\" she says. The family had hoped Obama would deliver immigration reform. But it never came. And his administration has deported two and a half million people. Anti-immigrant rhetoric is at a fever pitch. Maria doesn't blame Obama entirely. She also blames Congress and, more recently, people like Donald Trump. M. RAMIREZ: (Speaking Spanish). FLORIDO: Mrs. Ramirez thinks Americans want to go back to when this was a whiter country. But Mr. Ramirez says that isn't possible. DANIEL RAMIREZ: (Speaking Spanish). FLORIDO: \"Back then, people of color didn't have a voice,\" he says. \"They didn't have a vote. But now they do.\" Mr. Ramirez says there are more young Latinos, like his son Pablo, using that voice. Sure, when Pablo comes home from college full of new ideas, it causes a lot of eye-rolling, especially from his sister Daniela. DANIELA RAMIREZ: I tell him all the time. I'm like you've got to tone it down with your big words because, I mean, you're being all... FLORIDO: ...Academic? DANIELA RAMIREZ: Yes. P. RAMIREZ: Yes. DANIELA RAMIREZ: Yes (laughter). FLORIDO: Everyone at the table nods in agreement, including a guilty-looking Pablo. But his dad says this is because college is opening his mind. Pablo says the biggest thing he's come to understand in college is that he should embrace all of his heritage. P. RAMIREZ: I actually identify as Mexican and American. And I wouldn't give up either of my identities. FLORIDO: His sister Daniela and brother Ramon agree. They say they're Mexican too. DANIELA RAMIREZ: But I also feel like I live an American life. RAMON RAMIREZ: You learn to love both. FLORIDO: Listening on, their dad has a big grin on his face. DANIEL RAMIREZ: (Speaking Spanish). FLORIDO: \"What they're saying,\" he says, \"is that they like to eat both tacos and hamburgers.\" Adrian Florido, NPR News.

            "article_content": "Demographics play a huge determinative factor in presidential elections. NPR's Politics team has assembled a way for the audience to calculate possible voting outcomes based on demographics trends.  DAVID GREEENE, HOST: In this presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton appears to have many of the traditional advantages in poll numbers, in fundraising and also in demographics - race, ethnicity, gender, income levels in all of the states. So the map favors Democrats. NPR's Asma Khalid wanted to look at what it would take for Donald Trump to overcome those disadvantages and hit that important 270 electoral votes. Asma covers demographics and politics, and she's here with me in the studio. Hey, Asma. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Hey, David. GREEENE: So let's start with the basics. Why does Hillary Clinton seem to have the natural advantages, as of now? KHALID: So let's go back to the 2012 election, when President Obama won that election pretty convincingly by about 126 electoral votes. And just because of demographic changes, particularly along racial lines, this election is expected to have the most diverse electorate to date. That is an inherent advantage for Democrats. You know, think of Latinos, Asians and African-Americans. A majority of them in 2012 supported President Obama. GREEENE: OK. But we have two different candidates now. We have Hillary Clinton, and we have Donald Trump. And you've actually worked with some colleagues on a tool that would actually show us, I mean, what it would take for Donald Trump to sort of move the numbers in a lot of states and actually pull out a victory. KHALID: That's right. David, we created election sliders for five different demographic groups. We looked at white men, white women, African-Americans, Latinos and others. GREEENE: OK. And you're calling them sliders? KHALID: Sliders, yep. And so these are sort of interactive tools that allow you to adjust both the margin of victory and raw turnout in 20 battleground states. You can adjust them, a percent at a time, to see what it would take for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton to win a particular state. GREEENE: OK. A lot of people have been talking about the state of Pennsylvania - I'm not just bringing up that state because it's my home state - Donald Trump was actually there this week. I mean, it's been a clear focus for him. And there have been a lot of - a lot of question about whether Democrats sort of in a lot of those industrial areas, like around Pittsburgh, might turn to Donald Trump. I mean, is that a good case study? KHALID: It is. You know, Pennsylvania's been a blue state for years and years. But when you look at the current demography, I think it's a really good example of a state that, demographically speaking, looks like a true toss-up. You know, we found that just 1 percent change in how the white male population votes could flip the state Republican. I mean, think about that. So if Donald Trump can maintain Mitt Romney levels of support and Mitt Romney levels of turnout with all those other different demographic groups who we were talking about - African-Americans, Latinos, white women - and he can just bump up that white male margin by a percent, he could theoretically flip the state. GREEENE: So I could see that on this tool. I could sort of raise the white vote 1 percent in the state of Pennsylvania. And as I slide that over, I would see it turn red. KHALID: Exactly. GREEENE: This sounds like a lot of fun for political junkies. KHALID: (Laughter). GREEENE: I mean, so, sort of look at the map overall as you've played with this tool, any sort of takeaways when you think about Donald Trump and his chances here? KHALID: I would say that it is a very difficult path for Donald Trump. I mean, one state that I think kind of exemplifies that is Virginia. You know, it's a state that traditionally has been thought of as battleground turf. We ran probably six or seven different scenarios to see how Trump could carve a path to the White House. And in all of our scenarios, Virginia remained blue. And I think that's partly because, you know, Virginia's demography has changed. It has a growing Asian and Latino population in the state. But it's also kind of an example of how difficult the path is for Donald Trump. I think his best strategy is to focus on some of the old Rust Belt states. You know, Trump has repeatedly insisted that he could win a state like Michigan. So we looked at Michigan. And we also looked at Wisconsin. I would say they both seem sort of like long shots, partly because of their large, historically left-leaning white populations. But, I mean, look, Michigan is plausible. If, you know, he could win white voters by, say, 5 percent more than Mitt Romney did and hold everything else constant, he's got a shot in Michigan. GREEENE: So we will not be surprised to see Donald Trump spending a lot of time in the Midwest as we go (laughter) towards the fall. KHALID: I think it would make much more sense. You know, this whole battleground map that we traditionally think of in election cycles, I think, is changing. GREEENE: Asma, thanks a lot. KHALID: Thanks so much, David. KHALID: That was NPR's Asma Khalid who covers demographics and the campaign. And you can use the new tool she was talking about to try and predict the election through demographics.

            "article_content": "Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine is a on a short list to become Hillary Clinton's vice president. Kaine was also a finalist to become President Obama's running mate.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: There's one big unknown on the Democratic side of this race. Who will be Hillary Clinton's running mate? The short list includes Labor Secretary Tom Perez and some senators - Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Tim Kaine of Virginia. Tomorrow Clinton hits the campaign trail with Kaine. NPR congressional reporter Susan Davis visited the city Kaine calls home. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: On this rainy Thursday night, only a handful of choir members are out for weekly practice at St. Elizabeth's in Richmond. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CHOIR: (Singing) Wade in the water. God's going to trouble the water. DAVIS: Negro spirituals about the Underground Railroad aren't exactly commonplace at Catholic Churches. St. Elizabeth's is a predominantly black Catholic, and hanging in this church is a black Jesus, which wasn't uneasy Father Jim Arsenault recalls with a laugh. JIM ARSENAULT: The Italians did not want to make Jesus black. I kept rejecting the color of the skin tone. And I said, you know, the community's kind of African-American. And I think that threw the Italians for a loop. DAVIS: This church has been Tim Kaine's parish his entire adult life. He got married here. His three kids were baptized here. He was a parishioner before he ever ran for elected office, and he stayed a parishioner as politics drew him from the Richmond City Council to the mayor's office, from lieutenant governor to the governor's mansion and now as the state's junior senator. He's no longer a regular at Thursday choir practice, but musical director Kim Ford says Kaine still makes appearances during Sunday mass, particularly when she needs a tenor. KIM FORD: Tim sung in there until he really started kicking it with the politics and, you know, mayor and governor and so on, so forth. And then he - it took his time away from us a little bit. But when he comes here, I still snatch him out the audience. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CHOIR: (Singing) ...The water. DAVIS: Kaine was raised near Kansas City, Mo., but his political life was born here in Richmond. He ended up here because of his wife, Anne Holton. They met at Harvard. Viola Baskerville is a longtime Kaine ally. I met her for lunch at a restaurant across town from St. Elizabeth's. She says Anne helped shape Kaine's progressive views on race. VIOLA BASKERVILLE: Knowing that she had been one of the students to integrate one of the early schools in the city of - public schools in the city of Richmond, I think some of those things really form meaningful relationships and impressions on you. BASKERVILLE: Holton is the daughter of former Republican Governor Linwood Holton. He helped integrate the Virginia public school system, and he sent Anne and her siblings to black schools. This vein of racial equality pulses throughout Kaine's rise in Virginia and national politics, and it helps explain why he's a two-time Democratic contender for vice president. As a young Richmond lawyer, Kaine focused on housing discrimination cases. His work within the black community helped fuel his first election victory to the city council in 1995. Baskerville served with Kaine on the Richmond City Council. She remembers that election. BASKERVILLE: After he won, he held up his loafer that - he had a hole in the bottom of his loafers 'cause he had walked so much in the community. The African-American community very well respected him and very much supported him. DAVIS: Kaine has never lost an election, and in every one of those elections, he's been able to win black voters without alienating whites and vice versa. That's hard to do in Southern politics where the racial divide is often widest on Election Day. In his runs for governor and Senate, Kaine performed well for a Democrat in traditional Republican strongholds. He's won with the vote of Virginians like Bob Mooney. He's a Richmond-based entrepreneur. If Clinton tops Kaine as her running mate, it would win his vote. BOB MOONEY: That's the only way I would cast that vote. DAVIS: Mooney helped build a Richmond magnate school named after Maggie Walker, the first black woman to run a bank in the U.S. Mooney says Kaine was one of the politicians that helped make it happen. MOONEY: I just think he's a, you know, a person of tremendous values. DAVIS: Those values are what prompted his early endorsement of then little-known Illinois Senator Barack Obama in 2007. Kaine was the first Democratic governor to back him. Mark Rubin was Kaine's attorney when he was governor. I met him at City Diner, one of Kaine's local hangouts. MARK RUBIN: But the notion of having the first black president was a big deal to Tim, and so he jumped. DAVIS: That support helped earn Kaine a place on Obama's short list in 2007. This time his supporters say that record on diversity and his cross-party appeal could help a candidate who is disliked by as many Americans as her opponent. Clinton could use some likeability, some might even say a choirboy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CHOIR: (Singing) I'm going up yonder. I'm going up yonder.

            "article_content": "Voters went to the polls in Kentucky and Oregon on Tuesday. Hillary Clinton may have just barely edged out Bernie Sanders in Kentucky's primary. But Sanders won by a significant margin in Oregon.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: There is some suspense in the latest round of Democratic primaries. Hillary Clinton has a slim lead over Bernie Sanders in Kentucky. She declared victory, but NPR has not called that race yet. In Oregon, Sanders claimed a sizable victory. Here is his reaction last night. He was here in California, which votes in early June. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) BERNIE SANDERS: We are in until the last ballot is cast. (CHEERING) MONTAGNE: NPR political editor Domenico Montanaro is on the line now. Good morning. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: So last night's results - what do they tell us? MONTANARO: Well, look. I mean, first off, Bernie Sanders continues to win in places that you would expect him to win or he would expect to win based on the demography and how this race has played out. It was a surprise, frankly, that Clinton could seem to pull it out in Kentucky. She has a narrow lead. The race has not been called yet by the AP with some precincts still out. But it was a close primary, which has helped her in the past. And it - but it really doesn't do much to change the math at this point. Clinton moved a little bit closer to that magic number. She's now within a hundred delegates of the 2,383 she needs, including superdelegates. And she'll most likely cross on June 7 after New Jersey votes. MONTAGNE: And Bernie Sanders, as we've just heard - and heard many times before, actually - he's not giving up. And there was some ugliness in Nevada over the weekend, where Clinton got more delegates at the state's party convention. There was violence, there was threats against the state party chair by apparent Sanders supporters, you know, on her - you know, messages on her phone. Now he, Bernie Sanders, is in a kind of war of words with party leaders. Talk to us about that. MONTANARO: Yeah, he certainly is. And, you know, Sanders clearly hasn't come to a point of acceptance yet in this race. He was in California last night, which has a huge trench of delegates on June 7. He knows it's a steep hill. He said it was a steep hill last night. But what he's talking about when he talks about taking on the Democratic establishment - they're all against us - you know, he's playing with a little bit of a dangerous - you know, it's a little bit of a dangerous thing to talk about because in an election that you have Donald Trump on the other side, there are a lot of Democrats and supporters of Hillary Clinton who see the end of the tunnel here. And they would like Bernie Sanders to speak in a more unifying way. He hasn't gone after her, you know, speeches on Wall Street or any of that lately. So let's see what happens after June 7. He's still saying that he's going to take this fight into the convention, even though there's really no rationale for superdelegates to switch unless he wins a pledge majority. And it doesn't look like he'll be able to do that at this point, needing some 66 percent or more of those delegates to get a pledge majority. So, you know, it's going to be interesting to see after June 7 how he changes the tone, if at all. MONTAGNE: All right. Well, you just mentioned Donald Trump. And he, of course, and Megyn Kelly have been making news because they have got together, so to speak, in an interview. How did that go? I mean, was Megyn Kelly tough? What did he do? MONTANARO: Well, Megyn Kelly wasn't as tough as she was in that first debate, that's for sure. And they definitely made nice. Let's put it that way. Trump kind of defended his tone during the campaign. He said he had some regrets, but he wasn't very specific (laughter) about what regrets he had. He made the case that had he not been so tough and hit back at people - that he probably wouldn't have won. And he said that if he doesn't win this fall, it's going to be a waste of time, money and energy. And clearly, he must have liked the interview because afterward, he tweeted - well done, Megyn. And they lived happily ever after. So... MONTAGNE: You're right. They - (laughter) that interview on Fox, which is what they have in common as well. OK. Last night, Trump announced a joint fundraising operation with the Republican Party. What about that? MONTANARO: Well, now he's hired a pollster. He's raising money with the party. He's talking about voter data and how important that is, which is something about a week ago - or a few days ago, even - had just said - had downplayed that. He really does need a more traditional campaign apparatus to be able to run and win in a successful general election because he has a very narrow path. It goes through the Midwest. He's going to have to win in places like Michigan and Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania, where he's going to hope to use something like NAFTA against Hillary Clinton, whose husband signed that bill, the North American Free Trade Agreement. But, you know, it's going to be very difficult for him. The campaign that he ran in a primary is very different than what he has to run in a general election. He really stoked a lot of racial resentment. And it's going to be hard for him to be able to use the kind of talk about immigrants and women that does turn off Republican women in the suburbs to be able to win in places like Pennsylvania. It's hard to do. MONTAGNE: Got to leave it at that. Thanks. NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Ahead of our forthcoming podcast, I've been heads-down in some reading and interviews about the way we talk about, well, white people. Whiteness has always been a central dynamic of American cultural and political life, though we don't tend to talk about it as such. But this election cycle is making it much harder to avoid discussions of white racial grievance and identity politics when, for instance, Donald Trump's only viable pathway to the White House is to essentially win all of the white dudes. And indeed, the roiling civil war between the Republican Party's elites and a huge swath of its base has prompted an unusually candid public grappling with whiteness. Take this paragraph from a post by Bloomberg's Sasha Issenberg on \"Hillary Clinton's Appalachian Problem:\" \"This is all a reminder of how circumstantial Clinton's position as tribune of the white working class was during her first presidential campaign. (Thought exercises: what would Clinton's 2008 coalition have looked like had it been John Edwards, not Obama, who had won the Iowa caucuses that year? And what would it look this year if her liberal challenger were Deval Patrick instead of Sanders?) Perhaps now that she is no longer running against an African-American candidate\u2014and has anointed herself a crusader against the 'challenges of racism, of sexism, of discrimination against the LGBT community'\u2014Clinton no longer has much of a connection with those 'hard-working Americans.' \" This is much closer to Saying The Thing than we normally get, an acknowledgment that the reason \"hard-working Americans\" \u2014 the quotes underscoring the euphemism \u2014 don't really rock with Hillary Clinton is a sense that some of the concerns she's championing are, if not anathema to them, then at least not theirs. And that this time around, there isn't a black candidate to ensure that some white voters will vote for her, however grudgingly, despite her platform. But then, there's the liberal commentator Jonathan Chait's recent essay at New York Mag, \"The Real Reason We All Underrated Trump,\" in which he openly wonders whether Republican voters who've fallen for Trump are \"idiots\": \"Most voters don't follow politics and policy for a living, and it's understandable that they would often fall for arguments based on faulty numbers or a misreading of history. ... As low as my estimation of the intelligence of the Republican electorate may be, I did not think enough of them would be dumb enough to buy his act. And, yes, I do believe that to watch Donald Trump and see a qualified and plausible president, you probably have some kind of mental shortcoming. As many fellow Republicans have pointed out, Donald Trump is a con man. What I failed to realize \u2014 and, I believe, what so many others failed to realize, though they have reasons not to say so \u2014 is just how easily so many Republicans are duped.\" It's telling that Chait finds it easier to imagine that huge swaths of Republican primary voters are childlike and naive, rather than folks who quite rationally dig Trump's direct appeals to their interests \u2014 their racial interests. Among Trump's most notorious policy proposals is a moratorium on Muslims entering the country. He has called Mexican immigrants \"rapists.\" Maybe we should concede that these declarations are not incidental to his appeal among his supporters, but central to them. Calling them \"idiots\" posits that they've been duped, when perhaps Trump is saying precisely what they want to hear. When Trump's supporters aren't being written off as intellectually incapable of knowing a huckster when they see one, their motivations are often ascribed to their being \"working class.\" But the working class today is nearly 40 percent people of color \u2014 and among people of color, Trump is profoundly unpopular. His coalition is nearly entirely white. Even the class part of the \"working class\" narrative is inaccurate; Trump's supporters are wealthier than most Americans, and have higher incomes than supporters of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. The \"working class revolt\" explanation for Trump's rise is overstated \u2014 and it can be a useful dodge to avoid talking about explanations involving racial grievance. There have been outlets and pundits this election cycle who've shown they're willing and able to dig into the role that racial grievance plays in How Trump Happened. Others haven't, and continue not to. And that's a problem. When we don't grapple with whiteness in our politics directly and explicitly \u2014 to talk about the fact that not-insignificant numbers of white voters are motivated more by identity politics than by ideology or faith \u2014 we're essentially agreeing to misidentify some of the most important dynamics of this cycle.",

            "article_content": "After some recent missteps with African-American voters, Hillary Clinton addressed a high-profile civil rights group Wednesday.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: The presidential primary in New York is less than a week away, and the Democratic candidates are making their case to the National Action Network. That's the civil rights group in New York City led by the reverend, Al Sharpton. Today, the group heard from Hillary Clinton, who's dealing with some missteps with black voters over the past week. Here's NPR's Tamara Keith. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hillary Clinton told an almost entirely African-American audience at the National Action Network convention race still plays a significant role in determining who gets ahead and who gets left behind. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: There's something wrong, my friends, when the median wealth for black families is a tiny fraction of the median wealth for white families. KEITH: She hit recurring themes from her campaign about breaking down barriers and bringing the country together and owned her privilege as a white American. For Clinton, this comes after a week of less than favorable press for her campaign. First, there was her husband Bill Clinton's confrontation with Black Lives Matter activists. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BILL CLINTON: I like protesters, but the ones that won't let you answer are afraid of the truth. KEITH: In a more than 10-minute exchange with the activists, Bill Clinton defended some of the more controversial elements of his presidency, the 1994 crime bill and the 1996 welfare reform and then there was the comedy routine at a New York City gala where Hillary Clinton joined with Mayor Bill de Blasio to perform a joke taken by many to be racially insensitive. But you wouldn't know Clinton was having a rough week by the response to her speech today. SYLVIA DUMMIT: Hearing her speak today really brought tears to my eyes. KEITH: Really. Sylvia Dummit is a pastor from the Bronx, and she doesn't hold President Clinton's policies against his wife. DUMMIT: But she's willing to make some changes, so I'm holding her accountable to the things that she said today. I can't look back at what decisions that they made back then because at that time it was relevant. It was relevant for welfare reform, it was. KEITH: Dummit says she likes some of Sen. Bernie Sanders' ideas, but she's all in for Clinton because of her tenacity. Demographically, if you had to pick an audience most likely to support Clinton, it would be this one. Her strongest support this election cycle has come from African-Americans over 30 years old. But Tad Devine, a senior adviser to the Sanders campaign, says in Wisconsin, the senator made some inroads with black voters. And he expects that to continue in New York by highlighting Sanders' lifelong commitment to civil rights. TAD DEVINE: So we've got to tell his story, his own narrative, and most importantly, we've got to make sure that the African-American community knows about the policies that he wants to pursue as president, to achieve racial justice in America, to deal with the economic disparities that are so profound on the African-American community. KEITH: Sanders spoke here last year and will address the convention again tomorrow. Based on interviews with attendees, their support for Clinton wasn't for a lack of knowing about Sanders. Paulette Roca said on a scale of one to 10, she'd give Clinton's remarks an 11. PAULETTE ROCA: We can understand her. We can relate to her. I know I can. I like her. I feel very comfortable with her. She has respect. When black women respect you, you've got respect. KEITH: And in the lead up to the primary here in New York, Clinton has been working hard to shore up that support. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"FATHER CAN YOU HEAR ME\") UNIDENTIFIED ARTIST: (Singing) Father. UNIDENTIFIED CHOIR: (Singing) Can you hear me now? KEITH: In the last two weeks, Clinton has visited six black churches. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) H. CLINTON: Oh, this is the day the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it. KEITH: That's on pace with her run for Senate in 2000, when by WNYC's count, Clinton visited 27 black churches in two months. In New York, black voters made up 17 percent of the primary electorate in 2008. And if Clinton wins on Tuesday, it may well be because of their support. Tamara Keith, NPR News, New York.

On Sunday, after Bernie Sanders' commanding wins in the Alaska, Hawaii and Washington state Democratic presidential caucuses, Leslie Lee III, an American freelance writer living in Japan, tweeted, \"I knew it. I knew if Bernie won Hawaii it would magically become a white state.\" And then he tweeted again: \"Ever since I voted for Bernie, I've been bingewatching Friends. #BernieMadeMeWhite.\" .@HillyesRose @MisaelFrancoO @TheBpDShow @cenkuygur Ever since I voted for Bernie, I've been bingewatching Friends. #BernieMadeMeWhite Lee said he wrote that to contradict a narrative he sees playing out in the race for the Democratic nomination. \"There's always been these articles about how Bernie supporters are basically only white people,\" Lee told NPR. He continued, \"Me, myself, and many other POC, people of color, who support Bernie Sanders, feel like we don't get to be a part of the conversation. We get ignored. We get erased. It's assumed that the black vote, the Hispanic vote, and everyone is all behind Hillary Clinton and none of us really get Bernie Sanders or like Bernie Sanders.\" So he decided to have fun with it. \"Hey, if you're gonna ignore me as a black person, I might as well embrace my whiteness,\" Lee said. \"I might as well start watching Friends, or enjoying pumpkin spice latte, or whatever. I just wanted to have a bit of fun with it while highlighting the serious issue.\" The hashtag spread quickly. And trended for hours Sunday night. But not all of the tweets were supportive: This isn't a picture of two friends, it's actually a before and after voting for Bernie pic. #BernieMadeMeWhite pic.twitter.com/lHH9QJvTfB #BernieMadeMeWhite tag is proving EXACTLY how white his supporters are. They take one pic w/t a POC and call it a revolution... smh It was a strong, and, at times, hilarious showing for Sanders' supporters of color, one that might seem to be in contradiction with the Vermont senator's actual electoral support from minorities so far in this election. This election I learned that black voters over the age of 45 in the deep south were the only racial minorities #BernieMadeMeWhite Ever since I started supporting Bernie, Don't Stop Believing became my karaoke staple #BernieMadeMeWhite Sanders himself admitted to struggling to win the black vote. After a disappointing loss in South Carolina's Democratic primary, where Sanders only won 14 percent of the black vote in that state according to exit polls, he told ABC's George Stephanopolous, \"We got decimated.\" In another interview with the Los Angeles Times editorial board, Sanders said, \"Older African-American women, I think we found two in the country that voted for us in the South.\" \"I would attribute this to number one the popularity of Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton \u2014 you know it's a brand name,\" he continued. \"They've been known by the African-American community for 25 years, and they are popular.\" So which point of view is correct? Sanders does horribly with minority voters? Or the media do a bad job of telling the story of Sanders' existing minority support? \"Well, I think, looking at the exit polls,\" Randy Brown of Edison Research told NPR, \"they're both correct.\" Edison conducts entrance and exit polling for American elections and has conducted polls on primary voters and caucusgoers in 20 states so far this election. Brown said, by some measures, Sanders actually leads among black and Latino voters. \"Among African-Americans, who are 17 through 29, Bernie Sanders is actually leading that group, 51 to 48 [percent],\" he said. \"Among 17- to 29-year-old Hispanics, Bernie Sanders leads Hillary Clinton 66-34.\" \"I think the big takeaway,\" Brown said, \"is that whether it's among whites or African-Americans, Bernie Sanders does significantly better among the youngest voters in the Democratic primary.\" (Note: Similar data were not yet available for Asian-American voters. And Edison did not conduct exit or entrance polling in this past weekend's caucuses in Alaska, Hawaii and Washington state.) For what it's worth, Lee said he hopes his hashtag helps spread that narrative. But he also told NPR that he is not sure #BernieMadeMeWhite will actually make anyone change a vote. \"It helps connect progressives on Twitter,\" Lee said. \"I think that's the main point. It's not going to convince people in the media that they're wrong. It's not going to convince people who support Hillary Clinton that they're wrong. But it is going to help connect people who do support Bernie Sanders and, more importantly, believe in progressive values.\"",

In 2013, a young woman named Abigail Fisher sued the University of Texas after claiming she was denied admission to the school in 2008 because she was white. \"There were people in my class with lower grades who weren't in all the activities I was in, and who were being accepted into UT,\" said Fisher. \"And the only other difference between us was the color of our skin.\" Fisher sought to challenge the school's \"race-conscious\" admissions program, commonly referred to as affirmative action. Her case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. On Thursday the court ruled that the school's program is lawful under the Equal Protection Clause. \"Considerable deference is owed to a university in defining those intangible characteristics, like student body diversity, that are central to its identity and educational mission,\" wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy for the majority opinion. Fisher's case marks the most recent challenge to affirmative action, which was upheld in 1978 and 2003. Before Fisher's case, the court ruled that colleges and universities could consider race and ethnicity as a factor in admissions, as long as they didn't adopt quotas. Some are calling the ruling a victory, but warn that this probably isn't the last case of its kind. Others satirized Fisher's complaint (the 2013 hashtag #staymadabby transformed \u2014 post-Lemonade \u2014 to #beckywiththebadgrades). Others drew attention to the age-old question of who affirmative action really benefits \u2014 and doesn't. Here's a roundup of reactions to the Supreme Court ruling. Over at Colorlines, Victor Goode wrote about how the ruling will affect students of color across the country. Goode called it a \"victory for the civil rights community.\" \"In most respects, today's decision holds the line. It doesn't open any new ground to advance or diminish affirmative action. The Court was clear that affirmative action in higher education could continue, as long as its goals are clear and measurable. The Texas goals were \"ending stereotypes, promoting cross-racial understanding, preparing students for an increasingly diverse workforce and society, and cultivating leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry.\" These goals mirror the compelling interest standard that the Court has previously approved.\" Vox put Fisher's challenge to affirmative action into context with a piece titled \"White women benefit most from affirmative action \u2014 and are among its fiercest opponents.\" They break down some relevant stats: \"In general, women today are more educated and make up more of the workforce than ever before, in part because of affirmative action policies. Indeed, from the tech industry to publishing, diversity has emerged as an overwhelming increase in the presence of white women, not necessarily people of color. \"Incidentally, over the years white women have become some of affirmative action's most ardent opponents. \"According to the 2014 Cooperative Congressional Election Study, nearly 70 percent of the 20,694 self-identified non-Hispanic white women surveyed either somewhat or strongly opposed affirmative action.\" At The Root, Michael Harriot satirizes Fisher's charges of racial inequality. In a piece titled \"The Many Complaints of Abigail Fisher,\" Harriot pokes fun at what he calls Fisher's \"history of complaining\" \u2014 and pokes holes in her claims: \"Although Fisher claimed she was denied entry to the University of Texas because she was white, obviously her spot had been taken by some student of color who was less qualified than she was. However, during the case, it was revealed that Fisher had lower grades than all but 47 students who were admitted to UT that year. Of the students who were admitted to Texas with grades lower than Fisher's \u2014 42 of the 47 were white. Instead of Kanye-shrugging her shoulders and resigning herself to another school, she decided to sue. As a legacy student whose parents had attended the school, she felt she should have been afforded the opportunity of hopscotching past the more qualified candidates because ... well ... white privilege.\" It's worth noting that some minorities believe affirmative action is actually hurting them. Last year, Zhang Tianpu wrote a piece for Foreign Policy titled \"I'm Chinese, and I Know Why There Aren't More Asians in the Ivy League,\" in which Tianpu says the 'model minority' stereotype has worked against Asian students: \"Truth is, in terms of their economic status and academic accomplishments, Asians have already mostly drawn even with white people, even surpassed them. As a minority that takes seriously education and hard work, Asians have improved their lives immensely since coming to America just generations ago, and Asian students have quickly stood out. America, a society still led by white people, has started to call Asians a \"model minority,\" who have already realized \"quasi-whiteness\" in their economic and intellectual lives. This is meant as praise, however it means that Asians must pay a price at the school gates. \"Asian students were once a class protected under affirmative action, along with African-Americans and other minorities. But because Asian students have performed better and better, with higher and higher grades, they've opened light-years' worth of distance between themselves and other racial minorities.\" The University of Texas has used other mechanisms in an attempt to diversify. Most notably, its \"Top 10 Percent\" policy, which guarantees automatic admission to any Texas public university to high school students who are residents of the state and graduate at the top 10 percent of their class. Ironically, the policy \u2014 and the diversity mission behind it \u2014 benefits from racial segregation in Texas schools. This, from the Texas Tribune: \"Currently, the overwhelming majority of Texans admitted into UT-Austin get in because of the policy. \"The rule was designed to promote diversity at the state's top universities. Texas public schools are largely segregated, so promising admission to the same amount of students from minority-dominated schools and white schools \u2014 regardless of standardized test scores \u2014 in theory helps minorities.\" Meanwhile, even as more black and Hispanic students are enrolling in college, they aren't necessarily making it into top-tier universities. According to The Atlantic, the black undergraduate population at these universities has stagnated at an average of 6 percent for the past 20 years. Faculty diversity isn't looking too great either, reminding us that this week's Supreme Court decision doesn't fix the problems affirmative action was designed to alleviate \u2014 it just returns us to status quo.",

Updated at 6:20 p.m. ET Donald Trump has parted ways with his campaign manager and close ally, Corey Lewandowski. The move appears to be a reaction to the presumptive GOP nominee's sagging poll numbers and weeks of difficulty as he prepped for a tough general-election fight with Hillary Clinton. Hours after his abrupt exit, Lewandowski gave a pair of television interviews in which he put a positive spin on his exit. \"I wouldn't change one second of my time with Mr. Trump other than to say thank you, it's been an honor,\" the usually brash Lewandowski told MSNBC in brief comments. In a nearly 30 minute interview with CNN's Dana Bash, Lewandowski said he didn't \"know the answer\" to why he was fired, but instead pointed to their record successes in the GOP primary campaign. Later on Monday, there was a resignation from the campaign's staff preparing for the Republican National Convention. Michael Caputo, director of communications for caucus operations at the convention, quit after tweeting a message mocking Lewandowski's firing. \"Ding dong the witch is dead!\" Caputo tweeted, with a photo of the ruby slippers on the feet of the Wicked Witch of the East from The Wizard of Oz after she was crushed by a house. \"Unforced errors have no place on a general election campaign for the White House,\" Caputo said in a statement to NPR. While some campaign sources tell NPR Trump's split with Corey Lewandowski was \"mutual,\" another described it as a \"firing\" and a \"summary execution.\" The source said the news was unwelcome for Lewandowski at the weekly Monday staff meeting. The \"weekly Monday morning family meeting went awry for Corey,\" the source said. Officially, the campaign tried to put a good face on it. \"The Donald J. Trump Campaign for President, which has set a historic record in the Republican primary having received almost 14 million votes, has today announced that Corey Lewandowski will no longer be working with the campaign,\" spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement. \"The campaign is grateful to Corey for his hard work and dedication and we wish him the best in the future.\" Lewandowski has been with Trump since he began his presidential run, managing his shoestring operation. But as Trump has moved into the general election, a more traditional campaign structure largely managed by Paul Manafort, a former Ronald Reagan aide, has emerged. Within the campaign, Manafort and Lewandowski have been seen as competing forces. A campaign source told NPR that Trump previously had liked the competitiveness between the two. \"[Corey] knew there was a battle brewing. I am certain he thought he would win,\" one campaign source told NPR. In his interview with CNN, Lewandowski denied any tensions between the two, telling Bash that, \"Paul and I have been getting along amazingly well.\" Lewandowski said he would remain a Trump delegate from New Hampshire and would continue to work to help him beat Clinton in whatever way he could and was leaving with no \"professional\" regrets. The now-former campaign manager, though, has been a source of controversy himself. There were accusations \u2014 and a battery charge that was later dropped \u2014 following a confrontation with a former reporter for Breitbart News in which Lewandowski was seen on video appearing to grab her arm. The news of his ouster on Monday was first reported by the New York Times. Trump stood behind Lewandowski amidst those charges at a time when his ouster would have been a given for any traditional campaign. But CNN reported Monday that the breaking point appeared to have been growing tensions between himself and Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Sources confirmed to NPR that Kushner was indeed playing a bigger role in the campaign. Lewandowski told CNN's Bash that he had a good relationship with all of Trump's family. Even though Trump effectively clinched the Republican nomination more than six weeks ago, his campaign has yet to prepare for the usual rigors of a general-election campaign \u2014 hiring top staff, preparing a rapid response and communications team and beginning fundraising and building a data-analytics operation. Instead, Trump has continued to swirl in controversy, targeting a judge presiding over the Trump University fraud case by accusing him of bias because of his Mexican heritage. He doubled down on his Muslim immigration ban and expanded it after last week's deadly shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla. He called for a ban on anyone coming to the U.S. from any country with a proven history of terrorism against the U.S. or its allies. He also made confusing comments on guns, initially saying that if clubgoers had been armed, the shooter could have been stopped. He walked that back after even the NRA disagreed with him. Lewandowski helped preside over Trump's unconventional primary campaign, bolstered by the billionaire businessman's sheer personality and ability to command the news cycles, dwarfing his GOP opponents. But in a general election, Trump hasn't been able to do the same. Manafort was brought on earlier this year to help professionalize the skeletal, disorganized Trump operation. But there was reportedly tension between the two, with Lewandowski wanting to keep the same approach that had worked before, while Manafort worked to make Trump pivot to a more disciplined general-election approach.",

            "article_content": "Harlem was known as the cultural capital of black America. With Charles Rangel retiring, the neighborhood will be without African-American Congressional representation for the first time in 70 years.  LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST: There's a changing of the guard in Harlem. When the new Congress is seated in January, it will mark the first time since the second world war that the New York neighborhood is not represented by an African-American. For some residents, that adds to a growing sense of anxiety about changes underway, as NPR's Joel Rose reports. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: If you want to see the past and future of Harlem, look at the corner of 125th Street and Lenox Avenue, also known as Malcolm X Boulevard. On one side of the street, a towering metal and glass box where a Whole Foods Market will open next year. And on the other side, a two-story building with a crumbling Art Deco facade that used to be a jazz club called the Lenox Lounge. MICHAEL HENRY ADAMS: This building is a place where Billie Holiday performed and where great bebop artists made their reputations. ROSE: Michael Henry Adams is an historian of Harlem who's trying to preserve the neighborhood's distinctive architecture. He says the Lenox Lounge will be the next casualty. ADAMS: It'll be demolished and replaced by this five-story structure that will not reflect anything that was here. And that is what hurts my soul so much. ROSE: Harlem was once the undisputed cultural capital of black America. It was an important bastion of African-American political power, too. Now census data suggests that it's not even a majority-black neighborhood. Since the turn of the century, there's been an influx of whites and a growing Latino population. And longtime residents like Valerie Jo Bradley worry about what that means for the neighborhood. VALERIE JO BRADLEY: When I got my house in Harlem, there were no construction loans or mortgages. ROSE: Bradley runs a bed and breakfast in the elegant brownstone townhouse she bought with cash in the early 1980s when Harlem was represented in Congress by Charlie Rangel. But Rangel is retiring after more than four decades. And Bradley says there's some concern about his successor, who will be sworn in next month. BRADLEY: There is a fear that Harlem's going to be ignored by this congressman. But I would feel that that's impossible. ROSE: The new congressman-elect is Adriano Espaillat, who will be the first Dominican-American to serve in Congress. ADRIANO ESPAILLAT: I am a Dominican of African descent. There is no difference between myself and folks from Harlem. ROSE: Espaillat won a contested Democratic primary in the spring after losing to Charlie Rangel twice before. Espaillat's political base is Latino voters in Washington Heights, which he represented in Albany. But he insists Harlem residents will like him too once they get to know him better. ESPAILLAT: People will see as I establish myself there, and my office will be open right there in the state office building, that I will represent every district with no privilege of one district over the other. ROSE: Concerns about gentrification in Harlem are not new, but the pace of change may be accelerating as wealthier residents move in and attract businesses that cater to them. Jeff Green owns a cafe on 129th Street called Lenox Coffee. He's also a realtor in the neighborhood. JEFF GREEN: People are moving up here because they really like the way Harlem is. And the dynamic at this cafe is very diverse and people from old Harlem and new Harlem. ROSE: You can find similar racial diversity in the growing number of restaurants and cafes that have opened on Lenox Avenue. Historian Michael Henry Adams acknowledges that gentrification has some benefits. ADAMS: Harlem has become this highly cosmopolitan place with people who have moved here who formerly lived in Paris or all over. We all love the old buildings. We all love the heritage here. But for many of us, we can sense that our days are numbered. ROSE: Adams fears that Harlem's future doesn't have room for the history and the people who put the neighborhood on the map.

            "article_content": "After the election, professional peacemakers may feel they have to work harder to tamp down heightened feelings of \"us versus them\" in the workplace.\n                \n                    \n                    Marcus Butt/Ikon Images/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption After the election, professional peacemakers may feel they have to work harder to tamp down heightened feelings of \"us versus them\" in the workplace. On election night, as it became clear that Donald Trump would be the country's next president, Dorcas Lind was feeling unsettled. With her children tucked in bed, Lind watched as the results trickled in and battleground states like Pennsylvania, Florida and North Carolina turned red on the TV map. She thought about work. Maybe, she thought, this would be good for business. Or, maybe, it was time for a career change. Lind is a diversity consultant in the health care industry. It's her job to go into companies and help them create inclusive environments for their employees. For consultants like Lind, the election's polarizing nature, which especially divided the nation on issues of race, is two-fold. While it means some of their business will almost certainly boom, a new set of challenges emerges for the professional peacemakers. Now, they say, they have to work harder to tamp down heightened feelings of us versus them; they have to hear the concerns of people usually thought of as privileged; and they have to navigate a language minefield where the wrong word can ignite conflict. Studying the maps of how people voted, Lind was disturbed by the stretch of red in her district, a New Jersey suburb, which she said had once been celebrated for its diversity. Like many others in the business, Lind equated a vote for Trump with a vote for intolerance. \"I thought that my whole career had blown up in front of me,\" said Lind, who has worked in the field for more than two decades and is founder and president of Diversity Health Communications. \"I felt so absolutely overwhelmed with the depth of how much work had to be done. And on the other hand, I felt like I didn't even want to do the work. ... Given the results and how the map looked, I felt my work would be futile.\" It's those who voted for Trump or support Trump \u2014 and everyone else. And that's a really difficult dichotomy to address. Dorcas Lind It might feel futile, but many consultants said they expect to see an uptick in calls in the months ahead. That makes sense: The corporate world is a microcosm of the larger world. People who voted for Trump work at the same companies as those who voted for Hillary Clinton or other candidates. And with a contentious postelection environment, employees will inevitably clash over matters of race. Reports will be filed with human resources. Management will be notified. And company leaders will have to figure out how to deal with it all. \"There's a whole toolkit of language we need to create [in order] to talk about this polarization,\" Lind said. \"It's those who voted for Trump or support Trump \u2014 and everyone else. And that's a really difficult dichotomy to address.\" Luby Ismail is the head of Connecting Cultures, a diversity consulting business in the Washington, D.C., area. She said one of her biggest tasks is to break down any feelings that people are on warring sides. Ismail, who's an Egyptian-American Muslim, has worked with companies including The Walt Disney Co., Nike Inc. and Sodexo to lead sessions that help employees better understand Arab-Americans and American Muslims. \"The workplace is very tricky,\" Ismail said, \"because what do we say if you want to remain friends with people? 'Then don't talk about politics and religion.' And yet, people are needing to talk about it. So if only we had some way to bring civility with caution, and for people to feel that instead of doing an us versus them, a right versus wrong, it's, you know, 'Help me understand why you believe something.' \" The Department of Justice uses one of Ismail's training videos on identifying anti-Muslim bias as part of its cultural competence curriculum. She's updating the DOJ training now, but she said she's not sure what will come of it after Inauguration Day. That \"us-versus-them\" sentiment Ismail mentioned is particularly tough to manage now. Doug Harris heads The Kaleidoscope Group, a diversity company in Chicago. He said that he has to help people of color deal with \"historical garbage\" \u2014 he means racism \u2014 while also helping white people who, he learned during this campaign, feel strongly that they're \"out of the power base.\" \"I think right now there's a temperament within society of exclusion on both sides of the table,\" Harris said. \"And those who may have been seen to have been historically included are feeling just as excluded as everyone else. It's always a fight today in some ways [over] who's most excluded. Historically, it might have been about women, people of color, gay and lesbian. There's another group that's more powerful called \u2014 uh, I don't know the right name of it, but white males \u2014 who feel they haven't been given their fair shake. And so how do we make sure their viewpoint is heard?\" Usually, Harris uses an exercise he calls \"insiders and outsiders\" to get people to self-reflect. In this exercise, employees list who might feel like outsiders in the company. Maybe it's new workers or people at lower levels or people who have English as a second language or introverts, Harris said. Inevitably, the list turns to women and people of color. \"So we look at the list. If you're not part of the list, that means you're probably one of the ones causing the exclusion,\" Harris said. White people as a group, and particularly men, don't typically make that list. But the presidential campaign, Harris said, unearthed the strong sentiment among white people that \"they don't feel like the lead group that's been privileged, and if you look at their lives, they're not.\" Those who do diversity, he said, have a responsibility to address everyone's concerns. \"It's not about a special effort toward white men,\" he said. \"That's not the effort I'm talking about. It's more-so that ... if you honor everybody's challenges, they're more likely to own their privileges.\" Lind adds an amendment to that thought, one that underscores the tension diversity consultants, like the rest of the country, are tasked with resolving. Longstanding racial discord, fueled by the \"historical garbage\" Harris mentioned, collides with the idea of honoring everybody's challenges when some of those challenges spring from racial ignorance and racism. Thinking of all challenges as equal, she said, is a problem. \"I think the backlash we're seeing is people who work in the diversity space \u2014 and also civil rights folks in general \u2014 are saying, 'We are not going to be inclusive of ideas and values that are explicitly detrimental and harmful,' \" Lind said. \"Because the rhetoric is, 'One side has lost, one side has won, and everybody needs to get together and move forward for all Americans in the country.' \" Walking that line of competing interests is made even tougher by the language of diversity, including the word diversity itself. Leah P. Hollis, president of Patricia Berkly LLC in Philadelphia, said she actively avoids language that might be polarizing so she can keep everyone in the conversation. After all, in a swing state like Pennsylvania, where nearly 6 million people voted and Trump won by fewer than 70,000 votes, she has to assume that half of the employees she'll be working with voted for Trump, half for Clinton. So figuring out what tone to strike is important. Walking that line of competing interests is made even tougher by the language of diversity, including the word diversity itself. Even the phrase \"diversity consultant\" can be divisive to some. Hollis said she has to frame her focus as \"workplace bullying,\" because many folks seem unable to admit there's a diversity problem. Her workaround, she said, is this: \"Everyone is caught in a power differential, so a lot of my training has a lot to do with workplace bullying and how it disproportionately affects those from different backgrounds.\" Hollis said the minute she uses words like \"diversity,\" she loses the room. People who believe that others are too \"politically correct\" won't continue to play ball, she said. \"If I glom onto or attach those trigger phrases, it's over,\" she said. \"My training is about who you are. I don't know where you're from. You may be from Middle America. You may root for the Jacksonville Jaguars. You might love barbecue. I'm a black woman from Western Pennsylvania. I grew up eating pierogies. I grew up on the Rust Belt. ... In the trainings I have, it's not about whether I'm PC or not. It's about how people feel different. I try to peel back the layers of the labels.\" Looking ahead, the consultants said that now, more than ever, they'll have to take a harder look at their own practices, both in terms of how they'll frame training and how they'll choose clients. Ismail said it's not enough to be an ally to groups that are feeling attacked. Be an accomplice, she said: Defend and speak up. \"You're at lunch or dinner or on a break and someone makes a disparaging joke about anyone, let's say Muslims or Jews or being gay; don't let it pass,\" she said. \"I need you to pause that statement ... Maybe you have to say, 'That's unacceptable here, I don't appreciate that here.' ... That's one way to be an accomplice.\" Postelection, Lind is thinking about the best way to be effective, and it has something to do with where she'll do the work. She said she doesn't want to consult with a company that normalizes intolerance or discrimination or tries to brush them under the rug. She said she wants to work for a company where leadership has already made a demonstrable commitment to diversity. She pointed to the number of CEOs who have doubled down on their corporate mission statements since the election. Leaders of PepsiCo, General Electric, Apple, Medtronic and others have reiterated their support for diversity and inclusion. Medtronic CEO Omar Ishrak, in an email to the medical device-maker's employees, took a stand that would surely be heartening to those who do the work of diversity. He called the company's principles around inclusion \"an irrevocable priority.\"",

Each participant took two shots, celebrating the presidential election results. \"Our time is now.\" That's the message from Wayne LaPierre, the head of the National Rifle Association, to his group's members and gun owners across America, following last week's election. With a Republican-held Congress and Donald Trump headed to the White House \u2014 helped, in no small part, by the support of the NRA \u2014 big changes could be coming to the nation's gun laws. At an NRA-sponsored event Monday, in the desert north of Phoenix, more than 1,000 gun owners and enthusiasts gathered for a so-called 1000 Man Shoot. Men and women from 16 states lined up shoulder to shoulder to fire 1,000 Henry Golden Boy Silver rifles simultaneously. They fired two rounds at a long row of targets. In the cheers after the second, a shooting safety officer in a lime green shirt and red hat said: \"Can you hear us now, Hillary?\" \"We made history last week,\" Pete Brownell, the first vice president of the NRA, told the crowd. \"And I have to tell you it feels great to be on offense again.\" Brownell and other gun rights advocates say that they've had to be on defense for the past eight years under the Obama administration. \"We've always had to be looking out for how our rights are going to be taken away from us as individuals; how our constitutional rights are going to be impinged upon,\" Brownell says. \"Now, the ball's going to be in our court.\" There are a number of laws that the NRA and gun enthusiasts would like to see change under the Trump administration. We've listed some of those laws below and asked Adam Winkler, a constitutional law professor at the UCLA School of Law and author of Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America, what the chances are for each proposal. We should note that this is not a comprehensive list. And if you're wondering why it's not longer, Winkler says, \"It's because the NRA has been so successful over the last 40 years in American politics that it's already accomplished almost everything on the list of its agenda items.\" 1. National reciprocity for concealed-carry permits This is the biggest-ticket item for the NRA and it's the most likely to happen. Trump, a concealed-carry-permit holder, has said that concealed carry \"is a right, not a privilege,\" and that a permit should be valid in all 50 states, similar to a driver's license. That's what national reciprocity would do \u2014 it would give a concealed-carry-permit holder in a state such as Texas the right to carry a gun in a state such as New York, regardless of New York's concealed-carry laws. There are two versions of this law that have already been proposed in Congress, the broader of which would allow a person to get a concealed-carry permit outside his state of residence. \"That's the more controversial version of national reciprocity,\" Winkler says. \"I'm not sure that's the one we'll get, but the NRA is most likely going to push for the broadest version of national reciprocity.\" Winkler believes that some version is likely to pass, but he says that Democrats could filibuster. He also notes that some Republicans could withhold support from national reciprocity because of states' rights. \"If you believe in any local autonomy, as Republicans claim to, then the broad version of reciprocity undermines that significantly,\" Winkler says. \"Because a state or city like Los Angeles would no longer be able to control who carries guns in public.\" 2. An end to gun-free military zones At a rally in January, Trump said, \"My first day, there's no more gun-free zones.\" He was talking about schools and military bases. He later clarified his position on schools, saying that school resource officers or teachers should be allowed to carry them. He has not publicly changed his opinion on military bases. Currently, most gun owners on military bases must register their firearm and store it in an armory while on base. The only people who can carry guns while on a military base are on-duty military, state or local police. There have been pushes by the NRA and Republican lawmakers to allow more military personnel to carry firearms on base, following mass shootings at Fort Hood in 2009 and the Washington, D.C., Navy Yard in 2013, but the Department of Defense has not changed its position. Under Trump, it might. \"This is very easy,\" Winkler says. \"Allowing carrying of firearms on military bases is something that the president will probably be able to do through executive order. I believe that [Trump] will.\" 3. Removing suppressors from the National Firearms Act Gun owners can already use suppressors \u2014 or silencers \u2014 in most states, but gun rights groups say that the process to get one is onerous. Suppressors are regulated under the National Firearms Act, which was originally enacted in 1934 following the St. Valentine's Day Massacre to tax the making and transfer of certain firearms. The underlying purpose of the act, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, was to \"curtail, if not prohibit, transactions in NFA firearms.\" Gun rights advocates and shooters have long argued that suppressors should not be regulated by the NFA and have made a public health argument for their use: Guns are loud. \"Everybody that you know that's an old shooter is deaf,\" says Michelle Camp, the leader of the Utah chapter of The Well-Armed Woman. \"To have the ability to get [suppressors] easier would be really helpful.\" Winkler says it would take legislative action to get suppressors off the NFA list and that a piece of legislation already exists: the Hearing Protection Act of 2015, proposed in the House of Representatives. Winkler says he doesn't expect it to be a priority for Congress, but \"if the NRA decides to get behind silencer legislation, I think it will pass,\" he says. Hours after Trump won last week's election, the NRA dropped this tweet: Learn about the history of #suppressors with @NRA and @silencerco: https://t.co/1HBVpCqVCc #FightTheNoise pic.twitter.com/eVufkxcaP2 4. Revamping federal background check process Nobody is entirely happy with the federal government's current background check process or its database, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Gun control groups argue that there are too many loopholes in it, and many gun rights groups concur \u2014 a rare show of agreement \u2014 though not in the details. The system is supposed to prevent a felon or someone who is mentally ill from purchasing a gun, but it has obstacles like underfunding and inaccurate, out-of-date data. Gun control groups would like to see things in the current system fixed, including the straw purchasing loophole. Gun rights groups say they'd like to find ways to get the system better data to work with. During his campaign, Trump said that he was against expanding background checks and that the current system needs to be fixed. \"Unfortunately, I feel the efforts to 'fix' the background check system will be really efforts to gut the background check system,\" Winkler says. \"To make it less effective, less streamlined, and make it harder for prosecutors to find gun criminals. That's been the NRA's practice with regard to background checks in the past.\"",

Thursday.\n                \n                    \n                    Patrick Semansky/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Melania Trump, wife of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, spoke at the Main Line Sports Center in Berwyn, Pa. Thursday. The last time Melania Trump was in the spotlight, it did not end well. After her address at the Republican National Convention in July, it was discovered that several lines from Trump's speech were lifted from a Michelle Obama speech at the 2008 Democratic Convention. The plagiarism scandal led to online ridicule \u2014 her speech writer accepted responsibility saying that Trump had read passages of Obama's speech to her, which she then wrote down and included in the speech. Since then, she has appeared beside her husband occasionally, but rarely spoken, even when she was the butt of a Donald Trump joke (about his wife's plagiarized speech) at the Al Smith charity dinner last month. Thursday in Berwyn, Pa., a suburb of Philadelphia, at an event meant to appeal to white suburban, women voters, that changed. After a short introduction from Karen Pence, wife of GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence, Melania Trump spent a little less than 15 minutes delivering prepared remarks that were as much an endorsement of her husband as herself. She detailed her upbringing in Slovenia, talked about looking up to Ronald Reagan in her youth, and pursuing a career in fashion and modeling. She ended the biographical portion of her speech by telling the crowd at the Main Line Sports Center Indoor Training Facility how honored she was to become an American citizen. \"It is the greatest privilege in the world,\" said Trump. \"I'm an immigrant. And let me tell you, no one values the freedom and opportunity of America more than me, both as an independent woman, and as someone who immigrated to America.\" I'm an immigrant. And let me tell you, no one values the freedom and opportunity of America more than me, both as an independent woman, and as someone who immigrated to America. Melania Trump Melania Trump also spoke about the joys of motherhood and raising her child with Donald Trump, Barron. And she said that should she become first lady, she'd be an advocate for women and children. Regarding children, Trump outlined what she says will be one of her main causes as first lady: fighting youth bullying, in person and online. \"Our culture has gotten too mean and too rough, especially to children and teenagers,\" said Trump. \"It is never O.K. when a 12-year-old girl or boy is mocked, bullied or attacked. It is terrible when that happens on the playground and it is absolutely unacceptable when it is done by someone with no name hiding on the Internet.\" She continued, \"We have to find a better way to talk to each other, to disagree with each other, to respect each other. We must find better ways to honor and support the basic goodness of our children, especially in social media. It will be one of the main focuses of my work if I'm privileged enough to become your first lady.\" Her condemnation of online bullying, especially in social media, could be seen as ironic, given her husband's particularly combative persona on Twitter. But after her speech, several in the crowd said that what Trump does is different than the behavior his wife called out. Helen Tracy from Marlton, N.J. said of Trump's Twitter history, \"He's not going after kids. He's not going after innocent people ... He's really after going after people in the Democratic Party or people who are in the media. So I think that's all fair game when you're running for office.\" Another Trump supporter in the crowd took time to defend Donald Trump and his history with women, after weeks of stories documenting allegations of sexual harassment and lewd comments from Trump. \"I have said worse things about men, than Donald Turmp has said about women,\" said Micky DiBella. Her friend, Joanne DiGiuseppe said many have criticized Trump and his behavior unfairly. \"Everybody's high and mighty, during this election.\" But she admitted that in spite of her and most of her friends supporting Trump, he has a problem with women voters, especially in suburbs like Berwyn. \"He is having trouble,\" she said. \"And the women around this area, are statistically not for Trump.\"",

As presidential candidates travel the country, they often deliver the same speech, or close to it. We are annotating speeches delivered by both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton to give you a sense of what they are talking about regularly, and how they say it. To think about the structure of a Hillary Clinton stump speech, imagine a book shelf. Clinton probably has 50 books on the shelf, various elements of a speech, anecdotes, policies she talks about, themes, turns of phrase. For each speech she grabs a bunch of different books off the shelf. So, even if she gives three speeches at different events in the same day, they will be three totally different speeches, made up of things she says regularly. And she is constantly adding to the library, each time there is a development in the campaign, Donald Trump says something she wants to riff on or she gives a major policy speech. Here, we take a closer look at how a speech Clinton delivered on Sept. 6 in Tampa, Fla. lines up to her \"stump\": Hello, Tampa! Hello, USF! I know I'm only the second most exciting thing that's happened here in the last few days. Your big win to open your football season got some attention. [Clinton always offers a little bit of local color at the top of her speeches, and sometimes as is the case later in this speech, she gets into a more in depth discussion of a policy matter related to the place she is speaking. For instance in New Hampshire she often talks about heroin and opioid addiction. In Philadelphia in April she cited crime statistics and talked about a shooting days earlier and in North Carolina and Wisconsin she talks about voting rights and voter ID laws.] But I am always happy to be at a university that is doing such a superb job in preparing the next generation of students. I had the great privilege of speaking to your president, Dr. Genshaft. Thank you. And I will talk in a minute about some of what I've learned about USF and why I think a lot of what you do here is a model for what we need to do in higher education. But for me it's exciting to be here with so many friends. I want to start by thanking Mary Lent, who just introduced me. Air Force reservist, former commander of the 927th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron, a woman who has served her country with honor and distinction. I would be proud to be her commander-in-chief. I want to thank your extraordinary mayor, Bob Buckhorn. Bob is an example of the kind of leader who gets things done by bringing people together, setting big goals and working to achieve them. That's exactly what I want to do as president, and I look forward to working with Bob and the people of this great city and region. And that includes a longtime friend of mine, State Senator Arthenia Joyner. I have known Arthenia long before she was in elected office, but she's always been an activist, always trying to make things better for people. I've known her for, oh, I hate to admit it, 25 years, and I am so grateful she is my friend. [One thing Clinton always does is thank dignitaries at the beginning of her speeches. Every politician does this, but she takes it to another level, talking about how she knows the people, thanking lower profile politicians like city council members and often thanking the young organizers working on her campaign in the local offices, by name.] This is the countdown to one of the most important elections in our lifetimes. No matter what your age, this is going to determine so much about your futures, the futures of our children and grandchildren. The stakes could not be higher. Everyone knows what an important state Florida is, and it's not just because it's always a hard-fought state; it's because Florida shows all of the excitement, the dynamism, the opportunities as well as the challenges and problems that we have to face together. So we have 62 days \u2013 62 days to make the case. And I can't do it without you. And I'm here to lay out my case one more time and to ask for your help, because every single vote counts. Our campaign set a goal in July. We launched a drive to register three million Americans to vote this election. We have hosted thousands of events across the country, including right here in Florida. And today I'm asking every one of you to give us some of your precious time to be part of this campaign. And I'm going to run through some of the reasons why every single person here has a real stake in making sure our country heads into the future with confidence and optimism, that we truly are stronger together. [Stronger Together is Clinton's campaign slogan, visible on signs all over her events. She uses the phrase multiple times with different meaning in virtually every speech.] Because that's what will determine whether we have the economy that produces more good jobs with rising incomes; whether we have an education system that prepares our young people for the jobs of the future; whether college is affordable; whether student debt can be paid back; whether our health care system works; whether we lead the world with strength and steadiness, working with allies and partners to make sure that we move toward peace and prosperity. There is an exciting, bold agenda before us, but it cannot be done by any one person. It must be done by all of us, and that is something that Donald Trump does not understand. Among the many troubling things that were said at his convention \u2013 and honestly, I sometimes didn't recognize what country they were talking about. It was so dire, so dark, so divisive, so dangerous. But among the things he said was, 'I alone can fix it.' Think of who that leaves out \u2013 our men and women in uniform, troops on the front line; people like Mary who put on the uniform of the Air Force to serve our country. Think about the police and firefighters who rush toward danger. Think about those brave police officers and emergency responders in Orlando when the Pulse nightclub was attacked. Think about all the teachers, the educators, the professors, the staff who work to give young people a much better chance in the race of life. Think about all the hardworking people who can't build a house by themselves, can't erect one of Donald Trump's skyscrapers by themselves. Think of all the small businesses that take a big chance \u2013 my dad was a small businessman. I know what a chance it is. He couldn't do it alone. He needed customers. He needed suppliers. He needed workers. Americans don't say, 'I alone can fix it.' We say, 'We'll fix it together, just watch us \u2013 nobody, nobody can solve problems better than we can.' [Clinton added this section to her stump speech collection at another rally in Tampa, Fla. on the day after Donald Trump's convention speech. It is a theme she now comes back to regularly. Notice the local touches throughout, mentioning the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando and shouting out to the woman who introduced her at the event.] And I want to be a president for all Americans, not some Americans \u2013 Democrats, Republicans, independents, every single American. I want to be the president for those who vote for me and those who vote against me because I want to bring our country together. I'm very proud that Tim Kaine and I are running a campaign of issues, not insults. Because I believe anybody who is asking for your vote for the most important job not just in the country but in the world should tell you what they plan to do. I do have this \u2013 I guess it's an old-fashioned idea: If you're going to ask people for their vote, they ought to have some idea what they're voting for. [Clinton talks frequently about her plans. She's been rolling out policy papers, fact sheets and proposals since the very beginning of her campaign. Often in speeches, she talks about people mocking her for having so many plans, but she goes on to say the plans and details are important because these issues are important for people's lives. If her campaign motto weren't \"Stronger Together\" it might well be \"Hillary Clinton: I have a lot of plans.\"] And I don't think it's enough to say, 'Oh, I'll tell you later.' I think it's important to lay it out and to tell you how it's going to be paid for. And that's why starting today, especially for young people but really for everybody, we are putting out a book. It's called 'Stronger Together.' And in it, it shows this is more than a slogan for the campaign. This is a blueprint for America's future. Among the things that we talk about is the core of our agenda, as laid out in this book. It is building an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. [This is a phrase Clinton has been using literally since the very first day of her campaign. It is the most consistent phrase in her speech.] We're going to make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II. Infrastructure jobs like those here at the port. Our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, they need work and there are millions of jobs to be done. And in addition to what you can see, what about our water systems, our sewer systems? We need a new modern electric grid to be able to take in clean, renewable energy that can then move us toward that future we seek. [Although Clinton has a whole book full of policy proposals, in her speeches she tends not to get into great detail. They end up coming out in her speeches more like a big long list of ideas rather than details about exactly how they would work or how she would get there. In a way you could see her stump speech as a series of lists tied together by anecdotes.] I have a plan to install a half a billion solar panels by the end of my first term. And enough clean energy to power every home in America by the end of my second term. And I want young people especially to be part of this, to be in science, technology, engineering, manufacturing, creating this future that will determine the quality of your lives and the competitiveness of our economy. We also have to finish extending broadband access to every place in America. Right now, 70 percent of our teachers say that they assign homework to their students starting in elementary school that require the kids to learn how to use the internet. I think that's great. We want to have an internet-savvy population. But here's the problem: five million homes where little kids live, where high school kids live, don't have the internet. What does that mean? That means they're already behind. It's so unfair. We're going to make this economy grow but we're also going to make it fair. We're going to have more advanced manufacturing jobs. I think we made a mistake years ago when we eliminated what used to be called vocational education. We've got to return technical education to our high schools, our community colleges. There are right now more than a million jobs that can be filled by people who are machinists, computer designers, tool and die makers. But for whatever reason they haven't been given the chance to get that training. And maybe they've been told, you know what, the only future is to go to a great university like USF. Well, that is true for a lot of people, but it's not true for everybody, and we need to make the hard work that builds America the kind of great work with respect and purpose that is going to attract a new generation. That's why you'll read what I want to do in here. [She's holding up the book]  We're going to try to make community college free. We're also going to have apprenticeship programs. I'm going to give a tax credit to any company that is willing to pay a young person while that young person is learning the job at the same time. So infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, clean, renewable energy. We can do this. We are living off the investments that our parents and grandparents made. It's time for us to step up and build America's future. And let's make it fair while we do that. That's why I've said we're going to emphasize the importance of small businesses. Right now small businesses are having a tough time in Florida and across America getting access to credit, right, and getting the kinds of regulations and overlapping expectations and standards that don't really make sense. I want to make it clean and clear and I particularly want young people with an idea for a small business to feel that they can do it. So I have proposed a moratorium for three years on student debt so you can actually get a business off the ground, get it started, make your future. [In the first week of her campaign, Clinton met a recent college graduate with a ton of student debt who was operating and trying to buy a bowling alley. His student loan debt was making it really hard to get financing to purchase the bowling alley himself. Ever since then she has been talking about recent college graduates who want to start businesses and eventually her campaign developed a proposal related to that challenge.] I also believe we should raise the national minimum wage. Anybody working full-time should not be living in poverty. And finally, let's guarantee equal pay for women's work, which will raise family income. Anyone who's willing to work hard should have enough money to raise a family. Did any of you watch any of the Democratic Convention? Well, I don't know if you saw these two young people, 17 years old, from Kansas \u2013 young man, young woman, went to the same high school, about to be seniors, get a summer job working in a pizza restaurant in their home town. They're pretty excited. I remember when I had what I thought of as my first real job. Not babysitting, not, you know, just kind of knocking around, but a real job where I had to actually show up someplace and get a paycheck. That was pretty exciting. So a young man, young woman were at our convention, and here's the story they told. They were talking together one day after work. They'd known each other. And the young woman said, you know, I'm excited because I think I'm actually going to be able to save some money for college making $8 an hour. And her friend, the young man, looked at her, and he goes, I'm making $8.15 an hour. And the young woman said, well, you didn't have any experience before this job doing this, did you? He said, no. You know I didn't. She said, well, what do you think happened? And the man said, oh, it must be a mistake. So they, together \u2013 and I give the young man a lot of credit \u2013 good guy, right? They go to tell the manager that there's been a mistake. They're doing exactly the same job, he's making 15 cents more an hour. What happens? The manager fired them both. And, you know what? That's legal. [The anecdotes change from location to location and often repeat, but Clinton regularly talks about people she's met on the campaign trail, tying their story to one policy proposal or another.] If you find out about somebody else's salary, even if you're doing exactly the same job, you can be retaliated against, including being fired in most places. And so when I say, 'Let's have equal pay,' and some people I see looking quizzical at me \u2013 they say, well, of course you've got to have equal pay. Well, yeah, if you're in the military, and the pay scale is set, or you're in the government and it's set, or you're under a union contract and it's set. But if you're in the vast majority of jobs in America, you have no idea whether you're being paid fairly. So we cannot let that continue. That's wrong in America. If you're doing the job, you deserve to get the pay. And so how are we going to fund this? I'll tell you. We're going where the money is. We're going to the people who have made the money in the last 15 years. We're going to the top 1, 10 percent, the millionaires, the billionaires. They're going to have to start paying for supporting our military, supporting our education system, supporting our healthcare system. There could not be a bigger contrast between what I propose when it comes to taxes and what Donald Trump has proposed. He actually has proposed giving trillions \u2013 and I mean that with a T \u2013 trillions in tax cuts to big corporations, millionaires, billionaires, and Wall Street money managers. That would not only explode our national debt, it would lead to massive cuts in education and healthcare, and many of his proposals would really benefit his own family, but do nothing for the remaining 99 plus percent of Americans. And, in fact, independent analysts have said this: They've looked at our plans \u2013 he doesn't have much in the way of plans, but they've looked at what he has said, and they've concluded, if we did what Trump is recommending, we would lose 3.5 million jobs in four years. If we do what I'm recommending, we stand to gain over 10 million jobs in the next four years. [Throughout her speech, Clinton presents her own proposals in contrast with her opponent's. She started talking about this research from Moody's Analytics on her bus tour right after the Democratic convention, because that's around the time the analysis came out. She chooses the most positive way to describe what the analysis says about her own plan.] And among the things that I want to do is make sure we have an education system from early childhood through adulthood, and that means I want universal pre-K, I want to help more kids get a better start, so that when they get kindergarten and first grade they're ready to learn. [Clinton talks a lot about early childhood education, and has throughout her campaign. It's something she has been working on one way or another since the beginning of her career, decades ago.] I want to work with our teachers and educators \u2013 I respect teachers and educators \u2013 and I want to give them the support they need to do the job we ask. And I want to support universities like this one. Here's one of the reasons why. 50,000 students, 40 percent on Pell grants. A lot of people would never have gotten an education if it weren't for the federal Pell grant program, right? But here's what's most impressive. A lot of schools have a lot of Pell grants. This university graduates all categories of students at the same rate. If you're a Pell grant student, a non-Pell grant student, if you're white, African-American, Latina, Latino, Asian, everybody graduates at the same rate. And why that happens is because this university makes a particular commitment to every student, and moves as quickly as possible to help kids who maybe are first generation college students \u2013 right? I've got to tell you, when I got to college \u2013 now, my father went to college on a football scholarship. I knew I wasn't going to college on a football scholarship. My mother had a very difficult childhood; she never got to go to college. So my dad couldn't really tell me much about going to college, because he basically played football for four years, and loved it. My mom couldn't tell me. So when I got to college, I felt so out of place. I was so nervous. There used to be something way back in the dark ages called collect phone calls. Where you would call collect, which meant that your parents had to pay for it, and you just waited to see whether they'd accept it. So I called home and I said, I can't \u2013 I can't do this. It's too hard. Everybody here is smarter than I am. They're better prepared than I am. I want to come home. And my father, who didn't want me to go so far away to school anyway, he said, what? Come home. My mother said, no. You have to stick it out. And if you feel the same way at the end of the year, then you can make a different decision. Of course, my mother was right. I loved it within a month or two. But I know what it feels like to show up and wonder, can you make it? Are you good enough? Are you smart enough? [When Clinton talks about herself and her background, she frequently mentions her parents. At small businesses, she talks about her dad's drapery business. Other times she talks about her mother's very difficult childhood. And in this Tampa speech, she was on a college campus, so she talked about how nervous she was when she first went to college \u2014 a story she's told before as well.] And thank goodness USF has people waiting to mentor and reassure and guide students. Every single college and university needs to have that. And then we've got to make it affordable so kids don't have to leave because they no longer have the funding that they need. And I want to do more in my effort to make childcare affordable \u2013 no family should have to pay more than 10 percent of your income on childcare \u2013 and right now, you have a lot of states where it costs more for childcare than tuition at college and university. So I'm going to do \u2013 I know you've got childcare here, but as I told the president, I want to do more to help you to make sure every student parent has a safe place to bring their child while they're studying and working, and trying to get their education. [Here's where Clinton comes back to talk about the university where she is speaking, and ties its programs into her policy proposals.] And then we're going to help everybody with student debt. How many of you have student debt? We're going to help you pay it back and pay it off quickly. We're going to get the interest rates down, we're going to give you new ways of paying it. Because right now, we have too many people laboring under student debt in a way that holds your own futures back. So we're going to lift that burden off of you, and we're also going to make sure you can get quality affordable healthcare. Every age you are, every place you are, we're going to get the costs down, premiums, co-pays, deductibles, and especially prescription drug costs. And there are two other things we're going to take on. Because I've heard about this all across America. We're going to take on helping more people with mental health and addiction problems get the help you need. So I'm excited about what we can do to create an economy, an education and health care system that works. And while we do it, we're going to be protecting the rights of Americans. All Americans. We have fought too hard, we have come too far. And that means civil rights. And it means women's rights, and gay rights, and voter rights, and workers' rights, and disability rights. And, you know, I believe with all my heart, because I've done this work my entire life. I was looking at the disability sign there. My first job out of law school was with the Children's Defense Fund. I did a lot of interesting things. And one of them was to gather evidence about why so many kids with disabilities were out of school. There was no requirement that you went to school if you were blind, deaf, in a wheelchair. And we changed the law. The first nation in the world to do that. And I am so proud of our country. So these rights are not for somebody else. We all know somebody \u2013 we all know a woman, we all know somebody in a racial or ethnic minority, we all know a worker or a voter, we all know a gay person, and we all know somebody with a disability. These are our rights. And the kinds of things that you've been hearing from Donald Trump, demeaning, defaming groups of Americans, people who have every right to be respected by someone who wants to be President of the United States, and he stands there and mocks a reporter with a disability, and he calls women pigs, and he calls Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals, and he demeans Muslims, and attacks a Gold Star family whose son died in action in Iraq \u2013 that's not who we are. So, yes, we have a lot of plans, but we also have values, my friends. And we're going to stand up for American values. [Clinton's speech tends to be a mix of attacks on Donald Trump and an affirmative message about what she is proposing. And in almost every speech these days, she talks about how Donald Trump's rhetoric about immigrants and Muslims is out of sync with American values. It's a theme that came into full relief at the Democratic convention. There the unstated message was that this wasn't a campaign between Trump and Clinton but between Trump and America, American values. Clinton has always had American flags at her events, but since the convention they have been even more prominent as a backdrop at her events.] Our book also outlines how we're going to keep our country safe from all threats. We're going to work with our allies, not insult them. We're going to stand up to our adversaries, not cozy up to them. We're going to have real plans, not claims and secret plans. [You'll notice it is 3/4 of the way through the speech before Clinton starts talking about national security. That is pretty standard for a Clinton speech. So much of her focus on the campaign trail is on domestic concerns, despite her credentials as the former secretary of state. How much Clinton emphasizes national security and foreign affairs really depends on the speech, the setting, what is happening in the news that day. It tends not to be the bulk of her speech. And she often talks about foreign policy in contrast to her opponent.] This November, the American people have a big choice to make when it comes to national security. On the one hand, we have Donald Trump \u2013 who has called the American military a disaster. Who disrespects our military leaders by saying, and I quote, 'I know more about ISIS than the generals do.' His companies \u2013 and listen to this, because I know there are a lot of veterans and a lot of, you know, active duty people based here in Tampa \u2013 his companies, Trump companies have fired veterans because they had to take time off to fulfill their military commitments. And we all saw him disparage the Khans, a Gold Star family who lost their son in a car bomb explosion in Iraq, as he ran toward it to prevent the loss of life of the people in his unit, and saving hundreds of his fellow soldiers. And when asked why he would insult a Gold Star family, he suggested that his sacrifices are somehow comparable to theirs, because he said, and again I quote \u2013 you can't make this up \u2013 he said, 'I work very, very hard. I've had tremendous success.' His whole campaign has been one long insult to all those who have worn the uniform to protect our most cherished American values. And a man who is so wrong about our veterans isn't right to serve as our commander-in-chief. And when it comes to fighting ISIS, he has been all over the map. You would have to literally map it out. He's talked about letting Syria become a free zone for ISIS. Look at the map, Donald. He's talked about sending in American ground troops. Not on my watch. That is not what we are going to do. He's even talked about using nuclear weapons. He's very loose in his talk about nukes. He says he doesn't care if other countries get them. He doesn't know why they haven't been used already. I mean, it's so mind-boggling. When I hear these things, I say, that can't be true. And then they replay it for me again. He says he has a secret plan to defeat ISIS. But the secret is, he has no plan. After all his talk, the only thing that is clear is he has no clue about what he's talking about. [This section was a new addition to Clinton's stump speech and as a result is what many of the beat writers following her campaign wrote about that day.] And rather than work with our allies, he chooses to insult them. Just last week in a few hours, he managed to turn his trip to Mexico into an embarrassing international incident. He got into a Twitter war with the President of Mexico. He is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president of the United States. [Clinton has been driving home the message since early June when she began turning her attention to the general election. No matter what else she says, Clinton finds a way in every speech to say Trump is \"temperamentally unfit\" to be president. She also seems to relish mocking Trump for his Twitter habits. She's had various digs about Trump and his tweeting over the months, though this one was added after Trump's trip to Mexico.] As president, I have a very different vision. I will give our military everything they need when they're serving overseas. I will support them with care and the benefits that they need and deserve when they come back home, including job training and mental health care. I will work closely with our allies, not just to contain ISIS, but defeat them. First, we're going to take out their stronghold in Iraq and Syria. Second, we're going to dismantle their global terror infrastructure on the ground and online. Third, we're going to bolster our defenses, including with an intelligence surge, to protect us and our allies. We will do whatever is necessary for as long as it takes to bring ISIS to justice and end their reign of terror for once and for all. And I will tell you this. I am a very patient person. I don't quit. I don't give up. I don't blink. This Sunday will be the 15th anniversary of the attack of 9/11. I was a Senator from New York. I knew people who were killed. I worked with families and the few survivors. I worked to get the health care needed by our first responders and emergency workers who ran toward danger. I worked to make our country safer and to rebuild New York and the Pentagon. [Clinton has spoken about being the junior senator from New York on 9/11 many times. But how she talks about it changes depending on the setting. Sometimes it is to make a point about bipartisanship, working with a Republican president, governor and mayor to secure recovery funding. Sometimes it is to make a point about determination and the long slow effort to get long term health care expenses covered for first responders. Sometimes it is to make a point about Americans coming together. Sometimes it is all of those things.] But I always, always was determined to do anything I could to bring bin Laden to justice. And thanks to the very patient, painstaking work of the American intelligence community, finally, when I was Secretary of State, we were given the opportunity to evaluate the best evidence we had seen in a long time. And I was honored to be part of that small group in the Situation Room advising President Obama as we went through the evidence over and over and over again, trying to decide, was it credible enough, strong enough, to take action? And if we did, what kind of action? Would it be a missile strike? Would it be a bombing? Would it be an attack by special forces? And when it came time to go around the table, these were all extremely experienced, thoughtful experts. We all gave our opinions. I was one who said I thought it was worth the risk. And I was in that small Situation Room on that day. [Clinton also talks about her time in the White House situation room for the Osama Bin Laden raid with some frequency, to make a point about the difficult choices only a president can make and to remind people that she was there, and was among those urging President Obama to go for it.] You all know the story. Some of you read the book. Some of you have seen the movies. But there's one thing I want to tell you because it demonstrates again what our values are as Americans. Remember, Donald Trump has said he would order American troops to torture. He would order American troops to murder family members of terrorists. That's what he has said, heedless of the consequences that that would lead to in terms of putting Americans all over the world at even greater risk. But here's what happened that night in Pakistan. And this is not an often-told part of the story, so I want to tell you, particularly the young people here, particularly active duty and military veterans like Mary. If you saw any of the reenactment, you know that one of the helicopters clipped its tail as it was going into the courtyard on the wall. It disabled that helicopter. Now, thankfully, every contingency had been thought through. And so we were prepared for that. The military was prepared. They could get another helicopter there to take out the SEALs who were going to have to blow up the disabled helicopter. After rushing into the compound, taking out the two bodyguards, taking out bin Laden's adult son, taking out bin Laden, they knew they had to get out of there. At any time, there could have been Pakistani military wondering, what's going on? Something's happening. And this was a military garrison town. So time was really precious. But here's what the SEALs did. Before they blew that helicopter up, they took out all the women and children, family members of terrorists, including the worst terrorist of all. They took them out of the compound, around the back to safety, before they blew that helicopter up. That, Donald Trump, is what American honor looks like. [Clinton first talked about this part of the 9/11 raid in a June speech in San Diego, to make the point that Donald Trump's suggestions about how he would deal with terrorists and their families is out of line with American values.] I want to mention just three other threats, one threat here right at home, the epidemic of gun violence. And we have got to have comprehensive background checks. Close the gun show loophole. Close the online loophole. End the ability of people on the terrorist watch list buying a gun in America. This agenda I've just briefly outlined is supported by a vast majority of Americans and a vast majority of gun owners. And it's time we all said in one voice, hey, we can respect the Second Amendment. We can respect the right to own arms. But we don't want people who shouldn't have guns in the first place killing anybody else ever again. Another threat to our country is climate change. 2015 was the hottest year on record, and the science is clear. It's real. It's wreaking havoc on communities across America. Last week's hurricane was another reminder of the devastation that extreme weather can cause, and I send my thoughts and prayers to everyone affected by Hermine. But this is not the last one that's going to hit Florida, given what's happening in the climate. Nobody knows that better than folks right here in Tampa and in the broader region. Sea levels have been rising here about an inch per decade since the 1950s. At the rate we are going, by 2030, which is not that far away, $70 billion of coastal property in this state will be flooding at high tide. And whenever our infrastructure is threatened, so too is our homeland security. The next president will have to work with communities like Tampa's to prepare for future storms. When I'm in the Oval Office, I'm going to work with local leaders to make smart investments in infrastructure to help protect regions from flooding and other effects of climate change. I'm going to continue to continue to work on the international and national level to try to turn the clock back, to stabilize and reduce emissions even more, to try to gain more time. But we're going to have to begin working immediately on mitigation and resilience and prevention as well. And what about Donald Trump? Well, he doesn't even believe in climate change. He says it's a hoax invented by the Chinese. And he says, 'You can't get hurt with extreme weather.' Now, this is the same guy who at one of his golf courses in some coastal place has demanded that a seawall be built to protect his golf course from rising tides. So it's all fine if it affects Donald, but if it affects the rest of humanity, he could care less. If it affects people to lose their homes or their businesses that took a lifetime to build, it doesn't matter to him. When it comes to protecting our country against natural disasters and the threat of climate change, once again Donald Trump is totally unfit and unqualified to be our president. And let's not forget the next president also has to keep our country safe from public health crises like Zika. It's painfully obvious we can't rely on the Republican Congress or Republican governors to fund an adequate response. They can't help themselves from playing games even when lives are on the line. I call on all Republicans to put people before politics and finally vote in favor of a clean funding bill to fight Zika right here in Florida. But the failure of the Republicans in Congress, including your Republican Senator, means that we can't always count on them, can we? So last month I announced that as president, I will create a public health rapid response fund to be available when emergencies occur, to have a consistent budget to better enable government agencies at all levels to quickly respond to major public health crises and pandemics. This will complement our efforts to prepare our country to deal with those challenges, and because of climate change, we're going to have more of them. Because of mobility around the world, you can get on a plane in Africa and bring Ebola to the United States. You can be a mosquito in Brazil and make your way to Florida. We've got to be better prepared. It's always better to invest a penny in the front end than to have to pay many dollars after the crisis has already occurred. That's why it is time that when we talk about protecting public health, to put politics aside and put our people's needs first. Now, I'm excited about doing all of this with you, for you, on your behalf. But I can't do it without you. And here's what I'm asking. The deadline to register voters is October 11th. If any of you are not registered, or you're not sure you are registered, or you're a student and you're registered somewhere else but it would be more convenient to vote here, you have until October 11th. So please learn how to register. You can go to iwillvote.com and learn how to do that. You can go to my website, hillaryclinton.com, and learn how to do that. We are also building volunteer teams. So you can get involved by going to hillaryclinton.com, or text 'join,' j-o-i-n, to 47246. Or you can sign up here today \u2013 are there people with clipboards somewhere around here? On the way out, I guess. You can sign up here today to have a volunteer registration shift. [She always makes some variation on this pitch, encouraging people to sign up for text messages from the campaign and to put in time volunteering. There are two major purposes for a campaign rally/speech \u2014 to get news coverage and to energize and mobilize the people in the room. Many in attendance are already volunteers, but seeing the candidate can get them more excited about putting in even more hours. One person I interviewed at this event had been volunteering, making phone calls for the campaign and had just decided to open up his home to let a campaign staffer stay there while working to get out the vote.] And you can also apply, if you're really interested, to our Get Out the Vote fellowship program. We're going to organize special groups to get people to the polls, and we need you. This state has so much promise, and I want to be the best president that you could possibly have in Florida. I want to work on all of these issues, everything that's in this blueprint that we have published. And I want particularly to give the young people of this university, this state, this country, the best shot you can have to be part of the American dream however you define that. Many of us who came before know that there were barriers in the way. When I was a young woman, there were schools I couldn't go to, jobs I couldn't get, scholarships I wasn't eligible for, just because I was a woman. And a lot of those barriers have been knocked down. For every African American, Latino, Asian American, Native American, gay American, you know that barriers have been knocked down. But they're not all down, and we got to make sure they're all gone and that no demagogue can ever bring them back and can ever exploit the fears and insecurities of the American people. [\"Breaking Down Barriers\" was an earlier campaign motto for Clinton, one that lasted from February through June and she still uses some of that language in her speech from time to time.] So please, vote this year like your future depends on it because it does. And if you give me the great honor of serving as your president, I will get up every single day in that White House and I will work my heart out for those better jobs, better educational opportunities, better health care with quality and affordability, protecting our rights, protecting our country, unifying America, because we need to be the United States, not the Divided States of America. And yes, remember, as that sign over there says \u2013 I believe this, too \u2013 'Love Trumps Hate.' Let's have a future that proves that's true! Thank you all! God bless you!\"",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton gave a big nod to Bernie Sanders in her acceptance speech \u2014 and for good reason. She'll need backing from his young, diverse supporters \u2014 who are also being wooed by Donald Trump.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Hillary Clinton made her own direct appeal last night to young voters here in Philadelphia when she thanked Bernie Sanders. And that drew raucous applause. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: And to all of your supporters here and around the country, I want you to know I've heard you. Your cause is our cause. (APPLAUSE) GREENE: And that message was meant for many of the people our colleague, Asma Khalid, has been speaking to this week. Hey, Asma. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Hey, David. GREENE: You know, one thing I've noticed as I've been walking around the hall this week - so many young faces. And many of them, Asma, I mean, came to support Bernie Sanders. KHALID: That's right. And, you know, millennials actually now rival baby boomers as potentially the largest chunk of the electorate. That is, of course, you know, if they vote. GREENE: If they vote, and I guess if you're the Hillary Clinton campaign, you want to know if they will vote for her. I mean, could this be a problem for her, trying to get these Bernie Sanders voters who are young, to make sure they're behind her in November? KHALID: You know, David, it's hard to suss out exactly where young voters stand at this point. In the arena this week, and I'm sure you heard, there were boos coming from some Bernie Sanders supporters in the stands. So there are certainly skeptics. One young woman, Jen Ramos, she's a Bernie Sanders delegate from Texas. And she, I would say, is kind of the embodiment of some of the issues that matter most to her generation. JEN RAMOS: I am a minority in every sense of the word. I am a female. I am Hispanic. I am under the age of 30. I work as a waitress, where the federal minimum wage for a wait staff has not changed since 1992. I am the daughter of a single mother. All these different social issues that I've had to deal with in my entire life are the reasons that engage me into being politically motivated. And this is what brings me to the polls. KHALID: And, David, she was sporting a whole bunch of Bernie Sanders buttons all over her. But she told me that she does intend to vote for Clinton in November. That was kind of the majority opinion among the young Bernie Sanders supporters I spoke to, is that they may not love Hillary Clinton, they may not canvass for her, but they will vote for her. GREENE: If Hillary Clinton wanted to take younger people and take them to that next level from just planning tentatively to vote to actually being really engaged, are there issues that she should think about? KHALID: David, this is the most diverse generation to date. And some of the census data I've seen suggests that more than 40 percent of millennials identify as minorities. Issues of racial equality come up time and again in some of my conversations. But overall, regardless of race, I've heard a lot about income inequality, college affordability, immigration and reducing the role of money in politics. I did go to a millennial town hall this week, and I met a young black woman. Her name is Osaremen Okolo. And she kind of explained the Hillary Clinton-Bernie Sanders divide in her generation this way. OSAREMEN OKOLO: I think based on your background, based on the color of your skin, on your ethnicity, it's much easier for you to say that you are never Hillary in an election between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. I think it takes a sort of privilege to be able to say that. KHALID: So, David, this is a point I heard time and again, actually, this week when I was talking to young voters of color. And that's the sense that if you are black or Latino or Muslim - they feel that there is more at stake in this election with Donald Trump on the Republican side and that perhaps their very presence, their very identity in this country is under threat. And therefore, they don't think that they can vote for a third-party candidate. GREENE: So more pressure to vote for Hillary Clinton regardless of what they have felt about her coming to this point. KHALID: And, David, polling from the Harvard Institute of Politics actually reinforces that idea. They found really divergent favorable-unfavorable ratings for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump by race. In other words, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton seem to be equally unpopular among young white women. But you see Hillary Clinton doing much better among black and brown young women. And that bore out in interviews that I've done all week. GREENE: So, Asma, we see those numbers, you know, among blacks, among Latinos. Hillary Clinton has that support. But we might not know how passionate it is. KHALID: That's true, David. I mean, and look, that's also only a chunk of the millennial generation. Clinton's unpopularity among millennials as a whole could impact turnout this November. And we've already seen Donald Trump try to woo some of those Bernie Sanders supporters. GREENE: Asma, thanks a lot. KHALID: You're welcome.

            "article_content": "Editor's note: This has been updated at 1:25 p.m. ET Friday with additional fact-checking information. Hillary Clinton accepted the Democratic nomination for president Thursday night, delivering a speech that lays out her plan to address terrorist threats and create jobs. NPR's politics team annotated Clinton's speech below. Portions commented on are highlighted, followed by analysis, context and fact check in italics. (You can read our fact check of Donald Trump's speech at the Republican National Convention last week here.) Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you all so so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all very, very much. Thank you for that amazing welcome. Thank you all for the great convention that we've had. [A few thank yous at the top of a speech are not uncommon, but look at all the people Clinton thanks here at the top of her speech. This is something she does at every single campaign event. She thanks local elected officials, she thanks her top volunteers and campaign organizers by name. The scale and consistency of the thank yous are a trademark of Clinton's understated campaign style. \u2013- Tamara Keith] And Chelsea, thank you. I'm so proud to be your mother and so proud of the woman you've become. Thank you for bringing Marc into our family, and Charlotte and Aidan into the world. And Bill, that conversation we started in the law library 45 years ago, it is still going strong. You know, that conversation has lasted through good times that filled us with joy, and hard times that tested us. And I've even gotten a few words in along the way. On Tuesday night, I was so happy to see that my explainer-in-chief is still on the job. I'm also grateful to the rest of my family and to the friends of a lifetime. For all of you whose hard work brought us here tonight, and to those of you who joined this campaign this week. Thank you. What a remarkable week it's been. We heard the man from Hope, Bill Clinton. [Bill Clinton grew up in Hope, Ark., and The Man From Hope is the title of a biographical film shown during the 1992 Democratic National Convention. The last line of Bill Clinton's acceptance speech in 1992 was: \"I end tonight where it all began for me: I still believe in a place called Hope.\" \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] And the man of Hope, Barack Obama. America is stronger because of President Obama's leadership, and I'm better because of his friendship. We heard from our terrific vice president, the one and only Joe Biden. He spoke from his big heart about our party's commitment to working people, as only he can do. And first lady Michelle Obama reminded us that our children are watching, and the president we elect is going to be their president, too. And for those of you out there who are just getting to know Tim Kaine \u2014 you will soon understand why the people of Virginia keep promoting him: from city council and mayor, to governor, and now senator. And he will make the whole country proud as our vice president. And ... I want to thank Bernie Sanders. Bernie, Bernie, your campaign inspired millions of Americans, particularly the young people who threw their hearts and souls into our primary. [Sanders won 12 million votes in the Democratic primaries, to Clinton's 15.8 million, according to RealClearPolitics. And Clinton is right about young people's devotion to Sanders: As the Washington Post's Aaron Blake found, Sanders won more under-30 votes this primary season than Clinton and Trump combined. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] You've put economic and social justice issues front and center, where they belong. And to all of your supporters here and around the country: I want you to know, I've heard you. Your cause is our cause. [After the speech, I spoke to several Sanders supporters in the arena who appreciated the acknowledgement but still weren't convinced that she really meant it. \u2014 Tamara Keith] Our country needs your ideas, energy and passion. That is the only way we can turn our progressive platform into real change for America. We wrote it together \u2014 now let's go out and make it happen together. My friends, we've come to Philadelphia \u2014 the birthplace of our nation \u2014 because what happened in this city 240 years ago still has something to teach us today. We all know the story. But we usually focus on how it turned out \u2014 and not enough on how close that story came to never being written at all. When representatives from 13 unruly colonies met just down the road from here, some wanted to stick with the king. And some wanted to stick it to the king. The revolution hung in the balance. Then somehow, they began listening to each other, compromising, finding common purpose. And by the time they left Philadelphia, they had begun to see themselves as one nation. That's what made it possible to stand up to a king. That took courage. They had courage. Our Founders embraced the enduring truth that we are stronger together. Now, now America is once again at a moment of reckoning. Powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart. Bonds of trust and respect are fraying. And just as with our founders, there are no guarantees. It truly is up to us. We have to decide whether we all will work together so we can all rise together. Our country's motto is \"e pluribus unum\": out of many, we are one. Will we stay true to that motto? Well, we heard Donald Trump's answer last week at his convention. He wants to divide us from the rest of the world, and from each other. He's betting that the perils of today's world will blind us to its unlimited promise. He's taken the Republican Party a long way from \"Morning in America\" to \"Midnight in America.\" He wants us to fear the future and fear each other. Well, you know, a great Democratic President Franklin Delano Roosevelt came up with the perfect rebuke to Trump more than 80 years ago, during a much more perilous time: \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\" Now we are clear-eyed about what our country is up against. But we are not afraid. We will rise to the challenge, just as we always have. We will not build a wall. Instead, we will build an economy where everyone who wants a good job can get one. And we'll build a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who are already contributing to our economy! We, we will not ban a religion. We will work with all Americans and our allies to fight and defeat terrorism. [Donald Trump initially called for a temporary ban on all Muslims entering the U.S. following the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist attack last December. But he now talks about fighting terrorism through a temporary ban on people from countries with a known history of terrorism. \u2014 Tamara Keith] There's a lot of work to do. Too many people haven't had a pay raise since the crash. There's too much inequality. Too little social mobility. Too much paralysis in Washington. Too many threats at home and abroad. But just look for a minute at the strengths we bring as Americans to meet these challenges. We have the most dynamic and diverse people in the world. We have the most tolerant and generous young people we've ever had. We have the most powerful military. The most innovative entrepreneurs. The most enduring values: freedom and equality, justice and opportunity. We should be so proud that those words are associated with us. I have to tell you, as your secretary of state, I went to 112 countries. When people hear those words, they hear America. So don't let anyone tell you that our country is weak. We're not. Don't let anyone tell you we don't have what it takes. We do. And most of all, don't believe anyone who says, \"I alone can fix it.\" Yes, those were actually Donald Trump's words in Cleveland. And they should set off alarm bells for all of us. Really? I alone can fix it? Isn't he forgetting? Troops on the front lines. Police officers and firefighters who run toward danger. Doctors and nurses who care for us. Teachers who change lives. Entrepreneurs who see possibilities in every problem. Mothers who lost children to violence and are building a movement to keep other kids safe. He's forgetting every last one of us. Americans don't say, \"I alone can fix it.\" We say, \"We'll fix it together.\" [In his convention speech, Trump did say \"I alone can fix it\" \u2014 he was referring to the political system he sees as broken. Clinton first used this line of attack the Friday after the GOP convention and it has been well-received by supporters ever since. Clinton is taking the phrase beyond Trump's original context, but there are certainly other instances in his convention speech and others where he has portrayed himself as the one who can fix various ills from ISIS to the economy. \u2014 Tamara Keith] And remember, remember: Our Founders fought a revolution and wrote a Constitution so America would never be a nation where one person had all the power. Two-hundred-and-forty years later, we still put our faith in each other. Look at what happened in Dallas after the assassinations of five brave police officers. Police Chief David Brown asked the community to support his force, maybe even join them. And you know how the community responded? Nearly 500 people applied in just 12 days. [According to data posted on the Dallas Police Department Facebook page, 467 people applied to the department between July 8 and July 20. That's more than triple the 136 people that applied between June 8 and June 20. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] That's how Americans answer when the call for help goes out. Twenty years ago, I wrote a book called It Takes a Village. And a lot of people looked at the title and asked, \"What the heck do you mean by that?\" This is what I mean. None of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community or lift a country totally alone. America needs every one of us to lend our energy, our talents, our ambition to making our nation better and stronger. I believe that with all my heart. That's why \"Stronger Together\" is not just a lesson from our history. It's not just a slogan for our campaign. It's a guiding principle for the country we've always been and the future we're going to build. A country where the economy works for everyone, not just those at the top. Where you can get a good job and send your kids to a good school, no matter what zip code you live in. A country where all our children can dream, and those dreams are within reach. Where families are strong, communities are safe, and yes, where love trumps hate. That's the country we're fighting for. That's the future we're working toward. And so, my friends, it is with humility, determination and boundless confidence in America's promise that I accept your nomination for president of the United States! Now, sometimes, sometimes the people at this podium are new to the national stage. As you know, I'm not one of those people. I've been your First Lady, served eight years as a senator from the great state of New York. Then I represented all of you as secretary of state. But my job titles only tell you what I've done. They don't tell you why. The truth is, through all these years of public service, the \"service\" part has always come easier to me than the \"public\" part. I get it that some people just don't know what to make of me. So let me tell you. The family I'm from, well, no one had their name on big buildings. My family were builders of a different kind. Builders in the way most American families are. They used whatever tools they had \u2014 whatever God gave them \u2014 and whatever life in America provided \u2014 and built better lives and better futures for their kids. My grandfather worked in the same Scranton lace mill for 50 years. Because he believed that if he gave everything he had, his children would have a better life than he did. And he was right. My dad, Hugh, made it to college. He played football at Penn State and enlisted in the Navy after Pearl Harbor. When the war was over, he started his own small business, printing fabric for draperies. I remember watching him stand for hours over silk screens. He wanted to give my brothers and me opportunities he never had. And he did. My mother, Dorothy, was abandoned by her parents as a young girl. Sheended up on her own at 14, working as a housemaid. She was saved by the kindness of others. Her first-grade teacher saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and brought extra food to share the entire year. The lesson she passed on to me, years later, stuck with me: No one gets through life alone. We have to look out for each other and lift each other up. And she made sure I learned the words from our Methodist faith: \"Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as ever you can.\" So, I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund, going door-to-door in New Bedford, Mass., on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school. I remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house. She told me how badly she wanted to go to school \u2014 it just didn't seem possible in those days. And I couldn't stop thinking of my mother and what she'd gone through as a child. It became clear to me that simply caring is not enough. To drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. You need both understanding and action. So we gathered facts. We built a coalition. And our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities. It's a big idea, isn't it? Every kid with a disability has the right to go to school. But how, how do you make an idea like that real? You do it step-by-step, year-by-year, sometimes even door-by-door. My heart just swelled when I saw Anastasia Somoza representing millions of young people on this stage \u2014 because we changed our law to make sure she got an education. So it's true. I sweat the details of policy \u2014 whether we're talking about the exact level of lead in the drinking water in Flint, Mich., the number of mental health facilities in Iowa, or the cost of your prescription drugs. Because it's not just a detail if it's your kid \u2014 if it's your family. It's a big deal. And it should be a big deal to your president, too. After the four days of this convention, you've seen some of the people who've inspired me. People who let me into their lives, and became a part of mine. People like Ryan Moore and Lauren Manning. They told their stories Tuesday night. I first met Ryan as a 7-year-old. He was wearing a full body brace that must have weighed 40 pounds, because I leaned over to lift him up. Children like Ryan kept me going when our plan for universal health care failed and kept me working with leaders of both parties to help create the Children's Health Insurance Program that covers 8 million kids in our country. [CHIP had 8.1 million kids on the rolls as of 2015. And while Clinton wasn't in the legislature, she was instrumental in getting it passed, as PolitiFact found earlier this year. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] Lauren Manning, who stood here with such grace and power, was gravely injured on 9/11. It was the thought of her, and Debbie St. John who you saw in the movie, and John Dolan and Joe Sweeney, and all the victims and survivors, that kept me working as hard as I could in the Senate on behalf of 9/11 families, and our first responders who got sick from their time at Ground Zero. I was thinking of Lauren, Debbie and all the others 10 years later in the White House Situation Room when President Obama made the courageous decision that finally brought Osama bin Laden to justice. And in this campaign, I've met many more people who motivate me to keep fighting for change. And, with your help, I will carry all of your voices and stories with me to the White House. And you heard, you heard from, from Republicans and Independents who are supporting our campaign. Well, I will be a president for Democrats, Republicans and independents, for the struggling, the striving, the successful, for all those who vote for me and for those who don't. For all Americans together. Tonight, tonight we've reached a milestone in our nation's march toward a more perfect union: the first time that a major party has nominated a woman for president. Standing here, standing here as my mother's daughter, and my daughter's mother, I'm so happy this day has come. I'm happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between. I'm happy for boys and men, too \u2014 because when any barrier falls in America, it clears the way for everyone. After all, when there are no ceilings, the sky's the limit. So let's keep going, let's keep going until every one of the 161 million women and girls across America has the opportunity she deserves to have. But even more important than the history we make tonight, is the history we will write together in the years ahead. Let's begin with what we're going to do to help working people in our country get ahead and stay ahead. Now, I don't think President Obama and Vice President Biden get the credit they deserve for saving us from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes. Our economy is so much stronger than when they took office. Nearly 15 million new private-sector jobs. Twenty million more Americans with health insurance. And an auto industry that just had its best year ever. [The jobs-gain figure Clinton cites is from the trough, which came about a year after President Obama took office. The insurance figure includes those who gained coverage through new insurance exchanges, expansion of Medicaid, and changes in the private insurance market that allow young adults to stay on their parents' plan. U.S. auto sales hit 17.5 million last year, an all-time high. \u2014 Scott Horsley] Now that's real progress, but none of us can be satisfied with the status quo. Not by a long shot. We're still facing deep-seated problems that developed long before the recession and have stayed with us through the recovery. I've gone around our country talking to working families. And I've heard from many who feel like the economy sure isn't working for them. Some of you are frustrated \u2014 even furious. And you know what? You're right. It's not yet working the way it should. Americans are willing to work \u2014 and work hard. But right now, an awful lot of people feel there is less and less respect for the work they do. And less respect for them, period. Democrats, we are the party of working people. But we haven't done a good enough job showing we get what you're going through, and we're going to do something to help. So tonight I want to tell you tonight how we will empower Americans to live better lives. My primary mission as president will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the United States. From my first day in office to my last, especially in places that for too long have been left out and left behind. From our inner cities to our small towns, from Indian Country to Coal Country. From communities ravaged by addiction to regions hollowed out by plant closures. And here's what I believe. I believe America thrives when the middle class thrives. I believe that our economy isn't working the way it should because our democracy isn't working the way it should. That's why we need to appoint Supreme Court justices who will get money out of politics and expand voting rights, not restrict them. [With this oversimplified phrase, Clinton is effectively calling for court-mandated public financing, which is extremely unlikely. \u2014 Peter Overby] And if necessary, we will pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. [Passing a constitutional amendment would very likely be really, really, really hard in the current political climate of gridlock. Proposing one requires either a two-thirds vote of the House and Senate or a constitutional convention, which two-thirds of the states would have to call for, according to the National Archives. To be ratified, it requires 38 of the 50 states to approve it. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] [And not even advocates of this one can agree on language that avoids other First Amendment issues. \u2014 Peter Overby] I believe American corporations that have gotten so much from our country should be just as patriotic in return. Many of them are. But too many aren't. It's wrong to take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips with the other. And I believe Wall Street can never, ever be allowed to wreck Main Street again. And I believe in science. I believe climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying clean energy jobs. I believe that when we have millions of hardworking immigrants contributing to our economy, it would be self-defeating and inhumane to try to kick them out. Comprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy and keep families together \u2014 and it's the right thing to do. [The Congressional Budget Office projected the immigration bill passed by the Senate in 2013 would boost the economy and reduce the federal deficit, while slightly reducing wages. \u2014 Scott Horsley] So, whatever party you belong to, or if you belong to no party at all, if you share these beliefs, this is your campaign. [This is part of Clinton's occasional outreach to both Sanders supporters and people she once called \"reasonable Republicans.\" At the convention Thursday night, speakers included a former Ronald Reagan staffer and a woman who is leading a group of Republican women supporting Clinton. \u2013- Tamara Keith] If you believe that companies should share profits with their workers, not pad executive bonuses, join us. If you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage, and no one working full time should have to raise their children in poverty, join us. If you believe that every man, woman and child in America has the right to affordable health care, join us. If you believe that we should say \"no\" to unfair trade deals, that we should stand up to China, that we should support our steelworkers and autoworkers and homegrown manufacturers, then join us. If you believe we should expand Social Security and protect a woman's right to make her own health care decisions, then join us. And yes, yes, if you believe that your working mother, wife, sister or daughter deserves equal pay, join us. That's how we're going to sure this economy works for everyone, not just those at the top. Now, you didn't hear any of this, did you, from Donald Trump at his convention. He spoke for 70-odd minutes \u2014 and I do mean odd. And he offered zero solutions. [Trump's acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland offered a number of measures to address the various problems he defined. They included Trump's ban on Muslims entering the United States, which he now describes as a proposal for the U.S. to \"suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place.\" Trump also reiterated his call for a border wall to combat illegal immigration, new trade policies (in addition to renegotiating \"bad trade agreements\"), infrastructure investment and tax reform. Clinton has argued these proposals are wrong or not feasible, and therefore aren't solutions. But the statement suggests Trump's speech was devoid of specific proposals, which is not true. \u2014 Arnie Seipel] But we already know he doesn't believe these things. No wonder he doesn't like talking about his plans. You might have noticed, I love talking about mine. In my first hundred days, we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II. Jobs in manufacturing, clean energy, technology and innovation, small business, and infrastructure. If we invest in infrastructure now, we'll not only create jobs today, but lay the foundation for the jobs of the future. And we will also transform the way we prepare our young people for those jobs. Bernie Sanders and I will work together to make college tuition-free for the middle class and debt-free for all! [Clinton originally had a \"debt-free\" college plan, which was designed to ensure that people could attend college without taking out loans; that meant the student had to work and that the family would contribute what it could. But in July, she moved further in her primary rival Bernie Sanders' direction, proposing that college tuition at public universities for students from families making $125,000 or less (a threshold that would be phased in) would be free. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] We will also, we will also liberate millions of people who already have student debt. It's just not right that Donald Trump can ignore his debts, and students and families can't refinance their debts. And something we don't say often enough: Sure, college is crucial, but a four-year degree should not be the only path to a good job. [The income gap between high school and college grads is bigger for millennials than it was for Generation Xers, baby boomers and the Silent Generation, according to a 2014 Pew Research Center report. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] We will help more people learn a skill or practice a trade and make a good living doing it. We will give small businesses like my dad's a boost. Make it easier to get credit. Way too many dreams die in the parking lots of banks. In America, if you can dream it, you should be able to build it. And we will help you balance family and work. And you know what, if fighting for affordable child care and paid family leave is playing the \"woman card,\" then deal me in. Now, here's the other thing, we're not only going to make all these investments, we're going to pay for every single one of them. And here's how: Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes. This is not because we resent success, because when more than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent, that's where the money is, and we are going to follow the money. [In his convention speech, Bernie Sanders said something similar, saying that 85 percent of the income gains had gone to the top 1 percent \u2014 a stat that PolitiFact called \"half true\" because it was outdated. In 2014 and 2015, they write, the 99 percent's incomes recovered, and the top 1 percent's share fell to 52 percent. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] And if companies take tax breaks and then ship jobs overseas, we'll make them pay us back. And we'll put that money to work where it belongs, creating jobs here at home! Now, now I imagine some of you are sitting at home thinking, well, that all sounds pretty good. But how are you going to get it done? How are you going to break through the gridlock in Washington? Well, look at my record. I've worked across the aisle to pass laws and treaties and to launch new programs that help millions of people. And if you give me the chance, that's what I'll do as president. But then I also imagine people are thinking out there, but Trump, he's a businessman. He must know something about the economy. Well, let's take a closer look. In Atlantic City, 60 miles from here, you will find contractors and small businesses who lost everything because Donald Trump refused to pay his bills. Now, remember what the president said last night: \"Don't boo, vote.\" People who did the work and needed the money, and didn't get it \u2014 not because he couldn't pay them, but because he wouldn't pay them. He just stiffed them. [True. Specifically, she is referring to the losses suffered by contractors on the Taj Mahal casino. The Associated Press found that Trump owed $70 million to 253 contractors when the casino opened. After the casino filed for bankruptcy about a year later, many contractors got just 33 percent of what they were owed. As a result some went out of business. [It's unclear whether Trump could have paid those bills, as Clinton argued. He was deeply overleveraged on the project, with extensive debt, and both his corporate and personal finances were in relatively poor shape at the time. \u2014 Matt Katz, WNYC] And you know that sales pitch he's making to be president? Put your faith in him \u2014 and you'll win big? That's the same sales pitch he made to all those small businesses. Then Trump walked away, and left working people holding the bag. He also talks a big game about putting America first. Well, please explain what part of \"America First\" leads him to make Trump ties in China, not Colorado. Trump suits in Mexico, not Michigan. Trump furniture in Turkey, not Ohio. Trump picture frames in India, not Wisconsin. Donald Trump says he wants to make America great again \u2014 well, he could start by actually making things in America again. Now, the choice we face in this election is just as stark when it comes to our national security. You know, anyone, anyone reading the news can see the threats and turbulence we face. From Baghdad to Kabul, to Nice and Paris and Brussels, from San Bernardino to Orlando, we're dealing with determined enemies that must be defeated. So, it's no wonder that people are anxious and looking for reassurance. Looking for steady leadership, wanting a leader who understands we are stronger when we work with our allies around the world and care for our veterans here at home. Keeping our nation safe and honoring the people who do that work will be my highest priority. I'm proud that we put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot \u2014 now we have to enforce it. And we must keep supporting Israel's security. [Experts believe the agreement has lengthened the time Iran would need to develop a nuclear bomb from weeks or months to at least a year. However, the deal has had little effect on Iran's nonnuclear troublemaking elsewhere in the region. \u2014 Scott Horsley] I'm proud that we shaped a global climate agreement \u2014 now we have to hold every country accountable to their commitments, including ourselves. And I'm proud to stand by our allies in NATO against any threat they face, including from Russia. I've laid out my strategy for defeating ISIS. We will strike their sanctuaries from the air, and support local forces taking them out on the ground. We will surge our intelligence so that we detect and prevent attacks before they happen. We will disrupt their efforts online to reach and radicalize young people in our country. It won't be easy or quick, but make no mistake \u2014 we will prevail. Now Donald Trump, Donald Trump says, and this is a quote, \"I know more about ISIS than the generals do.\" No, Donald, you don't. He thinks, he thinks that he knows more than our military because he claimed our armed forces are \"a disaster.\" [Trump said, \"Our military is a disaster,\" in a debate in Charleston, S.C., hosted by the Fox Business Network on Jan. 14, 2016. \u2014 Arnie Seipel] Well, I've had the privilege to work closely with our troops and our veterans for many years, including as a senator on the Armed Services Committee, and I know how wrong he is. Our military is a national treasure. We entrust our commander in chief to make the hardest decisions our nation faces, decisions about war and peace, life and death. A president should respect the men and women who risk their lives to serve our country \u2014 including Captain Khan and the sons of Tim Kaine and Mike Pence, both Marines. So just ask yourself: Do you really think Donald Trump has the temperament to be commander in chief? Donald Trump can't even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When he's gotten a tough question from a reporter. When he's challenged in a debate. When he sees a protester at a rally. Imagine, if you dare, imagine, imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I can't put it, I can't put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started, not by big men with self-control and restraint, but by little men \u2014 the ones moved by fear and pride. America's strength doesn't come from lashing out. It relies on smarts, judgment, cool resolve, and the precise and strategic application of power. And that's the kind of commander in chief I pledge to be. And if we're serious about keeping our country safe, we also can't afford to have a president who's in the pocket of the gun lobby. I'm not here to repeal the Second Amendment. I'm not here to take away your guns. I just don't want you to be shot by someone who shouldn't have a gun in the first place. We will work tirelessly with responsible gun owners to pass common-sense reforms and keep guns out of the hands of criminals, terrorists and all others who would do us harm. You know, for decades, people have said this issue was too hard to solve and the politics too hot to touch. But I ask you: How can we just stand by and do nothing? You heard, you saw, family members of people killed by gun violence on this stage. You heard, you saw, family members of police officers killed in the line of duty because they were outgunned by criminals. I refuse to believe we can't find common ground here. We have to heal the divides in our country. Not just on guns. But on race. Immigration. And more. And that starts with listening, listening to each other. Trying, as best we can, to walk in each other's shoes. So let's put ourselves in the shoes of young black and Latino men and women who face the effects of systemic racism, and are made to feel like their lives are disposable. Let's put ourselves in the shoes of police officers, kissing their kids and spouses goodbye every day, heading off to do a dangerous and necessary job. We will reform our criminal justice system from end to end and rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. And we will defend, we will defend all our rights \u2014 civil rights, human rights and voting rights, women's rights and workers' rights, LGBT rights and the rights of people with disabilities! And we will stand up against mean and divisive rhetoric wherever it comes from. You know, for the past year, many people made the mistake of laughing off Donald Trump's comments \u2014 excusing him as an entertainer just putting on a show. They thought he couldn't possibly mean all the horrible things he says \u2014 like when he called women \"pigs.\" Or said that an American judge couldn't be fair because of his Mexican heritage. Or when he mocks and mimics a reporter with a disability. Or insults prisoners of war like John McCain \u2014 a true hero and patriot who deserves our respect. Now, at first, at first, I admit, I couldn't believe he meant it either. It was just too hard to fathom \u2014 that someone who wants to lead our nation could say those things. Could be like that. But here's the sad truth: There is no other Donald Trump. This is it. And in the end, it comes down to what Donald Trump doesn't get: that America is great \u2014 because America is good. [After Clinton's speech, there were claims on Twitter that this quote was lifted from Alexis de Tocqueville's Democracy in America. Interestingly, the Weekly Standard found in 1995 that it is a line of unknown provenance, often misattributed to de Tocqueville. Reagan used it (by way, his speechwriters said, of Eisenhower), as well as Pat Buchanan and Bill Clinton, the Weekly Standard wrote. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] So enough with the bigotry and bombast. Donald Trump's not offering real change. He's offering empty promises. And what are we offering? A bold agenda to improve the lives of people across our country \u2014 to keep you safe, to get you good jobs, and to give your kids the opportunities they deserve. The choice is clear, my friends. Every generation of Americans has come together to make our country freer, fairer and stronger. None of us ever have or can do it alone. I know that at a time when so much seems to be pulling us apart, it can be hard to imagine how we'll ever pull together. But I'm here to tell you tonight \u2014 progress is possible. I know, I know because I've seen it in the lives of people across America who get knocked down and get right back up. And I know it, I know it from my own life. More than a few times, I've had to pick myself up and get back in the game. Like so much else in my life, I got this from my mother too. She never let me back down from any challenge. When I tried to hide from a neighborhood bully, she literally blocked the door. \"Go back out there,\" she said. And she was right. You have to stand up to bullies. You have to keep working to make things better, even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce. We lost our mother a few years ago, but I miss her every day. And I still hear her voice urging me to keep working, keep fighting for right, no matter what. That's what we need to do together as a nation. Though \"we may not live to see the glory,\" as the song from the musical Hamilton goes, \"let us gladly join the fight.\" Let our legacy be about \"planting seeds in a garden you never get to see.\" That's why we're here ... not just in this hall, but on this Earth. The Founders showed us that. And so have many others since. They were drawn together by love of country, and the selfless passion to build something better for all who follow. That is the story of America. And we begin a new chapter tonight. Yes, the world is watching what we do. Yes, America's destiny is ours to choose. So let's be stronger together, my fellow Americans. Let's look to the future with courage and confidence. Let's build a better tomorrow for our beloved children and our beloved country. And when we do, America will be greater than ever. Thank you, and may God bless you and the United States of America!",

            "article_content": "A 1996 NPR interview with Clinton has been getting renewed attention on social media. She says her political beliefs stem from a different kind of conservatism and her political beliefs have changed.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: There's a clip of a Hillary Clinton interview making the rounds on the Internet. Let's hear. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) SIMON: I mean, did you ever, back in the '60s, between when, I believe, you were Goldwater Girl and... HILLARY CLINTON: That's right. SIMON: ...Whatever you became politically? CLINTON: That's right. And I feel like my political beliefs are rooted in the conservatism that I was raised with. SIMON: Hey, I know that interviewer. Hillary Clinton was in the White House, married to President Clinton and promoting her book, \"It Takes A Village.\" That clip's gaining renewed attention because, of course, Barry Goldwater was a Republican known as Mr. Conservative. The Internet is abuzz with people who charge this exchange demonstrates something about Hillary Clinton. NPR's Tamara Keith is covering the entire 2016 presidential campaign. She heard the entire interview this week - bless her - joins us in the studios. Thanks, Tam, that must have been painful. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Oh, it was good times - 13 minutes. SIMON: I - we don't get that kind of time anymore, do we? KEITH: We don't. SIMON: Barry Goldwater was the 1964 Republican presidential nominee. What do some opponents of Mrs. Clinton think this shows about her? KEITH: Goldwater voted against the Civil Rights Act. And some liberal opponents of Hillary Clinton said that Goldwater wanted to re-segregate the United States, and they've criticized her for supporting him. SIMON: He was not, on the other hand, David Duke or even Strom Thurmond. KEITH: No, he - and he, in fact, did not want to re-segregate the United States. And the other thing to note is that Hillary Clinton wasn't old enough to vote for Barry Goldwater when she supported him. Really the larger context of that clip, which is not going around on the Internet, includes, leading up to that point, a very long discussion you had with her about Whitewater and other controversies surrounding the Clinton White House, which she blamed and continues to blame on Republicans. SIMON: What did your set of, if I may, fresh young ears notice in this interview? KEITH: (Laughter) You know, what really stands out is that if you take out a lot of the details, there's a lot of this that sounds like it could happen today. The discussion of Whitewater has echoes of the email scandal. And at one point, you asked Clinton about how her younger self, who worked on the Nixon impeachment as a young lawyer, how she would have reacted to - at the time there was this issue where all of these Whitewater documents had been missing and then suddenly reappeared. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) SIMON: I was intrigued by something. You were a lawyer in the House Judiciary Committee... CLINTON: That's right. SIMON: ...During the Watergate impeachment hearings. CLINTON: That's right. SIMON: And I - I'm just wondering that - if you could put yourself back in that frame of mind once again - if the Nixon White House had come to your committee and said those records you've been asking for for two years, we found them, suddenly we found them, and here they are, would you have accepted that explanation with a straight face? CLINTON: I think we would have been delighted. The problem back then, you'll remember, is the documents were destroyed, tapes were missing 18 and a half minutes, the White House was not cooperating. They were claiming executive privilege on every piece of paper. I think the contrast is so dramatic. We want the truth to get out. We would just love to have this matter brought to an end. KEITH: And what really stands out to me with that is how much it sounds like something she said not that long ago about the ongoing controversy over her use of a private email server for public business while she was secretary of state. Here is just a little clip from the press conference she had last year about that server. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) CLINTON: I heard just a little while ago the State Department announced they would begin to post some of my emails, which I'm very glad to hear because I want it all out there. KEITH: She wants it all out there. SIMON: Let me return to the discussion about the Goldwater clip that's been making the rounds of the web. That wasn't really what I was getting at. KEITH: No (laughter). As far as I can tell, what you were getting at was something entirely different. And your question, in light of today, seems rather prescient. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) SIMON: Would you ever run for office yourself? Do you ever think about that? CLINTON: Oh, I don't think so. No. SIMON: I mean, did you ever, back in the '60s, between when, I believe you were Goldwater Girl and... CLINTON: That's right. SIMON: ...And whatever you became politically? CLINTON: That's right. And I feel like my political beliefs are rooted in the conservatism that I was raised with. I don't recognize this new brand of Republicanism that's afoot now, which I consider to be very reactionary, not conservative in many respects. I'm very proud that I was a Goldwater Girl. And then my political beliefs changed over time. But I've always thought that the role of citizen, the role of advocate, were as important in our democracy as running for office. And so it's not anything I've ever, you know, seriously considered. KEITH: So I guess you never say never (laughter). SIMON: Yeah, times and circumstances change. KEITH: Things change. SIMON: Twenty years from now, I hope they'll call this interview prescient, Tam. Thanks very much. KEITH: Oh, I sure hope you. You're welcome.

There's an audio clip circulating on the Internet of Hillary Clinton talking about being proud of her time as a \"Goldwater Girl\" in 1964. It turns out to be an incomplete and selective excerpt of a lengthy \u2014 and still compelling (all these years later) \u2014 interview Clinton did in 1996 with Weekend Edition Saturday host Scott Simon. The whole interview is worth a listen or a read. The full transcript is below. But let's just say, the Goldwater section might not even be the most interesting part. The interview originally aired Jan. 13, 1996, and was pegged to the release of Clinton's book It Takes a Village. But most of it focuses on the various tentacles of the Whitewater scandal Clinton had been tangled up in since the start of her husband's administration. The way Clinton discusses that scandal and the various investigations will likely sound familiar. There are echoes in the way she's responded to the controversy over her use of a private email server for official business while secretary of state \u2014 and her saying that she and her husband were \"dead broke\" when they left the White House. Here's how she described Whitewater to Simon: \"You know, we've been through this now for four years, and it started off as one thing, and every time a particular set of charges are disproved and questions answered, the ground shifts.\" At the time of the interview, some much sought-after records from the law firm where Clinton was a partner in Arkansas, the Rose Law Firm, were found. It was a huge story at the time and fed theories for some, including Whitewater investigators, that Clinton was hiding something. Here's how PBS Frontline put it back then: \"Ms. Clinton and her attorney have stated publicly that the billing records confirm that, as an attorney at the Rose Firm in the mid-80's, she was not significantly involved in the representation of Jim McDougal's savings and loan, Madison Guaranty. According to the Rose records, Hillary Clinton billed Madison for 60 hours of work over a 15 month period. Ms. Clinton's attorney argues that this represents a de minimus amount of work and includes billings for work performed by Rose Finn lawyers working for Hillary Clinton at the time. \"But Whitewater investigators believe that the billing records show significant representation. They argue that the records prove that Ms. Clinton was not only directly involved in the representation of Madison, but more specifically, in providing legal work on the fraudulent Castle Grande land deal.\" Simon asked Clinton about it, referencing her time as a young lawyer working on the Nixon impeachment: SCOTT SIMON: I was intrigued by something. You are a lawyer on the House Judiciary Committee -- HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: That's right. SIMON: \u2014 during the Watergate impeachment hearings, and I'm just wondering if you could put yourself back in that frame of mind once again? If the Nixon White House had come to your committee and said, 'Those records you've been asking for for two years, we found 'em, suddenly, we found 'em. And here they are,' would you have accepted that explanation with a straight face? CLINTON: I think we would have been delighted. The problem back then, you'll remember, is that documents were destroyed, tapes were missing \u2014 18-1/2 minutes. The White House was not cooperating. They were claiming executive privilege on every piece of paper. I think the contrast is so dramatic! We want the truth to get out. We would just love to have this matter brought to an end. It's a little bit odd that here we are, both my husband and I, nearly 50 years old \u2014 which is hard to believe. We don't own a house; we own half of the house that mother lives in in order to help support her. He has his 1968 Mustang, I have my 1986 Oldsmobile Cutlass. A recent magazine said that with our legal bills we are bankrupt. So, if we had intended to trade on my position, I've done a very poor job of it. At the point in the interview where Clinton talked about her time as a \"Goldwater Girl,\" it's clear that's not really what Simon was trying to ask about. In the light of today, his question was far more prescient: SCOTT SIMON: Would you ever run for office yourself? Do you ever think about that? HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Oh, I don't think so. No. SCOTT SIMON: I mean, did you ever, back in the '60s \u2014 between when you were, I believe, you were a 'Goldwater Girl' -- HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: That's right -- SCOTT SIMON: \u2014 and whatever you became politically? HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: That's right. And I feel like my political beliefs in the conservatism that I was raised with. I don't recognize this new brand of Republicanism that's afoot now which I consider to be very reactionary, not conservative in many respects. I'm very proud that I was a 'Goldwater Girl.' And then my political beliefs changed over time. But I've always thought that the role of citizen, the role of advocate, were as important in our democracy as running for office. So, it's not anything I've ever, you know, seriously considered. As for Clinton's time as a Goldwater Girl, she volunteered for the Arizona senator's presidential campaign in 1964 when she would have been 16- and 17-years old. She and her friends wore cowgirl hats, even helped open the Barry Goldwater for President campaign office in their hometown of Park Ridge, Ill. \"It just seemed to be part of what you did. Some people became Girl Scouts, and we did politics,\" said Clinton's childhood friend Betsey Ebeling, in an interview with NPR last year. And at the time, in their little suburb, the default political setting was Republican. The clip going around the Internet leaves off the part where Clinton talks about her political beliefs changing. But that evolution is something she is asked about regularly. MSNBC's Chris Matthews brought it up last week during a televised town hall. Clinton said her father was a \"rock-ribbed conservative Republican,\" and they talked about politics around the dinner table. \"When I went off to college, I went believing I was a Republican,\" she said. \"And actually I was president of Young Republicans for a couple of months and then I decided that I was much more in the camp of people like, you know, President Johnson \u2014 trying to promote civil rights, voting rights, ending poverty.\" Here's the full transcript from the 1996 NPR interview with Scott Simon: Weekend Edition 01/13/1996 Hillary Responds To Critics Allegations SCOTT SIMON, Host: Hillary Rodham Clinton began a book tour this week, but she's not asked many questions about that book, It Takes a Village, which details Mrs. Clinton's concerns for America's children. At the same time, a Senate committee is investigating her legal and financial affairs during the mid-1980s, when she was a partner in the Rose Law Firm of Little Rock, her husband was governor of Arkansas, and the firm represented Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, a financial institution owned by a friend of the Clinton's who was also their partner in the failed investment now known as Whitewater. Just this week, a lawyer in the Rose firm, Richard Massey, disputed some of Mrs. Clinton's recollections of how the firm came to represent Madison and what she did for them. Last week an old memo was discovered which said Mrs. Clinton had ordered firings in the White House travel office. We interviewed Hillary Rodham Clinton yesterday in the Old Executive Office. FIRST LADY HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: You know, we've been through this now for four years, and it started off as one thing, and every time a particular set of charges are disproved and questions answered, the ground shifts. And there's never any stable ground to stand on to say, `OK, everybody, let's take a deep breath.' SCOTT SIMON: Well, let me ask what seems to be the question of the week. You had- for a couple of years people were interested in obtaining copies of the billing records of the Rose Law firm in Little Rock. And now, they're HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Right. SCOTT SIMON: Now, where were they all that time? HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I have no idea. But I'm delighted they were discovered, because once again they prove what I've been saying for four years, based mostly on my own memory and whatever information was revealed. And that's what I mean about the shifting ground, Scott. I mean, a month ago we were accused of destroying the records. They do turn up and I have no idea where they've been. And of course, the timing is not great for me since I'd much rather talk to you about my book than these records, but I'm delighted they're out there because they confirm what I have been saying. SCOTT SIMON: That the work you did for Madison Savings and Loan was minimal? HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Exactly. SCOTT SIMON: Did that work or any of those hours, for example, include - and I guess the records indicate this - that you made a call to a state securities commissioner at the time that Madison needed the commission's approval to proceed with the stock plan? HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well, my memory about that is that I called the office. I do not believe I ever talked with the commissioner. And the reason I called is that we didn't know - namely, Mr. Massey and the law firm - who in the securities office was to handle this kind of work, because it was something new for Arkansas. Other states had done it, and the idea was to find out whether it was legal under state law. And the securities commissioner under Arkansas law at that time had responsibility for supervising savings and loans. But I never knew who that person was, and so I called to find out. I'm not even sure that I identified myself. But I have no memory of having talked to the commissioner about this matter. I wouldn't have known what to talk about. I'm not an expert in securities law and I, as I have said repeatedly, was minimally involved in the representation. SCOTT SIMON: Let me ask- you know, with the quibbling that goes on back and forth between how many hours amount to what- HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: - Mm-hmm- SCOTT SIMON: - there's this story about a man who's got his drain stopped up, and a plumber comes over, taps it once, the drain begins to flow. And he turns to the fellow who called him and says, `That'll be $100.' And the man says, `One-hundred dollars for tapping the pipe? That's ridiculous!' And the plumber says, `No, no. That's $5 for tapping the pipe; $95 is to know where to tap it.' Now, when you are Hillary Rodham Clinton, and you are the spouse of the governor of the state, one phone call that is two minutes can mean a lot to HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well, it could, but in this instance, it did not, because despite Mr. Massey's excellent work - and he's a very fine lawyer - Madison didn't get permission to do what it wanted to do. I keep making that point, that perhaps in retrospect I would never have even picked up the phone to call and say, `Gee, who handles S&L matters in the securities commission?' I didn't think that that was anything that was inappropriate- and then to tell Mr. Massey who he should call and who he should deal with- and so, for me, the idea that we keep having these house of cards built. You know, I practiced law in Arkansas for many years. People have gone over my life and my professional work with the finest of tooth combs. And apparently they are still trying to claim that on this one instance out of all the work I did, something must have happened. Yet, to me and many others who look at this fairly, none of us can figure out what they think it was. SCOTT SIMON: I was intrigued by something. You are a lawyer on the House Judiciary Committee- HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: - That's right- SCOTT SIMON: - during the Watergate impeachment hearings, and I'm just wondering if you could put yourself back in that frame of mind once again? If the Nixon White House had come to your committee and said, `Those records you've been asking for for two years, we found 'em, suddenly, we found 'em. And here they are,' would you have accepted that explanation with a straight face? HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I think we would have been delighted. The problem back then, you'll remember, is that documents were destroyed, tapes were missing - 18-1/2 minutes. The White House was not cooperating. They were claiming executive privilege on every piece of paper. I think the contrast is so dramatic! We want the truth to get out. We would just love to have this matter brought to an end. It's a little bit odd that here we are, both my husband and I, nearly 50 years old - which is hard to believe. We don't own a house; we own half of the house that mother lives in in order to help support her. He has his 1968 Mustang, I have my 1986 Oldsmobile Cutlass. A recent magazine said that with our legal bills we are bankrupt. So, if we had intended to trade on my position, I've done a very poor job of it. SCOTT SIMON: Did you ever say anyone in the White House travel office should be fired? HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: No. But I did express concern about the reports of financial mismanagement in the travel office that pre-dated my husband coming into office. And thankfully, that was taken care of. But I did not make the decisions about what was done, nor did I direct that any particular decision be SCOTT SIMON: Is it just possible in the human game of `Telephone' that Hillary Rodham Clinton says, `I'm concerned about the travel office, we ought to look into that,' and eventually that gets translated by aides who are anxious to please you as, `Clean house,'? HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well, I can't speculate on what did or did not happen. I only know what I said and what I intended to convey. SCOTT SIMON: Mind if we talk about your book a little? HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I would love to talk about my book. [laughs] SCOTT SIMON: All right, change of pace. A lot of it is much more sad ground, because you say in the book that despite the fact that we rhetorically say children are our most important commodities - no pun intended, talking about your financial affairs- HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: - [laughs] You are so good, Scott, I love that- SCOTT SIMON: - It just occurred to me, and I said it, I'm afraid- but that you say that we often don't invest in our most precious commodities as we should. HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Right, right. Unlike stocks and bonds and commodities that are traded in a market which is out there to be invested in - and you can see the immediate return; you either make money or you lose money - our children deserve a much more careful and long-term investment. SCOTT SIMON: You talk in the book about something I believe you call `the discipline of gratitude.' HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Right, right. SCOTT SIMON: Interesting idea, that you need to remind yourself what you ought to be grateful for. HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: It is. That came to me, really, as a gift in 1993, which was a very difficult year for me personally. It started off with such a great high with my husband's inauguration, and such hopes. And then shortly after, my father was stricken by a stroke and died, our friend Vince Foster killed himself, throughout that year I knew that my mother-in-law was much, much sicker than she let on, and in the fall learned that she only had a few months to live. And indeed, she died before the year was out. So I had to really dig down pretty deep in my own resources, and luckily I had people who sent me books to read, gave me favorite scriptures, shared with me the stories of how, like me, they would just get their eyes welling up; I would be standing in a receiving line and something would remind me of my father, and I'd, you know, wonder whether my mascara was going to run. And there was a book by Henri Nouwen, the Jesuit theologian, and it was about the prodigal son. And, you know, sometimes it's good to be reminded that people don't get what they think they deserve, that life is unfair, that every one of us is going to encountered obstacles. So, the whole book was helpful, but in it was this phrase `the discipline of gratitude,' and I had never thought of gratitude being a discipline. And I began to do that. I mean, every day, no matter what is happening around me, I consciously try to discipline my own feelings and my mind about what I have to be grateful for, because by any stretch of the imagination - even during the worst times when people are accusing me of things and doing all that they do - I'm a very lucky person. SCOTT SIMON: Would you ever run for office yourself? Do you ever think about that? HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Oh, I don't think so. No. SCOTT SIMON: I mean, did you ever, back in the '60s - between when you were, I believe, you were a `Goldwater Girl'- HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: - That's right- SCOTT SIMON: - and whatever you became politically? HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: That's right. And I feel like my political beliefs in the conservatism that I was raised with. I don't recognize this new brand of Republicanism that's afoot now which I consider to be very reactionary, not conservative in many respects. I'm very proud that I was a `Goldwater Girl.' And then my political beliefs changed over time. But I've always thought that the role of citizen, the role of advocate, were as important in our democracy as running for office. So, it's not anything I've ever, you know, seriously SCOTT SIMON: You know, whenever we've had to refer to you in news accounts, I - and I hope I've done this over the years - I've never used the term `first lady,' because it struck me as antiquated. Do you use that term? HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I don't use it much personally, but I don't object to people using it because it is a tradition that we think started with Martha Washington. So, it's not the term so much, it's the expectations that surround the role that I find fascinating. I have spent a lot of time in the last several years reading about my predecessors, and have discovered that nearly every one of them had a kind of bumpy time here because there's really no way to satisfy the extraordinary expectations that are put upon the person who is married to the president. And it has been both somewhat sustaining, if you will, as well as a cautionary tale to realize that the women who have been here before have encountered many different kinds of challenges. And at the end of the day, you have to be yourself, you have to say and stand for what you believe in, you have to be willing to get up and go ahead and take the slings and arrows and just try to persist through them, because it's apparently an inevitable part of our American democracy. SCOTT SIMON: For example, if I may, when William Safire of the New York Times said very bluntly in a column this week that he didn't believe you were telling the truth, and then through Mr. McCurry, the president's press secretary, it was communicated that your husband took exception of the kind he would like to apply to Mr. Safire's nose, I recall- HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: - But with a smile. SCOTT SIMON: No, understood, I think, on all sides. But the suggestion of that seemed to be, this is personal criticism that the columnist is leveling, and so therefore I'm going to take personal exception when you talk that way about my partner in life. But was it personal? Was it called for? I mean, he was- Mr. Safire was talking about your record as an attorney and a public figure. Did you take personal exception to that? HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well, I don't take what Mr. Safire says very seriously. As you pointed out, I was working for the committee that impeached President Nixon, for whom Mr. Safire worked, and, best I can tell, is still working. In fact, my mother took some offense because being called a `congenital liar' seems to be reflect badly on her and my late father. But, you know, I don't really have much to add to that. SCOTT SIMON: See, I wasn't going to repeat the phrase because I don't want your husband to punch me in the nose. We live nearby, after all. HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: He wouldn't, he won't, he won't. SCOTT SIMON: Thank you for all you time on a snowy day. HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Thank you. SCOTT SIMON: - Hillary Rodham Clinton.",

Bush (left) introduces his brother Jeb Bush during a campaign stop in South Carolina Monday.\n                \n                    \n                    Matt Rourke/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former President George W. Bush (left) introduces his brother Jeb Bush during a campaign stop in South Carolina Monday. Jeb Bush, the son and brother of former presidents, started his campaign promising voters, \"I am my own man.\" However, Bush's standing in polls has steeply declined, and now he is bringing back his brother George W. Bush for help in a place where George W. is still very popular \u2014 South Carolina. The brothers were together on the campaign trail this weekend in the Palmetto State ahead of South Carolina's primary in hopes of giving Jeb Bush a boost. And George W. could help. The former president won South Carolina's GOP primary in 2000, a victory that resurrected his candidacy. The former president, who has largely remained out of public view since leaving the White House, seemed at ease during a campaign stop Monday in North Charleston. He joked about his new passion for oil painting and made veiled criticisms of Donald Trump. Bush said it's important not to stoke voter anger and defended his record on Sept. 11, which Trump has recently criticized. Here are six quotes from W that stood out: 1. \" 'Misunderestimated' most of my life\" \"I've written two books, which has surprised a lot of people, particularly up East, who didn't think I could read, much less write. I've been one to defy expectations \u2014 I've been 'misunderestimated' most of my life. And as a real shock to people, I have become an oil painter. But let me assure you, I know that the signature is worth more than the painting.\" 2. \"Labels are for soup cans\" \"Being your president was a high privilege, and the honor of a lifetime. By the way, if serving as president of the United States makes me a part of the so-called establishment, I proudly carry that label. There seems to be a lot of name-calling going on, but I want to remind you what our good dad told me one time: Labels are for soup cans.\" 3. Angry? Frustrated? Don't pick Trump \"I understand that Americans are angry and frustrated. But we do not need someone in the Oval Office who mirrors and inflames our anger and frustration. We need someone who can fix the problems that cause their anger and frustration, and that's Jeb Bush.\" 4. \"The strongest person usually isn't the loudest one in the room\" \"Strength is not empty rhetoric. It is not bluster. It is not theatrics. Real strength, strength of purpose, comes from integrity and character. And, in my experience, the strongest person usually isn't the loudest one in the room.\" 5. Walking through the details of Sept. 11 \"When Americans woke up on Sept. 11, we did not know that the world would forever change that day. I was sitting in a classroom in Florida listening to a child read. My chief of staff, South Carolina graduate Andy Card, whispered in my ear, 'A second plane has hit the second tower. America is under attack.' My first reaction was, I was hot. We're going to deal with these people. My second reaction, when I was staring at this young child, was that my job became crystal clear, and that was to protect her, her community and her country. On the way to Air Force One from that school, Condi [Condoleezza Rice] called me and said a plane had hit the Pentagon. I felt the first one was an accident, the second was an attack and the third one was a declaration of war. I became something that no president should ever want to be, a wartime president.\" 6. Jeb is a man of \"humility\" and \"surrounds himself with people who do know what he doesn't know\" \"Jeb is a man of humble, deep and genuine faith. Faith that reveals itself through good works, not loud words. I think you should look for someone whose humility helps him understand what he doesn't know and surrounds himself with people who do know what he doesn't know.\"",

            "article_content": "Tuesday is the 100th anniversary of the New Hampshire primary. NPR talks to New Hampshire's secretary of state, who for four decades has defended the primary's first-in-the-nation status against critics who say the state isn't representative of the U.S. as a whole.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Tomorrow is the 100th anniversary of the New Hampshire primary. For the last 40 years, one man has staunchly defended this primary's first-in-the-nation status. That man is Bill Gardner. NPR's Brian Naylor brings us this profile of the nation's longest-serving secretary of state. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: The walls of Bill Gardner's second-floor office in the New Hampshire State House are covered with photographs of presidential candidates. There's Lamar Alexander in his trademarked flannel shirt. Over there is Ronald Reagan. Oh, look. It's Gary Hart, and here's Barack Obama. BILL GARDNER: These were the first steps that Barack Obama took in New Hampshire. He had never been to New Hampshire before. You see he's coming with - carrying his two bags. NAYLOR: In his four decades as secretary of state, Gardner has had many, many candidates in his office filing papers to get on the primary ballot. It's surprisingly easy to qualify. Assuming you meet the constitutional requirements, all you need is a $1,000, and if you can't swing that, well, 100 signatures will work, too. GARDNER: This primary is really about the little guy. It was created to give the average person a chance to be part of it, and it was created to be inclusive. NAYLOR: And while some have dropped out after the Iowa caucuses, the names of 58 candidates remain on this year's New Hampshire ballot. New Hampshire has not always had the first presidential primary. But as other states ended theirs or moved their dates, New Hampshire found itself all alone at the beginning, and now Gardner says it's part of the state's very essence. GARDNER: We're not smarter than anybody, any others. It's just part of the DNA of the state. It's part of our political heritage, our culture. NAYLOR: But some outside New Hampshire question whether this state, with its small and largely white population, is representative enough of the electorate as a whole to play such an oversized role in presidential politics. There have been efforts over the years to change the nominating calendar to put other states first. Gardener, backed by state law, has swatted them away. He recalls the time in 1983 when Nancy Pelosi, before she was in Congress, came to his office. The following years, Democratic convention was in San Francisco, and she appealed to Gardner to allow California to go first that year. GARDNER: She said, well, you're going to have to change it because New Hampshire won't be part of the convention. You're not going to be invited. NAYLOR: But Gardner refused to back down, and New Hampshire's delegation found its way to San Francisco. Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who finished second in New Hampshire in the 2004 primary, also tried to get the state to change its date when he became head of the Democratic National Committee. He failed, but as recently as this past October, Dean told Concord News Radio that Gardner was hurting the state. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HOWARD DEAN: You guys need a new secretary of state. If you do that, get rid of Gardner, and get somebody else in there. Gardner's been there too long. He's become autocratic. The candidates don't like him. NAYLOR: The 67-year-old Gardner, who was a Democratic state representative before taking this job, laughs off Dean's criticism. Current Republican Party chairman Reince Priebus has suggested early states like New Hampshire shouldn't get too comfortable. But Gardner has plenty of supporters, like former Republican Sen. John Sununu. JOHN SUNUNU: Bill Gardner has been essential in helping to promote the primary and doing that not just by keeping it first but by making sure it works. NAYLOR: New Hampshire is known for high voter turnout, and Sununu says... SUNUNU: We've never had, you know, scandals, problems, some of the issues that still plague, unfortunately, polling places across the country. NAYLOR: Bill Gardner says New Hampshire residents know they're first-in-the-nation primary is a privilege and a tradition. It's something, he says, that grew because there was fertile ground.

For the past 40 years, New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary status has been vigorously defended by one man: Secretary of State Bill Gardner. He is the nation's longest-serving secretary of state, taking office in 1976, one year before New Hampshire lawmakers mandated that the Granite State go first in primary voting. Gardner's second-floor office in New Hampshire's granite-walled (of course) State House is like a walk through the state's political history. It's filled with stacks of official forms, political paraphernalia \u2014 and lots of photographs of presidential candidates on the stump. New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner has four decades of memories to go with the political paraphernalia in his office.\n                \n                    \n                    Brian Naylor/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption There's Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee senator and former governor, in his trademark flannel shirt.

Gardner points to a picture of a young-looking Barack Obama, taken at the Manchester Airport. \"These were the first steps that Barack Obama took in New Hampshire,\" Gardner notes. \"He had never been in New Hampshire before. You see he's coming in carrying his two bags.\" Gardner has four decades of memories. There's the blizzard that occurred on primary day in 1984: \"The plow trucks were doing triple shifts to keep everything open.\" And there are the many \u2014 many \u2014 candidates coming through his office, filing their papers to get on the primary ballot. It's surprisingly easy to run for president in the New Hampshire primary, assuming you meet the constitutional requirements. All you need is $1,000 to get a spot on the ballot, and if you can't swing that, well, 100 signatures on a petition will work too. \"This primary is really about the little guy,\" Gardner said. \"It was created to give the average person a chance to be part of it, and it was created to be inclusive, so anyone who wants to have a chance to run for president can have a chance here and try.\" And while some candidates have dropped out since the Iowa caucuses, there remain the names of 28 Democrats on this year's New Hampshire ballot, and 30 Republicans, who are giving it a go.

Now, Gardner said, it's part of the state's very essence. \"We're not smarter than any others,\" he said. \"It's just part of the DNA of the state; it's part of our political heritage, our culture.\" \"1st in Nation Primary\" license plates on sale at the New Hampshire State House.\n                \n                    \n                    Brian Naylor/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"1st in Nation Primary\" license plates on sale at the New Hampshire State House. But some outside New Hampshire, mostly Democrats, have questioned whether the state, with its small and overwhelmingly white population, is representative enough of the nation's electorate to play such an oversize role in presidential politics. In September, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said no state should get \"too comfortable.\" \"I don't think that there should ever be any sacred cows as to the primary process or the order,\" Priebus said. That was met with a swift rebuke from Gardner. \"[A]s I have said over the years, this primary won't be taken away from us by external forces,\" he told local TV station WMUR back then. \"It will only change when the will of the people want it to change, and that's pretty unlikely.\" There have been efforts over the years to change the nominating calendar to put other states first. Gardner, backed by state law, which stipulates New Hampshire must hold its primary at least seven days before any similar election, has swatted them away. He recalls the time back in 1983 when Nancy Pelosi came to his office. The next year's Democratic convention was in San Francisco, and Pelosi, who was not yet in Congress, appealed to Gardner to allow California to go first that year. Gardner demurred. \"She said, 'Well, you're going to have to change it,' \" he remembers, \" 'because New Hampshire won't be part of the convention, you're not gonna be invited.' \" Gardner refused to back down.

Gardner's been in there too long. He's become autocratic; the candidates don't like him.\" Shrugging off the critics; paving the way for Jackie Robinson? The 67-year-old Gardner, who was a Democratic state representative before taking this job, laughs off Dean's criticism. He was re-elected last year by state lawmakers without opposition. And he's got plenty of supporters in the state, like former Republican Sen. John Sununu. \"Bill Gardner has been essential in helping to promote the primary and doing that not just by keeping it first but by making sure it works,\" Sununu said. \"We have an incredibly high turnout in New Hampshire, but we've never had scandals, problems, some of the issues that unfortunately still plague polling places across the country.\" Gardner, though, acknowledges concerns over New Hampshire's lack of diversity. \"It's a fair question to ask,\" he said. In response, he cites instances where New Hampshire has shown tolerance for outsiders. In 1946, for example, he noted, Brooklyn Dodgers General Manager Branch Rickey assigned two black baseball players, Roy Campanella and Don Newcombe, to the Nashua, N.H., Dodgers, a minor-league team. It was the year before Jackie Robinson, then a minor-league player in Montreal, broke Major League Baseball's color line. According to Gardner, Rickey told Newcombe and Campanella, \" 'If you guys could make it the way you did in New Hampshire, he's going to make it here,' so in the spring that next year, he brought Jackie Robinson down.\" Gardner said New Hampshire residents know their first-in-the-nation primary is a privilege, as well as a tradition. It's something, he said, that \"grew because there was fertile ground.\"",

Rand Paul is suspending his campaign for president after a disappointing finish in Iowa, turning his focus now to his Senate re-election bid. \"Across the country thousands upon thousands of young people flocked to our message of limited government, privacy, criminal justice reform and a reasonable foreign policy. Brushfires of Liberty were ignited, and those will carry on, as will I,\" the Republican said in a statement. \"Although, today I will suspend my campaign for President, the fight is far from over,\" he continued. \"I will continue to carry the torch for Liberty in the United States Senate and I look forward to earning the privilege to represent the people of Kentucky for another term.\" The libertarian-leaning senator finished a distant fifth in the Hawkeye State on Monday evening, unable to replicate the strong coalition that his father, former Texas Rep. Ron Paul, had built there four years ago. His prospects were similarly bleak both in national polling and in New Hampshire, which is up next Tuesday. Left off the main debate stage last month for his poor standing in surveys (he instead boycotted the so-called undercard debate), Paul faced being passed over again at Saturday's GOP debate. His end-of-the-year campaign finance report showed a depleted bank account, too, with just $1.3 million remaining. And Paul, unlike his rivals, had another campaign he was running simultaneously to worry about \u2014 his Senate re-election bid. Though the first-term senator starts with the advantage in the GOP-leaning state, he drew a strong Democratic challenger last month in Lexington Mayor Jim Gray. Paul had to jump through hoops just to be able to run for both Senate and president at the same time. Last year he persuaded the state party to hold a March caucus instead of a May primary so he could legally be on both ballots. That political insurance policy he won't need anymore was costly \u2014 he had promised he would pay for the change, which could be upwards of $500,000.",

Since 1972, Iowa has held the first presidential nominating contests in the country. Over the years, the Iowa caucuses have grown in size, scope and importance, sometimes launching underdogs to the presidency or upsetting established political juggernauts. It's easy to accept Iowa's role in presidential elections for what it is. But in some ways, Iowa should be questioned. The first-in-the-nation caucus state is whiter and more rural than the rest of the country; it doesn't really represent America in some fundamental ways. Knowing that, why is Iowa first? And is that fair? But first: \"A caucus \u2014 it's a neighborhood meeting,\" said David Yepsen, former political writer at the Des Moines Register and an Iowa politico of note. \"In fact, the term caucus is thought to be a Native American term \u2014 an Algonquin term for meeting of tribal leaders.\" A caucus is more than just a vote; like Yepsen said, it's a meeting. On caucus night, people gather at hundreds of sites across the state and talk about why they're supporting a candidate. Speeches are made on candidates' behalf, and there's jockeying to persuade other people to support their candidate. The process can sometimes take hours. For Democrats in Iowa, caucusgoers publicly show support for their candidates after the speeches by moving to designated spaces in the space they've gathered. If a candidate does not get at least 15 percent of the room backing him or her, those supporters must go support another, viable candidate. For Republicans, after the speeches, there's a secret ballot, no head counts. \"The really important thing to remember about Iowa is not that it's first because it's important. Iowa is important because it's first,\" said Kathy O'Bradovich, political columnist for the Des Moines Register. She acknowledges that Iowa didn't really happen on purpose. \"It happened after the 1968 Democratic National Convention,\" she said, which was marred by violence over the Vietnam War and racial tension. \"The Democratic Party nationally and in Iowa decided they wanted to change their process to make it more inclusive.\" Part of that meant spreading the presidential nominating schedule out in each state. Because Iowa has one of the more complex processes \u2014 precinct caucuses, county conventions, district conventions, followed by a state convention \u2014 it had to start really early. (The Democratic Party held Iowa caucuses first in the nation in 1972; the GOP followed suit in 1976.) And once a peanut farmer named Jimmy Carter rode an Iowa caucus win all the way to the White House, Iowa suddenly became a thing. Just a warning, there's probably no consensus for this. But here's how Jim Jacobson, a voter from Iowa City, rationalized it: \"Is it fair that Iowa goes first? What's fair in politics? I mean, seriously. Yeah, OK, we're like 97 percent white, and we're really rural, and we don't look like a microcosm of America. But so what?\" Let's take that first thing he points out, Iowa's whiteness. Officially, non-Hispanic whites make up 87.1 percent of Iowa's population according to the most recent census data. But J. Ann Selzer, the top pollster in the state, says that's actually kind of OK. \"The idea that because Iowans are white and older, they're going to vote for older white people is not borne out,\" she said. \"In both parties, candidates of color have often done quite well in Iowa. Look at Barack Obama. Jesse Jackson did well. Alan Keyes did well on the Republican side.\" Even Jeff Kaufmann, the head of the Iowa Republican Party, kind of says the same thing. \"This is going to be awfully odd, to have a Republican chair suggest you look at what Barack Obama has to say about Iowa,\" he said. \"But I'm guessing Barack Obama has no problem with the diversity that we reflect. And I'm guessing if you talk to Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz and Ben Carson, my guess is that they're not going to have a problem.\" But there's another issue of race \u2014 not just who Iowans are voting for, but which Iowans are voting. Both parties say they're reaching out more to Latinos, Iowa's fastest-growing racial group. But in West Liberty, Iowa, a town that is majority Latino, NPR spoke with several residents who had no idea what a caucus is, had no intention to vote, and said no one had ever talked to them about any of it. One man thought we were asking him about a cactus. \"Nobody says anything, and nobody talks about it,\" West Liberty resident Maria Luna said. \"And we see nothing, then we're not going to be nothing \u2014 and do nothing.\" FiveThirtyEight.com found that Latinos make up about 3 percent of Iowa's electorate. The state doesn't track the race of caucusgoers, but in the last general election, Latino turnout was quote low: 25 percent. Several advocacy groups say they plan to change that, however, particularly the League of United Latin American Citizens, or LULAC. But the Iowa Caucus Project points out that in general, caucus participation, regardless of race, is usually relatively low. \"With the exception, then, of the extraordinary Democratic caucus year in 2008,\" wrote Dennis J. Goldford, \"we can see from these numbers that in the last two Iowa caucus cycles, not unlike earlier cycles, only roughly 20 percent of eligible caucus-goers actually turn out to participate on caucus night.\" So, low turnout in an already small state; Iowa has a population of about 3 million people. And Iowa is very rural, at a time when an increasing amount of American voters these days live in or around big, urban areas. \"When we get to the general election next November, about 45 percent of the vote is going to come from places that I call big cities or urban suburbs,\" said Dante Chinni, director of the American Communities Project at American University. \"That's a lot of the vote. There are none of those [major cities] in Iowa.\" Given those numbers, he says, a state like Georgia might be more ideal. \"First of all, you have diversity, a much more diverse state [in Georgia]. The other thing that Georgia has is \u2014 it has Atlanta.\" When you look at states that have that mix \u2014 more racial diversity and a mix of rural and urban, there are actually a few options. \"Pennsylvania is a very good option. Colorado is an interesting state. My home state of Michigan; Ohio's a really good one,\" Chinni says. NPR's Asma Khalid analyzed and indexed the demographics of each of the 50 states compared with the national averages and found that Illinois might be more appropriate based on factors like race and income. But if you look to bigger states for more diversity, you could end up with a caucus state that's actually too big. Iowa is small enough for every candidate to make his or her way all across the state and advertise on the cheap. Small candidates can compete with the big dogs in Iowa from Day 1. It would have been much harder for Carter to win a California caucus than one in Iowa. Over time, one of the reasons people have come to support Iowa being first has come to be the people of Iowa themselves. \"The real reason we're first in the nation now is because of what we do. We take this real seriously,\" says Andy McGuire, head of the Iowa state Democratic Party. She says Iowans contest a candidate like no one else and that they've had literally decades of experience in figuring out how to grill candidates one on one. \"You know, we ask really good questions. We ask follow-up questions,\" she said. \"We look them in the eye like I am you right now. It's real. It's one-on-one vetting of candidates. Are you for real? Not a TV spot, not money \u2014 what's in your heart?\" Whether you believe that Iowa voters are better at this or that they deserve the privilege more, it probably doesn't even matter. Yepsen says we're stuck with Iowa. \"Iowa's first because of inertia,\" he said, laughing. \"Most people in the country don't like this process.\" But he says no one can agree on what else to do. Should the first nominating contest move to another state, the same questions raised about Iowa would just be shifted there. And when you're trying to find the state that's the most representative, you could fall down a rabbit hole: Which state has the most diversity of industry? Which state has education levels that most mirror the country? Which state has the most reflective ratio of things like union membership, or church attendance? You could go on ... Others have proposed alternative primary systems (which Danielle Kurtzleben broke down here). And say both parties agree on a viable alternative to Iowa, or even a different system altogether (one-day national primary?), Iowa might fight like hell to keep its favored spot. Being first gives Iowa lots of attention to issues Iowans care about, and it's a really, really big boost to the economy to have hordes of campaign reporters and campaign staffers staying in your hotels, eating at your restaurants, and buying ads on your television stations. With all of this, though, it's important to put Iowa in perspective. Iowa is first, and in some ways, yes \u2014 you could see that as problematic. But as several experts pointed out to NPR, Iowa doesn't actually pick the president. And it's not supposed to on its own. They all said that Iowa's role is that of a winnower; it's there to start narrowing the field of presidential candidates. And if you look at it that way, maybe it all seems a little more fair. Iowa is not the be all, end all. Iowa alone is not a kingmaker. Iowa is only the start of a long journey. Iowa is just first.",

We find out why those caucuses are first, and if it's fair that they are.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Iowa is known for corn, the Hawkeyes and for being first in the county to choose who they want to be president. With the Iowa caucuses little more than a week away, we wanted to revisit how this small state plays such a big role in American politics. Here's NPR's Sam Sanders. SAM SANDERS, BYLINE: Simple question - why are the Iowa caucuses first? I asked that all across the state of Iowa recently, including at Duncan's cafe in Council Bluffs. Do you know why Iowa caucuses are first in the nation? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: No, I do not. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: I don't know, myself why they're number one really (laughter). UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: I'm not really entirely sure how it - how it came to be that way. SANDERS: Have you ever caucused? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I don't think so. SANDERS: You don't think so? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I don't know anything about this. I'm sorry. SANDERS: So you don't even know if you've caucused. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I don't even know what a caucus is, to tell you the truth. SANDERS: Clearly, this calls for an expert - or several. So first things first. DAVID YEPSEN: OK. SANDERS: Tell me your full name and your title. YEPSEN: OK. I'm David Yepsen. For 35 years, I was a political writer for The Des Moines Register. SANDERS: Yepsen is the Iowa politics writer of a record. He helped answer a few questions. First of them being what exactly is a caucus? YEPSEN: In a caucus - it's a neighborhood meeting. In fact, the term caucus is thought to be a Native American term - an Algonquin term for meeting of tribal leaders. SANDERS: It's more than just a vote. People gather and talk about why they're supporting their candidate. And they try to convince other people to support their guy or gal. The process can sometimes take hours. I also spoke with Kathie Obradovich. KATHIE OBRADOVICH: Political columnist for The Des Moines Register. SANDERS: She acknowledges that Iowa didn't really happen on purpose. OBRADOVICH: The really important thing to remember about Iowa is not that it's fist because it's important. Iowa is important because it's first. SANDERS: It all began in 1968. OBRADOVICH: It happened after the 1968 National Convention - Democratic National Convention, which is marred by violence over the Vietnam War and racial tension. And the Democratic Party nationally and in Iowa decided they wanted to change their process to make it more inclusive SANDERS: Part of that meant spreading the schedule out in each state. Because Iowa has one of the more complex processes, they had to start really, really early. YEPSEN: And precinct caucuses would have to be in, my gosh, February. OBRADOVICH: And it turned out that they were going to be first in the nation. SANDERS: Settled that one. Next question - is it fair? Just a warning, there's probably no consensus for this. But Jim Jacobson (ph) at a diner in Iowa City, he said this. JIM JACOBSON: Is it fair that Iowa goes first? What's fair in politics? I mean, seriously. Yeah - OK. We're, like, 97 percent white, and we're really rural. And we don't look like a microcosm of America, but so what? SANDERS: Let's take that first thing he points out, Iowa's whiteness.

JACKIE GUZMA: It's new. SANDERS: It's new. GUZMA: It's new to us, yeah. SANDERS: Why's it new to you? GUZMA: I've never heard it - never heard the word. SANDERS: Until right now? GUZMA: Yeah. SANDERS: Wait, I was the first person to tell you the word caucus? GUZMA: Yeah. SANDERS: That's Maria Luna (ph) and her daughter, Jackie Guzma (ph). Maria owns a shop in West Liberty. LUNA: Right now in Mangolandia (ph). SANDERS: Mangolandia? LUNA: Yes. SANDERS: I like that. What does that mean? They sell frozen fruit snacks and other stuff with lots of mangos. Luna, the store owner, she's not an American citizen yet, so she couldn't vote in the caucuses even if she wanted to. But her daughter Jackie Guzma says she can caucus. But she told me that no one has ever come to West Liberty to tell her how. Jackie and her mother Maria think that's wrong. GUZMA: Nobody says anything and nobody talks about it. And we see no nothing - that we're not to be nothing and do nothing. SANDERS: Another thing with Iowa, the state has a relatively small population - 3 million in the whole state. And it's very rural. A lot of American voters these days live in big urban areas. DANTE CHINNI: When we get to the general election next November, about 45 percent of the vote is going to come from places that I call big cities or urban suburbs - that's a lot of the vote.

            "article_content": "The 2016 presidential campaign has in many ways become a question of character. Even though Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both have incredibly loyal supporters, the two candidates also inspire some intensely negative feelings among voters. Clinton and Trump are the two most unpopular candidates since modern polling began. NPR's Rachel Martin hosts an hourlong special that digs into key moments over the decades that helped cement their reputations and looks at character traits that have turned into liabilities with voters. For Clinton, it's the way she seems to protect her privacy at all costs. For Trump, it's how he seems to crave public attention and says almost anything to get it. Listen here or on your local station this Labor Day weekend: MARTIN: Hi. I'm Rachel Martin from NPR News and over the next hour, we're going to take a close look at the two major party presidential candidates. Specifically, we're going to try to understand why this election has become a question of character. You've heard this before. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are the two most unpopular candidates in modern history.   Having said that, it's important to point out that both Clinton and Trump have some incredibly loyal supporters, voters who believe strongly that their candidate is a great leader and someone who would take this country in the right direction. But the negative feelings voters express toward both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are intense. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  (UNKNOWN): Donald Trump is kind of like Kim Kardashian, just dumbing down America.   (UNKNOWN): I despise that man.   (UNKNOWN): I think of a bigot.   (UNKNOWN): He's a spoiled, privileged brat.   (UNKNOWN): Hillary Clinton, I think of illegal activities.   (UNKNOWN): The lack of integrity, all of that lying and contradiction.   (UNKNOWN): Scorned, but strong female.   (UNKNOWN): Seems like a terrible human.  (END AUDIO CLIP)  MARTIN: That was a small sample of voter sentiment from around the country. We're going to try to figure out what is behind those characterizations.  (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) CLINTON: I get it that some people just don't know what to make of me.   (UNKNOWN): Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person.   TRUMP: I think I am a nice person. People that know me like me.  (END AUDIO CLIP)  MARTIN: Over the course of this hour you'll hear from some of the people who have worked closely with them. Here's British TV journalist Piers Morgan.  (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  MORGAN: I've interviewed him 30 times. I spent maybe 200 hours doing Celebrity Apprentice in his company, and you underestimate this guy at your peril.  (END AUDIO CLIP)  MARTIN: And we'll hear from some who know them best. This is Chelsea Clinton.  (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) CHELSEA CLINTON: Growing up and really kind of watching my mom in the arena, I've \u2014 I don't remember a time when she wasn't attacked.  (END AUDIO CLIP)  MARTIN: We will take you back to their childhoods to explore their most formative experiences. And we'll try to understand some of the character traits that push voters away. For Clinton, it's the way she seems to protect her privacy at all costs.  (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) HILLARY CLINTON: The server contains personal communications from my husband and me. And I believe I have met all of my responsibilities, and the server will remain private.  (END AUDIO CLIP)  MARTIN: For Trump, it's how he seems to crave public attention and says anything to get it.  (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  TRUMP: They say I have the most loyal people. Did you ever see that? Where I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters, OK? It's like incredible.  (END AUDIO CLIP)  MARTIN: But before we get to the now, we're going to spend some time in the wayback, because as young people Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump stood out from their peers. We'll start with Donald Trump, who even as a young kid was the center of attention. He was known for goofing off, and sometimes he broke the rules. Gwenda Blair wrote a book about the Trump family. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)   BLAIR: He and his best friend liked to sneak over to Manhattan on the subway. And once when they went there they got some jackknives which \u2014 or actually switchblades, not just jackknives \u2014 which evidently they thought were pretty cool since they had just seen West Side Story.  (END AUDIO CLIP)  MARTIN: His parents didn't think it was so cool and they sent him to military school. NPR's Ailsa Chang talked to some people who knew Donald Trump back then.  (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)   CHANG: What Donald Trump was famous for before military school was breaking the rules. This kind of stuff was embarrassing for Trump's well-to-do parents in Jamaica Estates, Queens. So before eighth grade, his father sent him literally up the river to New York Military Academy in the Hudson Valley. Col. Ted Dobias remembers the tall, lanky kid who showed up at this dormitory.   DOBIAS: He didn't know how to make a bed. He didn't know how to shine his shoes. He had a \u2014 he had a problem, you know, with being a cadet. You know, being a cadet you got to take care of yourself.   CHANG: But instead of recoiling from the discipline, Trump thrived under it. Mike Kabealo, a classmate, says in the confines of these rigid rules Trump wanted to be a standout.   KABEALO: Cocksure, positive and anything-you-can-do-I-can-do-better kind of stuff, you know. He was very competitive.   CHANG: And friends say Trump channeled that competitiveness into everything at military school. When he was in charge of the rifle rack, he cleaned the rifles obsessively. He was meticulous about his uniform. When it was his turn to do inspections in the barracks, he whipped other cadets into shape. Ted Levine was Trump's roommate.   LEVINE: My bed wasn't really made right and he ripped it.   CHANG: Trump tore Levine's sheets right off. His bed hadn't passed muster.   LEVINE: Then I lost it. I totally lost it. So I think I hit him with a broomstick and he came back at me and, no, with his hands. He was bigger than me and it took three people to get him off me.   CHANG: Levine was 4 foot 11, Trump 6 foot 2. In the pecking order of young boys that size gave him authority. Trump became captain of the baseball team and Col. Dobias was his coach.   DOBIAS: He was very coachable, yes. If I told him, \"Do this,\" he'll do it. He accepted criticism. He wanted to be best, not better.   CHANG: And then there were the girls, so many girls visiting on Sundays. Classmate George White still cannot forget them.   WHITE: There were so many, it was a revolving door.   CHANG: Trump was voted \"Ladies' Man\" in his senior yearbook. His friends say he cared about his hair even then, growing it to the maximum length regulations would allow so it would look fuller. And Trump had this way of laughing when others spoke. It used to get on White's nerves.   WHITE: It made you feel like he was separating himself from you. It made you feel like there was an air of superiority, just enough of a signal that he was laughing at you.   CHANG: As his roommate Levine says, maybe it was that quality that made it difficult to get close to Trump.   LEVINE: I don't think he had a handful of loyalists, you know, because he was so competitive that everybody who could come close to him he had to destroy.   CHANG: But now, 50 years later Levine says he and the other guys still kind of admire Trump. Today Levine's office is littered with Donald Trump knickknacks like this talking doll. Sometimes, Levine says, that Donald gives him guidance about how to run his packaging business.   [to Levine] Wait, wait, wait, so you really squeeze this doll for advice?   LEVINE: Once in a while, yes. It's reinforcement, positive reinforcement of true values that are very important for businessmen.   TRUMP: Never give up. Under any circumstances, never give up.  (END AUDIO CLIP)  MARTIN: So that's what Donald Trump was like as a young competitor.   A young Hillary Rodham had the same kind of drive, but instead of sports, she was into politics. She was on the student council at her high school in Park Ridge, Ill. And she decided to run for class president even though it was a risky move. Her high school friend Judy Price describes it this way.  (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  PRICE: The president was always a boy and the secretary was always a girl. (END AUDIO CLIP)  MARTIN: But Hillary Rodham thought she could win. Her friend Betsy Ebeling explains.  (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  EBELING: I was her campaign manager so I advised her that probably. That one didn't turn out so well.  (END AUDIO CLIP)  MARTIN: She lost. She was still a student leader, though, putting together the homecoming dance, prom and pep rallies. Hillary Rodham headed to college as a Republican and in her freshman year at Wellesley she was elected president of the Young Republicans Club. She was a Democrat by the time she graduated.  (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) CLINTON: The question about possible and impossible was one that we brought with us to Wellesley four years ago.  (END AUDIO CLIP)  MARTIN: That is the voice of a young Hillary Rodham. It was 1969 and she was giving her college commencement address. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  CLINTON: We arrived at Wellesley and we found, as all of us have found, that there was a gap between expectation and realities. But it wasn't a discouraging gap and it didn't turn us, you know, into cynical, bitter old women at the age of 18. It just inspired us to do something about that gap.  (END AUDIO CLIP)  MARTIN: This speech put Hillary Rodham on the national stage for the first time and it came during a tumultuous chapter in American history. Here's NPR's Tamara Keith.  (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)   KEITH: The class of '69 had been through a lot together. By the time they were set to graduate, the Vietnam War and protest against it were in full swing. College campuses had become centers of activism and conflict. And both Martin Luther King Jr. and Bobby Kennedy had been assassinated.   Hillary Clinton wrote in her book Living History about fretting over the speech. Alan Schechter was her professor and college government adviser.   SCHECHTER: Hillary had read the speech to me beforehand and I thought it was a perfect example of youthful idealism at the time.   KEITH: But the speech Rodham read to Schechter is only part of what she delivered at the commencement ceremony. And it's the part that wasn't planned that drew all the attention. The special guest speaker that day was Sen. Edward Brooke, a moderate Republican from Massachusetts and the first African-American popularly elected to the U.S. Senate. His speech celebrated incremental progress and spent a lot of time arguing against protest. He said, quote, \"Coercive protest is wrong, and one reason it is wrong is because it is unnecessary.\"   When she stepped to the lectern, Rodham didn't go directly to her prepared remarks.  CLINTON: I find myself in a familiar position, that of reacting, something that our generation has been doing for quite a while now. We're not in the positions yet of leadership and power, but we do have that indispensable element of criticizing and constructive protest.   KEITH: She was reacting to Sen. Brooke's speech.   CLINTON: This is just \u2014 it has to be very quick because, you know, I do have a little speech to give. But part of the problem with just empathy with professed goals is that empathy doesn't do us anything. We've had lots of empathy. We've had lots of sympathy. But we feel that for too long our leaders have viewed politics as the art of the possible. And the challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible.   KEITH: And when it was over, she got a standing ovation, from her classmates at least. Schechter says not everyone was so pleased with Rodham's performance.   SCHECHTER: The administration was not happy afterwards or at least some people were not happy, because they felt it was inappropriate for a student to criticize the commencement speaker.   KEITH: It made papers across the country. The Chicago Tribune wrote, quote, \"Miss Rodham's discourtesy to Senator Brooke was unjustified.\" And this all led to Rodham's inclusion in a spread in Life magazine about the class of '69.   Time, which owns the Life magazine archives, dug up some notes from the photographer and reporter who worked on the story. Rodham said press accounts of the speech weren't accurate and she was, quote, \"quite concerned that it be made clear she was not attacking Sen. Brooke personally.\" It would seem Hillary Clinton's first moment in the limelight was also the beginning of her difficult relationship with the press.  (END AUDIO CLIP)  MARTIN: After this break, we'll explore how Hillary Clinton has struggled with the public nature of her political life. And later Donald Trump's affinity for the spotlight and his unwavering faith in his own instincts.   Hi. I'm Rachel Martin and we're back with a special broadcast from NPR News on character in this year's presidential campaign.   We just heard about what set Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump apart from their peers when they were young. Coming up, we'll look more closely at Donald Trump and his desire for public attention. For now, we're going to focus on Hillary Clinton and signature moments that came to define her in the eyes of the nation. And you can't start to understand who Hillary Clinton is as a public figure without examining her role as Bill Clinton's wife.  (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) CLINTON: The famous encounter occurred in the law school library.  CLINTON: The law library, at this long table studying and ... CLINTON: I don't know. You know those moments, you know, sort of like click.  CLINTON: And I was studying, doing something...  (END AUDIO CLIP)  MARTIN: The Clintons have told this story time and again over the course of their political life.  (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) CLINTON: She just put down the books she was reading and walked the entire length of the long library walked up to me and she said ...  CLINTON: If you're going to keep looking at me and I'm going to keep looking back, we at least ought to know each other, and I'm Hillary Rodham.  CLINTON: And what's your name? I couldn't remember my name. (END AUDIO CLIP)   MARTIN: And it's an appropriate starting off point in examining Hillary Clinton's past because after she met and fell in love with Bill Clinton her career, her aspirations and public persona were inextricably linked to his. David Maraniss of the Washington Post has been reporting and writing about the Clintons for decades.  (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  MARANISS: From the time they met I would say that they saw that they could get places together that they couldn't get to apart, that their talents matched in an interesting way. And she was the harder worker, the more of the pragmatist, and he had this raw preternatural political talent that she lacked. But they shared an interest in books and policy and ideas and in a notion that together they could change the world.  (END AUDIO CLIP)  MARTIN: They started in Arkansas and in 1979, Bill Clinton became one of the youngest people ever to be elected the governor of a state. And as his wife, Hillary Rodham was under a whole new level of scrutiny.   Here she was, this product of Northeastern liberal universities, a woman who didn't use her husband's name trying to fit in as the first lady of a conservative Southern state. This was part of an interview she did in 1979 on Arkansas public television. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)   (UNKNOWN): Does it bother you that because you don't use your husband's name that people think you're too liberal and, after all, this is not a state known for liberalism? (END AUDIO CLIP)  MARTIN: A 30-something-year-old Hillary Rodham essentially says:  (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  CLINTON: Too bad. Some people may think I'm, you know, too this or too that. But I think that's another one of the dangers about being in public life. One cannot live one's life based on what somebody else's image of you might be. All one can do is live the life that God gave you and, you know, you just do the best that you can. And if somebody likes you or doesn't like you, that's really, in many ways, something you have no control over. (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: It was an early moment in Hillary Rodham's contentious relationship with the press and the public. She didn't fit what a political spouse was supposed to be and felt a certain push and pull between what was expected of her and her own professional identity. She was a partner at a prestigious law firm in Little Rock. She had championed children's issues for years. By the time Bill Clinton ran for governor for a third time in 1982, she added her husband's name to hers. That served her well in Arkansas. But her discomfort being a traditional political spouse was again on display in 1992, this time on a national stage when Bill Clinton ran for president. In that campaign, he was accused of using the governor's office to help his wife's law career. Hillary Clinton characterized those attacks as a slam on professional women. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) CLINTON: You know, I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and have teas. But what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession which I entered before my husband was in public life. (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: Feminists cheered, but to the many women who were full-time mothers and homemakers at the time, the comment came off as patronizing and smug. It was not the first time she had offended traditional notions of a woman's place. The Clinton's were redefining what marriage and partnership look like in politics and they were doing it in public. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) STEVE KROFT: I'm Steve Kroft and this is a special abbreviated edition of 60 Minutes. Tonight Democratic presidential hopeful Gov. Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary, talk about their life, their marriage and the allegations that have all but stalled his presidential campaign. (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: Allegations of infidelity. The Clintons sat down for one-on-one with Steve Kroft of 60 Minutes. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) KROFT: I think most Americans would agree that it's very admirable that you've stayed together, that you've worked your problems out, that you seemed to have reached some sort of understanding and an arrangement. CLINTON: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. You're looking at two people who love each other. (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: It was an uncomfortable conversation as the Clintons tried to put those allegations to rest. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) HILLARY CLINTON: This is not an arrangement or an understanding. This is a marriage. That's a very different thing. You know, I'm not sitting here, some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette. I'm sitting here because I love him and I respect him and I honor what he's been through and what we've been through together. And, you know, if that's not enough for people, then heck, don't vote for him. MARANISS: By the time they started to run for the presidency, Hillary Clinton had made her bargain. (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: Again, journalist David Maraniss. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) MARANISS: She knew Bill Clinton's history and she decided that what they could do together in terms of policy was far more important than his personal flaws. And because they were so closely tied together in their eyes, she had to defend him. And I would say that that aspect of her character has really shaped much of her \u2014 the sort of critique of her public persona ever since. She, for almost 40 years in her relationship with Bill Clinton, has been defensive. (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: And being on defense has meant trying to tightly control public access to what she considers private. The problem is that what Hillary Clinton has characterized as a need for privacy, her critics have described as a pattern of secrecy. That's what happened in the so-called Whitewater scandal, which erupted during Bill Clinton's first term in the White House. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) (UNKNOWN): The tangled relationship between an Arkansas land deal, a savings and loan and Hillary Rodham Clinton's former law firm is again under scrutiny today. (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: It became a central part of a federal investigation. In the end, Bill Clinton's political opponents couldn't prove that he or Hillary did anything illegal in that real estate deal. Even so, David Maraniss says it did political damage. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) MARANISS: It all became sort of part of this stew of Clinton misdeeds or apparent misdeeds in that period. (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: Maraniss says Hillary Clinton refused to release key documents related to that case over to investigators. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) MARANISS: There was a recommendation by several advisers that the Clintons just give the public everything, you know. And it was a discussion actually with my newspaper, the Washington Post, about that when we were asking for records. And it was Hillary and the White House who said, no, don't ever give that up. (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: Because the White House wouldn't hand over certain documents, a second special investigator, Kenneth Starr, started asking more questions. And at the urging of some on Capitol Hill, the investigation into the Clintons broadened. After four years, it would eventually lead Kenneth Starr to a young White House intern named Monica. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) BILL CLINTON: I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie, not a single time, never. These allegations are false and I need to go back to work for the American people. Thank you. (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: The day after that now-famous television address in 1998, Hillary Clinton did her own damage control. She went on NBC's Today show and said this. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) HILLARY CLINTON: The great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president. (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: It would be more than six months before President Bill Clinton acknowledged that he did indeed have sexual relations with that woman. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) MARANISS: You know, with the Clintons a lot of things are true and false at the same time. (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: Again, David Maraniss. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) MARANISS: It's part of the complexity of their \u2014 of their place in American politics. And so whether it was an actual conspiracy or not, it is irrefutable that the right wing was more agitated by the Clintons and more prone to go after them in any way whether something was accurate or not, than any other Democratic politicians. And so by the time, you know, the Monica Lewinsky story broke and Hillary sort of rallied the troops and came to his defense and went on the Today show and issued that statement and was really the strongest person in the White House during that crucial period when some, you know, many people were saying that Clinton would have to resign, it was Hillary that was actually the steel there. (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: It was in part her steely resolve that made it difficult for the American people to warm to her as first lady throughout all her years in the White House, again, because she was redefining what that role was. Yes, she oversaw the Christmas decorations at the White House and hosted state dinners, but Hillary Clinton also had a lot of power from the beginning when her husband put her in charge of health care reform. She was an important policy adviser. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) MELANNE VERVEER: I think it can best be summed up by the phrase, \"Who elected her?\" (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: This is Melanne Verveer. She was Hillary Clinton's chief of staff when she was first lady. Verveer remembers when the president tapped Hillary to lead the push for health care reform in 1993. And there were a lot of people asking this question. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) VERVEER: Who elected her to come in and have this kind of power over a significant part of the U.S. economy, at least in terms of what health care represented? (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: Did you hear that kind of frustration or criticism internally as well, who elected her? (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) VERVEER: Well, I think internally as there always is and I've compared notes with my confreres who've been in this position both on the Republican side and the Democratic side, there is often a lot of flack from the West Wing, as we call it, where the president's closest staff work. And I think there probably was a sense of, you know, this may not have been the right move. (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: Hillary Clinton was still the first lady when she ran for public office herself. In 2000, she won her Senate race in New York. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) HILLARY CLINTON: And I just want to say from the bottom of my heart, thank you, New York. (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: In Congress, she seemed more comfortable than she ever had been as a public figure, because for the first time she was the politician. The decisions she had to defend were her own. She dug into the work and won respect from Democrats and Republicans. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) JUDD GREGG: She was a hardworking liberal senator who had strong opinions but who also understood that she didn't get anything done unless she worked across the aisle. (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: We called up former Republican Sen. Judd Gregg from New Hampshire and asked him if the public critic of Hillary Clinton in this election was evident back then. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) (UNKNOWN): In this election, she has admitted that she's had some problems with trustworthiness, that that seems to be a word that voters, when polled, say is a problem. Did you find her to be an honest broker? GREGG: Oh, there's no question she was an honest broker in the Senate. She \u2014 if you talk to her on issue, she told you what she thought, she tells you what her position was and that's the way you have to do things in the Senate. Your word is your bond in the Senate. If you don't live by your word in the Senate, you're not going to get anything done. (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: Yet time and again Hillary Clinton has had problems convincing the American public that she's trustworthy. Here she is at a campaign event in Chicago this summer. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) HILLARY CLINTON: You can't just talk someone into trusting you. You've got to earn it. So, yes, I could say that the reason I sometimes sound careful with my words is not that I'm hiding something, it's just that I'm careful with my words. I believe what you say actually matters. I think that's true with life and it's especially true with your president. So I do think before I speak and I could say that political opponents and conspiracy theorists have accused me of every crime in the book over the years. None of it is true, never has been. But accusations like that never really disappear once they're out there. CHELSEA CLINTON: It never made sense to me why more people don't see the person that I love and know so well. (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: Chelsea Clinton has been trying to understand this disconnect for a long time. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) CLINTON: My earliest political memories really come from 1986 when my dad was running for re-election as governor of Arkansas and he was running against a man named Frank White who had been governor of Arkansas before and he spent much of the campaign although he's running against my dad, attacking my mom. And I remember this so vividly I think because one of his lines of attack was against her as a mother. She must be a terrible mother because we see her working as a lawyer. She must spend all her time kind of in her office or in the courtroom. And it just all seemed kind of crazy to me because I was an only child and so I thought, kind of my opinion about my mom should matter a lot more than Frank White's opinion about my mom. And, you know, he kept saying that she must never be there, but I knew that she was there all the time. I mean she was home for every dinner. She never missed any of my soccer games or my little ballet recitals. And so my entire life there's been this cognitive dissonance between kind of the public characterization of my mother particularly from my parents' political opponents and my lived experience with her as my mom. (UNKNOWN): You no doubt have observed the polls that say there are still a large number of Americans who don't trust your mom. That obviously must be hard for you to hear as her daughter, but how do you reconcile that? CLINTON: On a fundamental level, it doesn't make sense to me because the person that I know and love is the person that, outside of my husband, I trust most to take care of my children. On the larger question, you know, as you said in the question that you asked, my mom has acknowledged that she has work to do and she's actively engaged in that work in this campaign of trying to earn both Americans' votes but more importantly their trust and confidence in her ability to be our next president. (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: It might not make sense to those who are close to her, but critics outside the Clinton inner circle, they see a pattern of behavior, a lack of transparency that makes it hard to sort the political hit jobs from the ethical missteps. Let's take the most recent example. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) (UNKNOWN): Secretary Clinton was interviewed today in the ongoing investigation into whether classified information was mishandled when she chose to use a private server during her time at the State Department. (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: In early 2015 during the ongoing Benghazi investigation it came to light that Hillary Clinton used a private email address and a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state. The director of the FBI said there was nothing illegal about that, but he also said there is evidence that Clinton and her staff were, quote, \"extremely careless\" in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information. That alone has been a political minefield for the Clinton campaign. But so have emails found in that server, messages that have shown that then-Secretary Clinton held meetings with donors to the Clinton Foundation. Critics say she used her position to grant favors to those donors. Bill Clinton biographer David Maraniss says this whole episode fits into a perceived pattern. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) MARANISS: At many key points it was Hillary who was the most protective and the least transparent. (UNKNOWN): How have these attacks, and especially the accusations of secrecy, how have these all stuck to Hillary Clinton in a way that they haven't stuck to Bill Clinton? And they seem to, they seem to adhere to her in a way that he shakes off. MARANISS: Yes. No. I think there's a lot of reasons for that; one is sexism. I think that's undeniable that as the strongest woman figure in American politics, in modern American politics, she is susceptible to more criticism for things that [others] might not be criticized for. I don't think that's all of it by any means, but I think it's foolhardy to not take that into consideration. Another aspect is that Bill Clinton is just purely \u2014 I mean this in a complimentary way to Hillary, but I've sometimes called Bill Clinton an authentic phony and Hillary Clinton a phony phony. In other words, Bill Clinton is better at presenting himself in his many different ways. He's a Protean character who when it comes into a room can be whatever that room wants him to be. And Hillary is not as adaptable as that and so that leads \u2014 she's less fluid in her political style and that leaves her open to more of these criticisms. And so over the course of time I think that that's built up this public perception of her. Now, the question to me now is whether now that she's on the verge of actually reaching this incredible position, whether that will liberate her from that protectiveness, whether, you know, she doesn't need Bill Clinton anymore. (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: While Hillary Clinton has struggled with the public nature of her life, Donald Trump has thrived on it. More on that coming up. Stay with us. Welcome back. I'm Rachel Martin and you're listening to a special broadcast from NPR News about the question of character in his year's presidential election. We just heard a range of perspectives on Hillary Clinton and her character, who she is as a mother, a politician and a colleague and how her need for privacy has been a political liability over the years. On the other side of this election is a man who is more than comfortable in the public eye. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) TRUMP: You've been lazy, you've been nothing but trouble and now you cut them off as they're fighting each other for who should be fired. Michael (ph)? (UNKNOWN): Michael (ph), yes. TRUMP: Michael (ph)? (UNKNOWN): Yes, sir. TRUMP: You're fired. (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: There has never been a presidential candidate like Donald Trump. He is a rich real estate tycoon who became an NBC reality TV star. He has no political experience and has run a presidential campaign based almost exclusively on his personal charisma and ability to grab headlines. Hyperbole is part of his style, but that gets him into real trouble on the campaign trail. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) TRUMP: ISIS is honoring President Obama. He is the founder of ISIS. He's the founder of ISIS, OK? He's the founder. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists. Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: Each time Trump has said something provocative in his presidential campaign, his followers have not been deterred. This is British TV journalist Piers Morgan. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) MORGAN: The turning point for me actually was when he was able to denigrate John McCain for his war record by saying I prefer my war heroes not being captured. TRUMP: He's not a war hero. (UNKNOWN): He's a war hero. TRUMP: He is a war hero... (UNKNOWN): Five and a half years (inaudible). TRUMP: He's a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured, OK? MORGAN: And he got away with it. (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: Morgan has been friends with Donald Trump for the past decade. And he says Trump supporters did not flinch after that dig at John McCain. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) MORGAN: That was a moment that could have ended many campaigns stone dead, and it showed me that Trump's uniquely personal style was actually resonating with the public in a way that people didn't anticipate. (UNKNOWN): He is a man of remarkable confidence. I think that's probably an understatement. MORGAN: Yes, of the millennium, yes. (UNKNOWN): But to be as successful as he has been, I would \u2014 I would pose it that you have to be able to see your blind spots. Do you \u2014 as someone who knows him, does he have that capacity? Does he recognize where he falls short? MORGAN: He believes that it's weak to constantly apologize and constantly backtrack and he believes it's strong to stand by your opinions however unpalatable they may be to other people. And regardless of what people think of him and that style perhaps of campaigning, it is the demonstrably, hugely successful for him. (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: To figure out where that confidence comes from, we called up Gwenda Blair. She's the author of a book called The Trumps: Three Generations of Builders and a Presidential Candidate. Blair says it was clear from early on that Donald would be his father Fred Sr.'s successor, not his older brother Fred Jr. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) BLAIR: From talking to his sister and from what Donald himself has written, it seems that it was apparent really very early on that Fred Jr., nice guy, funny, lots of friends, but not a killer, which is what their father, Fred Sr., literally told the kids to be and Fred Jr. not so much, Donald, absolutely. (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: Michael D'Antonio wrote another biography, called The Truth About Trump. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) D'ANTONIO: His father would tell his sons you're killers and you're kings and they were supposed to rise up in life as killers and kings and nothing was quite good enough. MARTIN: The Trumps were competitive. D'Antonio says they also had a flare for the dramatic. D'ANTONIO: His father was actually a pretty theatrical guy although his skill level wasn't as near what the sons became. Fred Trump loved to dress really well, to swan about town a little bit in Manhattan, and his mother was also the center of attention at a social event and loved to perform for people, telling stories and jokes. And I think that this is where Donald observed how effective that could be. So he'd grew into a young man who actually found theater and film to be his first area of interest. MARTIN: So much so that when Donald Trump was in his early 20s, just out of Wharton Business School, he thought maybe he'd like to be a Broadway producer. So he talked his way into co-producing a play called Paris is Out; it debuted on Broadway in 1970. D'ANTONIO: It got reviews of the sort that no one wants. One reviewer just said that he sat there and gaped at it and was neither moved to hate it or moved to like it, it was just there. But it did advertise itself with Donald J. Trump as a producer and it gave him I think a first experience with how to reach the public with a story and subsequently, I think he's kind of produced his own life and starred in it ever since. (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: Producing that play was a risk and taking it was just part of being a Trump. Biographer Gwenda Blair says the Trump family was big into the idea and that if you could just believe strongly enough in yourself, if you trusted yourself enough, you could make anything happen \u2014 otherwise known as The Power of Positive Thinking, the 1952 book by the minister Norman Vincent Peale. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) PEALE: Positive thinking works. BLAIR: The Trump family was very influenced by Dr. Peale. The parents went to his church in New York City. Donald and his sisters were married in the church, his parents were \u2014 funerals were in the church. PEALE: I've made a lifelong study of success, because it's something that all of us admitted or not would like to round out our lives with. BLAIR: And in Norman Vincent Peale's \"10 Guidelines to Success,\" No. 1 was, and I quote, \"Formulate and stamp indelibly on your mind a mental picture of yourself as succeeding. Hold this picture tenaciously, never permit it to fade.\" And I think we have seen that with Trump through the years and especially on the campaign trail. He's always successful at everything in his mind. He's always a winner and the only measure of anything is winning and losing and he wants to win. TRUMP: We will have so much winning if I get elected that you may get bored with winning. Believe me, I agree. You'll never get bored with winning, we never get bored. (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: Here's Piers Morgan again. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) MORGAN: He'd always said to me privately and in public and in interviews, \"You trust your gut instinct and you won't get far wrong.\" (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: But trusting his gut has not always worked out, which leads us to Atlantic City, N.J., and a man named Steven Perskie. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) PERSKIE: I served from October of 1990 to May of 1994 as the chairman of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission. MARTIN: Perskie remembers [that] when Trump started making noises about investing in Atlantic City, local officials thought they had hit the jackpot. PERSKIE: At the beginning, it was, \"Oh my goodness, here comes this major real estate developer in New York and he's going to enter the casino business, he's going to do so in Atlantic City and he's going to do it in a first-class way.\" And for the first six or seven years, he was a giant here. Then he may \u2014 has never acknowledged making but he did make a series of major and eventually catastrophic bad decisions. MARTIN: But we're getting ahead of ourselves. Let's start with what went right. Trump opened the Atlanta Hotel along the Atlantic City Boardwalk and then the Castle Casino in 1985. PERSKIE: So through the 1980s, his experience in Atlantic City was with those two properties which were successful in every sense. MARTIN: Then Donald Trump sniffed out another opportunity. He snatched up the new Taj Mahal Hotel and Casino at a bargain price, but he needed approval from the State Casino Commission to get another license. PERSKIE: Trump came to the Casino Control Commission, this was before I got there, and made a presentation that he wanted to buy and take over the completion and operation of the Taj Mahal, that he would do so by funding it in a fashion that was consistent with the successful funding that he had done on the other two properties and that everything would be fine. He didn't do that; he chose junk bonds. The terms of the debt were dramatic, several financial analysts at the time indicated that the market could not and would not sustain that kind of debt structure, but Trump insisted that it could and would. MARTIN: So Trump went ahead with it. And in April of 1990, he opened the Taj Mahal. Steven Perskie was there that day. PERSKIE: It was an incredibly exciting experience. MARTIN: Can you tell me more about that? Was there a ribbon cutting or something? PERSKIE: Oh my goodness, there was. There were, I don't know how many hundreds, there might have been maybe more than a thousand people. Many of them little old ladies who took one look at Trump and started to scream, \"Donald. Donald.\" MARTIN: At a historic meeting of showbiz and big biz, music's magic man and the Midas mogul ran the media [gantlet] to open the world's glitziest casino. Donald Trump gave Michael Jackson a personal tour of his $1.2 billion extravaganza. PERSKIE: That was in early April of 1990. By July 4, six or eight weeks later, the hotel was in financial trouble. MARTIN: Did he \u2014 I'm sure this is beyond the scope of your regular conversations with him but at any point, did you talk to him about it or did you hear his public statements of why was he so convinced that the analysts were wrong? PERSKIE: Well the conversations that I had with him were later but the message that he was giving was, \"I'm Donald Trump; I have never failed at anything and I'm not going to fail here and anybody who says I am doesn't know what he's talking about.\" When I got to the casino commission, which was in October of 1990, I walked in the door, the day I [was sworn] in and the staff was there and I said, \"Glad you're here. The first thing you've got to do is to decide whether Donald Trump and his companies are sufficiently financially stable to continue to hold a license in New Jersey.\" MARTIN: For the record, at the time, was it just the Taj that was suffering or were his other two businesses starting to falter? PERSKIE: By the end of 1990, it was still just the Taj. The Plaza and the Castle were still OK. That changed rather rapidly over the next couple of years because the problems were so significant at the Taj that it wound up draining a lot of the assets from the Castle and the Plaza so that by the time the exercise got finished in the late '90s and the early 2000s, all three properties were unsupportable. MARTIN: Instead of pulling Trump's license to operate the Taj, Steven Perskie essentially put Trump on a financial performance plan to try and keep the businesses afloat. PERSKIE: So eventually in spite of our and his I guess best efforts, the project failed. MARTIN: Steven Perskie says Trump has never owned up to the mistakes he made in Atlantic City. PERSKIE: He blames the failure \u2014 his failure in Atlantic City on others, on the economy, on whoever. The fact is that it was his failure which he has never acknowledged. MARTIN: Steven Perskie says the bondholders got their clocks cleaned but they knew the risks. PERSKIE: On the other hand, the small businesses in the Atlantic City and New Jersey, South Jersey area that welcomed him were thrilled with the opportunity to do business with Donald Trump didn't assume that risk. Donald Trump portrayed himself as too big to fail, too strong to fail, too smart to fail so that if you were in business with him whether you were selling him meats for his restaurants or you were fixing the carpets in his hotel, whatever it was that you were doing, you were thrilled to get the business because it was reliable and you were counting on Donald Trump to be reliable. MARTIN: But you also believed that he was too big to fail because of the importance of those businesses to the economy? PERSKIE: No, I didn't believe that he was too big to fail. I thought that he was too smart to fail. I thought that before he would fail, he had the ability and he had the knowledge to take the steps necessary to prevent failure, that's what I believed and my belief turned out to be wrong. PHIL RUFFIN: I know that Atlantic City has been a disaster. My name is Phil Ruffin, I've known Donald for 20 years, we're close personal friends. MARTIN: Donald Trump was Ruffin's best man at his wedding and they co-owned the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Las Vegas. When I asked Phil Ruffin about Trump's time in Atlantic City, he made it clear he thought it was about investment. RUFFIN: I stayed away from it. We had plenty of opportunity to get in. MARTIN: You saw the warning signs in Atlantic City, why do you think Donald Trump didn't see them? RUFFIN: He did that, Rachel, before I knew him and, you know, at that time Atlantic City was booming. You know, he built the Taj Mahal and a couple others and the economy just went sour on him and he couldn't pay it back but he personally did not declare bankruptcy, the properties declared bankruptcy. And so I don't know. MARTIN: Do you think he would admit that he \u2014 that he failed at parts of those investments and has learned lessons from that? RUFFIN: You'd have to ask him about that. He's a brilliant businessman but sometimes you take on too much debt and you can't make the payments. And I think that was the case there. MARTIN: The whole Atlantic City Casino story is instructive because it illustrates how Trump's unwavering faith in his own judgment can create blind spots and acknowledging any failure undermines the public persona Trump has created for himself as a winner, a winner who can succeed where everyone else has failed. And that message has become a main theme throughout his political campaign. TRUMP: Nobody knows the system better than me which is why I alone can fix it. MARTIN: One year ago, Republican Party leaders never would have believed that Donald Trump would address the GOP convention as their party's nominee. STONE: Well make no mistake about it, Trump's nomination was a hostile takeover of the Republican Party. MARTIN: This is Roger Stone, a longtime Republican strategist and informal adviser to Donald Trump. Stone remembers meeting Trump in 1979 when Stone was working with Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign. STONE: Yes. He was even then larger than life. I mean, charismatic, tall, good looking, blunt, straight to the point, all business, great sense of humor though, and I came way saying, \"Wow, what an incredibly attractive piece of political horseflesh.\" MARTIN: Donald Trump was focused on building up his father's business but he always kept tabs on politics and cultivated relationships with politicians from both parties. Stone says Trump was a Republican for most of his life with a couple of detours. He joined an affiliate of the Reform Party in 1999 and briefly considered running for president on that ticket. STONE: After Donald decided not to run in 2000, he switched his registration back to the Republican Party and he remained a Republican until ... George W. Bush became president. And then I didn't know this until recently but during the Bush presidency, he switched his registration to Democrat. And then after the Bush presidency he quietly switched his registration back to the Republican Party. Like many Americans, he's gone from being an establishment Republican to realizing that both parties are in it together, that there is a two-party duopoly and therefore this election is not so much Republicans versus Democrats as it is insiders versus outsiders. MARTIN: And Donald Trump has positioned himself as the ultimate outsider to the point where he has at times personally attacked key leaders of the Republican Party. I asked Roger Stone how he can repair those relationships if he wins. STONE: If his policies are popular, the establishment Republicans will come to him. Remember their major objective in life is getting re-elected and therefore they will be for whatever they think the people are for. So in Trump's case, if he can't make them see the light, he has to make them feel the heat. (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: Piers Morgan says it's how Trump has operated his entire career, in business and now in politics. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) MORGAN: If you're with Trump, if you're supportive of him, he is incredibly loyal back to you. If you cross him, if you take him on, if you abuse him, he will fight fire with fire. He can be very, very effective at burying opponents. (END AUDIO CLIP) MARTIN: Donald Trump has buried his opponents in his campaign. He has even buried his potential allies leaving him virtually alone at the top of his presidential project. That means he will likely take all the credit if he wins and he will have no one left to blame if he doesn't.

Schumer is expected to become the new Senate minority leader, but with Donald Trump's election as president, Garland's nomination is done. If Tuesday's election determined who would control the two elected branches of government, it also determined who would control the unelected third branch of government \u2014 the judiciary. First, the vacancy created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last February will be filled by President Trump's nominee, not by President Obama's. Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland died with the election returns, in essence vindicating the unprecedented confirmation policy of obstruction adopted by Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. \"I said in February of this year, to a hail of controversy, that I thought it best that the American people decide who made this appointment to the Supreme Court,\" McConnell said Wednesday. \"And so the American people have spoken.\" As to whom President-elect Trump might pick and what the process will be, we know at once a lot and a little. During the campaign, Trump issued two long lists of potential nominees, put together largely by the conservative Heritage Foundation. The lists were, to a person, very conservative, but were remarkable for who was missing \u2014 some of the most distinguished conservative judges and lawyers in the country. Among them: Paul Clement, the George W. Bush administration solicitor general who, as a private lawyer, represented conservative challengers to many of the Obama administration's most controversial policies; Brett Kavanaugh, an appeals court judge who carried the limited government banner on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia; and Jeffrey Sutton, the judge who wrote the only appeals court decision in the country upholding state laws banning same-sex marriage. There has never been any guarantee that Trump will limit his choices to his campaign lists. Indeed, when released the lists were viewed as a way of quelling the fears of religious and social conservatives. Conservatives note that there are names on Trump's lists, such as federal appeals court judge William H. Pryor, Jr., of Alabama, who would have strong support among GOP evangelical voters \u2014 and from an important early Trump supporter in the Senate, Jeff Sessions of Alabama. And it is unclear who, if anyone, outside the Heritage Foundation orbit will be advising Trump on the Supreme Court pick. GOP Senate leader McConnell did say Wednesday that he and other Republican senators have views. \"I've got a few suggestions I'd like to make, and I think he's open to our suggestions,\" he said, adding that \"I think it's the way it ought to work.\" Democrats likely will have no input \u2014 there is no need to extend an olive branch to the other side, as there was when President Obama picked Merrick Garland, in part because Republicans controlled the Senate. Obama was explicit about one of the reasons he picked Garland: For years Republicans had suggested him as the democratically appointed lower-court judge they favored, the one they could live with. That solicitude for the opposition party's views is not being replicated now because Republicans still control the Senate, and have little need for Democratic support. True, the filibuster rule is still in place for Supreme Court nominees, requiring 60 votes to end debate \u2014 considerably more votes than Republicans will have in the Senate. But if there were a Democratic filibuster, Republicans would almost certainly would change the Senate rules, just as Democrats would have done if they had prevailed on Election Night. In the short run, Trump will have more than 100 other judicial nominations to make to the lower federal courts. There are 103 judicial vacancies on the federal trial and appellate courts, or roughly an eighth of the entire federal judiciary. There are 59 pending Obama nominations to fill a majority of those seats, but Republicans have been artful about slow-walking these Obama lower court appointments, and the Republican Senate has confirmed only 11 judges since the beginning of the year. Now all of those pending appointments will die. If history is any guide Republicans will abandon \u2014 as they have before \u2014 traditional protections for the minority party, meaning that the views of opposition party senators will not be considered in the appointment of judges, even from states where both senators are Democrats. Senate Democrats, even when they controlled the Senate, did honor those GOP views, but Republicans have forsaken that traditional accommodation in recent times. In the longer run, the focus could well return quickly to the Supreme Court if there are more vacancies \u2014 a distinct possibility. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, appointed by President Clinton, is 83; Justice Anthony Kennedy, a center-right justice appointed by President Reagan, is 80; and Justice Stephen Breyer, a Clinton appointee, is 78. For the past half-century, until Justice Scalia's death, the Supreme Court has had a majority of Republican-nominated justices, with a 5-to-4 conservative majority prevailing for decades in the majority of closely divided cases. A conservative filling the Scalia vacancy would return the court to that narrow, 5-to-4 conservative domination. But with as many as three more vacancies possible in the next four years, that conservative domination could become overwhelming for generations to come. The result could well be the reversal of Roe v. Wade, the court's 1973 abortion decision; a court more hostile to the regulation of Wall Street; a court far more deferential to religious objections to anti-discrimination laws; and many more such dramatic legal turns to the right. Particularly interesting will be how the Supreme Court's view of presidential power evolves. In the eight years of the Obama administration, the court's conservatives have demonstrated an unusual and deep suspicion about executive power, while the court's liberals have shown relative deference. It will be interesting to see if that changes when the president is a Republican with an agenda, instead of a Democrat.",

At issue are two cases testing whether Miami can sue Wells Fargo and Bank of America under the Fair Housing Act for alleged racial discrimination in mortgage terms and foreclosures. Demonstrators in Philadelphia in 2008 try to draw attention to the subprime mortgage crisis. Philadelphia is one of the cities backing Miami's efforts to sue Wells Fargo and Bank of America.\n                \n                    \n                    Matt Rourke/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Demonstrators in Philadelphia in 2008 try to draw attention to the subprime mortgage crisis. Philadelphia is one of the cities backing Miami's efforts to sue Wells Fargo and Bank of America. Specifically, the city of Miami alleges that the banks discriminated against black and Latino homeowners in terms and fees. That made mortgages more expensive than they otherwise would have been, and when these homeowners ran into trouble, the suit says, the banks refused to refinance mortgages on terms equal to those offered to white borrowers in similar economic circumstances. It is a novel lawsuit, brought not by individual homeowners but by the city of Miami, which was among the hardest hit in the housing foreclosure crisis. Supported by two dozen other cities, Miami contends that local governments are in the best position to enforce the statute against large lending institutions that discriminate against certain borrowers. The city claims that the banks' foreclosures were racially imbalanced and unnecessary. They also say the foreclosures resulted in a dramatic drop in property values, which in turn resulted in a dramatic drop in property tax revenue at the very time the city needed to spend more to deal with the resulting urban blight. A federal appeals court based in Atlanta ruled in favor of the city, allowing it the chance to prove its claims at trial. The banks appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that Congress never authorized such suits under the Fair Housing Act and that Miami has failed to show it suffered directly from the discriminatory lending practices it alleges. A for sale sign stands in front of a bank-owned home in Las Vegas in 2008.\n                \n                    \n                    Jae C. Hong/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption A for sale sign stands in front of a bank-owned home in Las Vegas in 2008. According to the banks, if Miami can use the Fair Housing Act to hold them responsible for its financial hardship, anyone harmed by declining property values \u2014 from the local utility company or grocery store to neighboring residents \u2014 could do the same. Miami counters that municipalities differ from private actors because they have an interest in promoting fair housing. Banks' predatory lending practices, Miami says, had \"a direct effect\" on its \"efforts to assure fair housing.\" According to the city, it not only seeks economic relief, but also aims to fulfill the Fair Housing Act's commitment to \"provide ... fair housing throughout the United States.\" Congress passed the Fair Housing Act in 1968 to counteract widespread residential segregation and unequal housing and economic conditions, which had resulted in large part from discriminatory lending policies and white flight. The statute bans a range of discriminatory housing practices, including discriminatory lending. Its creators viewed fair housing as a \"basic keystone\" in solving the poverty, unrest and crime that had gripped the nation's inner cities. In a brief filed with the court, some two dozen cities argue that Miami has accused Bank of America and Wells Fargo of committing \"precisely\" the forms of discrimination that originally gave rise to the Fair Housing Act. Cities including Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Kansas City, observe that municipalities \"affected by high foreclosure rates are beginning to resemble the inner-city areas roiled by violence and poverty in the 1960s.\" The banks contend that Miami cannot sue because the city has not shown that discriminatory lending practices were the \"proximate cause\" of its drop in property tax revenue. While there is little doubt that foreclosures lead to empty houses, which in turn lead to blight and lower property values, the banks argue that economic downturns can be just as responsible as the terms of any loan or series of loans\u2014whether they are discriminatory or not. The conservative Cato Institute also cautions that, if Miami can sue the banks under the Fair Housing Act, municipalities throughout the country could bring similar lawsuits simply to raise revenue \u2014 \"government by litigation,\" the organization calls it. Miami notes that the federal government has played a limited role in enforcing the Fair Housing Act. The Department of Justice has intervened in just two lawsuits similar to Miami's (in Baltimore and Memphis), the city says.",

She says Trump will unify a nation that has divided into factions.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: All this week, we've been exploring what it means to be an American. The latest installment of our series A Nation Engaged, we meet a woman who feels that America needs to be rescued from its elites. Reporter Arun Venugopal of member station WNYC has her story. PATTY DWYER: My name is Patty Dwyer. I live in Brookhaven on Long Island - Brookhaven Hamlet. And I'm - what would you know, I'm 60 years old. Of course, by looking at me you'd never know that. (Laughter) No, I'm only kidding. ARUN VENUGOPAL, BYLINE: Patty Dwyer's a respiratory therapist and proud Irish-American who's actively working to get Donald Trump elected. But eight years ago, she cast her vote for Barack Obama. DWYER: I was happy and looking forward to the first black president. That he was - he's black and white. It's awesome. He could've used that for - oh, my God, to bring us all together. VENUGOPAL: So what happened? In time, Dwyer decided Obama didn't represent her. She thought he was an elitist, unable to appreciate her concerns about Islamic extremism, illegal immigration or violence directed at police officers. DWYER: A lot of us feel that he's laughing. He's laughing and he's mocking anyone who feels that way. VENUGOPAL: It didn't help that she was working fewer hours, taking home less pay, caring for a son who had substance abuse issues. She thinks Donald Trump gets this, gets her frustrations. Take his speech at the Republican convention in July, we watched it together at her home. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore. DWYER: (Laughter) Oh, my gosh. It seems like I've been waiting for this since the '80s. VENUGOPAL: The early days, as she sees it, of political correctness. DWYER: I can't - I'm a little emotional. VENUGOPAL: Why? DWYER: About this - to hear someone actually say things we've been saying for decades and not feeling we were heard. You know what I mean? Or nobody to speak up for us, and it's pretty amazing. VENUGOPAL: Which is why Dwyer's started pro-Trump Facebook groups, why she's weathered threats and the loss of friendships. She thinks Trump can restore something that's been lost. When her family moved from the city to the suburbs in the 1950s, Long Island was like the promise land for middle-class families - clean streets, nice lawns, and, yes, racial segregation, too. Now the property taxes are crushing. And their kids are dying from heroin and opioids. Trump can't solve everything, but she thinks he's best positioned to heal her ailing community. DWYER: I feel that if it's meant to be and everybody's done what they will, Donald Trump will become the next president of the United States. And I actually, as I'm standing here today, I do believe that's going to be the case. VENUGOPAL: Despite the uproar over the recent controversial video, Dwyer is still sticking with her candidate. DWYER: He will win by a landslide. VENUGOPAL: But to make sure everything goes smoothly, Dwyer is training to be a polling inspector. For NPR News, I'm Arun Venugopal in New York.

Holt's topic was how to \"heal the divide\" between the races, but the conversation had meandered from stop-and-frisk to no-fly lists to the Department of Justice's 1973 racial discrimination suit against Trump. When Clinton mentioned the discrimination lawsuit, Holt prompted Trump to respond. After veering further off topic, Trump did something you might call racial credentialing. \"In Palm Beach, Florida ... a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club,\" Trump said. \"And really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African-Americans, against Muslims, against anybody.\" Trump's invocation of his Palm Beach club was his attempt to \"inoculate himself from being called a racist,\" said Melanye Price, a political science professor at Rutgers University. We see this signaling \u2014 \"Trust me, I'm ok on race\" \u2014 from presidential candidates every election as they court people of color. Clinton has referred often to the time when she was 14 and met Martin Luther King, Jr., as well as to her participation in civil rights marches. On May 5 \u2014 Cinco de Mayo \u2014 Trump tweeted about taco bowls, saying, \"I love Hispanics!\" I asked a few experts for some terms for this play at establishing racial bona fides. The people I talked to liken it to someone saying, \"Some of my best friends are black,\" or, \"My wife is Mexican,\" before embarking on a questionable diatribe about African-Americans or Mexican-Americans. Often, people deploy these phrases to position themselves as \"insiders,\" or to give themselves license to say something offensive, said Jennifer Lee, an expert on race and immigration at the University of California, Irvine. Two \"insider\" examples: At a black church in Detroit, Trump told congregants that he wanted to create a \"new civil rights agenda,\" and also touted the importance of their religion: \"For centuries, the African-American church has been the conscience of our country \u2014 so true. It's from the pews and pulpits and Christian teachings of black churches all across this land that the civil rights movement lifted up its soul and lifted up the soul of our nation.\" In December of last year, Clinton's team published a controversial blog post on her site titled \"7 things Hillary Clinton has in common with your abuela,\" which includes lines like: \"She reacts this way when people le faltan el respeto ...\" And ... \"She isn't afraid to talk about the importance of el respeto (especially when it comes to women) ...\" Guillermo Grenier, a sociology professor at Florida International University, says this type of behavior could be an attempt for people \u2014 in this case, candidates \u2014 to simultaneously demonstrate empathy for and solicit empathy from folks. He calls it the \"opposite of othering.\" \"Sometimes [these appeals] come naturally,\" Grenier said, \"but a lot of times it's something you want to portray because you want a group to see you not as the other.\" But as Price pointed out, it's not always about the \"other.\" \"White candidates do this as much (or more) for white voters as they do it for people of color,\" she told me. If a candidate is seen as racially offensive, then for reasons that should be obvious, \"white voters don't want to see themselves as the candidates they choose.\" Slate's Jamelle Bouie expanded on the idea in August: \"The goal is straightforward: If Trump seems more normal and less erratic, then he could begin to win those white college-educated voters who are critical to victory in states like Colorado, Florida, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. For Team Trump, it's a simple equation. If those voters are turned off by his racist rhetoric, then he could address their fears by loudly reaching out to black voters. It's an old strategy, meant to assure a critical set of Republican-leaning voters that they aren't backing a bigot.\" Lee described Clinton and Trump's actions as nodding to their \"affiliative kinships\" \u2014 a term she told me she'd just cobbled together. \"They're trying to show that their actions prove that they care deeply about these communities, and have worked towards racial justice\" on behalf of African-Americans, Latinos and other racial and ethnic minorities, she said. Call it racial inoculation, the \"opposite of othering,\" or \"affiliative kinships,\" but candidates who at least try to appeal across racial lines tend to do better with people of color. That, at least, is what Loren Collingwood, a professor at University of California, Riverside, thinks. \"It's not automatic,\" Collingwood said in an email, \"but if candidates think about it, work at it, throw resources at it, hire the right people, and their opponent does not do these things (or only pays lip service), that candidate will do much better with the groups to which they appeal.\"",

Dormer of the Urban Development Corp. at the launching ceremony of the New York Hyatt Hotel in June 1978.\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Donald Trump stands with New York Mayor Ed Koch, Gov. Hugh Carey and Robert T. Dormer of the Urban Development Corp. at the launching ceremony of the New York Hyatt Hotel in June 1978. During the presidential debate on Monday night, Hillary Clinton raised a 1973 federal lawsuit brought against Donald Trump and his company for alleged racial discrimination at Trump housing developments in New York. The Justice Department sued Donald Trump, his father, Fred, and Trump Management in order to obtain a settlement in which Trump and his father would promise not to discriminate. The case eventually was settled two years later after Trump tried to countersue the Justice Department for $100 million for making false statements. Those allegations were dismissed by the court. \"Donald started his career, back in 1973, being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination \u2014 because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy,\" Clinton said on Monday night. Trump responded to Clinton by emphasizing that the case was settled with no admission of guilt. \"Yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company \u2014 had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens,\" Trump said. \"And we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country \u2014 it was a federal lawsuit \u2014 were sued. We settled the suit with zero, with no admission of guilt.\" The lawsuit was based on evidence gathered by testers for the New York City Human Rights Division, which alleged that black people who went to Trump buildings were told there were no apartments available, while white people were offered units. Back then, Sheila Morse worked as one of those testers. When a black New Yorker was turned down for service and racial bias was suspected, Morse, who is white, would be dispatched to see if she received different treatment. In this case, a black man in search of an apartment in Brooklyn in 1972 saw a sign on a building: \"apartment for rent.\" \"He met with the superintendent, and the superintendent said, 'I'm very sorry, but the apartment is rented \u2014 it's gone,' \" Morse says. \"So the gentlemen said to him, 'Well, why is the sign out? I still see a sign that says apartment for rent.' And the superintendent said, 'Oh, I guess I forgot to take it down.' \" When Morse went to the building to ask about the same apartment, she says, \"They greeted me with open arms and showed me every aspect of the apartment.\" Morse says she reported her experience to the Human Rights Commission, and then returned to the apartment building. After she was offered a lease, the black man who had tried to rent the apartment entered the office with a city human rights commissioner, and the three of them confronted the building superintendent. \"He said, 'Well, I'm only doing what my boss told me to do \u2014 I am not allowed to rent to black tenants,' \" Morse says. The commissioner asked the building superintendent to take him to his boss. That turned out to be Trump Management. Washington Post reporter Michael Kranish, co-author of the book Trump Revealed, tells NPR's Robert Siegel that the Justice Department considered the case \"one of the most significant race bias cases\" at the time. It was a suit that was directly against them, and it is one that Donald Trump to this day clearly is upset about. Michael Kranish \"They signed what was called a consent order,\" Kranish says. \"Trump fought the case for two years. ... He says it was very easy, but actually he fought the case for two years.\" The Trumps took essentially the first settlement offer the federal government provided, Kranish says; the Trumps did not, in fact, have to admit guilt in settling the suit. \"[The settlement] required the Trumps to place ads in newspapers saying that they welcomed black applicants,\" Kranish says. \"It said that the Trumps would familiarize themselves with the Fair Housing Act, which prohibited discrimination. So it also specifically said they don't admit wrongdoing, but they did have to take several measures that the Trumps had fought for two years not to take.\" Trump claims the Justice Department lawsuit was just one of many housing cases against many landlords, but Kranish says this description is misleading. \"Well, there were cases brought against various companies, but the point here is that Trump has said in the debate \u2014 and he also told me when I interviewed him at Trump Tower earlier this year \u2014 that this was part of one massive suit.\" Kranish says, \"And in fact, this very specifically is a case that charges Donald Trump, Fred Trump and their company of race bias in housing rentals. ... It was one of the largest cases of the time. ... \"It was a suit that was directly against them, and it is one that Donald Trump to this day clearly is upset about.\"",

That was one of the big takeaways from a report released this week by the Economic Policy Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C. Researchers were studying the longstanding black-white wage gap, and their findings were grim: The distance between what white Americans and black Americans earn is larger than it's been in almost 40 years. I talked to Valerie Wilson, who analyzes race and the economy for the institute. She told me that the wage gap has grown and shrunk over the years and has lingered in both boom and lean times. While it once varied by region \u2014 smallest in the Midwest and largest in the South \u2014 the gap is now more or less uniform across the country. It's been a chronic blemish on our economy. And the major reason, Wilson said? Not education. Not work experience. Not whether you live on a farm or in a downtown apartment complex. It's discrimination, and it's borne out in the data. I was curious when she said this. How would you even measure discrimination when the people doing it don't tend to advertise it, and the people being discriminated against often don't know it's happening? How do you detect something that is essentially invisible? \"The way that we measure discrimination in this report,\" Wilson said, \"is that it's the portion of the gap that remains after we control for all the other factors that would reasonably influence one's earnings.\" Here's the crux of the matter via the report: \"During the early 1980s, rising unemployment, declining unionization, and policies such as the failure to raise the minimum wage and lax enforcement of anti-discrimination laws contributed to the growing black-white wage gap. During the late 1990s, the gap shrank due in part to tighter labor markets, which made discrimination more costly, and increases in the minimum wage. Since 2000 the gap has grown again.\" The researchers didn't try to describe the ways widespread discrimination caused the wage gap, but we have some ideas. There's the much-cited 2003 study where applicants with resumes boasting \"black-sounding\" names \u2014 Lakisha, say, or Jamal \u2014 were less likely to get callbacks for jobs. And then there's this 2014 study by three prominent economists that analyzed the job searches of nearly 5,200 newly unemployed people in New Jersey: \"First, black job seekers were offered significantly less compensation than whites by potential new employers. Second, blacks were much more likely to accept these lower offers than their white counterparts.\" Interestingly, the economists also found that the racial gap in pay narrowed over time if employees stayed at the same company; that is, once the company became more comfortable with those black hires. But that also means that black folks have to stay with one employer longer to catch up with the wages of their white coworkers. That finding dovetails with data from the EPI study, which pointed out that black college graduates enter the workforce making less than white college graduates. Taken together, black people are starting their work lives with potential employers deciding whether their names disqualify them, with fewer job prospects and with lower entry-level wages. Discrimination, then, is part of the experience of black workers long before and long after they're hired. Discrimination, then, is part of the experience of black workers long before and long after they are hired. Wilson said that the degree of wage discrimination in the labor market fluctuates. In harder times, she said, it's easier for employers to offer black people less. \"When the economy is in a weakened state, quite frankly, discrimination is less costly [to the employer] because there are more available workers than there are available jobs,\" she said, \"and plenty of [people] employers could hire for lower pay,\" Wilson said. But in a flush economy like that of the mid-1990s, discrimination actually worked against employers. When the competition for hiring workers was steeper, Wilson said, the wages for everyone, including black folks, had to creep up. Perhaps not coincidentally, the researchers noted that anti-discrimination laws were being enforced more consistently when the economy was stouter and the wage gap was at its smallest. Wilson told me that some recent proposals meant to reduce the gender wage gap, which has been a recurring subject in the current presidential election cycle, would also make a dent in racial disparities. She pointed to a recent proposal from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that would require employers to report what they pay workers by race, ethnicity and gender. That idea wouldn't be nearly enough to end all the ways discrimination dampens pay, but it might give us a much clearer sense of of just how much salt is in the water.",

Updated at 7:10 p.m. ET Like a lot of people's grandmothers, Flonzie Brown-Wright keeps a candy jar in the living room of her single-story home, which is also adorned with potted plants and family photos. For Brown-Wright, 74, this jar is a reminder of the absurd questions \u2014 questions with no real answers \u2014 that she and other African-Americans had to answer before registering to vote in Mississippi in the 1960s. \"'How many jelly beans in a pound of candy? ... 'How many feathers are on a chicken?' And I got a bar of soap somewhere \u2013 but anyway, how many bubbles in a bar of soap?'\" she recalled. Brown-Wright says you could pass or fail those tests on the whim of an election commissioner. She failed the first time, but eventually became election commissioner herself in nearby Madison County, Miss. \u2014 a groundbreaking achievement for a black woman in the Deep South in the late 1960s. Now Brown-Wright is not pleased with the current political climate she says Donald Trump is fostering \u2014 and she's not alone. Trump has been promising to help bring jobs and security to black neighborhoods. But his poll numbers with African-Americans are in the low single digits, and many say his message is insulting. Brown-Wright now gives workshops on voting rights at local colleges, where she takes her jelly bean jar and soap bar.\"I try and make it real for people so people understand clearly that this is not something that we're just making up. That was on the test,\" she said. \"It's been in my lifetime that I could not register and vote freely. So when I contrast the then and the now, in many respects, this is not what we really fought for \u2014 in terms of the animus, in terms of the hate-filled slogans and rallies and all of that,\" she says. Brown-Wright says the Republican nominee is painting African-American communities with a broad brush, and insulting black voters with his rhetoric, which she calls \"a joke.\" Lowering her voice to mimic Trump, she says, \"'Uh, your schools are no good!' Is that a way to get a vote? 'You have no jobs!' It's just so condescending.\" Brown-Wright says despite Trump's claim that he's reaching out to African American voters \u2013 and his visit this week to Jackson, a majority-black city \u2013 his message does not seem \"genuine.\" Derrick Johnson, president of the Mississippi NAACP, said at a press conference Wednesday that Donald Trump \"clings to the hateful and intolerant rhetoric of this country's shameful history \u2014 a history that we know all too well.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Sarah McCammon/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Derrick Johnson, president of the Mississippi NAACP, said at a press conference Wednesday that Donald Trump \"clings to the hateful and intolerant rhetoric of this country's shameful history \u2014 a history that we know all too well.\" A much younger generation of black activists in Jackson seem to feel the same about the Republican nominee the question he posted to African Americans recently: \"What do you have to lose?\" \"We have a lot to lose,\" Avery Brown, a Jackson State University senior, said with a nervous laugh. \"I mean, I guess there's this notion that we're already so far on the bottom that we can't go any further down?\" Brown is an intern working on a voter registration drive at the Mississippi NAACP office in Jackson. She hopes to attend law school after graduation. Brown says at this point, given Trump's past statements about other minority groups like Latinos and Muslims, there's nothing Trump could say to win her vote. \"And for him to say that he just wants to make black communities better, but while at the same time putting us down, it doesn't add up. You can't make someone better while telling them that they aren't worth anything, or they don't have anything to lose,\" she said. For their part, the Trump campaign offered a response from their director of African-American outreach, Omarosa Manigault. \"The Democrats continue to take the African-American community for granted. It is disconcerting that they would rather pander than formulate substantive policy plans that would actually improve conditions as opposed to continue down the current path of the last eight years,\" Manigault said in a statement. Percy Glasper says he doesn't think there's much any president will do to improve his life.\n                \n                    \n                    Sarah McCammon/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Percy Glasper says he doesn't think there's much any president will do to improve his life. The campaign also provided a response from African-American pastor Mark Burns, who campaigns frequently with Trump. In a statement, Burns said, \"Mr. Trump's critics are just that, critical. African-Americans aren't stupid, we are worse off than where we were eight years ago. We are, as a people, tired of being used by the Democratic Party. Black Lives don't matter to Hillary Clinton, Black Voting Power Matters to Hillary Clinton.\" At the NAACP office in Jackson on Wednesday morning, several pastors and local leaders held a press conference to denounce Trump ahead of his campaign rally. President Derrick Johnson and others accused Trump of spreading intolerance, and being slow to disavow white supremacist support. Johnson pointed to the state's history of racial segregation and violence, saying that Trump \"clings to the hateful and intolerant rhetoric of this country's shameful history \u2013 a history that we know all too well.\" On the other side of the city, Percy Glasper works in the kitchen at Fred's Soul Food restaurant. Glasper, who is African-American, says he's not offended by Trump. He thinks Trump is just making outlandish statements to drum up media attention. \"It only makes his ratings go up. When you're in front of the camera, you do anything to get your shine on,\" Glasper says. Glasper is 40, and a father of four who says he doubts he will vote in November. \"I voted for Obama in the last election and me personally, I didn't see no result. I voted for Bush ... I still didn't see no result,\" he says. \"So I gotta get it myself, you know what I'm saying?\" Glasper says he just wants to make enough money to get out of Mississippi, take his kids on trips, and see the world \u2014 or at least, Seattle or St. Louis. He added that he doesn't think there's much any president will do to improve his life.",

While race is a topic many politicians try to avoid, recent news has made that all but impossible. We've come to expect heartfelt memorial speeches after tragedies, but this week, something unusual happened: folks on both sides of the political aisle addressed the incidents in explicitly racial terms. Yes, they talked about prayer and unity and peace. But they also talked, in no uncertain terms, about racial injustice in America. Listen to the Code Switch podcast \u2014 and subscribe! \u2014here. And share your comments with us on Twitter at @NPRCodeSwitch or via email at codeswitch@npr.org Three people in particular took the opportunity to dig into these issues: President Barack Obama, Republican Senator Tim Scott, and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. President Obama spoke on Tuesday at a memorial service for Brent Thompson, Patrick Zamarripa, Michael Krol, Michael Smith, and Lorne Ahrens, the police officers who were killed at last Thursday's protest in Dallas. He honored the sacrifice and courage of each officer, and insisted that despite violence and despair, \"we are not as divided as we seem.\" But Obama also reflected on the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile at the hands of police, and called out how racism still afflicts the country: \"America, we know that bias remains. We know it, whether you are black, or white, or Hispanic, or Asian, or native American, or of Middle Eastern descent, we have all seen this bigotry in our own lives at some point. We've heard it at times in our own homes. If we're honest, perhaps we've heard prejudice in our own heads and felt it in our own hearts. We know that. And while some suffer far more under racism's burden, some feel to a far greater extent discrimination's stain. Although most of us do our best to guard against it and teach our children better, none of us is entirely innocent. No institution is entirely immune, and that includes our police departments. We know this. And so when African-Americans from all walks of life, from different communities across the country, voice a growing despair over what they perceive to be unequal treatment, when study after study shows that whites and people of color experience the criminal justice system differently. So that if you're black, you're more likely to be pulled over or searched or arrested; more likely to get longer sentences; more likely to get the death penalty for the same crime. When mothers and fathers raise their kids right, and have the talk about how to respond if stopped by a police officer \u2014 yes, sir; no, sir \u2014 but still fear that something terrible may happen when their child walks out the door; still fear that kids being stupid and not quite doing things right might end in tragedy. When all this takes place, more than 50 years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, we cannot simply turn away and dismiss those in peaceful protest as troublemakers or paranoid. We can't simply dismiss it as a symptom of political correctness or reverse racism. To have your experience denied like that, dismissed by those in authority, dismissed perhaps even by your white friends and coworkers and fellow church members, again and again and again, it hurts. Surely we can see that, all of us.\" Some folks were impressed that Obama took on the issue the way he did. Jason Johnson, the politics editor for The Root, told NPR's Renee Montagne that the president's words were courageous. \"This was the memorial service for the five officers that were killed in Dallas. He didn't have to mention Alton Sterling. He didn't have to mention Philando Castile,\" Johnson said. While he doubted Obama's ability to diffuse the most extreme factions in the debate, he gave Obama credit for speaking of Castile and Sterling at the same time that he honored the officers who were killed. \"The president's decision to connect those two events was incredibly courageous on his behalf, to say, look, these events are connected, and the lives of all of these people lost in this overall civil rights conflict are worth mentioning in this environment.\" Jamil Smith of MTV News took issue with what he saw as Obama's attempt to please everyone was alienating a lot of people. \"On the night before his Dallas eulogy, Obama reportedly told a group of police association officials with whom he was meeting that the attack on the officers was a 'hate crime' and would've been prosecuted as such had the shooter survived,\" Smith wrote. Smith acknowledges that Obama didn't reference the term \"hate crime,\" directly in the Tuesday speech, but he still bristles at the idea. \"Hate crime laws first emerged as a response to the Ku Klux Klan's terrorism after Reconstruction. They are meant to protect folks who have been victimized by systemic discrimination and violence because of their identity, not their job. We hear about generations of cops in a family, but no one is born into that role...In trying to make the law enforcement community feel better, Obama may have made things worse. But even in the midst of their grief, the police need to hear some hard truths.\" Tim Scott is the sole African-American Republican member of the Senate, and someone who's been criticized in the past for defending the term \"All Lives Matter.\" In response to last week's violence, Scott prepared a three speech series that he delivered on the Senate floor. It was the second speech on Wednesday in the series that earned the most attention for highlighting the \"trust gap\" between black communities and law enforcement. While Scott was adamant that Americans should be \"thankful and supportive of all those officers do good,\" he also shared stories of the racial profiling that he, his friends and colleagues have faced at the hands of law enforcement \u2014 mentioning that he's been pulled over by police seven times in the course of a year while working as a public official. Scott said he knows very few African-American men who haven't experienced this type of racial discrimination, \"No matter their profession, no matter their income, no matter their disposition in life.\" He continued: \"While I thank God I have not endured bodily harm, I have however felt the pressure applied by the scales of justice when they are slanted. I have felt the anger, the frustration, the sadness, and the humiliation that comes with feeling like you're being targeted for nothing more than being just yourself. As that former staffer I mentioned earlier told me yesterday, there is absolutely nothing more frustrating, more damaging to your soul, than when you know you're following the rules and being treated like you are not... This is a situation that happens all across the country whether we want to recognize it or not. It may not happen a thousand times a day but it happens too many times a day. And to see it as I have had the chance to see it helps me understand why this issue has wounds that have not healed in a generation... Just because you do not feel the pain, the anguish of another, does not mean it does not exist. To ignore their struggles, our struggles, does not make them disappear. It simply leaves you blind and the American family very vulnerable. Some search so hard to explain away injustice that they are slowly wiping away who we are as a nation.\" Jack Hunter, an editor at Rare, reminded readers that Scott has been talking about this for years. \"Tim Scott spoke out against racial profiling. In 2002,\" Hunter wrote. \"He was 36 then. He's now 50 and a United States Senator. And it's still happening.\" Hunter added, \"The importance of Scott's speech is not that he's saying anything others haven't. It's that he's a black Republican admired by many conservatives who's saying it. He's saying it to people who don't necessarily want to hear it.\" Steve Benen, writing for MSNBC, echoed that sentiment. He called Scott's remarks \"striking,\" particularly because of who he is. \"I think it's fair to say the relevance, impact, and reaction to remarks like these would be far different coming from a progressive African-American Democrat. Indeed, it's not hard to imagine what we'd hear, because so many of us have already internalized the dialog. Scott's remarks, if they were acknowledged at all, would be dismissed as 'divisive' paranoia that contributes to a 'war on police,\" Benen wrote. And some Republican leaders were clearly listening. House Speaker Paul Ryan referenced Scott's speech in an interview with NPR's Steve Inskeep. Ryan said that he trusts the word of people of color who say they feel unsafe in encounters with police. \"I do believe this is a problem because people are telling me it's a problem and I believe them,\" Ryan said. And in a tweet, Marco Rubio called Scott's speech \"moving and powerful.\" Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speaks about race on Thursday. Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, delivered a wide-ranging address at the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Ill., where Abraham Lincoln gave his \"House Divided\" speech in 1858. In addition to covering economic inequality, gun control and other issues, she also spoke at length about race. Clinton invoked Lincoln's memory throughout her remarks, contrasting Lincoln's drive to unify a country on the brink of war, with America's current political divisiveness. She also called for all Americans to listen to their fellow citizens, even when their stories are hard to hear. \"We need to listen to the families whose loved ones have been killed in police incidents. Alton Sterling and Philando Castile are just the latest in a long and painful litany of African-Americans dying after encounters with police officers. We remember Laquan McDonald, killed in Chicago a year and a half ago and Sandra Bland, who grew up in Illinois who died one year ago today. Time after time, no one is held accountable. And surely we can all agree that's deeply wrong and needs to change. And yes we do need to listen to those who say 'Black Lives Matter.' Too many black Americans, especially young men, feel like their lives are disposable. And they worry every single day about what might happen. They have reason to feel that way. And it's absolutely unacceptable. Everyone in America, everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity. Surely that is something we can all unite behind. We need to acknowledge the five Latinos who also lost their lives in police incidents last week. Their stories didn't get national media coverage, but their families and communities are mourning too.\" Monique Garcia of the Chicago Tribune, wrote that \"During previous speeches, Clinton tried to associate Republicans with the controversial Trump. But in Springfield, she attempted to navigate a finer point in making an appeal for unity regardless of political support.\" Garcia also wrote that Clinton \"called for tough but necessary conversations to heal deep divisions across the nation following last week's fatal shootings.\" But in an opinion piece for The New York Times, John McWhorter, criticized Clinton's emphasis on conversation to address racism. \"Narrow policy proposals may not have the emotional reach of a conversation, and in and of themselves they will not stop the next Philando Castile either,\" McWhorter wrote. \"But they would do more for black America than any amount of formulaic dialogues, or exploring the subtle contours of whites' inner feelings about black people.\" Stacey Patton, writing for The Washington Post, was critical of Clinton's message more than her approach. \"Clinton's call for everyone to 'do the work' to unite against hatred overlooks the fundamental fact that it's whites \u2014 and only whites \u2014 who must work to fix the racist structures in our society,\" Patton wrote. \"While Clinton may not have intended it this way, what the message of unity winds up doing is blaming communities of color for failing to assimilate, rather than acknowledging that the very fabric of this nation is built upon a diabolical, calculated and constantly evolving system of racism.\"",

Mike Pence delivers a speech during a campaign rally for Donald Trump in Westfield, Ind., on Tuesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Indiana Gov. Mike Pence delivers a speech during a campaign rally for Donald Trump in Westfield, Ind., on Tuesday. Donald Trump has chosen Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate, a source with direct knowledge confirms to NPR's Mara Liasson. A rollout in New York City had been planned for Friday at 11 a.m., but Trump tweeted Thursday evening that \"in light of the horrible attack in Nice, France,\" he was postponing that announcement. Even with sources and multiple news organizations reporting Pence has been offered the job, Trump called into Fox News Thursday night and said he hasn't \"made my final, final decision.\" He underscored that the two other finalists, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, were still in the mix, calling both of them \"fantastic\" people. But Pence is the only one who has a clock ticking. He cannot run for both re-election as governor and for vice president, and he must withdraw by noon Friday so that the state party can replace him on the ballot. Pence would give Trump a younger, conservative favorite to help heal the rift within the Republican Party and ease the minds of many still skeptical of the presumptive presidential nominee. The Indiana governor emerged as a front-runner in the past week, with many of Trump's advisers reportedly liking what the 57-year-old would bring to the ticket. He's a more cautious, less-flashy choice over Gingrich and Christie. He won't run the risk of overshadowing Trump and could help him appeal to disaffected conservatives and evangelical voters. Having served at both the state and federal levels, Pence also has the political experience Trump has said he is looking for to help him navigate Washington. A House member for 12 years, Pence was elected governor in 2012. Before entering politics, he was a conservative talk radio host and hosted a Sunday political TV show in Indianapolis. He was also president of a conservative think tank in the state, the Indiana Policy Review Foundation. Pence has been praised for helping revive Indiana's economy \u2014 an argument he can make on the stump with Trump. When he took office, the state's jobless rate was at 20 percent, per CNBC; it has now fallen to 5 percent. He became a born-again Christian in college and has talked about how his faith drives his politics, saying he is \"a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.\" In 2015, he signed into law a controversial religious freedom bill, which spurred wide backlash and fears it would enable LGBT discrimination. Many state businesses \u2014 including the NCAA, which was readying to hold the Final Four there \u2014 said they reconsidered deals and investments. Pence later signed a revision he said would prevent such LGBT discrimination, but many religious conservatives faulted him for bending to political pressure. Earlier this week, Tony Perkins, president of the conservative Family Research Council, told NBC News that he believed Trump could \"do better\" with a pick \"who has not capitulated on something as fundamental as religious freedom.\" Even though Pence initially endorsed Ted Cruz ahead of his state's May 3 primary, his blessing for the Texas senator was lukewarm \u2014 he had also praised Trump. He endorsed Trump shortly after he won his state \u2014 a win that effectively ended the GOP primary after Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich dropped out. Donald Trump knows that we can make America great again. @realDonaldTrump Donald Trump knows that the boundless potential of the American People awaits. @realDonaldTrump Trump campaigned with Pence in Indiana this week, and the governor was the only one of the three finalists who introduced Trump to the crowd. \"Donald Trump gets it. Donald Trump hears the voice of the American people,\" Pence boasted, adding that, \"We are ready to put a fighter, a builder and a patriot in the Oval Office of the United States of America.\" He followed up on that appearance with tweets supportive of Trump. The two appeared to get along well, and Trump teased the crowd in Westfield, Ind., \"I don't know if he's going to be your governor or your vice president, who the hell knows!\" Pence was already locked in a tough rematch with former State House Speaker John Gregg, in part owing to his falling standing in the state after the religious freedom law controversy. Republicans can replace him on the ballot. According to the Indianapolis Star, potential replacements include Lt. Gov Eric Holcomb and Rep. Susan Brooks. Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma and Rep. Todd Rokita have already signaled their interest.",

Everywhere you turn in the world of sports, in seemingly every league, in amateur, college and professional ranks, you find athletes carrying the banner of some sort of political protest. But it started with Muhammad Ali. Today, there's LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and their teammates wearing gray hoodies in support of Trayvon Martin. The Chicago Bulls' Derrick Rose donning a T-shirt that reads \"I CAN'T BREATHE\" before another game. Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe taking a stand in favor of same-sex marriage. The U.S. Women's Soccer Team \u2014 the reigning World Cup Champions \u2014 threatening to skip the Olympics, filing a wage discrimination suit and demanding equal pay and the same kind of support the U.S. Men's Team receives. It's football players at Northwestern University trying to start a union and pressing for pay for college athletes beyond the scholarship that covers the cost of their education. And there are members of the St. Louis Rams making a bold statement in solidarity with protesters in Ferguson, Mo. They took the field before the game with their hands up in the air, miming the \"hands up, don't shoot\" that demonstrators made after the police shooting of unarmed black teen Michael Brown. \"The prototype is Muhammad Ali\" in 1967 when he maintained his right to not be inducted into the U.S. Army on religious grounds, says professor Daniel Grano of the University of North Carolina, Charlotte. Grano says today it's almost a matter of routine, \"it's practically generic, that a reference to Ali is going to be made whenever people engage in that kind of activism.\" Ali's Journey From Superstar To Activist In this 1967 photo, black athletes gather for a meeting to hear Ali's view on rejecting Army induction.

Back row (left to right): Carl Stokes (Democratic state representative), Walter Beach, Bobby Mitchell, Sid Williams, Curtis McClinton, Willie Davis, Jim Shorter and John Wooten. Muhammad Ali embodied the collision of sports and politics like no athlete before him ... or since. His journey from young superstar to activist is remarkable, even a half century later. In 1960, he was still Cassius Clay from Louisville \u2014 an 18-year-old with remarkable athletic gifts who wore red, white and blue after winning a gold medal at the 1960 Summer Olympics. He was known for his quick wit, supreme self-confidence and boastful rhymes \u2014 but not politics. By 1964, he was the heavyweight champion of the world. That's also the year he joined the Nation of Islam \u2014 led by Malcolm X \u2014 and changed his name to Muhammad Ali. That move confused or shocked white Americans who followed his career, but that was nothing compared to the reaction when Ali refused induction into the U.S. Army in 1967 citing his religious beliefs and opposition to the Vietnam War. And the core of his protest was his identity as a black man, a black Muslim, in America. Muhammad Ali (right) is shown with Malcolm X, outside the Trans-Lux Newsreel Theater in New York City, after watching a screening of films on Ali's title fight with Sonny Liston on March 1, 1964.\n                \n                    \n                    File Photo/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Muhammad Ali (right) is shown with Malcolm X, outside the Trans-Lux Newsreel Theater in New York City, after watching a screening of films on Ali's title fight with Sonny Liston on March 1, 1964. Ali was as determined to stand up for what he believed in as he was to dominate opponents in the boxing ring. But instead of 15 rounds, this went on for 3 1/2 years. And it came at a very steep price, one unimaginable for an athlete today. He was stripped of his title. He was banned from boxing. His source of income was gone. This was when he was age 25 to 28, most certainly his prime athletic years. Refusing The Idea Of A 'Comfortable Level Of Blackness' Ali's willingness to publicly take an unpopular political stand sets him apart from groundbreaking African-American athletes that preceded him, says Kevin Blackistone, a journalism professor at the University of Maryland and a Washington Post columnist. Names like Olympian Jesse Owens and baseball's Jackie Robinson. For Owens and Robinson, their excellence in competition combined with their mere presence was the political statement. And Blackistone notes that both \"were asked to swallow their pride in order to participate in their sport at the highest level.\" Robinson had to agree to take all manner of racial abuse, to ensure that what was labeled baseball's \"Grand Experiment\" would work. UNC's Grano adds that Robinson was chosen not just for his athletic skills, but \"because he represented a comfortable level of blackness for white fans.\" \"That changed with Ali,\" says Blackistone. \"He stood in the face of that and refused any suggestion that he be anything other than himself.\" As for taking on the Vietnam War, Blackistone notes that Ali \"was really on an island. Not only as an athlete, but as an American citizen, because most Americans in the mid-1960s support the war effort in Vietnam.\" Tommie Smith and John Carlos, gold and bronze medalists in the 200-meter run at the 1968 Olympic Games, engage in a victory stand protest against unfair treatment of African-Americans in the United States. Australian Peter Norman is the silver medalist.\n                \n                    \n                    Bettmann/Bettmann Archive\n                    \n                \nhide caption Tommie Smith and John Carlos, gold and bronze medalists in the 200-meter run at the 1968 Olympic Games, engage in a victory stand protest against unfair treatment of African-Americans in the United States. Australian Peter Norman is the silver medalist. In subsequent years, Ali's actions inspired other athletes to step up. At the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, American sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos had finished first and third in the 200-meter race. During the medal ceremony, they donned black gloves, bowed their heads, and each held a fist in the air as the national anthem was played. It was a protest to highlight how far the U.S. civil rights movement had to go to eliminate racial injustice. It remains an iconic moment in Olympic history. The athletes were subsequently suspended from the U.S. Olympic team and banned from the Olympic village. Other notables that followed include tennis star Arthur Ashe, a powerful voice in highlighting the apartheid system of racial segregation in South Africa. As an African-American, he was repeatedly denied visas to travel to South Africa to compete in tennis matches there. He subsequently lobbied for the U.S. to impose sanctions and was arrested in 1985, during a protest at the Embassy of South Africa in Washington. Perhaps because Muhammad Ali paved the way, protests by athletes have become more acceptable to the general public. There are still loud complaints from some that athletes should \"just play the game\" and \"keep their politics out of sports.\" But the stakes in general are lower than what Ali faced. Still, an athlete taking a stand does risk alienating fans, sponsors, teammates and sportswriters, potential endorsement deals, and the university that has given a scholarship. It is perhaps ironic that in his post-athletic career, Ali became a figure embraced by Americans of all races, and indeed by the entire world, as a symbol of courage. Much of that was due to the toll Parkinson's disease took on his body. He was frail. And while still courageous, Ali was no longer the brash, in-your-face radical whose political stand in the '60s rattled those who would praise him decades later.",

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, argue a point during a Republican presidential primary debate at Fox Theatre in Detroit earlier this month.\n                \n                    \n                    Paul Sancya/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, argue a point during a Republican presidential primary debate at Fox Theatre in Detroit earlier this month. Where powerful streams converge, there will be turbulence. That applies to politics as well as to waterways. Right now, two powerful streams of Republicanism in our time are converging on Cleveland and threatening to define the party's national convention in July. One of these streams is like a historic river, long settled in its course. The other is more like a flood, surging beyond its banks to render the landscape unrecognizable. Ted Cruz, the uber-conservative senator from Texas, has emerged as the candidate of the old-school stream, which now carries him toward a confrontation with Donald Trump, the man who unleashed the pent-up force of the new flood. History is in the balance. It has become almost a commonplace to say the coming clash in Cleveland may determine not only the 2016 nominee but the survival of the Republican Party as we know it. History is also the backdrop against which this battle will be fought, providing insight into the process and the outcome. The Cruz forces in the party are the recognizable heirs of its Regulars of generations ago. Their beliefs have been the bedrock for the Grand Old Party since it started calling itself that in the 19th century. Their credo prizes individual liberty over government programs and regulations. They are ever-respectful of states and suspicious of Washington. They detest taxes and have no use for labor unions. They are steeped in traditional social values, faith-based religion and commitment to a strong national defense. These legacy conservatives fought the party's progressives a century ago, resisting also the New Deal in the 1930s and the Great Society in the 1960s. Sometimes labeled the \"Old Right,\" or \"paleo-conservatives,\" they have kept their flame alive through decades when the party typically chose centrists or moderate conservatives for president who were acceptable to the party establishment. (Explore a century of intra-party convention wars here.) In the current Congress, the revival of old-school conservatism is alive in the Freedom Caucus, a relatively new alliance of about 40 mostly junior members. In the fall of 2013, when the government shut down for 16 days over funding for Obamacare, members of the Freedom Caucus huddled with one newly elected freshman senator to plot strategy. That senator was Ted Cruz. Trump's Legion But present day Republicanism is also driven by a host of newer arrivals, visible in the thousands crowding into Trump's rallies and the millions following Trump on Twitter. Surely the Trump phenomenon has to do with his highly personal brand and media magnetism, but the voters he represents are not simply a personality cult. Many of them trace their \"roots\" as Republicans back no farther than the Tea Party movement that arose in response to the first months of President Obama's first term. Others may have come to the GOP during its growth spurt in the Ronald Reagan era, when the Republican tent expanded to welcome \"Reagan Democrats.\" For decades, Southern voters who preferred Reagan or Richard Nixon, continued to vote Democratic for other offices. But that changed in 1994, when in one midterm election the \"Solid South\" went from having a majority of Democratic governors, senators and members of Congress to having Republican majorities in all three categories. And the GOP has held on to those majorities ever since, adding majorities in state legislatures as well. These newer Republicans, whether Reagan era or drawn to Trump, tend to be working people and business people who have gravitated to the Republican Party as they aged and as the parties changed. They are predominantly older, white and Anglo, and most of them are men. They come from all levels of education and affluence, but many do not have college degrees or high incomes. And whatever their backgrounds, they are as much a part of the Grand New Party as their more ideologically orthodox cousins who have been there for generations. The new arrivals do not necessarily disagree with the old-school GOP on any of its basic tenets, but they are much more recent in their association with the party \u2014 and potentially more transient as well. Their energy comes not so much from roots and principles as from their reaction to immediate issues and pressures. They feel their economic security and cultural comfort level being threatened by immigration and greater diversity, by social change and activist government. When they hear Trump say \"make America great again,\" they hear a promise of their own personal restoration \u2014 individually and as a group. History Of Conflict This new conflict, between the parties of Cruz and Trump, draws from deep wells of resentment and dissent within Republicanism \u2014 feelings that may be reinforced by personal rivalries based in region and personality, as well as ideology. At one time, the party had a robust progressive wing that supported President Theodore Roosevelt and often worked with like-minded Democrats in Congress. Later, there were Republicans, often called the Eastern Establishment, who shared some of the goals of the New Deal in the 1930s and stood with relatively centrist presidents of both parties (Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower) in the 1940s and 1950s. In this era, the term \"liberal Republican\" was not an oxymoron. In 1964, four of five Republicans in Congress voted for the Civil Rights Act. Republican votes defeated the filibuster by southern Democrats in the Senate. But thereafter, the party of Lincoln experienced a sea change. The pivotal moment came in 1964, when Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater broke from his own party's Senate leaders to vote against the Civil Rights Act. One month later, the Republican Party's national convention nominated for him president. In November, Goldwater carried just six states, his home state and five in the Deep South (Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina) that were disillusioned with President Lyndon Johnson for ending racial segregation. Goldwater lost, but the party's new focus on the South survived. In 1968, Richard Nixon won the Republican nomination and embarked on what was called a \"Southern Strategy.\" One symbol of the shift was party switcher Strom Thurmond, a South Carolina Dixiecrat who had run against his own Democratic president as the \"States Rights Party\" nominee in 1948. In 1964, the Republican Nixon claimed most of the states of the Confederacy. He would win them all four years later. When Ronald Reagan became the face of the Republican Party in the 1980s, he smiled even more broadly on the South, launching his first campaign as the GOP nominee from Mississippi with praise for the code phrase \"states rights.\" The states of the South, together with the Mountain States, became the base of the \"Republican lock\" on the White House in that era \u2014 and remain its best source of electoral votes today. Since the 1990s, the same states have been home base for Republican majorities in Congress as well. The racial overtones of the party divide have since become even more unmistakable. Black voters deserted the GOP nationwide even as white voters, especially white men, felt increasingly at home there. This has intensified in the Obama years, expressing itself in the \"birther\" challenge to Obama's citizenship and in elements of the Tea Party uprising as well. When asked about the birther issue, even prominent Republican officials typically said they \"didn't know\" whether Obama was born in the U.S. or not. Among those who kept talking up the birther story longest was Donald Trump. Effect On 2016 Some moderates do remain in Republican ranks. Some polls suggest as many as 30 percent of Republicans might self-identify as moderates or moderate conservatives. Some support abortion rights and same sex marriage, and their views on immigration may be as varied as the nation's. But in the 2016 presidential primaries, this center-right fraction of the party has been nearly invisible amid the media attention to Trump and a few rival conservatives. Beyond that, the old establishment has been without a hero to rally around. Jeb Bush, scion of the party's last dynastic family, did not make it to Super Tuesday. John Kasich, the Ohio governor, is one of the last four contenders standing, and could reasonably be called a fallback for the party's vestigial center-right. But at this point, Kasich appears in the running primarily as a prospective running mate. This lack of a horse for the establishment (or moderates, or moderate conservatives) to ride demonstrates how the intraparty wars have moved. The new competition is between kinds of conservatives: basically, between conservatives old and new.",

Is that racist? Over the weekend, a sizable gaggle of the white nationalist \"alt-right\" convened at a federal building in Washington, D.C., to puff their chests. It was a motley crew, emboldened by the election of Donald Trump, with whom they shared a broad aversion to immigration and contempt for \"political correctness.\" Their views were finally flitting around the mainstream of American politics. I guess that's why they were so touchy about their branding when my Code Switch teammate, Adrian Florido, asked a leader of the assembled group if they were using the \"alt-right\" label to camouflage views better described as racist. \"As far as the term racist is concerned, it always had a pejorative connotation,\" answered Jared Taylor, a prolific white nationalist writer. \"If racist were simply a neutral word ... fine. But that word cannot be retrieved or sanitized.\" If you needed another illustration of how the word racist has been defined so preposterously that nothing might ever meet the criteria, here it was. One of America's most prominent white separatists \u2014 a dude who dreams of a whites-only America and has called for the full repeal of the Civil Rights Act because it bars discrimination in private enterprise; a dude who was attending an event that ended in a chorus of Nazi cheers \u2014 was arguing against being labeled a racist because it makes his ideas sound distasteful. One of the many victories of the civil rights movement was casting racism as a moral failure of our society. But that's had the bizarre consequence of confounding the issue for many Americans, who have never been especially literate about race to begin with. That's how we've ended up in a place where anyone of any political stripe can use racist as a cudgel, no matter how outlandish the allegation. Just last week, Joel Pollak, the editor at large of Breitbart News, appeared on NPR's Morning Edition to defend Steve Bannon, the Trump adviser and former Breitbart editor, who once bragged about making that site the platform of the aforementioned alt-right. You probably know where this is going: Pollak defended his former boss by saying NPR programming is racist. A guest on Morning Edition called NPR racist because it had \"racial and racist programming,\" by which he meant Code Switch.\n                \n                    \n                    Malte Mueller/Getty Images/fStop\n                    \n                \nhide caption A guest on Morning Edition called NPR racist because it had \"racial and racist programming,\" by which he meant Code Switch. \"NPR is taxpayer-funded and has an entire section of its programming, a regular feature called Code Switch, which from my perspective, is a racist program,\" Pollak told host Steve Inskeep. \"I'm looking here at the latest article which aired on NPR calling the election results 'nostalgia for a whiter America.' So NPR has racial and racist programming.\" He was talking about a recent commentary by Beenish Ahmed (which was online only) describing the fear many Muslims in America feel about a president-elect who has regularly railed against Muslims and emboldened anti-Muslim sentiment. By Pollak's logic, complaining about racism is itself racist. But many more, less cynical Americans seem to look at racism in an equally odd way: Good people should endeavor to be colorblind and never talk about race or its unequal effects on how we live. And real racism is the province of a small cohort of uncomplicated knuckle-draggers whose presence is overstated by the ax-grinding, \"identity politics\" crowd. Our mainstream news media haven't done much to add clarity. We've developed a whole grab bag of tortured terminology for contentious racial subject matter \u2014 racially insensitive, racially charged or just plain racial \u2014 to avoid committing to calling anything racist. The dangers here are obvious. Because active racial discrimination and inequality remain defining features of American life \u2014 in housing, in our schools, in our criminal justice system, in employment \u2014 avoiding the word racist misrepresents the truth. The result is that racial issues have no meaningful distinctions, and racist in our mainstream discourse is defined only as something as extreme as the lynching of Emmett Till, or as an idea up for debate (Is THIS racist?), or as a phenomenon with no contemporary human vectors. If you call me a murderer, I'll just laugh, because I'm not a murderer. But if you call me a racist, I'll lose my s***. Robin DiAngelo, professor, Westfield State \"It's like the N-word for white people,\" Robin DiAngelo, a professor at Westfield State in Massachusetts, told me when we discussed the Pollak exchange earlier this week. (We spoke over the phone, but her eye-roll was strongly implied.) \"If you call me a murderer, I'll just laugh, because I'm not a murderer. But if you call me a racist, I'll lose my s***.\" She offered up a recent example from the news: A small-town West Virginia mayor and a local official found themselves in trouble over a Facebook post that called Michelle Obama an \"ape in heels.\" The official, Pamela Ramsey Taylor, wrote the post, and Clay, W.Va., Mayor Beverly Whaling added an approving note. The mayor resigned and Taylor, who was fired, later apologized, saying that her Facebook post was not racist and neither was she, and that the controversy surrounding her post was a hate crime against her. \"If [\"ape in heels\"] wasn't racist, what could possibly constitute racism?\" DiAngelo wondered. DiAngelo's specific academic focus is critical discourse analysis \u2014 the study of language as action. But outside the classroom, her job is to talk about racism. She leads seminars for faculty groups and nonprofit organizations. She kicks off those conversations by saying that America's political system and culture are racist in that they have always held whiteness as the threshold for legitimacy and authority. That idea that racism is foundational to American life isn't too controversial among social scientist types, but it still scandalizes many of the folks in DiAngelo's seminars. \"I sometimes wish we had new language because the baggage attached to these words is so deep,\" she said. But even for folks who don't treat racism as radioactive, the word has undergone a kind of definition creep, shorthand for any host of phenomena \u2014 yellowface, Islamophobia, sombrero-wearing, hair-touching, police shootings, mass incarceration \u2014 that are different in expression, scope and consequence. Some of these things have the weight of institutions and policy behind them. Some are the result of individual people being awful. \"Racism\" can be a powerful, compelling descriptor, but sometimes I wonder if we might be muddying up conversations \u2014 and inviting frustrating, unhelpful digressions about the inner workings of people's hearts \u2014 by insisting on it. That, of course, isn't where the mainstream conversation about racism is. DiAngelo, who spends her time trying to convince people that racism is A Thing, told me that she felt oddly buoyed by a small moment on the presidential campaign trail: Mike Pence's suggestion that there had been too much talk about institutional racism in policing during election season. She didn't agree with him, of course. But she was happy that the conversation had gotten to the point where he had to say those words \u2014 institutional racism \u2014 and treat it as a real idea. \"You take your victories where you can, I guess,\" she said.",

            "article_content": "Tuesday's election decided that the Republican Party would control the executive and legislative branches of government. What do the election results mean for nominations to the Supreme Court?  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And joining us now to discuss how those results will affect the Supreme Court is NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg. Good morning. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: Good morning. MONTAGNE: Let's start, Nina, with the immediate effect of Donald Trump being the next president of the United States. TOTENBERG: Well, the vacancy created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia almost a year ago will now be filled not by Obama nominee Merrick Garland, but by a Trump nominee. And with Republicans continuing to control the U.S. Senate, that nominee will almost certainly be easily confirmed, and the court will then revert to the conservative 5-to-4 majority that's prevailed for decades. MONTAGNE: What do we know now, though, about how Donald Trump would choose his nominee? TOTENBERG: We don't actually know a lot. He's issued two long lists of potential nominees. Significant is who's not on that list. Some of the most distinguished conservative judges and lawyers in the country are not on that list. We don't know who the most influential people will be. We don't know any of that. We just sort of have to take it on faith that this is going to be a very conservative nominee because all of the people on the list are very conservative potential nominees. MONTAGNE: And there is one vacancy on the court now, as we've just said. What to expect in the next four years? TOTENBERG: Well, it's entirely possible that we'll have more vacancies. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 83. Justice Stephen Breyer, also a Democratic appointee, is 78. Justice Anthony Kennedy is sort of a center-right justice appointed by President Reagan. He's 80. Any or all of those people could retire or be hit with health problems, et cetera. And it's entirely conceivable that, in the next four years, we'll have three more vacancies and that we would have the Trump effect on the court for generations to come. So you could imagine the Court's abortion decision, for example, Roe v. Wade, reversed. You could imagine a court that's already quite sympathetic to the business community becoming much more so, a court more hostile to regulations overall, a court far more deferential to religious objections to anti-discrimination laws. And these are just the ones I can think of off the top of my head. For the last half-century, Renee, until Justice Scalia's death, the Supreme Court has had a majority of Republican-nominated justices. But what's been really unusual about the last eight years is the deep suspicion evidenced by the court's conservatives about executive power, presidential power and the relative deference of the court's liberals. So it's going to be particularly interesting to see if that changes when the president is a Republican with an agenda instead of a Democrat with an agenda. MONTAGNE: NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg, thanks very much. TOTENBERG: Thank you, Renee. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

J'Neen Skinner says she and her husband are struggling to buy a house. Much of the anger and anxiety in the 2016 election is fueled by the sense that economic opportunity is slipping away for many Americans. This week, as part of NPR's collaborative project with member stations, A Nation Engaged, we're asking the question: What can be done to create economic opportunity for more Americans? Boston's high-tech economy is flourishing and real estate prices are soaring, but a legacy of racial discrimination has worsened a huge wealth divide. South Boston's waterfront is the heart of the city's innovation district, the home to biotech and financial services companies \u2014 and proliferating steel and glass office towers and luxury condominiums. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce ranks Boston as the American city best positioned to lead the shift to a digital economy, thanks to this innovation boom. \"So I think it's a significant moment that says to anyone who's thinking about where they either want to do their startup, locate their company that Boston is now the place to be,\" says Jim Rooney, president of the greater Boston Chamber of Commerce. But J'Neen Skinner and her husband represent another side of this economy. Not long ago, Skinner, who is African-American, and her husband, who's the son of Haitian immigrants, were both unemployed and counted on food stamps, cash assistance and public housing. Things are better now. They both have jobs at a nonprofit in Boston and have their sights set on a key piece of the American dream. \"Currently, we're looking to buy a home and it is quite a struggle across the board,\" J'Neen Skinner says. It's a struggle because Boston has some of the highest housing prices in the country. And because when times were tough, J'Neen Skinner and her husband relied on credit cards to pay their bills \u2014 and fell behind. Skinner also has more than $30,000 in student loans, so their credit score is too low to qualify for a mortgage. \"We were both not educated on the importance of having a high credit score,\" she says. \"So we are diligently working on paying off past-due balances.\" And so that's a snapshot of Boston's divided economy: the city's innovation district, building enormous wealth for some and J'Neen Skinner, struggling to buy a house. The Millennium Tower looking down Franklin Street in downtown Boston. The city has seen a tech boom and housing prices have also increased over the past few years.\n                \n                    \n                    Jesse Costa/WBUR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Millennium Tower looking down Franklin Street in downtown Boston. The city has seen a tech boom and housing prices have also increased over the past few years. Ana Patricia Mu\u00f1oz, an assistant vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, says it's just one story about the dramatic disparity in wealth. \"And when you get deeper into the data, you really realize that the racial differences and ethnic differences are immense,\" she says. Mu\u00f1oz is the author of a study called \"The Color of Wealth in Boston.\" Among the key findings: The city's white households have a median net worth \u2014 the value of their assets minus their debts \u2014 of about $250,000. The median net worth of black households: zero. And almost 80 percent of white families own a home, while just a third of black families do. Mu\u00f1oz says that means blacks have much less ability than whites to pass wealth on to their children \u2014 perpetuating the racial wealth gap. \"It's really the money that's passed down from generation to generation,\" Mu\u00f1oz says. \"Whites are more likely to get help to buy a house or more likely to get help to pay for education. And so then you see the cumulative consequences reflected in that number.\" By contrast, consider the experience of Setti Warren, who inherited his home in Newton, a wealthy Boston suburb. \"I think about my story and how fortunate I've been because there's no way my wife and I would be able to afford to live in that house right now if not for the intergenerational transfer of our home,\" he says. Warren is not just a fortunate homeowner in Newton, he's the mayor, and he's African-American. But he's keenly aware of the racial wealth gap and that too few blacks are in his position. He says his father was a Korean War veteran who bought the family home with the help of the GI Bill. \"This idea that if you work hard, you're able to take care of yourself and you're able to ensure that your child's life will be better off than yours. That story is something that we're losing,\" Warren says. The reasons for the wealth gap are many and complicated, including racially discriminatory housing and lending policies of the past. The report from the Boston Fed calls it a public policy challenge requiring immediate attention.",

As Elly Yu of member station WABE reports, businesses played a huge role in the debate.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: Georgia's governor is vetoing a bill that critics said would have led to discrimination against people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. Elly Yu of member station WABE reports those critics include big business and Hollywood. ELLY YU, BYLINE: Republican Governor Nathan Deal says his decision came down to wanting to reflect the state's character. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NATHAN DEAL: Georgia is a welcoming state. It is full of loving, kind and generous people, and that is what we should want. YU: Georgia's also been a welcoming state for many businesses. With more than a dozen Fortune 500 companies based here, it prides itself on luring in more corporate headquarters, like Mercedes-Benz USA, as well as attracting more filmmaking. So when state lawmakers passed a bill this month that would allow faith-based nonprofits to refuse services or higher people due to religious reasons, businesses spoke up loudly. Delta Air Lines, Coca-Cola, UPS, Home Depot and hundreds of Georgia businesses came together to fight the legislation. Those companies were concerned the measure amounted to legalize discrimination against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. Today, Governor Deal seemed to agree. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DEAL: I do not think that we have to discriminate against anyone to protect the faith-based community in Georgia of which I and my family have been a part of for all of our lives. YU: William Pate says he's relieved the governor came to this conclusion. Pate heads the Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WILLIAM PATE: I think his decision is really going to sustain Georgia's position as a No. 1 state in which to do business. YU: But having business weigh in on politics isn't new in Georgia. Atlanta, the state's capitol, has a long history of corporate heavyweights shaping key decisions. In 1964, when Martin Luther King Jr. received the Nobel Peace Prize, some white elites refused to attend an integrated dinner in his honor. That's when Coca-Cola threatened to leave the state if the boycott happened. About 1,600 people ended up attending the sold-out event where Martin Luther King Jr. addressed the crowd. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.: This marvelous hometown welcome and honor will remain dear to me as long as the chords of memory shall lengthen. YU: But in this case, the business community's fight may not be over yet. Supporters of the bill were disappointed in the governor's decision, saying the bill is still necessary to protect people who want to follow their own religious beliefs. State Senator Josh McKoon criticized the governor for what he sees as bowing to business. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOSH MCKOON: If we're going to allow a handful of business executives largely from outside of our state to dictate public policy, I mean, I would argue we could do away with the kind of quaint elections that we have. We may as well just auction off seats in the legislature. YU: Some lawmakers are now calling for a special session to try to override the governor's veto. For NPR News, I'm Elly Yu in Atlanta.

Parson is now one of three pastors who say a new rule in Virginia requiring primary voters to sign a pledge before getting a Republican ballot is discriminatory.\n                \n                    \n                    Richard Drew/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Pastor Stephen Parson holds one of Donald Trump's books before meeting with the candidate in New York last November. Parson is now one of three pastors who say a new rule in Virginia requiring primary voters to sign a pledge before getting a Republican ballot is discriminatory. When Donald Trump met with a group of black ministers in New York City in November, Stephen Parson, a minister from Richmond, Va., was faithfully in attendance. Then, in December, when Trump spoke at a rally in Manassas, Va., Parson again stood by his side \u2014 this time giving him a ringing endorsement. Parson is an evangelist for Trump, and he's also a plaintiff in a lawsuit filed Wednesday against members of the Virginia State Board of Elections over a new rule that requires GOP primary voters to sign a pledge. Two other plaintiffs \u2014 Leon Benjamin and Bruce L. Waller Sr. \u2014 are also named in the lawsuit. They want to vote in the Republican primary, but they don't want to sign the \"loyalty oath.\" My signature below indicates that I am a Republican. Virginia GOP Primary Pledge Virginia has historically held an open primary \u2014 because there's no party registration in the state, voters could choose either a Democratic or Republican ballot at the polls. But this year, anyone who opts for a GOP ballot must also sign a nine-word statement that reads: \"my signature below indicates that I am a Republican.\" In the lawsuit, the pastors claim the new rule is discriminatory; it will lead to \"long lines\" and deter minority voters from participating. \"I think that's a clear violation of people who would otherwise expect to be equally protected,\" said Chester Smith, the lawyer who represents the three Richmond-area pastors. Smith argues that the new rule violates the First Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th amendment and the Voting Rights Act. Given Virginia's history of racial discrimination, the Trump supporters claim the new requirement will create a \"burden of fear\" for black voters. In the lawsuit, they also say it has the potential to spark backlash in their communities \"if the Republican Party were to release the names of black voters who had publicly proclaimed that they 'are Republicans.' \" But Rick Hasen, a professor specializing in election law at the University of California Irvine, is skeptical the lawsuit has any substantial legal muscle. \"I don't that think having people sign the loyalty oath is any kind of legally binding requirement,\" said Hasen. He also points out that a lot of states have closed primaries, where only registered members of the party can vote, and that system is entirely constitutional. Hasen says the real issue here seems political. \"It does sound like a kind of make way to try to use the Voting Rights Act as a tool to try to actually achieve a different goal,\" Hasen said, \"which is to allow those people who don't want to express loyalty to the Republican Party, but want to express loyalty to Donald Trump, to be able to vote in the election.\" In a series of tweets in late December, Trump blasted the loyalty pledge, calling it a \"suicidal mistake\" and saying the party needs to stop excluding new voters if it wants to win. It begins, Republican Party of Virginia, controlled by the RNC, is working hard to disallow independent, unaffiliated and new voters. BAD! R.P.Virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row. Will now not allow desperately needed new voters. Suicidal mistake. RNC MUST ACT NOW! The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory. The Dems LOVE IT! Be smart and win for a change! Straighten out The Republican Party of Virginia before it is too late. Stupid! RNC The Virginia GOP declined to comment. But in an email to party officials obtained by NPR, Virginia GOP executive director John Findlay dismissed the idea that the pledge, which he described as a \"statement of affiliation\" was an attack on Trump. \"Let me be very clear, the statement of affiliation is not designed to favor or hurt any candidate whatsoever,\" Findlay wrote. The party put out a statement citing a similar pledge in the 2000 Republican primary. But Dan Tokaji, a professor at Ohio State University who focuses on election law, believes the politics in this skirmish are clear. \"I don't think there's much doubt that at least a part of the reason behind the Republican Party of Virginia's decision is a desire to make it more difficult for Trump supporters to vote in the Republican primary,\" said Tokaji. But, Tokaji adds that doesn't mean the rule itself is illegal or unconstitutional. In fact, like Hasen, he thinks the lawsuit is weak. Still, he says it's a sign \u2014 a warning of the growing battle between Trump and the GOP establishment. \"We can expect more of these disputes between Trump supporters and the Republican Party establishment to be emerging,\" Tokaji said. \"I would not at all be surprised in other states to find other cases brought. Some of those claims may be stronger than the ones in the Virginia case appear to be.\"",

            "article_content": "The GOP presidential front-runner scheduled rallies in Phoenix and Tucson on Saturday ahead of Tuesday's primary in Arizona.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Let's talk presidential politics now. The campaign shifted to Arizona this weekend in preparation for Tuesday's primaries there. Today, Donald Trump held a big rally in Fountain Hills. That's an upscale suburb of Phoenix. NPR's Nathan Rott was there, and he's with us now. Hi Nate. NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: Hey, how you doing? MARTIN: Good. So there were a lot of protests planned around this event today. What happened? ROTT: Well, it was actually a little calmer and quieter than people had expected. There were a lot of nerves going into the rally because Trump is a very controversial figure here given his strong stance on immigration. You can definitely see that in terms of the police presence. People were commenting that they'd never seen so many sheriff's department folks in one place before. In terms of what actually happened though, a group of protesters led by a Latino and immigrant's rights group called Puente blocked a major thoroughfare up to the event in the hour leading up to it. That stopped quite a few people who were trying to get there to see the rally and support Trump. At the actual event, there were smaller pockets of protesters, at least one of which I saw got escorted out. By and large, people were pretty civil, and any arguments that started to get heated were broken up by people in the crowd themselves. MARTIN: Speaking of a heated issue, immigration has been a very heated and polarizing issue across the country, certainly in Arizona. Trump has taken a hardline stance. Did he talk about that there in the state? ROTT: Oh yeah. I mean, that was his main talking point and certainly the biggest cheer-getter from the crowd. Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio was who introduced Trump to the event. And for folks that don't know, Arpaio is a bit of a figurehead in the anti-immigration world and a really controversial one at that. He's been accused of racial profiling and discrimination. That said, his endorsement is worth its weight in gold in Arizona politics. And he's firmly backing Trump because of the strong stance that we mentioned. Trump has said that he'd like to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico and have Mexico pay for it. He must have mentioned that at least a half dozen times during today's event. And every time he did, it drew huge, huge cheers from the crowd, which was mostly older, mostly white, though there were some younger people that were mixed in as well. I talked to a lot of those people, and they said that they do support Trump simply because of that hardline stance on immigration and because it's so important here. MARTIN: Just a couple of minutes here left, what are the other candidates doing this weekend? ROTT: Well, Trump's biggest rival here in Arizona, Ted Cruz, visited - and really his biggest rival in the election overall at this point - he visited the Mexican border yesterday and held am event at a small Christian college in Phoenix afterwards. It was a much smaller venue and a much smaller crowd than Trump had today. But he also focused on immigration at the event. He used less-strong words. But he did throw some jabs at Trump and said that he is the person that is best served as far as fixing immigration in this country and that Trump's strong rhetoric and all of that is just that. There's no actual meat behind that. Ohio Gov. John Kasich is in Utah today campaigning in preparation for the primary there. On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders visited the border today and met with some immigrants down there. He's holding an event in downtown Phoenix tonight and is expecting a pretty big turnout there. Hillary Clinton is waiting until Monday for her big event at a high school in Phoenix. And I think it's worth mentioning again that the primary here in Arizona is hugely important in both races. In Sanders' case, he needs to win in Arizona to have any chance of getting the nomination. And for Cruz... MARTIN: OK. ROTT: ...He needs to show that he can get backing from mainstream Republicans... MARTIN: OK. ROTT: ...And be an actual threat to the surging Trump. MARTIN: All right, Nathan, thanks. That's NPR's Nathan Rott in Phoenix. And I do want to add that on the program tomorrow, we're going to talk specifically about the challenge that media groups are facing covering Donald Trump specifically. We'll talk with editors from Politico, Huffington Post and NPR, and we hope you will tune in on Sunday. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

In 2008, NPR gathered more than a dozen voters in a York, Pa., hotel. They had dinner and got to know one another, and over the course of several meetings that fall they spent hours sharing their views on an often uncomfortable subject: race. The York Project culminated when the voters gathered after Barack Obama's victory. Obama supporters were exultant. Some who voted for Republican John McCain had mixed feelings. They were excited about the historic moment but disappointed in the result. Now, after a very different election, Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep traveled back to York to follow up with four of those people. Their lives and their city have changed. Some of their viewpoints have changed, too. Yet this time, those whose candidate lost in 2008 were now on the winning side. Pennsylvania mattered in this election. The swing state helped decide the result. And York County went decisively for President-elect Donald Trump. When we gathered four of the '08 participants in York's Colonial Courthouse, they shared a range of ideas about what led to Trump's victory \u2014 and what kind of future his presidency might hold.

Weary, a registered Republican, crossed party lines in 2008 to vote for Obama. At the same time, he asserted in 2008 that any black advance causes some white people to feel like something is torn away from them. He says he sees Trump supporters who try to distance themselves from the white supremacists who also backed him. Even if other Trump voters don't consider themselves racist, he says, they are in essence enabling racism. \"I think that they definitely are saying that it's not that big a deal to them,\" he says. Weary suffered a heart attack just before the 2016 election, an event he now sees as a metaphor. \"You could kind of look at what just happened to us, was kind of like a heart attack,\" he says. \"Now we're at a point of, I mean, do we have another one? Or do we start therapy?\" 2008: 2016: Sarah Yacoviello in 2008 (left) and 2016.\n                \n                    \n                    (Left) David Deal for NPR; Ariel Zambelich/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sarah Yacoviello, 39 2008: Former teacher; voted for McCain 2016: Works in development for a nonprofit; voted for Trump Hear her 2016 profile. Yacoviello was a reluctant McCain supporter, and says she again had serious reservations this time around \u2014 so much so that, until now, only her family knew she supported Trump. That Trump is not your typical politician is refreshing, she says \u2014 but she sighs when asked if he's a role model, and says no. Instead, her support for Trump ultimately came down to his promises to cut taxes and reduce regulations on business owners. As someone who works in fundraising for charities, Yacoviello sees how policies helping affluent businesses end up affecting everyone else. \"The working class needs [philanthropists], and our country needs them,\" she says. Yacoviello says that, although she thought in 2008 that McCain better reflected her conservative values, she has grown to like Obama. \"He's a good man, he was a good husband, he was a good father, a good statesman, a good spokesman for our country,\" she says. \"It's hard as a conservative to say these things, but I really do have a great deal of respect for him.\" 2008: 2016: Margie Orr in 2008 (left) and 2016.\n                \n                    \n                    (Left) David Deal for NPR; Ariel Zambelich/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Margie Orr, 71 2008: Receptionist; voted for Barack Obama 2016: York City School Board president; voted for Hillary Clinton Hear her 2016 profile.

Eight years later, she thinks she was right. \"He's had a rough time of it, with the other party coming into office,\" she says. \"He's tried his best with him being who he is. I think he's been an excellent president \u2014 a very good, excellent role model.\" And she's sure he was opposed because of the color of his skin \u2014 even though his mom was white. \"The country wasn't prepared to have a black president,\" Orr says. \"It's mind-boggling to me, because he's half of everybody \u2014 but any percentage of blackness that you have within yourself, you face racial conditions.\" Even though he had a white mother and was raised by her parents, she says, \"he's still black, and there lies the problem.\" 2008: 2016: Don Gettys in 2008 (left) and 2016.\n                \n                    \n                    (Left) David Deal for NPR; Ariel Zambelich/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Don Gettys in 2008 (left) and 2016.

            "article_content": "Critics are taking aim at the coalition of Americans pushing \"to rethink essentially everything about the way we treat each other.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Brooks Kraft/Corbis via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Critics are taking aim at the coalition of Americans pushing \"to rethink essentially everything about the way we treat each other.\" In a recent essay in the New York Times, Columbia professor and historian Mark Lilla issued a warning to liberals left stunned by President-elect Donald Trump's victory: Knock it off with the \"identity politics\" or be doomed to repeat this failure. \"American liberalism,\" he wrote, \"has slipped into a kind of moral panic about racial, gender, and sexual identity that has distorted liberalism's message and prevented it from becoming a unifying force capable of governing.\" This admonition has been welcomed, and echoed, by pundits and public figures left and right. \"Make identity politics the main operational model in a country that is two-thirds white and 50 percent or so male, and what do you expect?\" asked the National Review. Sen. Bernie Sanders warned that the Democratic Party's future rests on whether it can \"go beyond identity politics\" and says he is \"deeply humiliated\" by the party's failure to attract more people with his white, working-class background. No one seems to have a satisfying definition of what \"identity politics\" means, exactly, but the message is clear: Liberals have been paying too much attention to race and gender and sexual orientation \u2014 or not enough attention to the right variants of those \u2014 and sensible Americans are rightly saying \"no thanks.\" The critique is aimed at the astonishingly broad, often fractious, ever-shifting coalition of voices that has been pushing Americans to rethink essentially everything about the way we treat each other. That coalition has been at it in full force for the past few years, on every available platform, from street protests and campus walkouts to tweetstorms and first-person essays; from investigative reports to Hollywood boycotts to a new crop of identity-focused podcasts helmed by prominent writers and thinkers of color. What Lilla and others keen on pulling the plug on conversations about multiculturalism and diversity don't realize is that by doing so, they play right into the hands of the newly emboldened neo-Nazis who helped put Trump in office and are now delighting over several of his post-election staff and Cabinet picks. Shutting down these conversations \u2014 or redirecting them to the concerns of white, straight, mostly male Americans \u2014 is precisely what those groups want badly to see happen. Richard Spencer, the head of the white supremacist National Policy Institute, made it clear in a recent speech at the Ronald Reagan building in Washington, D.C., that the so-called alt-right won't be satisfied by a ban on Muslims or the deportation of millions of immigrants in the U.S. illegally. They want to go back to a time when no one questioned why all the Academy Award winners were white or wondered whether the black man shot by the police officer deserved it; back to a time when even if someone questioned those things, who would listen? Listen to Spencer boasting to a crowd of about 200 people, most of them white men, some of whom responded with Nazi salutes: \"Within the very blood in our veins as children of the sun lies the potential for greatness. That is the great struggle we are called to. We are not meant to live in shame and weakness and disgrace. We were not meant to beg for moral validation from some of the most despicable creatures to ever populate the planet. We were meant to overcome. Overcome all of it.\" Neo-Nazis and white supremacists like the ones brazenly applauding that night (\"Hail Trump! Hail our people!\") long to once again feel safe parading their supposed superiority around without anyone talking back loudly enough to matter. Others worry about being bumped from the head of the line, where, to their ears, terms like \"inclusion\" and \"anti-racism\" are code for \"white genocide.\" They all see the emerging Trump administration as a potential partner in creating the country they want to live in, one that preserves their version of white culture. \"I think we can be the ones out in front, thinking about those things [Trump] hasn't quite grasped yet\" and pushing for new policies \"that have a realistic chance of being implemented,\" NPI's Spencer told the New York Times. Others point out that with the right guy in charge, you don't need to change the laws to change society. \"A change in tone would be as dramatic as a change in policy because a president and his cabinet have tremendous influence that goes well beyond policy,\" Jared Taylor, an editor of the self-described \"race realism\" website American Renaissance, wrote last year. For instance, when it comes to immigration, \"white, high-IQ, English-speaking people obviously assimilate best, and someone in a Trump administration might actually say so,\" Taylor wrote. \"A Trump presidency could completely change ... what it means to be an American.\" [R]ewriting our ideas of what it means to be an American has been the point of all this 'identity' politicking all along. Indeed, rewriting our ideas of what it means to be an American has been the point of all this \"identity\" politicking all along, and there are signs it's working, albeit slowly, unevenly and imperfectly. For one thing, white supremacists are clearly paying attention. I also take heart in the way words like \"institutional racism\" and \"implicit bias\" have become commonplace everywhere from the campaign trail to the Wall Street Journal. Comedians like Hari Kondabalu and Baratunde Thurston and writers like Lindy West and Roxane Gay have made their names by talking about race, gender and identity. Major media outlets like NPR, the Associated Press and the New York Times have created newsroom verticals dedicated to the identity beat. The heads of major companies from Marriott to MasterCard have committed to making their staffs and products look more like America. Vanity Fair called 2016 \"the year Disney started to take diversity seriously,\" and several of the most anticipated sci-fi and superhero films \u2014 typically blindingly white genres \u2014 feature people of color in the lead roles. This progress \u2014 this painfully imperfect and unfinished collection of scraps we shine up and call progress \u2014 is what a portion of Trump's base wants to undo. Whether or not Lilla and company realize it, they're helping that cause by telling the rest of us to knock off our \"fixation\" with \"identity politics,\" as though our laser focus has been a fad, not a survival tactic. That's why it's never been more important to continue talking \u2014 and arguing, and complaining, and venting \u2014 about identity in America. To continue interrogating whiteness as a construct, even as we discuss the economic woes of many white Americans. To continue asking why so many of our superheroes are white and male, even as we push to better understand the defeat and humiliation felt by many flesh-and-blood white men in our country. To continue surfacing the science that proves this stuff matters: that the faces we see (or don't see) on TV can change our brains; that housing segregation makes some of us scared of each other; that being seen as \"other\" can hurt your grades, your income, your friendships, even the way you feel about yourself. We must continue insisting that \"identity politics\" are simply politics; that a truly civil society requires empathy from all, not self-abnegation of the few; that while it's easy to write off as frivolous and indulgent that which doesn't affect you, doing so doesn't make you a good citizen. Because a logical next step in that direction is writing off entire groups of people whose concerns seem silly to you, or don't make sense to you, or offend you. The neo-Nazis and white supremacists among us are already hard at work trying to make that happen. Let's not make their jobs any easier.

The dust is starting to settle in Washington and around the country after an election that stunned political watchers and pollsters. Here are seven things we've learned about Donald Trump's path to victory Tuesday night: As vote continues to be counted, Hillary Clinton has now surpassed Al Gore's 2000 popular vote margin. Clinton's popular-vote lead is 668,171 over President-elect Donald Trump, according to the latest totals compiled by the U.S. Election Atlas. Gore got 547,398 more votes than George W. Bush in 2000. Clinton's lead will only likely grow as votes continue to be finalized. Democrats have now won the popular vote in six of the last seven presidential elections, but lost the Electoral College in two of them. This takes place as Democrats continue to migrate to cities and the coasts and where their population is now more concentrated. The constitution mandates the Electoral College picks presidents. The founders created that system in part to avoid the largest states picking \"favorite sons\" and having outsize influence. Turnout may even surpass 2012 when all the vote is counted. These figures represent only about half of all eligible voters in the U.S. But, as explained below, Clinton earned a lower share than Obama and more voters chose third-party candidates. The number of people electing not to vote for the Republican or Democratic nominee went up by 4.5 million votes, nearly tripling from 2012. Votes for third party or candidates outside the major parties in 2012 vs. 2016.\n                \n                    \n                    Domenico Montanaro/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption It's difficult to say precisely which of the two major-party candidates these voters would have leaned towards. Libertarian Gary Johnson got more than 4 million votes (or 3 percent), up from 1.3 million in 2012. Green Party candidate Jill Stein got 1.3 million votes in this election, only about 1 percent overall. But more young voters went third party this year: 18-29 YEAR OLDS WHO CHOSE THIRD PARTY/OTHER2012: 3 percent2016: 8 percent Clinton got nearly 5 million fewer votes overall than Obama: Trump, meanwhile, got roughly the same number of voters as Mitt Romney four years ago: 18-29-YEAR-OLDSYoung voters were the same share of the electorate (19 percent), but went in smaller margins for Clinton than Obama and they jumped in third-party support from 3 percent to 8 percent: 2012: 60-37 Obama, 3 percent third party2016: 55-37 Clinton, 8 percent third party LATINOSBy their sheer size, Latinos went up as a share of the electorate from 10 percent to 11 percent, but the idea that they would turn out for Clinton in bigger numbers than for Obama because of Trump turned out just not be true overall \u2014 and a significant share, especially among Latinos, went third-party: 2012: 71-27 Obama2016: 65-29 Clinton; 6 percent third party Latinos certainly had an impact in the Southwest, helping Clinton win Nevada and Colorado and even made Arizona and Texas closer than past years. Texas was within 10 points for the first time in 20 years, and Latinos were a quarter of the electorate (24 percent). It might be becoming clear that about 3 in 10 Latinos are simply part of the conservative base. BLACK VOTERSBlack voters were down as a share of the electorate slightly and went for Clinton in a smaller margin \u2014 more like 2004 numbers for John Kerry: 2012: 13% of electorate, 93-6 Obama2016: 12% of electorate, 88-8 Clinton In places like Wayne County, Mich., home to Detroit, and Milwaukee, Wis., Clinton was significantly off from Obama's vote total in 2012. In fact, had she met Obama's vote total, it would have made been more than enough to make up the statewide differences in both states: WISCONSIN STATEWIDE MARGIN: Trump +24,000 votesMILWAUKEE Obama total votes 2012: 332,000Clinton total votes 2016: 289,000 (-43,000) MICHIGAN STATEWIDE MARGIN: Trump +13,000 votesWAYNE COUNTYObama total votes 2012: 595,000Clinton total votes 2016: 517,000 (-78,000) A similar pattern wouldn't have helped Clinton win Pennsylvania. She turned out about 25,000 fewer voters in Philadelphia than Obama, but that discrepancy would not have made up for the crumbling in rural areas and even some counties Obama won. Luzerne (Wilkes-Barre), for example, shifted huge to Trump \u2014 by 25 points. Erie shifted 18 points. In North Carolina, despite Clinton doing better in the Research Triangle area than Obama, black voters, who traditionally turn out at high rates in North Carolina, dropped significantly: BLACK VOTERS IN NORTH CAROLINA2012: 23% of electorate, 96-4 for Obama2016: 20% of electorate, 90-8 for Clinton Could they have made up the difference? Quite possibly. Trump won the state by 177,000 votes out of about 4.7 million votes. If black voters were the same share of the electorate as 2012, and Clinton won 90 percent, she would have picked up some 126,000 votes. Now, if they voted in the 96-percent, same margin as they did for Obama and turned out at the same share of the electorate, Clinton would have picked up 191,000 votes. Now almost no one expected, including the Clinton campaign, to get the same margins and share of the electorate with black voters as Obama, so these calculations probably aren't fair. What's more, Trump increased turnout among Republicans, so the black share would have to drop even if the same raw number turned out as 2016. Sure, mathematically, no slippage with black voters, no third-party bleed among young voters in particular and juicing the Latino vote would have meant Clinton could have won despite a white, working-class cratering (more on that below). But that's not realistic, considering the election didn't take place in a vacuum. The declines are interrelated. POST GRADUATESPost-graduates went by a slightly wider margin for Clinton than Obama: 2012: 18% of electorate, 55-42 Obama2016: 18% of electorate, 58-37 Clinton This furthers the distinct education gap in this election, especially among whites. They were a group Democrats used to compete with. In 1992 and 1996, Bill Clinton won them by a point. But they have fled to the GOP in the years since \u2013- and now the gap between whites with college degrees and without appears to be the widest ever. A whopping 35 points. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben charted it here. WHITES WITHOUT A DEGREE2016: R+392012: R+262008: R+182004: R+232000: R+171996: D+11992: D+1 Ohio and Iowa went by huge margins for Trump \u2013- almost 10 points in Iowa and 9 in Ohio. Trump won Wisconsin and Pennsylvania (by less than a point), leads in Michigan (by an even smaller margin), and lost by less than 2 points in Minnesota. Those last three states went for Democrats in six straight presidential elections. They were crucial to the Democratic Blue Wall, and Trump took a sledgehammer to it. We heard the voices of Obama-Trump white, working class voters in our stories online and on the air, but they never registered in big enough numbers \u2014 in public or private, non-partisan, Republican or Democratic polling before the election to show that a Trump win was apparent. Take a look at the vote shifts among the white, working class in some key states: THOSE WITHOUT A COLLEGE DEGREE IN INDUSTRIAL NORTH MINNESOTA2012: 53% of electorate, 52-46 Obama2016: 44% of electorate, 55-38 Trump (net gain: R+23) WISCONSIN2012: 58% of electorate, 51-47 Obama2016: 55% of electorate, 56-40 Trump (net gain: R+20) IOWA2012: 57% of electorate, 52-46 Obama2016: 57% of electorate, 54-40 Trump (net gain: R+20) MICHIGAN2012: 54% of electorate, 56-43 Obama2016: 58% of electorate, 49-45 Trump (net gain: R+17) OHIO2012: 60% of electorate, 53-46 Obama2016: 56% of electorate, 51-45 Trump (net gain: R+13) PENNSYLVANIA2012: 52% of electorate, 57-42 Obama2016: 52% of electorate, 52-45 Trump (net gain: R+12) Overall, the reason Trump won was because he flipped big margins with white, working class voters in the Midwest and Pennsylvania \u2014 something that was always a possibility. Trump spoke to these voters \u2014 whether it was on policy with how he blew up the Republican message on trade and Clinton's ties to the establishment and pro-globalist agenda; or his fueling white resentments and racial bias; and there was likely some degree of sexism that played a role. That's something that's difficult to measure, though there will likely be dissertations written about it. But Clinton made her mistakes with this group \u2014 calling half of Trump supporters \"deplorables\" likely fired up these exact kinds of voters, for example. The late-in-the-campaign letter from FBI Director James Comey about Clinton's emails likely also played a role, reinforcing a narrative about her as untrustworthy especially with voters who were prone to believe the worst about her. In the end, though, Clinton allowed the caricature created of her to become cemented. It's actually surprising considering how she campaigned for her 2000 Senate seat. Back then, she took on the caricatures of her as a carpetbagger who didn't deserve it by meeting and talking with voters in upstate New York. Some questioned that strategy given New York City and the suburbs have such big populations and generally determine the outcome of statewide races. (Sound familiar?) Clinton, though, worked hard and won many of them over \u2014 and easily won the Senate seat. She never did that this time. It was something she promised she would do at the outset of this campaign, but it was never attempted during the general election when she was against Trump. Instead, she was largely absent from the campaign trail for most of August, staying out of the news, as Trump was steeped in controversy. That turned out to be a mistake. She never created an affirmative message about her candidacy. \"Stronger Together\" was reactive to Trump. And she took for granted what used to be a critical piece of the Democratic coalition. It's ironic that instead of courting these voters to solidify the Blue Wall, she spent a lot of time courting Republicans. But the Republicans who would be open to her message would be metropolitan globalists, and it's the very type of message that appeals to them that would turn off populist, blue-collar Democrats. A rural Pennsylvania, Michigan or Wisconsin tour might not have reversed this 36-year trend away from Democrats, but given how extraordinarily close all three states turned out to be, Clinton likely would have reduced the margins enough to win. Of course, that's not what happened.",

When American voters must choose a new president, reaction tends to rule. Given a choice between continuity and contrast, we favor contrast \u2014 even when the retiring incumbent leaves office with relatively high public approval. This sometimes is called the pendulum effect: The farther the pendulum swings in one direction, the farther it is likely to swing back. In physics, every action has an equal and opposite reaction; in politics, the pushback sometimes can be disproportionate. The rule has obvious applications to candidate personalities and political parties, but it also relates to the long waves of history, and the most profound changes in our national life. Thus we have Barack Obama, elected in 2008 largely because he offered such a dramatic divergence from two terms of George W. Bush \u2014 who himself had been a stark contrast to Bill Clinton. This is more than just a habit \u2014 it is closer to being our nature. The country chooses more than a person or a party to occupy the Oval Office, it chooses a vision of itself, whether it actively contemplates its decision in those terms or not. And then, we find ourselves wanting something different \u2014 sometimes very different. Thus we have the spectacle of Obama being succeeded by Donald Trump, who had been something of a nemesis for years as he questioned the president's legitimacy and birthright citizenship. It is hard to imagine a greater gulf between two sets of policies, or two men with less use for each other. Obama himself had been a sharp departure in 2008 from George W. Bush, who had been quite a change from Bill Clinton in 2000. The party loyalties of these men were only the beginning of their contrasts in outlook, demeanor and personal background. Stepping back a bit further in memory, Clinton had been a youthful alternative to George H.W. Bush in 1992. Ronald Reagan's persona in 1980 had been worlds apart from Jimmy Carter's, and Carter's an antidote to Richard Nixon's in the 1970s. Each of these men had something that characterized his candidacy, and it stood vividly apart from what went before. Each came to office with a certain vision of a White House under new management, entirely transformed. Call it a message or a myth, but these were the means by which their campaigns sought to fashion a mandate for their presidencies. John F. Kennedy in 1960 ran against the relatively quiescent 1950s, saying: \"Let the word go forth to a new generation of leadership.\" His message was expansionary and inspirational, symbolized by the promise to put a man on the moon. Now we have Trump with his vow to \"make America great again.\" This seems to mean bringing back whatever elements of the economy or the culture his various rally audiences might be missing \u2014 manufacturing jobs, coal mines, nuclear families, tighter restrictions on abortion and immigration. In an interview with The New York Times editorial board earlier this year, Trump was asked when exactly America had last been \"great.\" His answer: the late 1950s. JFK was scarcely the first elected Democrat to be associated with progressive visions; that legacy dates back to Woodrow Wilson's administration, through Franklin Roosevelt's \"New Deal\" in the 1930s, Harry Truman's \"Fair Deal\" in the 1940s and on to Lyndon Johnson's \"Great Society\" in the mid-1960s. They represented a more activist federal government, a shift in economic and political power from capital to labor, a gradual acceptance of racial diversity and a commitment to civil rights. Republicans' promises have been more restorative in nature: Warren Harding's \"Return to Normalcy\" in the 1920s, through Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover, to Dwight Eisenhower's peacetime equilibrium in the 1950s. Nixon and Reagan invoked nostalgia for the Ike years \u2014 the latter with a frank appeal to the old-fashioned values of \"work, family, neighborhood.\" (Reagan even had bumper stickers that said: \"Let's make America great again!\") Restorative periods followed as reactions to eras of significant social change \u2013 especially regarding race and gender. In the South, the Civil War and Reconstruction period, with the abolition of slavery and the attempt to mainstream former slaves, produced a backlash among the Southern Democrats who dominated local and state offices. Their restrictive \"Jim Crow\" laws and segregation kept the descendants of slaves from achieving much beyond emancipation. Up north, immigrants crowding into urban centers and showing up on voter rolls gave rise to nativist sentiment and the Know-Nothing Party, which resisted the new arrivals. In the 20th century, civil rights marches and boycotts led to landmark legislation in the Johnson years, including voting rights \u2014 but what followed was Nixon's \"Southern Strategy\" for winning the White House in 1968. Combined with widespread resistance to other changes \u2014 including \"women's liberation,\" legal abortion and bans on school prayer \u2014 this conservative game plan helped the GOP win five of the next six presidential elections. That skein was broken by Clinton's win in 1992, but his breakthrough for Democrats at the presidential level led directly to Republican takeover in Congress (the GOP's first control of both chambers in 40 years). The Republicans have held the House for 18 of the 22 years since, and the Senate through most of that same era. During that time, the presidential pendulum has continued to swing, from Clinton to Bush to Obama. So for the Democrats to hold the White House past 2016 would have been surprising. In a sense, Hillary Clinton seemed uniquely capable of doing it \u2014 and of becoming the first woman president. But she was vulnerable to the populist-nativist appeal of Trump, in no small part because of her longtime association with the women's movement, with power in Washington and with money on Wall Street. It didn't help to have her rhetorically toss half of Trump's supporters into one \"basket of deplorables\" or another. Trump won this week by capturing two-thirds of the white voters who do not have a college degree, and while he sacrificed some of the GOP's traditional strength among college graduates, he lost less of it than anticipated (especially among white women with degrees). His votes wound up being located in just the right places, including rural areas of the big industrial states around the Great Lakes that had boosted Bill Clinton and Obama. Trump is a disruptive figure, to be sure \u2014 he has shattered the usual categories of the Republican Party and realigned the loyalties of the working class. But in one sense, his victory reinforces something quite traditional \u2013 the rhythm of presidential cycles and the alternation of progressive and restorative attitudes in the White House.",

So what's a female leader to do when she confronts these conflicting stereotypes?\n                \n                    \n                    Gary Waters/Getty Images/Ikon Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Our culture has long expected that women will be kind, and leaders will be authoritative. So what's a female leader to do when she confronts these conflicting stereotypes? Fewer than 1 in 5 members of Congress are women. At Fortune 500 companies, fewer than 1 in 20 CEOs are women. And if you look at all the presidents of the United States through Barack Obama, what are the odds of having 44 presidents who are all men? If men and women had an equal shot at the White House, the odds of this happening just by chance are about 1 in 18 trillion. What explains the dearth of women in top leadership positions? Is it bias, a lack of role models, the old boy's club? Sure. But it goes even deeper. Research suggests American women are trapped in a paradox that is deeply embedded in our culture. \"It is really the very, very fine line of being a shrew on one hand and a puppet on the other that any woman in public life has to walk,\" says former U.S. Sen. Carol Moseley Braun, a Democrat from Illinois. When Moseley Braun was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1992, she achieved a powerful first. She was the first female African-American senator. And in her race for office, she assumed that racism would be a more daunting obstacle than gender bias. But she says, that wasn't the case. \"I think in some regards the gender biases are more profound and more central to our culture than even the racial ones, and that to me was the surprise.\" One moment in particular still stays with her, more than 20 years later. \"There was a cartoon from one of the newspapers in the state that showed me as a puppet, with my campaign manager's hand up my dress,\" she says. \"And the idea that I was a puppet of this guy that who was managing my campaign was shocking to me.\" But shortly after Braun won her race, she says she confronted a second trap. One day, she made an impassioned plea on the floor of the Senate. But she says, all her colleagues could hear, was a shrill black woman. Her experience is one that researchers have described as a \"double bind\" \u2014 a set of assumptions that get at our implicit assumptions about men, women and leadership. \"The female gender role is based on the stereotype that women are nice and kind and compassionate,\" says social psychologist Alice Eagly. By contrast, she says, \"in a leadership role, one is expected to take charge and sometimes at least to demonstrate toughness, make tough decisions, be very assertive in bringing an organization forward, sometimes fire people for cause, etc.\" So what's a woman to do? Be nice and kind and friendly, as our gender stereotypes about women require? Or be tough and decisive, as our stereotypes about leadership demand? To be one is to be seen as nice, but weak. To be the other is to be seen as competent, but unlikable. Connie Morella served for 16 years as a Republican congresswoman from Maryland. Like Democrat Braun, she says at times she struggled to be heard. \"In a committee room, when I wasn't chair of the committee, I would respond to a question or comment on an issue, [and] they'd say, 'Thank you, Connie, that was great.' And a little later Congressman Smith would say the same thing, and it was, 'Oh, Congressman Smith ... that was fabulous, let the record show ...' and I'd think, 'Gee, I just said that.' \" How can we tell, with scientific certainty, whether women like Morella and Carol Braun were the victims of bias? When we look at a female leader who appears incompetent or shrill, how do we know if we are seeing reality, or just seeing the world through the lens of our own unconscious biases? That's where researchers like Madeline Heilman come in. She's a psychology professor at New York University who focuses on gender stereotypes and bias, particularly when it comes to leadership. In one study, Heilman asked volunteers to evaluate a high-powered manager joining a company. Sometimes volunteers are told the manager is a man, other times they're told it's a woman. \"When the person was presented as a high powered person, who was very ambitious, we found that the person was seen as much more unlikable when it was a woman than when it was a man,\" she says. In these studies, the high-powered male and female manager are described in identical terms, down to the letter. The only difference is that one is said to be a man, and the other is said to be a woman. Heilman says that the double bind arises because our minds are trying to align our stereotypes about men and women, with our stereotypes about leadership. \"We have conceptions of these jobs and these positions and what is required to do them well, and there's a lack of fit between how we see women and what these positions require,\" she says. The biases Heilman describes aren't just held by men. They're held by both sexes, which explains why many female leaders encounter derision and suspicion from men and women. \"We have very strong feelings about how men and women are, and that leads to this dislike when they go over the line, when they tread where they are not supposed to be.\" The good news, says psychologist Eagly, is that our culture's views are always changing. And that includes our views on women, men and the meaning of leadership \u2014 whether in elected office or the workplace.

Law and order has been a major theme this year on the campaign trail. But that means very different things to the two major party presidential candidates. With just under two months to go before the November election, we're taking a closer look at where Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump stand on issues of crime and policing. Trump has made what he calls a return to law and order a centerpiece of his campaign. Trump devoted a lot of time to the issue in his address to the Republican National Convention, where he vowed: \"The crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon, and I mean very soon, come to an end. Beginning on January 20th of 2017, safety will be restored.\" Trump recently told the International Association of Chiefs of Police in a written questionnaire that he would reduce crime by enforcing federal statutes that cover illegal immigration, drug trafficking and human trafficking. While murder and violent crime are on the rise in several big cities, criminologists and justice analysts say the problem is a localized one. Historically, they say, the nation remains far from the kind of trouble that plagued major cities from the 1970s to the early 1990s \u2014 a change that Clinton has credited to years of hard work by police and community leaders. Clinton told the police chiefs group that she would focus in part on deterring repeat offenders and promoting strategies to reduce violence that bring clergy, friends and relatives of gang members together to de-escalate situations before crimes happen. She added that any plan to cut down on violence needs to consider the ready availability of illegal guns. Clinton said she wants to see a crackdown on dealers that \"flood\" cities with such weapons and she wants Congress to pass comprehensive background check legislation, an issue the public has supported in opinion polls but that lawmakers have failed to achieve. While Trump has expressed some worry about times when police killed unarmed people, he often focuses on how law enforcement feels, especially after deadly assaults on police in Baton Rouge and Dallas this year. In campaign appearances, Trump has stressed the role of police under siege. Last week, the Fraternal Order of Police, a large police union, endorsed Trump for the presidency, citing his commitment to promoting law enforcement officers and public safety. Officials at the FOP said Clinton had not requested their endorsement. Clinton talks about the issues more broadly. She says killing a law enforcement officer is a \"terrible crime\" but says national leaders can't ignore incidents where black men are disproportionately killed by police. \"We've got urgent work to do to rebuild trust between police and communities and get back to the fundamental principle: everyone should have respect for the law and be respected by the law,\" Clinton told an audience last summer about clashes between law enforcement and black people. Clinton said she views building trust between police and people of color to be a major priority for the next president. In speeches and responses to the police chiefs questionnaire, Clinton said she supports federal funding for training police on crisis intervention and de-escalation. She said she wants the federal government to pay to make sure every police department in the nation is equipped with body-worn cameras. Clinton also supports legislation that would ban racial profiling by law enforcement, and she has called on the federal government to partner with state and local authorities to develop national guidelines for when police should use force against people on the streets. During President Obama's tenure, the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department has launched dozens of investigations into racial bias and unconstitutional practices in local police agencies from Ferguson, Mo., to Baltimore, Md. Trump said he would end that practice. \"The federal government should provide assistance to state and local law enforcement, but should not dictate ... or interfere unless invited in by appropriate authorities or when verifiable improper behavior is clearly demonstrated,\" he told the IACP. Trump added that the federal government should not demand information about incidents where local police shoot people, leaving the management to state and local authorities. Clinton would adopt a far more activist approach. Clinton promised to devote $1 billion in her first federal budget as president to funding training programs to reduce implicit bias within law enforcement and research to achieve that goal.",

Tim Kaine held a town hall at the Exeter Town Hall in Exeter, N.H., on Thursday afternoon. A week after his running mate, Hillary Clinton, came under attack for describing half of Donald Trump's supporters as in the \"basket of deplorables,\" Tim Kaine said he, too, believes there are ideals \"not in accord with American values\" motivating some of the GOP nominee's backers. \"There are some who are motivated by dark emotions, that are not in accord with American values,\" the Democratic vice presidential nominee told NPR's Steve Inskeep during an interview Thursday in New Hampshire. \"When you have David Duke doing robo-calls telling people to vote for Donald Trump, which he did just a couple of weeks ago, that is highly troubling,\" Kaine continued, referring to the former Ku Klux Klan leader now running for Senate in Louisiana. \"And she was basically saying some of Donald Trump's voters are motivated by these dark emotions that really are out of step with American values.\" The Virginia senator acknowledged that many of Trump's supporters are also motivated by \"deep economic anxieties.\" \"She was not belittling those anxieties,\" Kaine said about Clinton's remarks at a Democratic fundraiser. \"She was actually telling a group of supporters of hers, there are Trump voters who have concerns that we need to speak to during the campaign, and that we especially need to speak to if we have the opportunity to govern.\" But Kaine argued that Clinton did have an obligation to call out the racist, sexist and alt-right messages some Trump supporters promote, including some comments that Trump has re-tweeted from people connected to white supremacist groups. \"I think silence in the face of divisive, bigoted comments allows it to grow. And so you can't be silent about it,\" Kaine said. \"I think you have to call out comments or behavior that are contrary to our values, and if you don't, you actually allow it to grow. And that's what she was doing.\" Kaine recalled an earlier time in Virginia when racial and social tensions were high. His father-in-law, former Virginia Republican Gov. Linwood Holton, helped desegregate the commonwealth's schools in the 1970s. Eventual change helped the state's economy grow and prosper, Kaine argued. \"So there was a lot of anxiety about it, but it was what I call a transitional anxiety. When the demographics start to change and what you have assumed to kind of be constant turns out not to be constant, there's anxieties. But you go through a transitional period and you realize, hey, wait a minute, these demographic changes aren't bad. It's not bad to have people sitting around a table together. It turns out that they're good. They helped our state. They help our country. And so I have actually a high degree of confidence that over time those anxieties tend to go away. Human beings have always been afraid of change, of all kinds. Change can be, can produce anxiety.\" Kaine said those anxieties extend to religious identity as well, and criticized Trump for his call to bar Muslims from entering the U.S. He said America's religious freedom, guaranteed by the First Amendment, argued against such a practice. \"And we're an example for the rest of the world, because so many people live in countries where that is not the case,\" said Kaine, a devout Catholic and former missionary in Honduras. \"And so is there, have there been anxieties about other religions? Sure, but we're a stronger nation because we've tolerated this great breadth of religious diversity.\" Kaine said that for him, supporting Clinton came down to a decision about character. \"I tell people character and public life is probably best measured this way: If you look at somebody who's an official and you see, you look to see, do they have a passion in their life that showed up before they were in politics? And have they been consistent in following that passion, whether they're winning or losing, in good years or bad, in or out of office? Hillary Clinton has that,\" Kaine argued. Clinton has struggled to gain voters' trust, though, and that handicap has been exacerbated by controversy surrounding her private email server while she was secretary of state. The perception that she wasn't being fully transparent was fueled last week when she did not disclose a pneumonia diagnosis she received on Friday until she fell ill at a Sept. 11 memorial service on Sunday. Kaine said he was sympathetic with her choice, recalling that he, too, caught pneumonia during his first political race in 1994, when he was seeking a seat on the Richmond City Council. He said he also tried to \"power through\" the illness and didn't disclose his diagnosis. \"Hillary had that attitude. This is, nobody who knows her doubts her work ethic. She works very, very hard. And after she had that diagnosis, she said I think I can power through this, and then she found out after about 48 hours, maybe it won't be quite so easy as I thought. And then she did let folks know what was going on.\" After a three-day absence, the Democratic nominee returned to the campaign trail on Thursday with a rally in Greensboro, N.C. She dodged questions, though, about whether Kaine was told about her diagnosis last Friday. Kaine disagreed with the suggestion that Clinton did not disclose her illness because her GOP opponent, Donald Trump, has argued she isn't healthy enough for the Oval Office. Kaine said Clinton, like many working women, chose to keep going no matter what. \"This is a person who has a lot that she wants to get done. And she just decided, look, I think I can power through this. And, you know, what you find is you can't do it at a hundred percent. You have to scale back a little bit.\" Kaine also argued that Trump has been far less forthcoming on almost every issue, refusing to release his tax returns and provide information about his business dealings in foreign countries and the extent of his charitable donations. \"The Newsweek story yesterday is very, very powerful in laying out a number of areas where it could at a minimum be a significant conflict of attention as he's watching these money-making endeavors that produce income for him and his family,\" Kaine asserted. \"But it also raises very significant questions about his connection to foreign governments and would he really put the U.S. interest first? I mean, we are talking about an individual who got up at a microphone and publicly encouraged Russia to engage in cyber-espionage and find material and give it to him so he could help win the election that way. Now later he said, oh, I was just trying to be funny, but that's just not funny.\" If he does become vice president, Kaine said, he wouldn't be afraid to disagree with Clinton \u2014 something she said she valued when choosing Kaine for the ticket \u2014 and as a former lieutenant governor and party chairman, he was also comfortable in a supporting role. \"I've had some experience not only being the top person, but I've had experience being in this role where you're trying to offer the absolute best advice you can to the person that you know is the one that's making the decisions,\" Kaine said. \"And I relish that role. And Hillary and I have talked extensively about the way that she wants me to play, and I feel very comfortable with the partnership.\"",

Dr. Ben Carson is seated next to Trump at center. Donald Trump plans to take his black voter \"outreach\" to a predominantly African-American audience with a visit to Detroit this weekend, perhaps to quell criticism that his recent speeches about African-Americans have been delivered primarily to whites. That was certainly true during his August stop in Charlotte, N.C., where he began tailoring his message to black voters, who have been roundly rejecting him at the polls. \"If African-Americans give Donald Trump a chance by giving me their vote,\" he said, \"the result will be amazing.\" The Republican presidential candidate cast Democrats and their nominee Hillary Clinton as the true bigots, who \"have taken African-American votes totally for granted.\" But Trump's inclusive Charlotte takeaway \u2014 one that seemed geared to the diverse, more progressive \"New South\" city \u2014 has been undermined by a series of clumsy and insulting overtures, and by his and his party's support for tactics that could remind many black voters of the old South. It was in Pennsylvania, another battleground state he must win, where Trump echoed a familiar and shameful theme in American history: that some citizens \u2014 and their votes \u2014 are more legitimate than others. He suggested that \"independent\" monitoring was needed at voting places in urban parts of the state \u2014 Philadelphia, for example \u2014 to prevent citizens casting multiple ballots and other vaguely fishy goings-on. There is still a call on his \"Make America Great Again!\" website, asking for volunteers to sign up as a \"Trump Election Observer\" to \"Help Me Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!\" This all brings back images of Jim Crow-style poll-watching, of African-Americans and other voters of color having to somehow prove themselves worthy of participation in U.S. democracy, with every kind of proof never being enough. It was a call for intimidation masquerading as oversight, though it may take more than any challenge to discourage dedicated citizens such as Rosanell Eaton. She was a named plaintiff and witness in one of the challenges to the strict North Carolina voting law that was effectively killed \u2014 at least for this election cycle \u2014 by the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this week. Her case illustrates the historical racist obstacles to voting, the spirit needed to overcome and the frustration that comes with fighting the same battles again and again. Born in 1921 in North Carolina, Eaton became one of the first African-Americans to register to vote in her county in 1942. First, she had to pass a written literacy test and recite the preamble to the Constitution from memory. Eaton went on to work for civil rights, registering more than 4,000 citizens to vote. But even her voting rights were imperiled by the 2013 North Carolina voting law, because it limited forms of acceptable ID. The name on Eaton's birth certificate did not match the name on her driver's license or the one on her voter registration card. To assure her voting rights, she had to spend more than 20 hours and travel more than 200 miles to assemble all the required documents from various banks and government offices. In addition, that law would've cut a week of early voting, ended preregistration for 16- and 17-year-olds, eliminated same-day registration, declared that votes cast out of precinct would not be counted and increased the power of anyone to challenge a voter's eligibility. When a federal appeals court struck down the law in July, it declared, \"The new provisions target African Americans with almost surgical precision\" and \"impose cures for problems that did not exist.\" The problem for Trump is that the state's Republican Governor Pat McCrory vigorously backed the law; it was McCrory's decision to appeal a lower court's ruling that brought the issue to the Supreme Court in the first place. And state GOP leaders haven't given up. In the latest development, the hours of early voting \u2014 set by GOP-controlled boards and particularly popular among African-Americans in the state, 22 percent of registered voters \u2014 have become another partisan battle. This is a nationwide fight. Courts are turning an increasingly skeptical eye on regulations like North Carolina's that restrict voting, ruling against all or parts of laws in other states such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Kansas and Texas. But as The New York Times pointed out, voting policy is enforced in cities and counties, in local races for mayor, city council and school boards, on a level that affects citizens' everyday lives. Voting rolls are being purged, polling places closed and districts shifted in ways that disadvantage minority voters. Kristen Clarke is president and executive director of the nonpartisan, nonprofit Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, where a major focus is on voting rights. She said that the fight for voting justice is a challenge for the new administration, no matter which candidate leads it, which must work \"to defend the right to vote for all Americans, but most especially for African Americans and other minority groups who continue to deal with the legacy of discrimination.\" In a demographically and economically diverse nation, voting is one right that places all Americans on equal footing. There should be a desire to remove all obstacles to eligible citizens who want to do their civic duty. If Trump really wants to \"Make America Great Again\" for black voters, he needs to join that battle ... on the right side. Mary C.

In the past week, the presidential campaign has alighted upon a volatile subject: the issue of race. Specifically, how Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have been cultivating their relationships with voters of different racial groups. On Thursday, for instance, Clinton delivered a blunt speech in Reno, Nev., criticizing the Republican nominee's track record with minorities and calling attention to the support he has received from white nationalist groups. Trump, meanwhile, called Clinton a \"bigot\" at a Mississippi rally, saying she and her fellow Democrats have taken the support of minority voters for granted. He also invited a group of black and Latino supporters to consult with him on Thursday \u2014 including retired neurosurgeon and former GOP presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson. \"He wants to find out from a lot of different sources what people perceive the problems to be and what they perceive the solutions to be,\" Carson tells NPR's Michel Martin. \"And he also wants to hear about things that have effectively moved people out of the position of dependency and put them on a ladder to success.\" Carson characterizes the meeting as a means of discussing solutions to the problems that affect inner-city communities \u2014 because \"you cannot be great if you have large pockets of people who are failing,\" he says. Still, it's not apparent that Trump's message is resonating among minority voters. In recent polling, he remains mired in single digits with African-Americans, and his support among Hispanics has been hovering around 20 percent \u2014 give or take a few points depending on the specific poll. And, for the most part, Trump continues to convey his outreach efforts not to black and Hispanic groups, but to audiences that are predominantly white. He has not spoken to groups like the National Association of Black Journalists, the NAACP or the National Urban League. Carson does not see this as a deficiency; rather, he says, this is further evidence of Trump's unconventional campaign strategy. \"There hasn't been anything traditional about Donald Trump's campaign,\" he says, \"and I don't think it's going to start being traditional now either.\" As for Trump's place in the polls, Carson makes the case that his low numbers are less a function of Trump's campaign than an effect of recent GOP political strategy. \"Recognize that in recent decades the Republican party has largely given the black vote up to Democrats, in the sense that there was no point in even pursuing it. Well, [Donald Trump] has a different philosophy,\" Carson says. He adds: \"I think a lot of people in the black community are going to say, 'Wait a minute, you mean they're going to pay some attention to us? Let's listen to what they have to say.' \" Carson says that among African-Americans, rates of incarceration and out-of-wedlock births are high, while \"the African-Americans who are on food stamps has gone up substantially in the past seven to eight years\" \u2014 though, as NPR's Michel Martin notes, there are more white people currently on food stamps than black people. \"This is something that we should all be concerned about,\" he says. \"This is not a partisan issue, as far as I'm concerned.\" This outreach effort, however, may not be aimed at minority voters, as NPR political editor Domenico Montanaro explains. He points to Trump's flagging support among whites with college degrees, a group that former GOP nominee Mitt Romney won handily in 2012. This time around, this subset of voters appears to be swinging toward Hillary Clinton \u2014 with college-educated white women supporting Clinton by a margin of 20 points. \"To be frank and succinct about this,\" Montanaro tells Martin, \"the fact is, whites with college degrees don't want to feel like they are voting for somebody who's seen as a bigot or a racist.\" Trump's campaign has embarked on a bid to change that perception. And for Carson, that bid is key to changing the conversation around the campaign. \"The problem, of course, is that a lot of people listen to the propaganda about his views of other people. And they say, you know, 'He hates all Muslims and he wants to discriminate against them, he hates the Hispanics and he wants to discriminate against' \u2014 of course that's not true,\" Carson says. \"But as you well know, it's a political tactic to demonize your opponents, particularly if you don't have good policies to talk about.\"",

Libertarian Party candidates Gary Johnson and Bill Weld pitched themselves as the antidote to Washington partisanship in a CNN town hall, hoping to appeal to voters frustrated with both the Republican and the Democratic presidential nominees. Both are former Republican governors \u2014 Johnson from New Mexico and Weld from Massachusetts \u2014 and told CNN's Anderson Cooper they align with most voters on both fiscal and social issues. \"We want the government out of your pocketbook and out of your bedroom, and the polling shows that a majority of Americans think that,\" said Weld, the party's vice presidential nominee. Johnson, who ran for the GOP nomination in 2012 before becoming the Libertarian nominee four years ago, said if they are elected, the two longtime lawmakers will almost act as co-presidents \u2014 sharing a staff and \"planning to do this as a partnership.\" \"Two heads for the price of one, and that it would be a plus for the country, believing that,\" the former New Mexico governor said. \"I think it would be refreshing to have a party that was not terribly partisan holding the White House, and we would hire the best people from the Democratic Party, the smartest people from the Republican Party and the best people from the Libertarian Party,\" Weld added. The two bemoaned the rules that, as of now, would keep them off the presidential debate stage come this fall. A third-party candidate must hit at least 15 percent in polling, and the Libertarian ticket is at 9 percent in the latest CNN/ORC poll. The Green Party's Jill Stein is at 5 percent in that same survey. A third-party candidate hasn't made it onto the stage since independent Ross Perot in 1992, but with both Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton still struggling to unite their parties' bases while being dragged down by high disapproval ratings, there is a rare opening. And Johnson and Weld are aiming to fill that void. \"The idea that we should not be at those debates expressing what is a majority point of view in the country can only be laid at the door of the two-party monopoly, the duopoly, that has a stranglehold on power in Washington,\" Weld said. \"That's the Rs and the Ds, who sometimes seem to exist mainly for the express purpose of killing each other.\" Johnson stood by his characterization that Clinton was \"beholden\" to special interests and slammed her high fees for speaking to Wall Street groups. He argued there is a conflict of interest between the former secretary of state and her family's Clinton Foundation that \"smacks of pay-to-play.\" But Weld had harsher words for Trump and the way the GOP candidate has reacted to criticism from the family of a Muslim-American soldier killed in Iraq. \"He's a showman. He's a pied piper. He's the music man,\" Weld said about the billionaire real estate magnate. \"More recently, it's gotten more serious, and the noun that comes to my mind is a screw loose.\" Johnson dismissed the idea that they would play spoiler this fall, though. \"A wasted vote is voting for somebody that you don't believe in, and if we're going to continue to vote for the lesser of two evils, that's still evil,\" he told a questioner. Johnson did depart from typical libertarian orthodoxy in one instance. Previously, he has said that \"religious freedom, as a category\" was \"a black hole,\" and he said he wouldn't back any state religious freedom laws, such as ones that would protect people like wedding photographers or bakers from having to provide services for a gay wedding. \"I fear that under the guise of religious liberty, the LGBT community is being discriminated against,\" Johnson said. \"There can be a balance between the two, but I don't want to support discrimination in any form whatsoever.\" Shetamia Taylor, a woman who was wounded in the Dallas police attack last month, asked Johnson about the Black Lives Matter movement. And the Libertarian nominee gave a rare acknowledgement that, as a white man, he had been slow to realize there was a problem between minorities and law enforcement. \"My head's been in the sand on this. I think we've all had our heads in the sand, and let's wake up,\" Johnson said. \"This discrimination does exist.\" On the subject of foreign policy, Johnson said the two weren't pushing for an isolationist approach, simply one that was more hesitant to enter into foreign skirmishes. \"We both reject the notion that libertarians are isolationists,\" Johnson said. \"We're not isolationists. We're non-interventionists. We don't want to get involved in regime change that has the potential to make the world less safe.\"",

A lot of observers were quick to point out that 2016 is no 1968 and that Donald Trump is no Richard Nixon. As it happens, \"law and order\" isn't what it once was, either. \"Law and order\" is an archaic expression, from the Latin \"lex et ordo.\" Over the course of American history, it's the cry that the people in charge have raised to confront the threat of violence bubbling up from below \u2014 whether as popular insurrections, public disorders, radical agitators or gangs. It was a phrase invoked to condemn the striking auto workers in Flint in 1936 and the demonstrations organized by Martin Luther King in Birmingham in 1963. But for most Americans of the Nixon era, \"law and order\" was saturated with the mythology of the Old West. Hollywood made at least five Western films with that very title, most with the same tried-and-true plot: a lawman reluctantly takes up his badge one last time to clear out the ruffians who have been terrorizing the decent folks of Dodge or Tombstone. Ronald Reagan starred in the 1953 film of that name. Thirteen years later, he revived the role of the new sheriff in town to win the California governorship, running as a citizen-politician who could restore law and order in the wake of the Watts riots and the disorders at Berkeley. By the time Nixon and George Wallace adopted the law-and-order slogan in 1968, the phrase was everywhere in the air. The social fabric seemed to be coming apart at the seams: the assassinations of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King, the urban riots, the Weathermen and the Panthers, the street protests and campus upheavals \u2014 and a violent crime rate that had risen alarmingly over the course of the decade. By August of 1968, voters saw law and order as the most important issue facing the nation, ahead even of the Vietnam War. Nixon publicly denied that the phrase was a code for racism \u2014 the very accusation implied a \"reverse racism,\" he said, as if the critics were suggesting that \"the Negroes\" didn't want law and order, too. But the message was clear enough in Nixon's references to a \"city jungle\" that threatened to swallow the affluent suburbs. His TV ads showed a middle-aged white woman walking nervously down a city street at night, where the assailants who might be lurking in the shadows presumably weren't hippies or demonstrators. This was a new maneuver in modern American political rhetoric. Even in the South, most Americans had repudiated explicit racism. Now, crude appeals to bias had to be replaced by phrases that obliquely brought racial images to mind. People often describe these phrases as racial dog whistles, which send a signal that's only audible to one part of the audience. But their racial connections are usually pretty obvious to everyone. You don't need a Captain Midnight decoder ring to know that \"welfare queens\" or \"inner-city culture\" are references to minorities, no more than to know that \"Park Avenue\" is a reference to the rich. Those phrases are less like dog whistles than Pavlov's bells \u2014 all the dogs can all hear them but they only salivate if they've been conditioned to respond. The important thing is that they leave you room to deny the associations to yourself and to others. And they provide the opportunity for a kind of rhetorical jiu-jitsu in response, where you turn the charge of racism against your critics. Somebody taxes you with racism for a remark about bands of youths in hoodies, and you indignantly point out that Mark Zuckerberg wears a hoodie too \u2014 and they're the one with race on the brain. In the past, these racial bells have usually been abandoned when their associations become too obvious to be plausibly denied. The phrase \"states' rights\" is so tarnished by its association with segregation that nobody uses it now. If you want to object to federal control of some policy or program you have to say the issue should be \"left to the states.\" \"Law and order\" lasted as a political slogan into the 1990s \u2014 Bill Clinton invoked it to justify both tougher penalties and community programs. But by the turn of the century, the phrase was out of fashion, other than as the punning title of a popular TV series about cops and prosecutors. That owes something to the dramatic decline in violent crime since then, even if public perceptions haven't entirely caught up with it. But public attention had turned to other kinds of criminality \u2014 Enron and Madoff, cybercrime and mortgage scams. Trump's single-handed effort to revive the slogan \"law and order\" is the key to creating the perception of a new crisis of crime and violence. Geoff Nunberg Trump's single-handed effort to revive the slogan \"law and order\" is the key to creating the perception of a new crisis of crime and violence; it weaves together assaults by those he calls radical Islamic terrorists, inner-city thugs and illegals. The racial overtones of the phrase are even harder to deny now than they were in the Nixon years, when white radicals and students were part of the mix. But deniability isn't as important as it used to be; in the new rhetorical climate, these phrases are mostly designed to troll the other side for its political correctness. Still, \"law and order\" itself sounds a little creaky now. It doesn't have the mythical resonances it did 50 years ago. When Trump uses it, it makes people think of Richard Nixon; when Nixon used it, it made them think of Wyatt Earp. But they're not making those movies anymore.",

Most Americans will get their first real look at Tim Kaine when he speaks at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday night. Of all the people Hillary Clinton considered as her vice presidential running mate, he has the most experience at all levels of government. But there is an irony in the Virginia senator's career. In the heart of the Old Confederacy, Kaine's rise has been fueled in part by his personal commitment to racial reconciliation. Politics, race and religion can make for a controversial mix, but for Kaine, they have comprised the core of his public and political life. \"I do what I do for spiritual reasons,\" he said in a C-SPAN interview. Raised in Kansas City where he worked in his father's iron welding business, and educated by Jesuit priests in high school, Kaine went to the University of Missouri, then to Harvard Law School. Along the way, he took a year off to do missionary work in Honduras, where he picked up Spanish. There he found a new kind of Catholic worship. \"Mass was two and a half hours long and it was so vibrant and chaotic and fun,\" he recalled. \"I learned how a strong spiritual life can help you deal with the challenges we all face in life.\" Settling down in Richmond Returning to Harvard, his soon-to-be wife, Anne Holton, persuaded him they should settle down in Richmond, Va., where she had grown up. The lure was the predominantly black Catholic church where the Kaine family has worshipped ever since. Indeed, Kaine sang in the choir every week for ten years, until he had to give it up because his obligations at various levels of government meant he couldn't make the Wednesday night rehearsals. Kaine practiced law in Richmond for 15 years, focusing on civil rights cases and winning a multi-million-dollar settlement to end housing discrimination in bank lending practices. His wife Anne, a former judge and state secretary of education, was no stranger to racial conflict. In 1970, her father, Republican Governor Linwood Holton, was frozen out of politics after he lead the way to school desegregation in the Commonwealth. As governor, he not only decided not to appeal a court order to desegregate, he sent his children to the predominantly African-American public schools in the center of Richmond. Linwood Holton, now 92, has been something of a mentor to his son-in-law, and encouraged him to get involved in public service. But when Kaine decided to run for the racially divided and dysfunctional Richmond City Council in 1994, Holton couldn't believe his ears. Gov.

Kaine, (left), speaks with his father-in-law and former Virginia Gov. Linwood Holton, (right), as former Gov. Gerald Baliles listens during an event in 2007, in Richmond, Va. \"You're crazy!\" Holton recalls telling Kaine, who replied, \"But I thought you encouraged me to get into government.\" \"I did,\" Holton agreed, adding, \"but the city council is where they bury budding politicians.\" It didn't work out that way. Kaine proved such a successful peacemaker that the majority black council voted by acclamation to elect him mayor in 1998 and then to re-elect him for a second term. Only one council member dissented. According to Kaine's former law partner and friend Thomas Wolf, the councilman wanted to make a \"wholly inappropriate\" deal in exchange for his support, telling Kaine that the vote would then be \"unanimous.\" Kaine just laughed, Wolf says, informing the councilman,\" I don't even get unanimous support in my own household. I don't think I need it on the council.\" In 2001, Kaine was elected lieutenant governor, and four years later governor. Balancing faith and politics Along the way, he had to reconcile two articles of his Catholic faith with his political life: his opposition to abortion and to the death penalty; Kaine viewed both as the taking of a life. Abortion was the simpler one. Like many other Catholic officials, he said he would not impose his own religious beliefs on women who have contrary beliefs. On the death penalty, he pledged that he would follow Virginia law. It was a pledge that he would carry out, but it was painful. As a private lawyer, Kaine had twice represented men on death row. But as governor he upheld the death penalty for all but one of the 11 men seeking clemency. He did grant clemency in that one case, persuaded that the man was mentally incapacitated. Kaine's former chief of staff Wayne Turnage describes execution days as \"very emotionally draining\" in the governor's office. \"During the course of the day he was a different guy, a little more somber.\" 'Impeccable timing' Kaine was a popular governor with a 57 per cent approval rating when he left office. But the Republican legislature refused to adopt any of his initiatives. Instead, Kaine's tenure coincided with the worst national recession in generations; he spent much of his time, and skill, making massive budget cuts while at the same time trying to preserve essential public services. \"I think governor Kaine's greatest accomplishment was his stewardship over the state budget during the worst economy in 50 years,\" Turnage says, adding that other states are still paying the price of less effective leadership back then. Kaine had planned to return to private life at the end of his term, but when the state's junior senator announced he would not run for re-election, Kaine stepped in to run and win, again. Indeed, Kaine has never lost an election. Sen.

Tim Kaine participates in a swearing-in with his wife Anne Holton and Vice President Joe Biden in the Capitol on Jan. 3, 2013 in Washington, D.C. Washington Post reporter Steve Hendrix sums up Kaine's career as \"the politics of updraft.\" \"The central feature of Tim Kaine's political career is his impeccable timing,\" Hendrix says. \"He was a liberal social justice candidate for Virginia at the very moment that the state was ready for it.\" Among the first high profile officeholders to endorse Barack Obama for President in 2007, Kaine served for two years as chairman of the Democratic National Committee after Obama was elected, a position that for the first time put him on the national stage. While Kaine's tenure in office has been scandal-free, he did accept $160,000 worth of gifts, during his eight years as governor and lieutenant governor. Though Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has branded Kaine as \"corrupt Kaine\" for accepting these gifts, records indicate two-thirds of them provided transportation or reimbursement for work-related travel. Of the rest, the largest amount was $45,000 for campaign-related travel when Kaine toured the country campaigning for Barack Obama in 2008. All the gifts and reimbursements were meticulously disclosed, including personal gifts from friends for less than $100, and all were legal under Virginia's ethics laws at the time. The largest personal gift Kaine disclosed was a week-long stay worth $18,000 at the Carribbean vacation home of Kaine's friend James B. Murray, Jr., a venture capitalist. The value was apparently based on what it would have cost to rent the property. Kaine subsequently recommended that the state legislature tighten the state's lax ethics laws. The subject has been a hot one in Virginia since the man who succeeded Kaine as governor, Republican Bob McDonnell, was convicted of extortion and bribery for secretly accepting $175,000 in loans, luxury items, and other benefits. The undisclosed gifts came from a single businessman who was seeking help to promote his products with the state government. Even though the conviction was subsequently overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court, the state legislature enacted a new and somewhat more rigorous ethics law. Criticism from the left Few believe that ethics concerns will be a problem for Kaine. What is a problem for some on the left is that they see Kaine as too centrist. That is in part because Kaine has supported trade agreements that have benefited Virginia's export-rich economy, and he signed a letter supporting the easing of regulations on small and mid-size regional banks. These objections may say more about the current state of the Democratic party than Kaine, suggests Daniel Palazzolo, a political scientist at the University of Richmond. \"I think it suggests just how far the liberal wing of the party has gone, and how aggressive they are about their demands,\" he says. \"They're true believers, and so they're not interested in any deviation.\" There are true believers in the U.S. Senate too, but Kaine's sunny, upbeat disposition has served him well there. He's forged relationships, and occasional compromise, with republicans of all ideological stripes. On the day Hillary Clinton picked Kaine as her running mate, conservative Republican Jeff Flake tweeted, \"Trying to count the ways I hate Tim Kaine. Drawing a blank. Congrats to a good man and a good friend.\"",

            "article_content": "Roger Ailes' biographer Gabriel Sherman discusses Ailes' influence on conservative politics and what his departure from Fox News means for the network's future.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Now we want to spend a few minutes talking about a towering figure in American media. Roger Ailes created Fox News and ran it for two decades until he was forced to step down this week after allegations of sexual harassment became too big for Fox's owner, Rupert Murdoch, to ignore. We're turning now to biographer Gabriel Sherman to hear more about why Ailes is such an important figure and what his departure could mean, both to politics and television. He's the author of the unauthorized Ailes biography, \"The Loudest Voice In The Room,\" and a writer for New York Magazine. And he's with us now from Cleveland. Gabe Sherman, thanks so much for speaking with us. GABRIEL SHERMAN: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: Now, obviously you wrote a whole book about this, but could you just give me the broad outlines of Roger Ailes' biography? How did he become such a pivotal figure? SHERMAN: Roger Ailes revolutionized American politics and media and became the most influential Republican in American life over the last 40 years by figuring out that television and politics were going to become one and the same thing. He got in on the ground floor of \"The Mike Douglas Show,\" a pioneering daytime TV show. And from those early days, he learned the techniques of show business and communication as an effective tool of political messaging. And in 1968, he was hired by Richard Nixon as a 27 year old to be his chief television adviser. And he scripted and packaged Nixon, who had a famously dour and unappealing television image, and he reintroduced Richard Nixon to America as the new Nixon. And from that moment on, Republicans all over America flocked to him to craft and rebrand themselves. You know, it seems inevitable that Donald Trump has become the Republican nominee as a reality television star because he is the conclusion of all of the work that Roger Ailes has done injecting right-wing populism through moving images on television. MARTIN: I do want to ask you in a minute about what Roger Ailes' relationship with Donald Trump has been. But before we get to that - so was it Ailes' intention to use the network as a tool for influencing Republican politics and specifically bringing conservatives to power? SHERMAN: Without question, as I document in my book. You know, Roger Ailes is a charismatic, towering figure. He runs Fox News - or he ran, I should say - as a cult of personality. And he believes deep in his heart, as he said to people many times, that he needs to save America, that Fox News was his megaphone to change and save America and preserve the republic. What Roger Ailes did when he created Fox News was to create a television news network that was anti-journalism. And so what he did with Fox News was to create it as a political campaign that would run against the American media, that would convince millions of Americans not to trust the mainstream - so-called mainstream media, and that Fox News would be the only place on television where you could find the truth. It was a brilliant marketing and political message that created a loyal core of viewers. And so the impact that it's had on American life over the last 20 years is almost impossible to overstate. MARTIN: Why is Roger Ailes' departure coming now? There are other - there have been other incidents at Fox over the years. This didn't just happen overnight, so why now? SHERMAN: Principally, what's different now is that Rupert Murdoch's two adult children, James and Lachlan Murdoch, have been elevated into co-leadership positions atop the corporate parent that owns Fox News. And both Murdoch children have had their tangles with Roger Ailes in the past. Both children have been seeking a way to move him aside, and this lawsuit that Gretchen Carlson filed - it really gave them a powerful cudgel. And since then, Fox newswomen, including their biggest star Megyn Kelly, have come forward to say that Roger Ailes made unwanted sexual advances towards them. So this gave the Murdoch children enough leverage with their father to say, it's time for Roger Ailes to be removed from the company. MARTIN: What is Roger Ailes' relationship with Donald Trump? I mean, you have argued that Donald Trump is, in fact, the culmination of what Roger Ailes has built. SHERMAN: I think it's a very close relationship. The two men have known each other for decades. They travel in similar circles. Roger Ailes really created Donald Trump as a political figure. While \"The Apprentice\" on NBC made him a celebrity, Roger Ailes gave him access to Fox News. He gave him a weekly segment to call in to the morning show and spout off on politics. And he really got the ball rolling with Republican voters that Donald Trump could be a presidential candidate. In the wake of Gretchen Carlson's lawsuit, Donald Trump was advising Roger Ailes on how to navigate the sexual harassment scandal. And there is a lot of speculation here in Cleveland that with his exit from Fox News, Roger Ailes could, in fact, land as Donald Trump's media adviser and try to rekindle his role that started his political career in 1968 by helping Donald Trump get elected president. MARTIN: And, finally, how will this affect Republican politics, since, in your description, he has been such a key political player both overtly and behind the scenes? SHERMAN: The future of Fox News is in many ways a metaphor for the future of the Republican Party. If Trump wins, the party will become rebranded as the Fox News party. But if he loses - you know, the Republican Party is going through soul searching, and the same is going to happen for Fox News. Fox News is going through the same competition that the mainstream networks went through when Ailes launched the network. There are now multiple conservative media outlets on the right. There is Newsmax Television, which is a conservative media company run out of Florida that is now broadcasting into people's homes. Glenn Beck has started his own television and digital media company to compete with Fox. So we're seeing a fracturing of the conservative audience in the same way we saw a fracturing of the mainstream audience when there were just three broadcast networks way back when. And the Murdoch family is going to have to reassess, is this style of programming a profitable business strategy going forward? And my sense from talking to people inside the company - that all bets are off, that they are looking far and wide at ways that they might reposition the channel as less overtly partisan and populist and try to relate to a different audience. And I think that's what we're going to see playing out in the months ahead. MARTIN: Gabriel Sherman is a writer for New York Magazine and author of the unauthorized Roger Ailes biography, \"The Loudest Voice In The Room.\" We were able to catch him in Cleveland just before he packed up to move on to his next assignment. Gabe, thanks so much for speaking with us. SHERMAN: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Mike Pence, whom he is vetting as a running mate.\n                \n                    \n                    Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption On Tuesday night, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump campaigned with Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, whom he is vetting as a running mate. Updated 9:45 p.m. Donald Trump will unveil his running mate on Friday morning, he announced via Twitter this evening. I will be making the announcement of my Vice Presidential pick on Friday at 11am in Manhattan. Details to follow. The deadline for a decision comes after the presumptive GOP presidential nominee wrapped up both public tryouts and private meetings with the three men believed to be among the finalists \u2014 Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. After he campaigned with Pence in Indiana Tuesday evening, Trump his family met with Pence at his Indiana home on Wednesday morning, according to NBC News, while Gingrich and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions also flew to Indianapolis to meet with Trump. Christie met with Trump and his family on Tuesday. Pence, who gave a tepid endorsement to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz before his state's primary, was more gleefully on board with Trump's campaign on Tuesday night as he introduced him at a rally in Westfield. \"Donald Trump gets it,\" Pence told the crowd. \"Donald Trump hears the voice of the American people.\" \"We are ready to put a fighter, a builder and a patriot in the Oval Office of the United States of America,\" he continued. Of the three presumed vice presidential finalists, Pence was the only one who gave a direct introduction for Trump before he came to the stage. Trump also campaigned with Christie on Monday in Virginia and with Gingrich last week in Ohio. Trump praised Pence at the end of what was a meandering speech \u2014 attacking rival Hillary Clinton often but also wandering off into other topics such as immigration and trade and back again. \"I don't know if he's going to be your governor or your vice president, who the hell knows!\" Trump told the crowd, referring to Pence. Trump has held tryouts of sorts for each of his potential picks, and the process he seems to be using has drawn more than one comparison to the reality TV world that boosted Trump ahead of his presidential run. Gingrich predicted the pick would come Wednesday or Thursday, telling Fox News, \"It's a little bit like The Apprentice. You find out sooner or later who the last one standing is.\" Pence is an attractive choice for several reasons \u2014 he has both executive and congressional experience, something Trump has said he is looking for in a potential running mate. But he also has plenty of baggage as well. Around Indianapolis, yard signs that read \"Pence must go\" can be seen in front of some houses. He is locked in his own re-election battle back in the Hoosier State, and joining Trump's ticket could give him an out from a tough race. Indiana law bars him for running for both offices, and the deadline to withdraw is Friday. Once a hero of social conservatives, Pence ran into controversy last year for a \"religious freedom law\" that would have allowed individuals and corporations to cite their religious beliefs as a reason to refuse goods or services. Major businesses in the state revolted and threatened to leave, and Pence signed a revised version that he argued would narrow the possibility that LGBT individuals would face discrimination under the law. That episode saw him fail to defend the original law \u2014 which was cheered by many evangelicals and religious conservatives \u2014 on a national stage. And when he signed the new law, many were subsequently upset he bent to pressure so quickly. Tony Perkins, president of the conservative Family Research Council, told NBC News that he believed Trump could \"do better\" with a pick \" who has not capitulated on something as fundamental as religious freedom.\" Tony Zirkle, an attorney from Crown Point, Ind., who was at the rally Tuesday, said he liked Pence but that Trump might see his social conservatism as a liability. \"Honestly, the homosexual lobby is too strong; he's not gonna pick Pence because he made them angry, but it's nice that he's considering him,\" Zirkle said. Trump continues to drop other breadcrumbs about whom he might choose. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, he said he was looking for someone who would be an attack dog and \"fighter skilled in hand-to-hand combat\" to rebut criticisms from the media. That's something he said he finds in both Christie, the first of his former rivals to endorse him, and Gingrich. Pence probably said all the right things on Tuesday, but he didn't come off as pugnacious as both Gingrich and Christie often can. Trump is also closer to Gingrich and Christie, having campaigned with both several times already. Trump first spent time with Pence and his wife over the Fourth of July holiday and said he walked away impressed. Ultimately with Trump, trying to read the tea leaves of whom he might pick or what he might do this election cycle has proved futile.",

House/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Flags fly at half-staff on Friday at Dallas City Hall, following the fatal shootings of five police officers the night before. During tragedy, many look to leadership for guidance. The deaths of five Dallas law enforcement officers Thursday and two black men at the hands of police earlier this week have prompted politicians to respond. President Obama spoke about the events from Poland early Friday morning, but later in the day announced that he would return to Washington, D.C., on Sunday night. That's one day earlier than planned. The White House also announced he plans to travel to Dallas early next week. In this divisive election year, many politicians called for putting aside differences to offer condolences and calls for unity. Here is how some of the presidential candidates and other politicians have responded. Presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump on Friday evening released a video response to the shootings on his Facebook page. In it, he condemned the shootings of Dallas law enforcement officers Thursday night as well as the deaths of two black men who were killed by police in the previous days. In the video, he said that \"We must stand in solidarity with law enforcement, which we must remember is the force between civilization and total chaos.\" He said the deaths of the two men in Louisiana and Minnesota, Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, reveal \"how much more work we have to do to make every American feel that their safety is protected\" and that the country's \"racial division [has] gotten worse not better.\" In light of the events, the candidate canceled his expected trip to Miami, where he had reportedly planned to meet with Hispanic leaders. Trump released a statement earlier Friday, his first response to the shootings this week. He called for restoring \"law and order\" and \"confidence of our people to be safe and secure in their homes and on the street.\" \"Our nation has become too divided. Too many Americans feel like they've lost hope. Crime is harming too many citizens. Racial tensions have gotten worse, not better,\" Trump continued. \"This isn't the American Dream we all want for our children.\" He said now is a time for \"strong leadership, love and compassion.\" Trump also tweeted his condolences earlier Friday morning: Prayers and condolences to all of the families who are so thoroughly devastated by the horrors we are all watching take place in our country Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was scheduled to campaign with Vice President Biden and then hold a finance event in the Scranton, Pa., area Friday. She canceled those events, but appeared on CNN and MSNBC Friday afternoon and traveled to Philadelphia for the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) church's national convention. In Philadelphia, she addressed the recent shootings and applauded police officers for running toward the gunfire in Dallas, but also called for action to combat racism, urging Americans to ask themselves, \"What can I personally do to stop violence and promote justice? How can I show that your life matters to me, that I have a stake in your safety and well-being?\" In the CNN interview, Clinton said she has been working to \"close the racial divide\" for her entire adult life and put the onus on white people to \"put [themselves] in the shoes of African-American families\" and \"start listening to to legitimate cries\" coming from the African-American community. \"I thought we were on the right track, somehow we have veered off of it in recent years,\" Clinton said. On MSNBC, Clinton called for support of police officers and also urged the country to start taking action on racism and police brutality: \"I believe we need a national conversation, and we start showing respect toward one another. Seeing each other, walking in each other's shoes.   I think we have to show our support for our police under very difficult circumstances, particularly as we have seen in the last day, the bravery of police officers running toward danger and being shot down.   At the same time, we've got to do criminal justice reform and we need national guidelines about the use of force, particularly lethal force so routine traffic stops don't escalate into killings.\" She also tweeted her condolences on Friday morning: I mourn for the officers shot while doing their sacred duty to protect peaceful protesters, for their families & all who serve with them. -H That tweet followed several other tweets and a statement Thursday supporting the Black Lives Matter movement and calling for the country to learn from \"police officers demonstrating how to protect the public without resorting to unnecessary force.\" On the House floor Friday, Speaker Paul Ryan responded to the shootings in Dallas, calling for unity among the American people: \"There will be a temptation to let our anger harden our divisions. Let's not let that happen. There's going to be a temptation to let our anger send us further into our corners. Let's not let that happen. That script is just easy to write \u2014 it's too predictable.\" He also addressed gun violence and racism in his statement, but did not mention explicitly Alton Sterling or Philando Castile, the two black men who died at the hands of police in Louisiana and Minnesota: \"Every member of this body \u2014 every Republican and every Democrat \u2014 wants to see less gun violence. Every member of this body wants a world in which people feel safe regardless of the color of their skin. And that's not how people are feeling these days. Sometimes we disagree on how to get there. Sometimes we disagree passionately on how to get there. But in having this debate, let's not lose sight of the values that unite us. Let's not lose sight in our common humanity.\" See the full video of his response below. After Ryan's comments, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi took the floor. She began by agreeing with Ryan that \"this must not harden our divisions but should unify us as a country.\" But Pelosi diverged from Ryan by explicitly mentioning Sterling and Castile and the possible link between their deaths and the deaths of the five police officers in Dallas. \"I also want to reference a remark of the mayor of Dallas when he said, 'We must get to the root causes of what happened last night.' And in that spirit, I want to also acknowledge Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge and Philando Castile. We have to get the facts and to the root causes of what caused these tragedies.\" She ended by thanking the families of the police officers. See the video below for full remarks. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid took to Twitter on Thursday to condemn the deaths of Sterling and Castile and said Americans have to \"stop pretending the system is fair and fine.\" For too many Americans, the 'justice system' is unjust. Lives are not valued. We have to stop pretending the system is fair and fine. After the incident in Dallas on Thursday night, he tweeted again and issued a statement on his website, calling for solidarity against a \"senseless, evil act.\" The nation stands with the people of Dallas and their brave police force. There is no possible justification for such a senseless, evil act. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement on his website in response to the Dallas shootings, calling them \"unconscionable.\" McConnell added that the killings were a \"cruel reminder that law enforcement officials selflessly put themselves in harm's way day in and day out to keep our communities safe.\" He ended by saying, \"Now is the time to come together as nation, not pull further apart, and let justice and healing be our guide.\" Former House speaker \u2014 and possible vice presidential pick for Donald Trump \u2014 Newt Gingrich responded through a medium he has been using a lot lately: Facebook's live video feature. In a video with CNN political commentator Van Jones, Gingrich was candid about his own struggle to understand racism in America: \"It took me a long time, and a number of people talking to me through the years to get a sense of this. If you are a normal, white American, the truth is you don't understand being black in America and you instinctively under-estimate the level of discrimination and the level of additional risk.\" Bernie Sanders, Vermont senator and democratic presidential candidate, also tweeted Friday morning, calling the Dallas attacks \"horrifying and despicable.\" He tweeted several times the day before in response to the shooting of Sterling and Castile. The attack on police officers in Dallas last night is horrifying and despicable. We must as a nation stand against violence of all kinds. Below is a small collection of other lawmakers' responses to the shootings this week. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., posted a video statement where he encouraged Americans to \"put ourselves in each other's shoes.\" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., responded by condemning all gun violence, and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she was praying for the families of victims in Dallas, Baton Rouge and Minnesota. Watch my statement on this week's tragedies below, or read: https://t.co/QYP4BI85EN #Dallas #Minnesota #BatonRougehttps://t.co/PVGCzvb35h I DON'T ACCEPT police gunned down by snipers, kids murdered in school, or black men shot during routine stops.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump is expected to announce his running mate any day now, and speculation is swirling about whom he might pick. A vice presidential choice is a critical one for the Republican presumptive nominee. Not only has he never held elective office, but he still hasn't united his party around his controversial candidacy. More social media missteps this week and comments praising former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein unsettled GOP leaders even more. Trump has said he is likely to pick someone with political experience who can help him navigate Washington if he's elected. That moves former Rep. Newt Gingrich, who campaigned with Trump Wednesday night in Ohio, higher up on the list. At a rally in Ohio Wednesday night, Trump campaigned with Gingrich and teased the crowd that the former House speaker would be involved in his administration \"in one form or another.\" Someone like Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, a former congressman, gives him both state and federal experience. Plus Pence, who met with Trump last weekend, is popular among Christian conservatives. He could also go with loyalists like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer or Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions. Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, a onetime top prospect, took his name out of consideration after campaigning with Trump in North Carolina on Tuesday. He told the Washington Post that \"I'm far more suited for other types of things.\" Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, a dark-horse candidate who met with Trump on July 4, also tamped down speculation on Wednesday, saying she preferred to focus on her first term in the Senate. Ultimately, though, Trump has run a highly unpredictable campaign and his vice presidential choice could be the same. He may not pick from the 11 possible candidates we've profiled below and has even said he may look to a general or someone with career military experience. Based on our reporting and other news reports, here are some of the top potential Trump running mates.  Arizona Gov.

As governor of Arizona in 2010, she signed SB1070, a controversial law that enabled police to stop anyone they suspected of being in the country illegally. Its passage led to demonstrations in Arizona and around the country. In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down much of the law, but kept a \"show me your papers\" provision. Another controversial bill to restrict medication abortion was also struck down. Brewer endorsed Trump in February 2016, saying he may be \"our last chance\" to secure the country's Southern border.

He moved to neighboring New Hampshire and unsuccessfully ran for Senate in 2014. Brown was an early Trump endorser, and the presumptive nominee suggested at a New Hampshire rally that he might pick Brown as his running mate. Trump has said of Brown, \"he's central casting,\" a likely reference to Brown's looks (and possibly his 1982 nude Cosmopolitan photo shoot).

Less than a month later, he surprisingly endorsed Donald Trump, becoming one of the first big, establishment names to endorse him. He would add considerable political heft to a Trump ticket and could certainly fulfill the attack dog role of a running mate, but he is still unpopular in his home state after the so-called Bridgegate scandal.

Christina was part of the electronica band Pink Pony and has been involved in a variety of controversies involving offensive social media posts With nearly three-quarters of women viewing Donald Trump unfavorably in recent polls, many Republicans believe picking a woman as a running mate could help. Fallin, the first female governor of Oklahoma and a former congresswoman, might begin to bridge that gap. She also would match Trump's tough stance on immigration. During her campaign for governor, she said she supported Arizona's immigration laws, which allowed local police to determine the status of those suspected of being in the country illegally. However, she isn't well-known outside of Oklahoma and doesn't come from a swing state.

Religious liberty is a rallying cry for many evangelical voters, and it has been popping up repeatedly throughout this presidential campaign. But in the current political climate, some conservative Christians are struggling with how to apply religious freedom to other faiths \u2014 like Islam. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz made religious freedom a hallmark of his failed campaign for the Republican nomination. Now, presumptive nominee Donald Trump is picking up the theme. \"Religious freedom. The right of people of faith to freely practice their faith. So important,\" Trump said in a June 10 speech in Washington, D.C., to members of the Faith and Freedom Coalition. On June 21, in a room full of evangelical leaders in New York City, Trump again promised to protect religious freedom. The presumptive GOP nominee said if he's elected, \"people are going to say 'Merry Christmas' again.\" For decades, fights over religious liberty in the U.S. have mostly been about the religious liberties of Christians. Evangelicals have rallied around issues like prayer in public schools, and more recently, whether conservative Christian vendors should be required by law to provide services for same-sex weddings. But now, as the nation's small but growing Muslim population gains a higher profile, other questions are emerging, including debates in several communities over the right to build mosques. Pastor John Wofford of Armorel Baptist Church in northeast Arkansas raised that question at a national meeting of Southern Baptists this month. \"I would like to know how in the world someone within the Southern Baptist Convention can support the defending of rights for Muslims to construct mosques in the United States when these people threaten our very way of existence as Christians and Americans?\" Wofford said. \"They are murdering Christians, beheading Christians, imprisoning Christians all over the world.\" It had been just days since a gunman who had pledged loyalty to ISIS shot and killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando. The gunman was also killed. In response, Southern Baptist leader Russell Moore warned that letting the government restrict Muslims could lead to restrictions on Christians. He believes Christianity is the only true faith, and people must choose it freely. \"Sometimes we have really hard decisions to make \u2014 this isn't one of those things,\" Moore said. \"What it means to be a Baptist is to support soul freedom for everybody.\" Moore leads the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, which recently signed on to a legal brief supporting the right of a group of Muslims in New Jersey to build a mosque. His answer was met with enthusiastic applause \u2014 but he has also faced criticism from some fellow conservatives, including Wofford. What it means to be a Baptist is to support soul freedom for everybody. Southern Baptist leader Russell Moore On a recent Sunday morning, after a fire-and-brimstone sermon, Wofford said he believes the U.S. Constitution protects all religions, including Islam. But Wofford doesn't believe Southern Baptist leaders, who draw their salaries from dues paid by local congregations, should be advocating for the rights of Muslims. \"So what I am actually doing if I support and defend the rights of people to construct places of false worship, I am helping them go to hell. And I do not want to help people go to hell,\" Wofford said. Some Christian groups dedicated to defending religious freedom argue for equal treatment for all faiths, out of the principle that discriminating against one religion could threaten them all. \"It's a double-edged sword,\" said Matt Staver, founder and chairman of Liberty Council, which focuses on religious freedom litigation on behalf of Christians but has also represented at least one Jewish client. \"Religious freedom is for all of us or it's for none of us,\" Staver said. \"If we want to pick and choose, what's the standard? And if it's only that might makes right, then that means it's a political struggle and whoever is the ruling class at any particular time, they're the ones that have their say.\" So what I am actually doing if I support and defend the rights of people to construct places of false worship, I am helping them go to hell. And I do not want to help people go to hell. Pastor John Wofford In a tense presidential election year, such debates have a tendency to become political. After the meeting with Trump in New York last week, several evangelical leaders held a press conference, where they praised Trump's promise to protect religious liberty. Asked how that pledge applies to Muslims, conservative columnist Ken Blackwell responded that he favors freedom for all faiths, but his primary concern is the rights of Christians. \"I was more interested in hearing Donald Trump say that he was willing and ready to defend religious liberty not just for Christians, but including for Christians, in the public square,\" he said. Pressed on Trump's call to temporarily ban Muslim immigration \u2014 a proposal that has appeared to shift over time, but which Trump has yet to explain in detail \u2014 Blackwell said that issue will be part of an ongoing \"conversation\" between Trump and evangelical leaders. He said many conservative Christians see the real estate developer as more favorable to their concerns about religious freedom and other issues than his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. \"We're not going to, in fact, throw him overboard\" over the Muslim ban issue, Blackwell said.",

The woman leading the federal government's effort to block a North Carolina law that limits the rights of transgender people knows what it's like to feel like an outsider. Vanita Gupta, 41, is the child of immigrants who left India in search of better economic opportunity. That journey took her as a small child from a McDonald's in London where her family fled racial insults and french fries thrown by bigoted skinheads all the way to the Ivy League. For nearly two years now, Gupta has worked inside the government, leading the Justice Department's civil rights unit. At a news conference last month anouncing the North Carolina case, she addressed her role in deeply personal terms. \"It speaks to all of us who have ever been made to feel inferior, like somehow we don't belong in our community or we just don't fit in,\" Gupta said. \"Let me reassure every transgender individual, right here in America, that you belong just as you are. That you are supported. And that you are protected.\" Randy Hertz, a dean at New York University law school and Gupta's longtime mentor, said he's watched a lot of people underestimate Gupta over the years. \"When you see her and she's this unassuming, very young looking person, you don't realize what a powerhouse she is,\" Hertz said. \"But once she starts talking and once she starts doing things, you know it immediately.\" Gupta looks on as Attorney General Loretta Lynch announces federal action related to North Carolina last month.\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Gupta looks on as Attorney General Loretta Lynch announces federal action related to North Carolina last month. Gupta started the job at Justice a few months after a white police officer killed Michael Brown on the street in Ferguson, Mo. The episode ignited violence in the St. Louis suburb and launched a national conversation about the role of law enforcement in minority communities. Gupta found a place in history last year when she delivered a scathing report on unconstitutional and brutal practices by police and local courts in Ferguson. She's investigating police departments in Baltimore and Chicago, too. And, in a bit of a surprise, Gupta has managed to do that work without alienating leaders at the Fraternal Order of Police. Executive Director Jim Pasco said Gupta \"showed from the outset\" that she wanted to work with law enforcement to make changes. Lately, he said, the two can talk several times a week. \"There's always a tension between the regulator and the regulated, if you will,\" Pasco added. \"But that has not translated into a lack of communication or a lack of willingness to listen.\" It wasn't until Vanita came in that I got a sense of ease that maybe things would turn around. Freddie Brookins Gupta talked about her approach to the job in a recent commencement speech at her alma mater, NYU. \"History doesn't reward timidity,\" she said. \"And even when other people in implicit, quiet ways will tell you to know your place, do not stay silent. And fellow women graduates I am especially talking to you here.\" College friends recall how Gupta spoke up in class and organized campus protests to defend immigrants. Carmelyn Malalis, an old friend from those days at Yale, said, \"she's excellent at bringing people together but you know I'm also biased on that point because she introduced me to my wife 20 years ago.\" After law school, Gupta joined the storied NAACP Legal Defense Fund. There, as a 26-year old public interest lawyer, Gupta traveled to Tulia, Texas. Dozens of black people in that small town had been charged and convicted of drug crimes, all based on the false testimony of a single white police officer. The son of Freddie Brookins was one of the defendants. \"It wasn't until Vanita came in that I got a sense of ease that maybe things would turn around and people would listen and kind of look into these cases and kind of see what was really going on,\" Brookins said. \"Even when other people in implicit, quiet ways will tell you to know your place, do not stay silent,\" Vanita Gupta, head of the Civil Rights Division, said recently.\n                \n                    \n                    Melina Mara/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"Even when other people in implicit, quiet ways will tell you to know your place, do not stay silent,\" Vanita Gupta, head of the Civil Rights Division, said recently. Gupta gathered so many documents she had to buy an extra suitcase to lug them home. She obsessed over legal deadlines, worried her clients would suffer because of a technicality. Gupta recruited an elite team of lawyers to help pro bono. Two years later, in 2003, Texas Gov. Rick Perry pardoned Freddie Brookins' son, setting him and other defendants free. \"I have a ways to go before I trust our justice system,\" Brookins said. \"But I'm proud to have somebody like Vanita up there because that makes me trust it a little better.\" Gupta went onto work for another prominent liberal organization, the American Civil Liberties Union. Those credentials have drawn criticism from Republicans like Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, who told Gupta at a hearing last year that \"there is a perception, not altogether unjustified, that this department's civil rights division goes beyond fair and balanced treatment, but has an agenda.\" Legal scholar Ed Whelan went even further when he criticized the Justice Department's lawsuit against North Carolina. In a recent call with the conservative Federalist Society, Whelan says Gupta and the civil rights team overreached. \"At some level I think that this is even being presented as a serious question is a testament to societal collapse,\" Whelan said. For Gupta, whose sister is gay, the issue is a matter of preventing discrimination against real people, in the real world. She told reporters when the North Carolina lawsuit was filed last month that the legal case is clear. Ultimately, the Supreme Court will determine whether she's right.",

            "article_content": "U.S. Senate candidate, Rep. Donna Edwards, M-Md., visits with voters at Leisure World in Silver Spring, Md.\n                \n                    \n                    Brian Witte/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption U.S. Senate candidate, Rep. Donna Edwards, M-Md., visits with voters at Leisure World in Silver Spring, Md. When it comes to policy, there are few differences between the two candidates locked in a bitter fight in Maryland's Democratic Senate primary. But as individuals, there are big ones \u2014 Rep. Chris Van Hollen is a white man running to succeed the longest-serving woman ever in the Senate, while Rep. Donna Edwards is running to be just the second African-American woman ever to serve in the upper chamber. And as the race reaches a crescendo with Tuesday's primary \u2014 which in this traditionally blue state is likely to pick the successor to retiring Sen. Barbara Mikulski \u2014 the contest has turned on identity politics and how much race and gender should influence a voter's choice. Edwards hasn't shied away from her personal story, which many in the state can relate to. \"We have not had an African-American woman senator for 17 years, and that's just not acceptable,\" said Marcy Stech, a spokeswoman for EMILY's List, the pro-abortion rights group that's spent $3.4 million supporting Edwards. \"Donna's perspective as a single mom, someone who went to Planned Parenthood for her health care, someone who had to talk with her son about how to interact with law enforcement \u2014 that's exactly the kind of profile we need in the Senate.\" Both Candidates Target the African-American Vote \"Race does matter,\" Edwards said during one debate. \"It's time that we had the ability to speak for ourselves.\" In Maryland especially, it's a message Edwards hopes resonates. Just a year ago, Baltimore was rocked by the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray, who died from injuries sustained while in police custody. Riots enveloped the city for days. Charges were filed against several of the officers involved; one trial resulted in a mistrial when the jury couldn't reach a verdict, and other trials will resume next month. More than 40 percent of the Democratic primary electorate in Maryland is expected to be African-American. Turnout is likely to be especially high in the city of Baltimore, where there's a competitive mayoral primary featuring two black women as the front-runners. \"It's not that the black community doesn't like Chris Van Hollen. The issue is that there's little ideological daylight between the two,\" said Mileah Kromer, a professor of political science and a pollster at Goucher College in Baltimore. \"Now you have an opportunity to send someone who actually looks like you to the Senate, and that's not lost on a lot of black women in Baltimore City.\" The presidential nominating contest is also on the ballot, and that is also expected to boost turnout. And one of the most reliable voting blocs for Hillary Clinton (whom both Van Hollen and Edwards support) has been black women. Earlier polls have shown a close race for Senate, but a Monmouth University survey last week gave Van Hollen a double-digit advantage. \"The hardcore voters who come out every single election cycle are older, African-American women. Those are people right now who are breaking for Edwards,\" Kromer said. \"She has certainly benefited from the intersection of race and gender in this election.\" Arguing Competence Over Identity Van Hollen's main argument is his experience of a different sort. An ambitious legislator who rose up the ranks in Maryland's state capital and then repeated that climb in Washington to join the Democratic leadership, Van Hollen has represented the affluent D.C. suburbs for a decade in Congress. Van Hollen has far out-raised Edwards, out-paced her in advertising and is hoping his sophisticated get-out-the-vote operation can top hers on Tuesday. There's a competence argument Van Hollen and his supporters have been making in the final stretch, too. His ads have questioned Edwards' effectiveness in Congress and ability to work with others. The Washington Post, in endorsing Van Hollen, criticized Edwards' \"aloofness from the details of local problem-solving and for running an office notorious for inattention to constituent services and teamwork.\" The Edwards campaign pushed back on such criticism Friday in a conference call with reporters, with her supporters arguing such charges are sexist. Edwards received few endorsements from her colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus. Her campaign has said that's not surprising though, given she got to Congress in 2008 by knocking off CBC member Albert Wynn in a primary. Wynn sits on the board of the CBC's political action committee, which didn't endorse Edwards. Her most high-profile African-American endorsement came last week from Baltimore City State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby, who is leading the prosecution against the officers in Grey's death. Edwards' supporters say that the Democrat has every right to campaign on both her gender and her race. \"What is she supposed to do?\" asked Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority. \"She has to run as a woman, and she has to run as an African-American woman....We have a right to talk about her background and a right to say that women are grossly underrepresented.\" \"These complaints that, oh, she doesn't schmooze or she doesn't know 'how to get along with people,' that's flat out sexist,\" argued Terry O'Neill, president of the National Organization for Women. \"It's quite subtle in its sexism, but it is flat out sexist.\" Van Hollen's campaign put out its own list last week of 100 African-American women leaders in the state who are backing his candidacy over Edwards. \"We are mindful of our natural affinity with Chris Van Hollen's opponent and the paucity of racial and gender diversity in the U.S. Senate. But after thoughtful consideration and objective analysis of the track records of the candidates, our choice was obvious: we must support Chris Van Hollen,\" they wrote in the letter. One of those signers was Van Hollen's state co-chairman Yvette Lewis, the former head of the Maryland Democratic Party. She told NPR in an interview that her decision on whom to support was based on experience and accomplishments, not race or gender. \"It was not about a demographic for me. Just because someone doesn't look like me doesn't necessarily mean they won't do what's best for me,\" Lewis said. \"It wasn't based on emotion. It was based on cold, hard facts. He doesn't have to look like the people he represents in order to represent them effectively.\"",

            "article_content": "Colorado was supposed to be a sideshow in the Republican presidential race. But with the odds of a contested convention rising, suddenly presidential campaigns are trying to woo Colorado's delegates.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: We're going to take a close look at one place where Republicans are hunting for delegates, and that's Colorado. The state party is meeting tomorrow in Colorado Springs to finish choosing delegates who will go to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. And as Colorado Public Radio's Megan Verlee reports, there's a lot riding on who wins those slots. MEGAN VERLEE, BYLINE: Colorado's state convention this weekend is going to be hopping. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz will be speaking. The other campaigns are sending surrogates. And every party member in the state seems to want to go, according to Colorado GOP Chair Steve House. STEVE HOUSE: You can't get a guest pass right now because it's sold out. I don't think we've had an assembly that'll be quite this big in many, many years. And the last time we had a presidential candidate in Colorado at a state assembly for the Republican Party was a guy named Ronald Reagan in 1976. VERLEE: This is a far cry from the snooze-fest Colorado Republicans expected of the nominating process here. Colorado was technically a Super Tuesday state back in early March. Republicans caucused, but those caucuses didn't allocate any delegates to the presidential candidates. Without anything to win, the campaigns treated Colorado as flyover country - until now. The state's RNC delegates are free agents. They can back any candidate they want. And with the likelihood of a brokered convention rising, that means the state's 34 open delegate slots are an extremely hot commodity. DJ LAMPSON: I get all the calls, all the emails. It's unbelievable. I get four, five a day. VERLEE: DJ Lampson is one of the guys who will vote on RNC delegates at the state assembly tomorrow. He's looking for people that value party unity. LAMPSON: We want to win. That's the whole attitude I'm looking for. So to get unified - that's the key. VERLEE: More than 600 people are trying to win the delegate slots open at the state assembly. Tomorrow, they'll each get 10 seconds to make their case to convention attendees - 10 seconds. That should make for some funny speeches, but it's unlikely to have a big impact on votes. Instead, campaign organizers will hand out lists of preferred delegates on the floor. Republican former State Sen. Greg Brophy says the campaigns have been working for weeks to assemble their slates. GREG BROPHY: What you want to do is identify the people that will commit for your candidate who will have that highest the name ID amongst regular participants, so a former state legislator or a current state legislator or a long-time activist who's really, you know, prolific on Facebook or something like that. VERLEE: As he has in many other states, Sen. Ted Cruz seems to be doing the best at locking down Colorado's delegates. He's cleaned up in the congressional districts that have already chosen their delegates. Cruz's campaign started working months ago to make sure its supporters advanced through the complex caucus process. But Brophy says it's not just organization that gives the Texas senator an advantage here. BROPHY: The average assembly attendee in Colorado is a conservative. So of all the people left in the race, Cruz is their natural guy. VERLEE: It looks like the Trump campaign might agree. After days of rumors that the businessman might make his first visit to the state for the Republican assembly, in the end, he decided to stay away. For NPR News, I'm Megan Verlee in Denver. SHAPIRO: And E.J. Dionne and David Brooks are still with us. David, quick reaction to what we just heard there from Megan? DAVID BROOKS: Yeah, well, this is why Cruz is now suddenly considered the favorite in this race. Because of the delegates, he's just doing much better. We just heard about some of congressional races. That was a state race on Saturday. They've already done the congressional districts. And in one district, the Trump campaign printed up a list of people - a slate to support. But two of the names on the slate were not even on the ballot. And in other districts they didn't even get organized enough to print up a slate. And so that level of basic disorganization is hurting them on the delegate count. SHAPIRO: Now, we're going to hear about the Democratic side of the race in another part of the show. And so I want to take advantage of this moment to ask you both about a couple political questions apart from the presidential race. First, there has been a flurry of the so-called religious freedom bills that allow businesses to refuse LGBT customers. Just today, Bruce Springsteen announced he is canceling a show in North Carolina. E.J., why do you think this is happening right now? E.J. DIONNE: Well, I think religious conservatives have wanted these bills before. They failed on an earlier round because of opposition from business, but they haven't gone away. And they still feel as they did before. For Republicans, this is a nightmare issue, first because it splits business groups from the socially conservative wing of the party. And you're seeing real tension in Mississippi and North Carolina. They're - it may solidify voters who already support Republicans, but it will turn off a lot of young people, a lot of social moderates. And in the case of North Carolina, which is more a purple state than a fully red state, it could be a real problem for Republicans. I think a lot of people in the national party would wish these would go away, but they're not going to go away because people feel strongly about them. SHAPIRO: You know, David, that phrase - a nightmare issue for Republicans - suggests that this schism in the party goes beyond just campaign politics. BROOKS: Yeah, well, it's a deep schism, and I think it's a tough issue. You want to give people the right to practice their faith and to be in organizations that reflect their faith. On the other hand, you don't want to discriminate against gays and lesbians. You don't want to allow discrimination of every sort. And so it's one of those moral dilemmas where you want to give people religious freedom. You want to - you know, people - we do have a right to practice our faiths. But when it impinges upon other people's rights to get promoted, you know, obviously that's a conflict. And so I think this is actually a more complicated moral issue than is reflected in a lot of the public debates. DIONNE: You know, I do think that a lot of people are for exemptions for religious institutions, for example, who are opposed on moral grounds to gay marriage. But when you start exempting them to providers of public accommodations, to bakers and to florists, then it becomes more like classic discrimination. And that is why these fights are so bitter. SHAPIRO: With everybody paying such close attention to the campaign, we still have a president in office - President Obama, who delivered this speech on corporate inversions, a phrase that many listeners may not be familiar with. And, E.J., you think this is an important speech. Explain why. DIONNE: Well, because I think President Obama is saying, wait a minute, I am still here. I have power. And he is moving in what we call these days a populist direction. A lot of people are very upset about corporations not paying their way in the United States. This move will - is a step towards handling that problem. He also put through a tough rule on the kind of advice that financial advisors give people. It's a rule that says their advice can't be conflicted. And so I think President Obama has shown this week, A, he's given to keep governing and, B, he is going to be a factor in these elections going forward. SHAPIRO: And, David, this seems to tie into a broader theme of sort of anger at wealthy, powerful elites, underlined by this week's disclosure of the Panama Papers, showing how the world's richest people hide money in shell companies offshore. All of these different things seem to be coming together at this rage against the 1 percent. BROOKS: Right. I think there are sort of two issues here. One is the - whether we allow people to hide money offshore. And that's controlling the tax system so you don't have as many loopholes and as many allowances, simplifying the code to make it more straightforward. I think there's probably support in both parties for that. The other, where I think the Democratic Party has shifted, say, from Bill Clinton's days - the Democratic Party always wanted to be activists in giving people chances to get into capitalism, to give people - to lower their student loans. But they used to be more resistant to the idea of actually getting involved in the internal operations of businesses. We've seen on a broad array of fronts - not only Bernie Sanders, but also Hillary Clinton and, now, Barack Obama getting involved in the internal operations of businesses. And I think that's a shift for the party. SHAPIRO: And yet, this idea of populism doesn't seem limited to one party or another or, frankly, even one country - a similar theme across many European countries as well as in the U.S. right now. DIONNE: Yeah. The reason - I don't quite buy the way David framed this because in the case, for example, of the corporate inversions, around the world, as you said Ari, there are a lot of countries saying lots of corporations are finding ways of evading their basic responsibility to pay tax. And they're saying, no, we can't operate a society or a government if that goes on. So the populism is not something that just came out of nowhere. It's a reaction, obviously, to rising inequality, but also to behavior by corporations that you don't have to be a radical to say there's something wrong with this. SHAPIRO: That's E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and the Brookings Institution and David Brooks of The New York Times. Thanks to both of you. BROOKS: Thank you. DIONNE: Great to be with you. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

Nathan Deal announces his veto of legislation that major corporations said could legalize discrimination. He said, \"I do not think that we have to discriminate against anyone to protect the faith-based community in Georgia.\" Since the civil rights era of the 1960s, Atlanta civic leaders have touted the slogan, \"The City Too Busy to Hate.\" Their message: We're focused on creating jobs and wealth, not resisting desegregation. Turns out, many businesses liked that attitude. Atlanta held on to its longtime giants, such as Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines, and become home to many more corporations, including UPS, Home Depot and Mercedes-Benz USA. So on Monday, when Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal announced his plan to veto legislation denounced by gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender groups, he wrote the latest chapter of a long-running narrative about hospitality. Georgians are a \"warm, friendly and loving people,\" he said at a press conference. Deal had been under intense pressure from business leaders who opposed House Bill 757, which would have given religious organizations the right to deny jobs and services to LGBT people in Georgia. Under the legislation, such organizations could fire workers who were not in accord with their employer's \"sincerely held religious belief.\" Gay rights supporters warned that the measure would, in effect, legalize discrimination. The Republican governor said the bill was unnecessary. \"I do not think we have to discriminate against anyone to protect the faith-based community in Georgia, of which I and my family have been a part ... for all of our lives,\" he said. William Pate, who heads the Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau, said he was relieved the governor reached this conclusion. \"I think his decision is really going to sustain Georgia's position as the No. 1 state in which to do business,\" Pate said. The Faith and Freedom Coalition used robo-calls to urge Georgians to contact Deal's office and express support for the bill. Many conservatives said the bill was needed to protect religious beliefs. But major corporations with operations in Georgia, including Apple, Disney, Time Warner, AT&T, Intel and Salesforce, called on Deal to veto the bill. The NFL even warned that Atlanta's bid for a Super Bowl could be jeopardized if the bill were to become law. The corporate push was similar to the effort that shook up politics in Indiana last year when a similar measure was signed into law. Last week, North Carolina lawmakers passed legislation to block local laws that protect LGBT people. On Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union, Equality North Carolina and three individuals filed a federal lawsuit saying the law violates LGBT people's constitutional rights and federal law. In Atlanta, the capital of Georgia, businesses have had a long history of shaping key decisions on racial and diversity issues. One of the most famous examples came in 1964, when Martin Luther King Jr. received the Nobel Peace Prize and some white elites refused to attend an integrated dinner in his honor. That's when Coca-Cola threatened to leave the state if the boycott happened. About 1,600 people ended up attending the sold-out event, where King addressed the crowd, saying: \"This marvelous hometown welcome and honor will remain dear to me as long as the chords of memory shall lengthen.\" But in this case, the business community's fight may not be over yet. Supporters of the bill were disappointed in the governor's decision, saying the bill is still necessary to protect people who want to follow their own religious beliefs. State Sen. Josh McKoon criticized the governor for what he sees as bowing to business. \"If we're going to allow a handful of business executives largely from outside of our state to dictate public policy, I mean, I would argue we could do away with the kind of quaint elections that we have. We may as well auction off seats in the Legislature,\" McKoon said. Some lawmakers are now calling for a special session to try to override the governor's veto.",

Bernie Sanders argues a point as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton listens during the Democratic presidential debate at the University of Michigan, Flint on Sunday.\n                \n                    \n                    Carlos Osorio/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders argues a point as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton listens during the Democratic presidential debate at the University of Michigan, Flint on Sunday. In their seventh debate, this time in Flint, Mich., Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders agreed on the root causes of that city's drinking water crisis. They both called for a massive federal intervention and investigation of the lead poisoning there and urged that the state's Republican governor, Rick Snyder, either resign or be recalled. But the two Democratic candidates also clashed over the role of trade deals in the deterioration of Michigan's economy, the usefulness of the Export-Import Bank and the state of manufacturing in America generally. They also disagreed about gun control and the best way to expand health care coverage to the maximum of Americans. They had predictably different views of whether President Bill Clinton helped or hurt African-Americans during his eight years in office. Sometimes, the contrast between their positions, aims and personalities created visible tension. When Clinton talked about cracking down on U.S. companies that move jobs overseas or move their corporate headquarters to duck U.S. taxes, Sanders was contemptuous. \"I am very glad,\" Sanders said, \"that Secretary Clinton discovered religion on this issue. But it's a little bit too late.\" At another juncture, Clinton noted Sanders' vote against the 2009 bailout for the auto industry as a contrast between them. \"If you are talking about the Wall Street bailout where some of your friends destroyed this economy,\" Sanders began. Clinton began to interrupt, then Sanders said: \"Excuse me, I'm talking.\" \"If you're going to talk, tell the whole story,\" said Clinton. \"Let me tell my story, you tell yours,\" he responded. There were also hostile exchanges on the issue Clinton's team regards as Sanders' greatest vulnerability in the primaries. Clinton noted that Sanders voted against a bill making gun manufacturers liable for crimes committed with their products, calling it a blanket immunity enjoyed by no other industry. Sanders said Clinton was talking about a position whereby no guns could be manufactured in the U.S. at all, adding that he disagreed with that. Both candidates admitted they did not and could not really know how it felt to be a person of color in the U.S. Each related experiences in their youth that brought them into confrontation with the racial schism of their time. Clinton spoke of exchanges between her suburban church and the youth of inner-city churches in Chicago. Sanders related his own arrest for protesting discrimination in housing in the same city, when he was a student at the University of Chicago. But despite the frequent disagreements and reliance on sarcasm, the debate between these two candidates was a broadly collegial affair when compared with the two most recent Republican debates. \"I just want to make one point,\" said Clinton near the end of the evening. \"We have our differences and we get into vigorous debate about issues. But compare the substance of this debate with what you saw on the Republican stage last week.\" Sanders agreed, saying either he or Clinton would invest \"a lot of money into mental health, and when you watch these Republican debates you know why we need to invest.\" If you have watched all six of the previous debates among the Democratic candidates, you know well the arc of the contest thus far. Initially, the Democratic National Committee wanted only four debates and scheduled this small number in time slots all but guaranteed to minimize the audience watching in real time. Pressure to expose the candidates and create more competition between them led to additional debates. The stage at first included not only Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders but three other contestants as well: former Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia, former Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland and former Gov. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island. Webb dropped out on Oct. 20, complaining about his scant speaking time. Chafee also suspended his campaign three days later. O'Malley lasted until the Iowa caucuses, where his minor fraction of the vote indicated he was not connecting with voters. Since then, Sanders and Clinton have met several times, and their encounters have been progressively less cordial. Sanders had been generous toward the former secretary of state in the first debates, even helping her deflect criticism for keeping official business on her private server while in office. But as the Sanders campaign matured into a major competitor for Clinton, Sanders became more challenging, even hostile. In February in Milwaukee, he interjected a quick jab: \"You're not the president yet.\" The Flint debate featured several similar moments when, without becoming overtly nasty, Sanders managed to assert his presence and challenge the air of dominance Clinton has sought to project. On this occasion, Sanders could also note, as he did, that he had won three of the four states where voting took place over the weekend: Kansas, Nebraska and Maine. Big margins in these states had given him a slight edge over Clinton in the delegate allocations for the weekend, despite her overwhelming win in Louisiana, a primary state where far more votes were cast than in the three caucus states combined. Clinton could say she won more votes over the weekend than any of her rivals in either party, and she could say she'd won a million more votes than Donald Trump thus far in all the primaries and caucuses around the country. Clinton's margin among \"pledged delegates,\" whose vote is allocated according to primaries or caucuses, is still near 200. When so-called superdelegates (elected officials and party leaders) are included, her advantage swells to more than 600.",

The election of Donald Trump has sent shock waves through civil rights organizations, including among LGBT activists.

Meanwhile, opponents of gay and lesbian rights also see a shift coming with the Trump administration. For the past several years, conservatives in the culture wars \u2014 those who have felt that their views on same-sex marriage, for example, were under attack \u2014 now say they have something to cheer about. \"I can tell you I'm pretty hopeful, and I'm hopeful based on what Donald Trump has said over the last year,\" says Kerri Kupec, legal communications director for the Alliance Defending Freedom. \"In September 2015, he said that his first priority if elected president ... would be to preserve and protect our religious liberty.\" Kupec says religious liberty will be tested in a case to be heard next week before the Washington State Supreme Court.

Kupec says the case could wind up before the U.S. Supreme Court, to which she expects President-elect Trump will appoint justices who will be sympathetic to claims of religious liberty. That's a term LGBT activists say is just code language for discrimination against them. \"It's a very bitter time,\" says Rachel Tiven, CEO of the civil rights organization Lambda Legal. Tiven says she sees the election as a repudiation of progress, and not just in same-sex marriage. Trump has promised he will rescind all of Obama's executive orders, including protections for gays and lesbians working for federal contractors. \"He has promised to appoint people to executive branch agencies, and within the White House and the Justice Department, who are hostile to LGBT people,\" says Tiven. Tiven's anxiety about the future is already evident at the grassroots. There are reports of transgender crisis hotlines buzzing with calls from people fearful of the election results. A spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, Jay Brown, says a top search question on his group's website is \"should I hurry and get married?\" \"People are wondering if they're going to be able to be open in their workplace and when they're serving our country ... in their homes and in their communities,\" says Brown. \"They're wondering how safe they'll be.\" Trump himself sought to reassure LGBT voters even before the election. In his convention speech last summer, he condemned the massacre committed at an Orlando nightclub by a shooter who had sworn allegiance to ISIS. \"I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology,\" Trump said. But Tiven of Lambda Legal isn't swayed. \"If Republicans in the White House or in Congress want to protect LGBT people, they should pass anti-discrimination law,\" said Tiven \u2014 though she does not believe a Trump administration will do that.",

It's the summer of 1998 and I'm at the mall with my mom and my sister Anna, who has just turned 5. I'm 7. Anna and I are cranky from being too hot, then too cold, then too bored. We keep touching things we are not supposed to touch, and by the time Mom drags us to the register, the cashier seems a little on edge. \"They're mixed, aren't they?\" she says. \"I can tell by the hair.\" Mom doesn't smile, and Mom always smiles. \"I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about,\" she says. Later, in the kitchen, there is a conversation. Children aren't ice cream cones, Mom says. Could an ice cream cone wear sunglasses?\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of the Donnella Family\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"Children aren't ice cream,\" Mom tells us. She's smashing chickpeas on the counter. Anna and I shove Doritos into our mouths, sensing trouble. Falafel is a classic Donnella-family tension dinner. \"You're not some chocolate-vanilla swirl cone,\" Mom says. \"You're human children.\" Mixed, I now understand, is an insult. Things are mixed, not people. Dad was the bearded black guy who coached our basketball teams growing up.\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of the Donnella family\n                    \n                \nhide caption Dad was the bearded black guy who coached our basketball teams growing up. For the next decade or so, I proceed to not think of myself as mixed. Fortunately, my hometown is small enough that I almost never have to explain my background \u2014 everyone knows my parents. Dad is the bearded black guy who speaks softly and coaches Little League, and Mom is the bespectacled white lady who explains things passionately and organizes the Hebrew school carpool. When I get to college, I tack up a photo of Mom and Dad in my dorm room, show up to Office of Black Student Affairs and Hillel events in equal measure, and let my friends do the math. \"Mixed\" is not in my vocabulary. I hear it in passing, but shrug it off like any casual slur. When \"What are you?\" does come up \u2014 via strangers at the gym, on the bus, in Taco Bell \u2014 I take a deep breath and dive in. \"Well, my mother's paternal grandmother emigrated to the U.S. from what would now be called Ukraine,\" I begin, to the dismay of everyone involved. I'm thrilled to pieces when my little boo from Degrassi makes it big and I can finally say, \"You know Drake? I'm like him.\" I get through grade school and college assuming polite society agrees with my mom, that calling someone \"mixed\" is dehumanizing and intrusive. But at work one day, I see a copy of a book called Mixed Me! floating around. It's by dreamboat actor Taye Diggs, who is black and had a kid with Idina Menzel (aka Queen Elsa from Frozen), who is white. I'm shocked to see that word in big crayon letters scrawled across the cover of a kids' book. Fashion designer Sonia Smith-Kang sits with actor Taye Diggs as he reads his book, Mixed Me, to children in Los Angeles in 2015.\n                \n                    \n                    Vivien Killilea/Getty Images for Mixed Up Clothing Inc.\n                    \n                \nhide caption Fashion designer Sonia Smith-Kang sits with actor Taye Diggs as he reads his book, Mixed Me, to children in Los Angeles in 2015. I point it out to my teammates on Code Switch \u2014 folks who traverse the very frontiers of race, culture and ethnicity for a living \u2014 expecting an outpouring of finely worded indignation. To my surprise, no one cares. Stuff like this keeps happening. A co-worker talks about the adorableness of \"mixed\" babies. A multiracial friend posts an article about dating as a \"mixed\" girl on Tinder. I come across a line of hair-care products at Target called Mixed Chicks, and even I have to admit it's a catchier name than \"shampoo for women with ancestry from multiple parts of the world whose hair isn't traditionally catered to in mainstream beauty products.\" I don't want to start throwing around pejoratives willy-nilly, but it would be nice to have a single-syllable answer the next time someone asks, \"What are you?\" But first, I need answers. Is \"mixed\" a slur, or what? Where does it come from? Who is it for? More broadly, who gets to decide which words work and which are verboten? There are very few spaces left in America where calling someone a \"mulatto\" wouldn't elicit some serious side-eye, but for a long time, the word mulatto, like Negro or Oriental, was largely a nonissue. So what makes one term fall out of favor, and another take off? In a country where the share of multiracial children has multiplied tenfold in the past 50 years, it may be a good time to take stock of our shared vocabulary when it comes to describing Americans like me. I start digging into the history of that vocabulary, over time and around the world. It turns out we've had a dizzying multitude of monikers, many of which are offensive. Skip ahead if you want to avoid some of the worst \u2014 otherwise, here we go: muwalladeen, mulattos, mestizos, mesti\u04abos, blended, biracial, interracial, multiracial, multiethnic, gray, high yellow, half-breed, mixed-breed, cross-breed, mutt, mongrel, mixed blood, mixed race, mixed heritage, quadroon, octoroon, hapa, pardo, sambo, half-cracker but a nigger, too. In early Rome, we were di colore, \"of color.\" In Japan, we are mostly called h\u0101fu (half) but sometimes we get to be daburu (double). We were half-castes in the U.K. until 2001 (2001!), when the census officially deemed us \"mixed.\" In South Africa, we are coloured, officially, and unofficial \"bushies,\" a slang term that comes from the idea that multiracial children are conceived in the bush. In Brazil, where multiraciality is assumed, the options are colorful: cor de canela, cor de rosa, cor de crema, cor de burro quando foge (the color of a donkey as it runs away). In the United States, when it comes to describing \u2014 or even acknowledging \u2014 people who identify with more than one race or ethnicity, the official track record is spotty. In 1790, the first-ever decennial U.S. Census survey asked each head of household to enumerate the free white males, free white females, \"other free persons,\" and slaves living on his property. The \"other\" category was murky. Some people who weren't considered monoracial may have been marked under \"other free persons,\" but there's no way of knowing how many, or what their makeup was. In 1850, things got a little more explicit. The U.S. Census Bureau rolled out two new racial categories: \"B\" for black and \"M\" for mulatto, a term for someone with one black and one white parent that became sort of a catch-all for anyone perceived as racially ambiguous, including many Native Americans. As for white folks, they didn't have to answer the race question at all; they were considered the default. An 1860s pamphlet published, supposedly, by abolitionists encouraging black and white people to get together and procreate.\n                \n\n                    U.S. Archives\n                    \n\nhide caption An 1860s pamphlet published, supposedly, by abolitionists encouraging black and white people to get together and procreate. At the start of the American Civil War in 1861, \"amalgamation\" was the word of choice for describing cross-racial canoodling. Then, in 1863, the word \"miscegenation\" came along. It was first used in a pamphlet published, supposedly, by abolitionists encouraging black and white people to get together and get procreating. The pamphlet praised diversity as one of America's greatest strengths, and it suggested that the country's triumphs were achieved not only by its \"Anglo-Saxon progenitors, but from all the different nationalities.\" If that sounds unbelievably progressive, it was. The pamphlet was a hoax, put out by anti-war Democrats hoping to trick the public into believing that President Lincoln, who was running for re-election, had a secret plan to \"solve America's 'race problem' with a campaign of interracial sexual relations that would create a new 'American race,'\" as race studies scholar Philip Kadish puts it. In some ways, the \"miscegenation\" hoax didn't work; Lincoln was re-elected, and slavery officially ended in 1865. But the term lived on as states passed anti-miscegenation laws barring interracial marriage, and \"became the foundational justification for the Jim Crow segregation that followed,\" writes Kadish. \"With its hoax origin forgotten, 'miscegenation's' scientific connotation \u2014 and the fact that it has the same prefix as 'mistake' or 'misbegotten' \u2014 planted the notion that races represented different species that should be separated.\" As this perverse origin story makes clear, when it comes to the words we use to describe race, it's important to know the history. While miscegenation is by no means considered a neutral word today, very few people know just how laden it is. Unpacking the history of these terms can help us better understand how Americans felt about racial mixing in the past \u2014 and to identify any lingering skittishness we may have inherited. Today, I have the option of selecting more than one race on my Census form, if I want. But that choice is still very new: until the 2000 survey, Americans had to pick just one. In the past, Census surveys introduced \u2014 and later dropped \u2014 terms like \"quadroon\" (someone with one black and three white grandparents) and \"octoroon\" (someone with one black great-grandparent), but that did nothing for someone with, say, a Chinese mother and Latino father. These surveys offer a window into how government officials thought about race in the U.S. over the years, but the language that normal people use in their daily lives, and the identities they embody, have always been far more complex. So the next time you find yourself rolling your eyes at people who insist on shouting from the mountaintops that they're a quarter this, half that, a dash of the other, keep in mind that for decades, they had very limited options. That started to change in the mid-20th century, in the wake of Loving v. Virginia, the 1967 Supreme Court case that officially legalized interracial marriage. The Loving decision overturned a trial judge's opinion, written in 1958, that \"Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he placed them on separate continents. And, but for the interference with his arrangement, there would be no cause for such marriage. The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix.\" Mildred Loving and her husband, Richard P. Loving, are shown on Jan. 26, 1965. In 1967, the ruling in the Lovings' Supreme Court case officially legalized interracial marriage.\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mildred Loving and her husband, Richard P. Loving, are shown on Jan. 26, 1965. In 1967, the ruling in the Lovings' Supreme Court case officially legalized interracial marriage. A surge of scholarship, personal writing, activism and community organizing around these issues was bubbling up alongside Loving. These writers, activists and scholars had to choose how to describe themselves and their communities. For some, existing words felt unsatisfying, so they invented new ones. For example, a 1979 graduate dissertation by Christine Iijima Hall, then a researcher at University of California, Los Angeles, appears to be the first influential usage of the word \"multiracial\" for describing people with blended ancestries. \"This dissertation explored the lives of a particular multiracial/multicultural group,\" she wrote in the abstract, defining \"multiracial\" as \"being of two or more races.\" By most accounts, little scholarly research had been done about these identities before Hall's paper, in which she profiled 30 people with black American fathers and Japanese mothers. (Hall's own parents are black and Japanese.) There was even less scholarship about people whose backgrounds didn't involve whiteness. What little did exist, Hall says, tended to cast people like her in a negative light. She points to Everett Stonequist, a sociologist who in 1935 referred to mixed-race people as \"marginal men ... poised in psychological uncertainty between two or more social worlds,\" their souls reflecting \"the discords and harmonies, repulsions and attractions of these worlds.\" (That sort of characterization wasn't exactly shocking \u2014 the \"tragic mulatto\" trope was almost a hundred years old by the time Stonequist wrote about it.) Hall's subjects didn't seem to suffer such internal discord. They didn't necessarily agree about what to call themselves \u2014 they variously identified as \"Afro-American,\" \"Japanese,\" \"Black-Japanese\" and \"other\" \u2014 but overall, Hall found, \"all felt happy and lucky\" to be who they were. Hall's use of \"multiracial\" as an umbrella term for describing individuals started leaking into popular culture. G. Reginald Daniel, a leading scholar on issues of multicultural identity and a sociology professor at the University of California in Santa Barbara, says Hall's dissertation was one of the first instances in which the word \"multiracial\" was used to describe an individual, rather than a larger group or a society as a whole. He first heard it used that way in public by a panelist on The Phil Donahue Show in the early '80s, and thought: \"Wow, that's interesting. I like the sound of it.\" Later, Daniel and his colleagues began to incorporate \"multiracial\" into their own work. In light of Hall's paper, \"multiracial\" was adopted by several advocacy groups springing up around the country, some of which felt the term neutralized the uncomfortable connotations of a competing term in use at that point: \"mixed.\" In English, people have been using the word \"mixed\" to describe racial identity for at least 200 years, like this 1864 British study claiming that \"no mixed races can subsist in humanity,\" or this 1812 \"Monthly Retrospect of Politics\" that tallies the number of slaves \u2014 \"either Africans or of a mixed race\" \u2014 in a particular neighborhood. Steven Riley, the curator of a multiracial research website, cites the year 1661 as the first \"mixed-race milestone\" in North America, when the Maryland colony forbade \"racial admixture\" between English women and Negro slaves. But while \"mixed\" had an established pedigree by the mid-20th century, it wasn't uncontroversial. To many, \"mixed\" invited associations like \"mixed up,\" \"mixed company\" and \"mixed signals,\" all of which reinforced existing stereotypes of \"mixed\" people as confused, untrustworthy or defective. It also had ties to animal breeding \u2014 \"mixed\" dogs and horses were the foil to pure-breeds and thoroughbreds. Mixed \"evokes identity crisis\" to some, says Teresa Willams-Le\u00f3n, author of The Sum of Our Parts: Mixed Heritage Asian Americans and a professor of Asian American Studies at California State University. \"It becomes the antithesis to pure.\" By the 1980s, some of those made uneasy by \"mixed\" had a welcome alternative in Hall's \"multiracial.\" But others felt \"multiracial\" was still better for describing groups, not individuals. \"Sometimes, when people hear multiracial, they think of a multiracial society,\" says Williams-Le\u00f3n, one in which \"there are blacks, there are Latinos, there are Asian-Americans, and we all live together.\" Mixed, in this line of thinking, avoided that confusion. Biracial is, of course, another widely used term. It began showing up regularly in scientific papers in the 1970s, often referring to communities with both black and white members. But because of the specificity of \"bi,\" meaning two, some argued that \"biracial\" was too limited a term. President Obama speaks at the Presidential Summit of the Mandela Washington Fellowship for Young African Leaders on Aug. 3 in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Obama speaks at the Presidential Summit of the Mandela Washington Fellowship for Young African Leaders on Aug. 3 in Washington, D.C. Consensus remained elusive, and competing terms existed side-by-side. In Chicago, the Biracial Family Network (BFN) was founded in 1980. In 1986, a similar group founded halfway across the country called itself Multiracial Americans of Southern California. Influential books on the subject include Paul Spickard's Mixed Blood, published in 1989, and Maria Root's The Multiracial Experience and Naomi Zack's American Mixed Race, both of which came out in 1995. (As did Barack Obama's Dreams from My Father, ushering in what one researcher called a \"multiracial memoir boom.\") Then there's the Journal of Critical Mixed Race Studies, which debuted in 2011, and is the first major academic publication to focus on mixed-race identity. Lest you think naming the publication was easy, editor G. Reginald Daniel, the U.C. Santa Barbara professor, included a lengthy note in the first volume explaining the many factors that went into calling it the Journal of Mixed Race Studies, rather than Journal of Multiracial Studies, or Journal of Mixed-Race Studies or Journal of 'Mixed' Race Studies. Ultimately, the publishers went with \"Mixed Race\" in the title, but it's not the only term you'll see in any given volume. \"We accommodate the terms mixed race and multiracial interchangeably in the journal,\" Daniel wrote, \"since both are widely used in the field of mixed race/multiracial studies and consciousness, as well as in the public imagination.\" Today, \"mixed race\" seems to have won out in academic writing. A Google Scholar search for that term results in 2.5 million results. Results for \"biracial\" and \"multiracial\" combined offer up about half that. But the debate continues, inside and outside the ivory tower. Some resist any terminology for multiracial people, period. \"All this talk is disturbing,\" says Rainier Spencer, director of the Afro-American Studies Program at University of Nevada, Las Vegas and self-professed racial skeptic. \"What drives my antagonism is that people are coming in and saying, 'We're new, we're different, we are the answer to race problems in America,'\" says Spencer. \"Population mixture has been going on for hundreds of years. Calling people 'mixed' erases the history of race in the U.S.\" The history of race and the weight of science, some might say. According to the American Association of Physical Anthropologists, \"Pure races, in the sense of genetically homogenous populations, do not exist in the human species today, nor is there any evidence that they have ever existed in the past.\" So discussions of \"mixedness\" are even trickier, because they inherently rely on cultural, not scientific, understandings of race. Sharon H. Chang is an activist and author of the new book Raising Mixed Race: Multiracial Asian Children in a Post-Racial World. She also runs social media for the Critical Mixed Race Studies team, which was founded through DePaul University. In her writing, Chang tends to use \"mixed race\" and \"multiracial\" interchangeably, but in regular conversation, when someone asks her about her background, she says \"I'm mixed.\" She used both in the title of her book to convey that there are ongoing conversations about terminology and what it means at any given time. That sort of linguistic fluidity is common, says Andrew Jolivette, an activist and chair of the American Indian Studies Department at San Francisco State University. Jolivette says there are no hard and fast rules when it comes to describing someone's racial identity. He recommends simply asking someone what they prefer, \"because we all have different experiences,\" he says. \"I don't think we should create universal truths for everybody. Everybody's experience is different, even if we're the same mix.\" Drake performs as part of the Summer Sixteen Tour at Madison Square Garden on Aug. 5 in New York City.\n                \n                    \n                    Charles Sykes/Invision/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Drake performs as part of the Summer Sixteen Tour at Madison Square Garden on Aug. 5 in New York City. But let's be real: When it comes to how people describe themselves, most of us are more likely to take cues from celebrities and public figures than from painstakingly titled scholarly journals. Rihanna, Drake, Key and Peele and Shemar Moore have all used the term \"biracial\" to self-identify. Barack Obama, ever tongue-in-cheek, likes to throw around mongrel and mutt. Slash, Nicole Richie and Trevor Noah have used \"mixed.\" Author Mat Johnson, whose 2015 novel Loving Day centers heavily on mixed race identity, has reclaimed \"mulatto\" as his identifier of choice. Some don't use any of those words, choosing instead to describe their specific ethnic makeup, like Olivia Munn, who has spoken about being connected to multiple parts of East Asia, or Yawna Allen, a tennis player who's Quapaw, Cherokee, Euchee, white and black. Actress Olivia Munn arrives on the red carpet for the Oscars on Feb. 28.

Munn has spoken about being connected to multiple parts of East Asia. Others just choose one identity and stick with it, like Melissa Harris-Perry, who acknowledges her white mother but identifies as straight-up African-American. In fact, according to Pew Social Trends, 61 percent of adults with a mixed racial background don't consider themselves multiracial. Lots of people adjust how they describe themselves according to the situation. Even Christine Iijima Hall, the pioneer scholar who popularized the term \"multiracial,\" doesn't have a uniform answer for the question \"What are you?\" Hall says she often introduces herself in terms of her specific lineage, but it all depends on context. \"In an African-American group, I would say, 'I am mixed' or 'My mother was Japanese,'\" Hall says. \"I don't need to say the African-American part because most African-Americans know I am part black.\" But that changes in different groups, and has changed over time. The language we use is also distinctly regional. In places like California and Hawaii, with relatively high rates of multiracial folk (nearly 4 percent and 23 percent, respectively,) \"mixed\" gets tossed around pretty casually. In much of the rest of the country, where the rate hovers around 2 percent, the vocabulary seems to still be in flux. It's also dependent on the particular racial makeup of a place \u2014 as we've seen, there's a long, well-documented history of how black and white multiracial folks have been identified, but the same can't be said for other combinations. \"People make their individual solutions,\" says Naomi Zack, a pioneer in the study of multiracialism. \"They talk about it. They change their identities. They go with the path of least resistance for what identity they pick up. Or they live in places where not as much emphasis is put on racial identity.\" Maria Root, one of the founding mothers of mixed-race studies, created a multiracial \"Bill of Rights,\" which includes the right to create and change one's identity across time and place. This episode from a multimedia project called \"Evoking the Mulatto\" is a good example of young people grappling with how they identify as well as how they are identified: Evoking the Mulatto is a multimedia project exploring black mixed identity in the 21st century. So back to my original dilemma: After all this hand-wringing, time travel and jet-setting, where do we stand on these words? Do I start calling myself \"mixed\"? Have I found something better? In thinking about this too much, am I becoming the tragic mixed-up mixed blood that everyone warned me about? As with all of my small crises, I wind up calling Mom again. She is, after all, the one who started me down this rabbit hole. I tell her about my research, and in our respective kitchens, we have a conversation. We talk about segregation, and beauty standards, and colorism. We talk about adoption. We talk about antiquated medical instruments. I remind her of that day 20 years ago in the mall, with Anna. She tells me more stories from my childhood \u2014 like how once, when she was nursing me, someone came up and asked her, \"Is that baby yours?\" I tell her my own story about the time, when I was working at McDonald's, that a customer came up to me and said: \"You look pure. Where are you from?\" We start talking about the Loving case, and she mentions something I hadn't yet stumbled across. Yes, interracial marriage was legalized in the 1960s, she says. \"When your dad and I were teenagers,\" she reminds me \u2014 not ancient history. But in the same decade that law was passed, and even after, several states also passed laws to limit and in some cases ban interracial blood transfusions. The multiracial crew: Me, Mom, and my siblings, Sarah, David, and Anna. Dad was taking the photo.\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of the Donnella family\n                    \n                \nhide caption As Mom puts it, it was considered \"better for a white person to bleed to death than to be ruined by getting the blood of a black person.\" \"Context matters in a really big way,\" she tells me. \"Why does anyone ask you, 'What are you?' Whose business is it? Whose right is it to do that? Strangers don't often, or ever, come up to me and ask me 'what' I am or speculate about it. Someone can't immediately put you in a box or a frame of reference, that's their problem. It should never be yours.\" My mom asks if I'm going to include all of that. \"Maybe I just want you to add these things to vindicate me,\" she says, \"so I don't sound so stupid at the beginning, trying to encapsulate for my 5- and 7-year-olds all my feelings about race terminology in a line about ice cream cones.\" We're both laughing when we say goodbye. Later, I turn back to my notes and realize, quietly, that I still have no answers. But talking to my mom, doing all this research, hearing from historians who've devoted their entire careers to investigating these questions and still fumble when they're asked \"What are you?\" \u2014 it's had the welcome effect of allowing me to care a little less.",

            "article_content": "Black social media users are nearly twice as likely to see posts about race and race relations as whites, according to a report from Pew.\n                \n                    \n                    Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Black social media users are nearly twice as likely to see posts about race and race relations as whites, according to a report from Pew. Why aren't more of my white friends on Facebook talking about this stuff? We heard that refrain a lot last month after video recordings of the fatal police shootings of two black men, Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, went viral, followed by deadly attacks on police officers in Dallas and in Baton Rouge, inspiring lots of conversation about the central role of race in these killings. New data from the Pew Research Center strongly suggests that folks weren't just imagining things \u2014 white people really are much less likely to talk about racial issues on social media: In a survey released Monday about the way people talk about race on social media, Pew found that nearly 70 percent of black folks on social media said that at least some of the content they encountered on social networking sites was in some way related to race \u2014 a number nearly twice as high as the number of white people who said the same. Furthermore, 1 in 4 black respondents told Pew that most of the content they see on social media is about race, while about 1 in 5 Latinos said the same. That's compared to just 6 percent of white folks. About 30 percent of black people say at least some of what they post pertains to race. Only about 8 percent of whites say the same; 70 percent of white people say they never post anything related to race. (The Pew researchers allowed respondents to determine for themselves what made something on social media qualify as race-related.) Monica Anderson, the lead researcher on the Pew Study, pointed to other surveys showing similar gaps in conversations about race in real-life settings. White people say they are also less likely to discuss issues of race offline. \"We asked people in another survey how often they talk about racial inequality in their everyday lives,\" she said. \"For blacks, about 40 percent said they did so often. For whites, that's about 18 percent.\" In another study, black folks told Pew they were nearly twice as likely as whites to say they changed their social media profile pictures to support a cause. \"There's definitely something going on, and a kind of different experience that blacks are having with social media that whites aren't,\" she said. Anderson also pointed me to a Pew study about the way people talk about thorny issues on social media. In that survey, nearly twice as many people said they were willing to talk about a politically thorny news story in person \u2014 in that study, it was the Edward Snowden-NSA affair \u2014 than they were to discuss it on social media. Respondents also told Pew that they were more willing to share their opinions on social networking sites if they thought their audience agreed with them. Social media, it seems, is a space where many people feel particularly uncomfortable conversing about things they think might elicit a lot of disagreement. In many ways, the Pew findings aren't that surprising: People's social media lives tend to reflect their offline ones. In 2014, Robert P. Jones of the Public Religion Research Institute mapped out the friend circles of respondents in their American Values Survey and found that white people were substantially less likely than people of color to have friends of another race. Fully 75 percent of white people had entirely white friend circles. That kind of social segregation, Jones wrote in The Atlantic, is a major reason people of color and white people have had such different reactions to stories about race in the news in recent years. \"There are myriad reasons for this divergence, from political ideologies ... to fears based in racist stereotypes of young black men,\" Jones wrote. \"But the chief obstacle to having an intelligent, or even intelligible, conversation across the racial divide is that on average white Americans live in communities that face far fewer problems and talk mostly to other white people.\" Pew also combed through activity on Twitter over a 15-month period (Jan 1, 2015, through March 31, 2016) to see how often people discussed race on that platform. During that span, there were nearly a billion tweets about race \u2014 or about 2.1 million tweets about race a day. Still, the researchers noted that tweets about race made up a tiny, tiny sliver of the total tweets on the platform \u2014 less than half of 1 percent. (I asked Anderson how they sifted through nearly a billion tweets. \"Very slowly,\" she said.) Most tweets dealing with race were prompted by something in the news, the researchers found \u2014 the church shooting in Charleston, S.C., or the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore. About 10 percent of tweets about race were related to the 2016 presidential election \u2014 more than the number of tweets about race and the criminal justice system (7 percent). But Anderson said most tweets about race were related to the kind of pop culture moments that the Twitterverse tends to coalesce around. \"A majority of the times that people are talking about race explicitly seems to be around big events that already can get people clustered together,\" Anderson said, citing the Grammys or the Oscars as examples. Anderson also noted that about 40 percent of those daily race-related tweets were not directly tied to a news event. They were people \"talking about their everyday experiences, or people talking about discrimination in general, or people talking about race but not specifically about discrimination,\" she said. \"There's really a wide array of conversation, and it's going on all the time.\" And sometimes, \"the news about race\" and \"social media conversation about race\" can be inextricable from each other, as in the case of #BlackLivesMatter, which began its life as a Twitter hashtag before becoming a discrete social movement. As part of the study, Pew looked at how people used that hashtag on Twitter over a roughly three-year period. About 40 percent used it to support the movement, while about 11 percent did so to criticize. But that changed dramatically in July, when that hashtag was being used more than ever before \u2014 nearly 5 million people discussed #BlackLivesMatter in the first two weeks of July. And at first, it was mostly in support. From July 5 through July 7, following the aforementioned police shootings of Sterling and Castile, the overwhelming majority of tweets about #BlackLivesMatter \u2014 90 percent \u2014 were people allying themselves with the movement. Then came the killings of police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge. \"The tone became a lot more negative toward the Black Lives Matter movement,\" Anderson said. By July 17, two-thirds of the tweets with the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag opposed the movement, while just 26 percent were positive. Many of the people using the hashtag blamed the movement for the attacks on police. And while the tone for #BlackLivesMatter was changing over that period, there were record spikes in the number of people tweeting with the hashtags #AllLivesMatter and #BlueLivesMatter \u2014 both of which were formed in ideological opposition to #BlackLivesMatter. Anderson told me that before the shootings of Dallas police officers on July 7, many people using #BlueLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter hashtags were actually doing so in order to criticize them. After the shootings in Dallas, though, #AllLivesMatter and #BlueLivesMatter were being tweeted primarily by people sympathetic to them. Anderson couldn't say whether those shifts in how people were discussing #BlackLivesMatter, #AllLivesMatter and #BlueLivesMatter persisted as the news cycle moved on; Pew looked only at their use for a period that ended on July 17. But she says that even at the height of the use of #BlueLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter over that period, they were still far outpaced by the number of tweets with #BlackLivesMatter:",

Ailes served as CEO from Fox News' first day in 1996.\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Cooper/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Fox News CEO Roger Ailes in his New York City studios in 2006. Ailes served as CEO from Fox News' first day in 1996. The news that sexual harassment allegations have cost Roger Ailes his job threatens to obscure Ailes' singular career and his almost unrivaled influence in the public sphere. But no contemporary figure has done more to shape the intersection of American media and politics than Ailes, who, until Thursday, had been the Fox News chief since its very first day on the air in 1996. In his long career, Ailes advised a succession of Republican presidents on how to gain power and maintain it \u2014 both on their payrolls and off the books. He showed how to bring flair and flash to financial coverage as president of CNBC. Then Ailes gave a turbo boost to the Republican movement in the mid-1990s, just in time to fuel opposition to the Clinton White House, with the creation of Fox News. It was a partnership and mind meld between Ailes and his new patron, media magnate Rupert Murdoch. Fred Barnes, executive editor of The Weekly Standard and a familiar figure on Fox News, told me the new network gave conservatives hope. \"They were so used to thinking that the media was completely barren as far as they were concerned,\" Barnes said. \"There was nothing there for them. It was all for liberals. And then Fox comes along \u2014 and they really glommed on it.\" Fox served as the home of debate within the conservative movement. At its default setting, Fox blended pugilistic, right-of-center populism, resentment of changing demographics and sexual mores, and a strong nationalistic tone. Fox News' success also drove television news as a whole more toward conflict, given its emphasis on assertion over reporting. From Entertainment To Politics Fred Barnes spoke to me outside the arena for the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. It was perhaps fitting that the end game for Ailes played out as Republicans gathered there. Ailes, an Ohio native, enjoyed his first big professional success in Cleveland, as a producer of a local variety and talk program called The Mike Douglas Show. In time, the show went national. So did Ailes. After Richard Nixon appeared on the show during the 1968 campaign, Ailes gave the candidate some advice: use televised appearances to go around the press and interact with voters. More to the point, be seen interacting with voters. Roger Ailes was a political consultant in 1971, advising many leading Republicans, including Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Karl Rove.\n                \n                    \n                    Jerry Mosey/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Roger Ailes was a political consultant in 1971, advising many leading Republicans, including Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Karl Rove. In one such encounter, former college football coach Bud Wilkinson, a Nixon fan and friend, served as moderator. \"No one has any idea what questions will be asked,\" Wilkinson told viewers. \"Mr. Nixon cannot possibly know. His answers must be immediate and direct \u2014 and our panel is representative.\" In reality, the panelists were pretty carefully screened. Ailes ended up advising the Nixon White House. He also rose to be executive producer of The Mike Douglas Show, which lasted for thousands of episodes. Ailes dabbled in Broadway, producing two shows, including The Hot l Baltimore. He advised President Reagan's re-election campaign in 1984, helping Reagan revive his fortunes following a disastrous first debate against Walter Mondale. Reagan dominated the second debate with remarks that became political legend. Pressed on his age, for example, Reagan said, \"I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience.\" Reagan never looked back. Ailes kept toggling between producing television specials and serving as a political consultant, sometimes doing both at once. In 1988, Ailes played a key role in George H.W. Bush's White House bid. A climactic moment arrived early that year. Ailes warned Bush that CBS News anchor Dan Rather was primed to go after him on the Iran-Contra scandal during a live interview. The conversation turned testy. Bush ordinarily displayed a patrician reserve. Ailes goaded Bush to rumble. When pressed by Rather, the vice president roared back, \"It's not fair to judge my whole career by a rehash on Iran. How would you like it if I judged your career by those seven minutes when you walked off the set in New York?\" Bush was jabbing Rather over a 1987 incident in which the network delayed the start of CBS Evening News to carry the end of a U.S. Open tennis match. Rather, infuriated, walked off the set (on location in Miami, not New York). When the match ended, the network went black for more than six minutes before Rather returned. That year, Ailes published the book, You Are the Message, a primer on how candidates and corporate executives should communicate with the public. He proceeded to manage several unsuccessful Republican campaigns, starting with Rudy Giuliani's first mayoral bid in New York City in 1989. Ailes left politics once more, though hardly definitively. He produced Rush Limbaugh's radio show and then joined CNBC to build it up into a recognizable version of what the channel is today. The Era Of Fox News He later jumped at the chance to run Rupert Murdoch's Fox News \u2014 defined as an alternative to the liberal media at its launch in fall 1996. Roger Ailes (left) speaks at a news conference with Rupert Murdoch in January 1996 after it was announced Ailes would be chairman and CEO of Fox News.\n                \n                    \n                    Richard Drew/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Roger Ailes (left) speaks at a news conference with Rupert Murdoch in January 1996 after it was announced Ailes would be chairman and CEO of Fox News. Fox built up momentum during the impeachment process of President Bill Clinton and then surged after the disputed 2000 presidential election and the September 2001 terrorist attacks. The channel draped itself in patriotism \u2014 a constant Ailes refrain. Fox would become the top-rated cable news channel and has remained so ever since. Before Thursday evening, many with ties to the network said there is no way to disentangle what they felt about Fox from what they felt about Ailes. \"At Fox, everything is due to Roger,\" Fred Barnes said. \"It was entirely his vision. And what he created \u2014 one guy creating that. I'm still amazed.\" News reports were often straight ahead. But common themes cropped up on the opinion shows, including some racial undercurrents. In a 2009 appearance on Fox & Friends, Glenn Beck, who at the time hosted his own show on Fox, said of President Obama, \"This president, I think, has exposed himself as a guy over and over and over again who has a deep-seated hatred for white people or the white culture.\" Ultimately Beck's conspiracy-driven rhetoric and his belief that his star shined brighter than the network's was too much for even Ailes, who did not renew Beck's contract. Ailes never fully shed his partisan activities. He counseled President George W. Bush's chief adviser, Karl Rove, during the invasion of Iraq. In 2012, he personally encouraged New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to run against Obama and sent an emissary to Afghanistan to try to coax Gen. David Petraeus into the race. (That secret mission, carried out by a Fox News national security analyst, was taped.) Ailes had put many of the candidates in the past few cycles on the Fox payroll; John Kasich and Mike Huckabee used to be Fox News hosts, while Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich and Ben Carson had all been paid Fox News commentators. Fox News host Megyn Kelly moderates the Republican presidential debate in Des Moines, Iowa, on Jan. 28.\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Fox News host Megyn Kelly moderates the Republican presidential debate in Des Moines, Iowa, on Jan. 28. Above all, Ailes wanted Fox News to referee Republican Party politics. That backfired, in a sense, last August, when Fox News host Megyn Kelly confronted Donald Trump in the first Republican debate. Kelly said, \"You've called women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals.\" Trump interjected, \"Only Rosie O'Donnell.\" \"No, it wasn't,\" Kelly said. After the debate, Trump attacked Kelly and Fox News and appeared repeatedly on rival networks, driving up their ratings. Ailes effectively sued for peace with Trump, alienating Kelly. The Obsessions Of Roger Ailes One of Ailes' former executives once told me you just had to watch Fox to understand his obsessions. The channel was drenched in stories about sex. Female presenters on Fox were often overtly sexualized. They were steered to wear revealing outfits, while cameras lingered over their legs. The morning show Fox & Friends, a peppy mix of fraternity humor, gossip and conservative chat, was a particular source of charged banter. Gretchen Carlson had been a co-host on the show for years. She filed suit earlier this month alleging that Ailes had demoted her to an early afternoon show several years ago, cutting her pay, as a result of her complaints of sexism on the set. He then proceeded to make increasingly plain sexual advances, according to her suit. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie appears on Fox & Friends with co-anchors Steve Doocy, Gretchen Carlson and Brian Kilmeade in 2011. Carlson filed suit earlier this month alleging that Ailes had demoted her to an early afternoon show several years ago, cutting her pay, as a result of her complaints of sexism on the set.\n                \n                    \n                    Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie appears on Fox & Friends with co-anchors Steve Doocy, Gretchen Carlson and Brian Kilmeade in 2011. Carlson filed suit earlier this month alleging that Ailes had demoted her to an early afternoon show several years ago, cutting her pay, as a result of her complaints of sexism on the set. Some anchors and hosts defended Ailes, including some women, in what appeared to be a coordinated effort. Megyn Kelly, by contrast, held back from public comment and cooperated with an inquiry set up by parent company 21st Century Fox. She reportedly told the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison \u2014 which was conducting the inquiry \u2014 that Ailes had harassed her, too, when she was a young reporter in the network's Washington bureau. Others have also come forward. Ailes' management style knit together fierce loyalty and paranoia. Many Fox News journalists have told me of their deep fears of offending Ailes, including one who, like Carlson, says she was sexually harassed by him in recent years. One way such loyalty can be enforced: Ailes' PR department has peddled negative stories about colleagues who fell out of favor. In one instance, a publicist successfully planted a story in the Washington Post depicting then-anchor Laurie Dhue as drunk at a black-tie affair; after leaving the network, she acknowledged she was an alcoholic. Her lawyer said Thursday she, too, is writing a book about her interactions with Ailes and others at Fox. Ailes is receiving a severance package in the tens of millions of dollars, though he will remain an adviser to Rupert Murdoch. Murdoch will oversee the network in the short term. Carlson's attorney, Nancy Erika Smith, tells me the payment of such an astonishing sum to get Ailes to resign falls short given all the accusations against him. Until Carlson's lawsuit, Ailes' charisma, his accomplishments and his stature held sway. No longer.",

Unofficial results show that the Philippines is electing its first-ever transgender member of Congress \u2014 Geraldine Roman, who's winning nearly 62 percent of the vote in her district, according to polls. Like many Filipino politicians, Roman is part of a political dynasty: She will be taking over her House seat from her mother, currently a representative of Bataan, who has hit her three-term limit. Roman's father held the seat before that. \"The fact that she comes from a prominent and politically powerful family definitely helps her candidacy in this conservative, predominantly Catholic country where abortion, divorce and same-sex marriage are all illegal,\" Michael Sullivan reported for NPR in the run-up to the election. Now Roman has claimed victory \u2014 a significant milestone. The status of LGBT people in the Philippines made headlines earlier this year, when boxer and politician Manny Pacquiao compared gay people to animals. (He later apologized.) And according to the AFP, there are currently no openly gay politicians active at the national level in the Philippines. CONGRATS to Bataan 1st Dist.Rep. Geraldine Roman. First elected transgender congresswoman in Philippine history. pic.twitter.com/oaEBnPwjy8 Roman told the AFP her life \"has not been a secret,\" and that her father always encouraged her to be confident in the face of teasing about her gender. Roman transitioned in the '90s. She speaks three European languages and lived in Spain before returning to the Philippines to take care of her father when he fell ill, the AFP writes. Ahead of the election, she told the news agency that a victory would be \"a statement that even transgender people can serve our country and should not be discriminated against.\" The AFP noted the many challenges: \"On the most basic front, a law was passed in 2001 making it impossible for transgender Filipinos to change their name and sex. \"In 2010, the election commission also barred the Ang Ladlad party, which represents the LGBT community, from contesting the polls, accusing it of 'immorality which offends religious beliefs. \"The Supreme Court overturned the commission's ruling, but Ang Ladlad failed to win a seat in Congress in the past two elections.\" Roman is a member of the ruling Liberal party. She told AFP she will campaign for an LGBT anti-discrimination bill and for the legalization of gender transitioning. But she has emphasized, both to AFP and to Reuters, that her campaign hasn't been about her gender identity \u2014 it's been focused on her family legacy. \"At the start, my opponents are trying to convert my gender into an issue and it turns out that people don't mind,\" Roman told Reuters. \"People look beyond the gender and look at what you offer and what's in your heart. That is the most important thing.\"",

            "article_content": "When I was a senior in college, I experienced one of the most quietly humiliating moments of my life. I had just arrived in my adviser's office, excited to go over the latest draft of my thesis, which focused on the racial dynamics of Brazilian sex tourism. The draft was over 100 pages long and involved research I had been doing for a year. When I sat down, my adviser handed me a printout and said, \"Leah, I think you'll find this immensely helpful.\" It was a Wikipedia page titled \"History of Brazil.\" Glancing over the page, I immediately got the point: I was posing all these questions in my paper that someone with even a cursory knowledge of colonial history would recognize as well-trod territory. I thought I was exploring uncharted waters, asking questions like, \"Why is race so complicated in Brazil?\" and then starting from absolute scratch to answer them. My professor was basically saying, \"Let me Google that for you.\" Not because the answer to any of the questions in my paper were easy, but because there's heaps of well-documented and easily accessible social and institutional history out there to start from. I was reminded of this when I watched a video put out this week by BuzzFeed, called 27 Questions Black People Have For Black People. Some of the questions raised in the video are harmless, silly fun. Others, many have pointed out, rest on seriously flawed premises. The video has been taken to task by Bossip, The Root and, of course, Twitter, which went nuts with the satiric hashtags #RealBlackPeopleQuestions and #BuzzFeedVideoQuestions. The problem is that questions like \"Why do we call each other the N-word, but get vehemently upset when a white person uses the N-word?\" are presented as though they're new, daring and bold, ignoring the fact that they've been taken up since time immemorial by black folks, white folks, scholars, historians, academics, activists, writers and others. The vast majority could be addressed by a 15-second Internet search or reading a Wikipedia page on structural racism. It's also that many of the questions seem to presuppose that blackness exists in a vacuum, and that the actions, beliefs and perceptions of black people haven't been shaped by, say, housing segregation, mass incarceration, poverty, underfunded schools and the like. So in the spirit of Let Me Google That For You, I'm going to take a crack at answering BuzzFeed's 27 questions for black people with all of this in mind. Here we go: 1. \"Why is it so hard to be on time?\" The tsk, tsk vibe of this question rubbed many the wrong way. There's history worth considering here, like the era when African-Americans were the first to be kicked off public transportation if there wasn't space for white folks to sit down, which led to more costly and time-consuming travel. Or the fact that places like the Bay Area have spent millions of dollars on transportation systems that serve affluent white neighborhoods \"at the expense of a bus system ... for low income people of color.\" Then again, maybe black people being late is just a stereotype, and people of all races show up late in equal measure. 2. \"If my dab is on fleek, am I lit?\" Nah, but here's how you get lit. 3. \"Why is it a problem if I like anime?\" Vice's \"What Black Anime Fans Can Teach Us About Race In America\" might answer that for you. 4. \"Why do black people look at your shoes before they greet you?\" Just in case. 5. \"Why are we more likely to engage in the new dance trend than we are to get involved in politics or opening a business?\" The person who asked this question might take note of the facts that: A) Black women voted at a higher rate than any other group in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. B) It's incredibly difficult for black people to get loans to start businesses. C) Dancing is accessible to everyone \u2014 and doesn't preclude folks from participating in either of the aforementioned activities. She might also take a look at this video, which I believe addresses all three points: I think this video gets at all of that. 6. \"How did watermelon become our thing?\" Take a look at this Atlantic article, which does a deep dive into the history of the watermelon stereotype. It turns out that after the Civil War, watermelon was one of the first products that newly free African-Americans were able to make money from, so it became a symbol of freedom for the black community. 7. \"Why do you get upset when I don't like a black celebrity?\" Black celebs get a lot of hate already. Also, the Southern Poverty Law Center conducted a study that found that black people are the most hated people in the country. So there's understandable sensitivity and perhaps overcompensating when it comes to black folks cheering on their own. 8. \"Why do we call each other the N-word but get vehemently upset when a white person uses the N-word?\" About a million really interesting articles and essays have been written about this, going back decades, but the broad answer is, perhaps, because white people generally use it as a slur, and black people generally don't. (Feel free to vehemently disagree. But the point is, this is not a novel question.) 9. \"Why is my natural hair, the hair that grows out of my head, seen as a political statement?\" In addition to stereotypes, there has been actual legislation designed to prevent black women from wearing their natural hair. The U.S. military is one of many institutions that have and continue to put restrictions on how black women can wear their hair. The truth is, black people haven't really had a choice when it comes to whether their hair is politicized or not. 10. \"Why do we think people with light skin look better than people with dark skin?\" This article talks about the fight against colorism in the black community but is careful to point out that one researcher who studies the phenomenon \"has traveled the world and hasn't found one place where colorism didn't exist.\" This is not a \"black people thing.\" 11. \"Do you really believe that black is beautiful or it just something that you say because it sounds cool?\" For some helpful history, see \"Black is Beautiful,\" via Wikipedia 12. \"Why do some black people say that you're pretty 'for a dark-skinned girl'?\" Refer to question 10. 13. \"Why do some black men only date white women?\" Could be anything from personal preference to coincidence to internalized racial stereotypes. 14. \"Why is it OK for black men to date white women, but not OK for a black woman to date outside her race?\" Relationship-advice giver Edward Bowser makes the argument that \"When black men \u2014 arguably the most stereotyped and subjugated minority group in the country \u2014 see black women dating outside their race, they, once again, feel shunned.\" He adds, importantly, that this is something that black women also experience and that \"complaining about who someone else is dating like it's any of your business\" is decidedly not dope. 15. \"Why do you protest Black Lives Matter and then tear each other down in the next breath?\" This question is confusing, but here's some food for thought. Black Lives Matter is an activist movement trying to address systemic and structural problems of racial inequality. As a movement, it represents a lot of ideas that people believe in. That said, any given person who is part of the Black Lives Matter movement is a human with strengths and flaws and limitations, and sometimes other people find those flaws annoying. So they support the cause, but rag on the individual. It's very possible to champion someone's work, believe in what they're fighting for, and still not like the person. 16. \"Why do we say that we don't want to be seen as a monolith but then try to take people's black cards away for not liking something that's supposedly black?\" \"Do I contradict myself? Very well, then I contradict myself. I am large, I contain multitudes,\" wrote Walt Whitman, well-known poet who both advocated for stopping the spread of slavery and also held views that many today would consider anti-black. That is to say, black people don't have a monopoly on holding conflicting ideas in their heads at the same time. 17. \"Why are we so quick to support a non-black-owned business, but then hesitate when it's a black-owned business?\" I'm sure this is a thing that happens, though I've never experienced it or seen evidence for it. But as with anything, one person's experience does not a trend make, mine included. And that's what's frustrating about many of these questions. I'm sure the folks in the video have experienced or observed many of the things they're asking about. But as the reaction to the video makes clear, it's very easy to find black folks who've never had these problems or noticed these habits. And that's fine! Different people have different experiences, based on where they live or grew up, what kind of job they have, who they hang out with, etc. Black people are, indeed, not a monolith. The trouble is, the video never acknowledges that. It poses its provocative questions to all black people, as though all of us need to sit down and get our heads right. You could argue that the point was to \"start a conversation,\" but again, most of these conversations don't need starting \u2014 they've been broiling for years, decades, even centuries in some cases. It's really easy to find thoughtful, in-depth commentary on the issue of black folks shopping at black-owned business, for instance. But the video gives the impression that this is something no one is talking about, much less writing about or organizing around, and that's just not the case. 18. \"Is there a cutoff time for this whole homophobia thing in the black community?\" From a ThinkProgress piece titled, \"New Survey Debunks The Myth Of Black Homophobia\": \"For many years, there has been a myth that African Americans are more likely to be homophobic and thus more likely to oppose advances for LGBT equality. Conservatives have even tried to leverage this supposed wedge to slow the progress of equality. A new survey, however, not only debunks the myth, but suggests that the black community is one of the LGBT community's strongest allies.\" 19. \"Why is growing up without a father so common in our race?\" Here's another instance where this video seems to exist in a vacuum, a vacuum in which decades of systemic racism and structural oppression never happened. Here's Michelle Alexander, the author of The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness, in an interview with Fresh Air's Dave Davies, on the effect of the war on drugs on the lives on black men in America, millions of whom were arrested for minor crimes: \"[The young black males are] shuttled into prisons, branded as criminals and felons, and then when they're released, they're relegated to a permanent second-class status, stripped of the very rights supposedly won in the civil rights movement \u2014 like the right to vote, the right to serve on juries, the right to be free of legal discrimination and employment, and access to education and public benefits. Many of the old forms of discrimination that we supposedly left behind during the Jim Crow era are suddenly legal again, once you've been branded a felon.\" See also this article about ways in which the stereotype of the absent black father is overblown. 20. \"Why don't we like to confront our mental health issues?\" I actually like this question, and so do some other folks, but some searches to start with might be \"racism in mental health services\" and \"myth of the strong black woman.\" 21. \"Why is there a checklist for being black?\" Race is a social construct, and for that construct to exist, there need to be rules for fitting into one category or another. Scholar Peter Geller describes the process of both the media and the \"state's creation and maintenance of racial categories through law, policy, and enumeration.\" But again, there is zero evidence that this is \"a black thing.\" 22. \"Why is being educated considered 'a white thing?' \" Let's consider this Jamelle Bouie piece about racialized achievement, where he offers context and research to discredit the myth that black folks don't value education: \"According to [several sociologists'] research\u2014drawn from interviews with students across eight North Carolina schools\u2014racialized stigma against high achievement exists. But it requires specific circumstances, namely, predominantly white schools where few blacks attend advanced classes. There, black and white students hold racialized perceptions of educational achievement, and black students are often isolated by stigma from both groups.\" He continues: \"Across schools, the general pattern was this: 'Acting white' accusations weren't attached to academic performance and rather were a function of specific behaviors. If you hung out with white kids and adopted white fashions, you were accused of 'acting white.' Smart kids were teased, but no more than you'd see in any other group. Also, a 2013 Houston Education Survey found that African-Americans are more likely than any other racial group to value post-secondary education. 23. \"Why do I have to be mixed in order to have long hair?\" Chris Rock made a documentary that gets at that question, and guess what, BuzzFeed: You have a whole article about black women with long hair on your own website! 24. \"Why do you think well-off black people don't know what it means to be black?\" Google \"conflation of race and class.\" There's some good stuff out there. 25. \"Why do some black people say, 'Oh, I have Native American in my family,' in order to feel interesting or more valuable than other black people around them?\" There is a very complex racial hierarchy in the United States that affords certain privileges to African-Americans but denies them many others. Currently and historically, some black people have sought to gain certain privileges by distancing themselves from negative stereotypes associated with blackness. Also, falsely claiming Native American ancestry cuts across all sorts of racial lines. Slate digs deep into this centuries-old identity tic: \"Throughout the South in the 1840s and 1850s, large numbers of whites began claiming they were descended from a Cherokee great-grandmother. That great-grandmother was often a 'princess,' a not-inconsequential detail in a region obsessed with social status and suspicious of outsiders. By claiming a royal Cherokee ancestor, white Southerners were legitimating the antiquity of their native-born status as sons or daughters of the South, as well as establishing their determination to defend their rights against an aggressive federal government, as they imagined the Cherokees had done. These may have been self-serving historical delusions, but they have proven to be enduring.\" 26. \"Why can't we just acknowledge that there are a bunch of different types of black people walking around and they're all amazing and unique and special in their own way?\" See question 21. 27. Why are we always looking for the discount? The racial wage gap, for a start.",

Before Black Lives Matter was a hashtag, before it was a slogan chanted by protesters in cities across the country, before it was a national movement, it was a Facebook post by an Oakland-based activist named Alicia Garza. She wrote it after George Zimmerman was acquitted in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. It read in part: \"I continue to be surprised at how little black lives matter, and I will continue that. Stop giving up on black life.\" She ended by saying, \"Black people, I love you. I love us. Our lives matter.\" NPR's Kelly McEvers spoke with Jelani Cobb, who recently wrote an article in the New Yorker about Black Lives Matter, how the movement started and where it stands today. He talks about how those three words were later adopted as a rallying cry by protesters from around the country who came to Ferguson, Mo. after 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by a police officer. On tensions about who speaks for the movement \"I think there's been a conflict that's played itself out publicly in terms of the people who founded the idea or came up with the name and the people who really did the pivotal work on the ground in Ferguson. In some ways, it's an entity that has two births. It's conceived after one tragedy and really comes to fruition after another. And we've talked about the Internet and social media and the ways that those things have really revolutionized and changed the way social activism happens. In some ways that's a plus, but it can be a really big liability as well because a good bit of the conflict between the various factions of Black Lives Matter has played itself out in public and on social media... \"A little more recently, Alicia Garza was going to come to St. Louis to give a speech at Webster University, and a great deal of social media chatter erupted about this and whether or not she had any place coming there, and whether it was more appropriate to think of the people who were in St. Louis and Ferguson as the founders. When I spoke to Alicia Garza about it, she said that she got death threats and threats of violence, and she wound up canceling the talk. That became kind of a crucial moment in the history of this organization where a person who is organizing about African-Americans and their lives is really not giving a talk because of threats to her own.\" On how earlier ideas of leadership don't necessarily work for this movement \"We associate whole blocks of history with W.E.B. Du Bois or Booker T. Washington or Malcolm X or Dr. King. Entire constellations of history are distilled down to two individuals, almost always male. There's been a certain kind of fatigue, and Black Lives Matter represents that. They find a more horizontal ethic of leadership to be more important, and they find inspiration from Ella Baker, who was one of the most central figures of the civil rights movement in - partly due to her belief in kind of grassroots and local leadership in her aversion to the spotlight. Her story wasn't as well known. And so they have kind of resurrected her idea that it's better to have 10,000 candles than a single spotlight.\" On who Black Lives Matter represents \"Movements tend to pick up where the last one left off. When people look back at the civil rights movement, one of the most glaring shortcomings that emerges is in many ways the marginalization of women within the movement or things like Bayard Rustin, who was the pivotal organizer of the March on Washington, but also faced discrimination as a gay black man. Those are the things that Black Lives Matter look at and say, we want to not replicate those things. We want to not replicate the errors of the past.\" On the effects of having a diffuse organization \"When I talked with Alicia Garza, she was very clear about making a distinction between Black Lives Matter the organization and Black Lives Matter as a movement. But it's been almost kind of like a franchising effect. The fact that there's a low barrier to entry has been useful when there are people who have never participated in a political protest before and they're willing to come out and say, 'OK, I can be part of this Black Lives Matter thing, and I agree with, you know, what's happening here.' At the same time, it makes it a little bit more difficult to have a kind of discipline within the ranks. And then you have a third element, which is the tendency of people to refer to any statement by a disgruntled black person as...connected to Black Lives Matter.\" On where Black Lives Matter could go from here \"I don't think it's easy to predict these things. But one of the things that I think we ought to take note of is the circumstances that allow Black Lives Matter to flourish. One is the existence of a black presidency and these sorts of egregious racial problems continuing in the context of a black presidency, which contributed to a climate of frustration. And we're in the last year of the Obama presidency, and so that will change. In addition to that, precisely because we're in an election year, we've seen the movement to be able to leverage influence and - helping to shape and push the direction in which these two candidates on the Democratic side, at least, are moving. I don't think that necessarily will happen after the presidential election. Or at least it's not as easily achieved.\" On the distance between the political process and everyday realities \"It's not necessarily that the black president is not doing more, because I don't think it all lays at President Obama's feet. I think it's the frustration of having both of these circumstances coexist, that you can be represented at the most powerful level of electoral politics and you can have incidents like the death of Trayvon Martin and the subsequent acquittal of George Zimmerman. Those two things are fully capable of coexisting.\" The full interview with Cobb can be found here.",

Thompson-Hernandez identifies as a \"blaxican\" \u2014 another term for Afro-Mexican, the identity soon to be included on the Mexican census for the first time. With February comes Black History Month in the U.S., a time designated to reflect on the history and contributions of people of African descent in this country. And while the month may invite debate among some, one thing rarely does in the U.S.: the idea of calling oneself, or being described as, black or African-American. In Mexico, however, it is unusual \u2014 so unusual, in fact, that up until now, Mexican citizens were unable to officially recognize themselves as \"Afro-Mexican\" on national censuses. That is set to change in the upcoming 2020 census, though. Already, a preliminary 2015 survey \u2014 conducted in preparation for the 2020 census \u2014 found that some 1.4 million people identify as Afro-Mexican. To learn more about what this might mean \u2014 and why these changes are only happening now \u2014 NPR's Michel Martin spoke with Luisa Ortiz, CEO of Nova Mexico, a nonprofit organization that works with minorities communities. NPR also spoke with people of mixed Mexican and African descent; their takes on race and identity can be found on the right side. Walter Thompson-Hernandez, son of an African-American father and Mexican mother, created the Instagram account Blaxicans of LA.\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of Walter Thompson-Hernandez\n                    \n                \nhide caption Walter Thompson-Hernandez, son of an African-American father and Mexican mother, created the Instagram account Blaxicans of LA. I think there's no one way to be blaxican, right? It's not this homogeneous experience. I think there is an incredible amount of nuance in how ... people who are blaxican self-identify. Walter Thompson-Hernandez On the history of people of African descent in Mexico You could say there are actually two big waves of arrival of people of African descent. One of them would definitely be the 16th century, and there is definitely a second wave \u2014 and that is in the 1950s and '60s, after the independence of several nations in Africa. Many people arrived in the region and they arrived to Mexico, probably on their way to the United States or not. But some of them stayed. And I would probably even think now there could be a third wave of people of African descent arriving, coming from Haiti, coming from Cuba, coming from Venezuela or even from Colombia. On why Mexico is adding the category \"Afro-Mexican\" to the census only now There has never been that option. The last time people of African descent were counted was in the 19th century. The Mexican federal government is arriving late to the party. Dora Careaga-Coleman, a professor at the University of New Mexico, is from an Afro-Mexican community in the Mexican state of Veracruz.\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of Dora Careaga-Coleman\n                    \n                \nhide caption People looked at me and asked if I was Brazilian, Cuban, Colombian, things other than Mexican \u2014 because in Mexico, it's difficult for people to recognize that there are Afro-descendants. Because of that, I became interested in finding my roots. Dora Careaga-Coleman I believe that this is the result of a bottom-up movement. Many, many organizations for years now have worked with communities in the coast, and organizations that are mostly international found out, and they saw that people happen to be of African descent. So this is the result of many, many years of philanthropy that bring to the fore organizations that today are becoming politically very active. I think that the government, the federal government, is reacting to the politicization of civil society that happens to be of African descent. On whether Afro-Mexicans feel as if they've faced discrimination Absolutely \u2014 and they even feel discrimination from their indigenous brothers and sisters. It is not easy; it is not an easy debate. Until last year, until 2015, black Mexicans requested to be identified as indigenous because there was no category in the census, and they were asked if they spoke an indigenous language and they would have to say yes. But when they would have to clarify which language it was, you would come to interesting results \u2014 such as, \"We speak some patois, some Haitian, a form of French, some Yoruba\" or else. On what she thinks will result from allowing this designation I envision, on the positive side, a lot of young men and young woment who are feeling comfortable with who they are. And definitely there is some sense of pride in seeing somebody you actually look like making it big, making a movie, winning an Oscar, being president of a country, a senator. So, on the one hand, the result is that people globally are recognizing with pride and dignity who they are and what they can achieve. On the not so positive side, I believe this is definitely a political maneuver. Black Mexicans live in territories where there's politics and the acceptance of their ethnicity could probably pigeonhole them to be members of different political parties in the coming elections. So I don't think it is so romantic. It is definitely far more nuanced and complex.",

When Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump meet for their third and final debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday \u2014 the only one held in the West \u2014 they'll be sparring in an important swing state where six electoral votes are up for grabs. But there's another number you should know about that likely won't get much attention, even though it's hugely important to many Westerners: 81 percent. That's the amount of land in Nevada that's currently owned, operated and controlled by the federal government. Like in much of the Mountain West, the federal government's ownership and management of public lands in Nevada is hugely controversial \u2014 in Nevada, the government owns 58 million acres. Decisions about who gets to do what on those lands are almost always political and the subject of bitter fights, in large part, because in rural areas, many people's livelihoods are at stake \u2014 whether they be federal employees, outfitters, tour guides or ranchers. So this past summer when the Republican National Committee quietly included a provision in its 2016 platform calling on Congress to transfer federal public lands to states, the move didn't go unnoticed out West. \"Congress shall immediately pass universal legislation providing for a timely and orderly mechanism requiring the federal government to convey certain federally controlled public lands to states ... The residents of state and local communities know best how to protect the land where they work and live,\" the RNC wrote. In rancher Stanton Gleave's home state of Utah, more than 70 percent of the land is owned by the Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Forest Service or the National Park Service. \"The last thing our Founding Fathers wanted was for a federal government to be out here in our business,\" Gleave says. He says he's frustrated with bureaucrats in Washington making top-down decisions and would rather see locals in charge of the land. The last thing our Founding Fathers wanted was for a federal government to be out here in our business. Utah Rancher Stanton Gleave \"I could make a good living if I didn't have to comply with all the government rules, if we could just be left alone to ranch,\" Gleave says. Lawmakers in several Western states \u2014 Nevada included \u2014 have passed or considered resolutions in support of transferring federal land to local control for some of these very reasons. But Utah has gone the furthest. After the state passed a law in 2012 demanding that 30 million acres of federal land be turned over to the states, lawmakers earmarked several million dollars to mount a lawsuit against the federal government. But the state has since signaled that lawmakers will wait until after the presidential election to decide whether to proceed. The so-called land transfer movement had been gaining national momentum \u2014 until recently. Nevada was the site of a dramatic, armed standoff over cattle grazing between Bureau of Land Management agents and rancher Cliven Bundy in 2014. Earlier this year, Bundy's sons staged the armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. The Bundys and other militants are currently facing federal conspiracy charges and possible lengthy prison terms. Duane Ehmer rides at the occupied Malheur National Wildlife Refuge on Jan. 15 near Burns, Ore.\n                \n                    \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Duane Ehmer rides at the occupied Malheur National Wildlife Refuge on Jan. 15 near Burns, Ore. Many conservative state lawmakers and members of Congress who originally backed transferring the land now find themselves in an awkward political position. Jennifer Fielder, a state lawmaker from Montana who heads a pro-transfer group called the American Lands Council, recently told The New York Times that the Bundys drew attention to the land issues, \"but in some ways, it was very negative attention, unfortunately. The majority of us are committed to a civil process that is going to be peaceful and isn't going to get anybody killed.\" This might also explain why the issue of federal lands has received scant attention among Republicans on the campaign trail, even as nominee Donald Trump has spent extensive time in Western states like Nevada and Colorado. It would be a huge chunk of our legacy that we're in danger of losing. It's a great idea in theory, but in practice it just doesn't work. Ed Putnam, board member with the Oregon chapter of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers Earlier this year, Trump did criticize the Bureau of Land Management's oversight of federal land in Nevada in particular. But in a June interview with Field and Stream Magazine in Las Vegas, he appeared to oppose the idea of a full-blown transfer: \"I don't like the idea because I want to keep the lands great, and you don't know what the state is going to do. I mean, are they going to sell if they get into a little bit of trouble?\" If the land is transferred, the argument goes, states wouldn't be able to shoulder the costs of major federal expenses such as wildfires or watershed management that benefit ranchers, and they'd be forced to sell the land to private interests such as timber or mining companies. It's a rare instance where Democrats and conservation groups are on the same page as Trump. \"It would be a huge chunk of our legacy that we're in danger of losing,\" says Ed Putnam, a hunter and board member with the Oregon chapter of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers. \"It's a great idea in theory, but in practice it just doesn't work.\" Even in conservative eastern Oregon, site of the January occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, many ranchers who have long struggled to comply with federal land policies oppose the idea. \"I don't think there's any way that would work,\" says Gary Miller, who ranches near Burns. \"You'd have the same set of issues [but] with a huge financial burden.\" So it was a bit of a surprise then to see the language calling for an immediate federal land transfer still included in the 2016 RNC platform ratified in Cleveland last July. But if nothing else, it was just the latest reminder that the outcome of this election could have some sweeping implications.",

When rancher Cliven Bundy claimed his family of Mormon pioneers had \"ancestral\" rights to the federal land in and around Gold Butte, Nev., Vernon Lee scoffed. \"As a native, and as the tribe that actually had that land granted by the federal government back in the 1800s, he really doesn't got a right at all,\" Lee says. \"If anybody's got a right it would be the Moapa Band of Paiutes.\" Lee, who is a former tribal councilman, is sitting on a lawn chair in the shade of his mobile home on the Moapa River Reservation. An air conditioner hanging from a side window hums. He swats away flies as he recalls how the tribe's land once included all of Gold Butte, but was later shrunk tenfold by the U.S. government. Today the reservation is just this small sliver of desert north of Cliven Bundy's place and adjacent to a coal-fired power plant. \"To be quite candid I wish they would give it all back, but realistically that probably won't happen,\" Lee says. So the Southern Paiute tribes in Nevada are proposing another plan. Now that Bundy and many of his militia followers have been arrested by federal authorities, they sense a small window of opportunity before President Obama leaves office. They want him to designate Gold Butte as a national monument. For Vernon Lee of the Moapa Band of Paiutes, a national monument designation for Gold Butte would be the next best thing to having the U.S. government return the land to his people.\n                \n                    \n                    Kirk Siegler\n                    \n                \nhide caption For Vernon Lee of the Moapa Band of Paiutes, a national monument designation for Gold Butte would be the next best thing to having the U.S. government return the land to his people. \"We want to protect the lands, we want to protect the animals and we want our sacred sites protected,\" Lee says. \"Right now the best thing we can think of is to go on the side of this creation of a monument.\" Vandalism of sacred sites Such a designation would be a bittersweet end to an especially rough few years for the tribes. After the armed standoff on the Bundy Ranch, the federal government stopped managing Gold Butte entirely due to safety concerns. Until recently, it was lawless. Kenny Anderson, cultural director for the Las Vegas Paiute tribe, recounts a recent walk through Gold Butte with a group of elders. He noted that the Bundy family's cows are still trespassing in the area. \"There was petroglyphs that they were walking on, there was cow patties everywhere,\" Anderson says. \"And I'm saying, dang, what the heck?\" Native American tribes have been documenting a recent rise in vandalism and other damage to ancient petroglyphs and other artifacts in Gold Butte. Here, two bullet holes were pocked into a carving.\n                \n                    \n                    Kirk Siegler\n                    \n                \nhide caption Native American tribes have been documenting a recent rise in vandalism and other damage to ancient petroglyphs and other artifacts in Gold Butte. Here, two bullet holes were pocked into a carving. It's not just the cows that Anderson and other tribal members are concerned about. They've documented evidence of people shooting at ancient petroglyphs carved into rocks, theft of pottery and arrowheads. There are photos of off-road vehicle tracks cutting across plants native people have gathered for centuries to make paint and baskets. \"I don't know if it's because of they weren't told about things like this or maybe they weren't concerned with what history is,\" Anderson says. \"It's a mystery.\" Thursday in Las Vegas, tribal leaders joined U.S. Sen. Harry Reid and other conservationists to issue a more detailed report of what they say is extensive damage and vandalism in Gold Butte. The event followed a recent announcement that the federal Bureau of Land Management has resumed its field work in the remote area east of Las Vegas, after a more than two year absence. Seizing the moment In the end, the irony is that the Bundy standoff may end up helping the tribes' cause. There's a lot more public attention being paid to these historical lands than in recent memory. And not just in Nevada, either. There's a plan to transfer ownership of the National Bison Range to tribes in Montana. In Utah, five tribes that want to create a massive, jointly managed national monument have the ear of the Obama Administration. National monument designations that bypass Congress are hugely controversial. University of Colorado historian Patty Limerick says it's not uncommon for a president to wait until the very last minute. \"Bill Clinton and his Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbit had quite a realistic recognition that the Democrats were not going to be carrying Utah in the 1990s,\" Limerick says. \"So they could go ahead with national monuments, whether or not the people of Utah thought that was a cool idea or not.\" William Anderson, a former chairman of the Moapa Band of Paiutes tribe, is leading an effort to get the remote Gold Butte area permanently protected.

Editor's Note: This piece contains language that some readers may find offensive. It was a hot day in Cleveland at the height of the Republican National Convention and Stevedore Crawford Jr. was angry. He stomped through the city sweating through his white T-shirt, stopping at corners to denounce police. Right next to him was his young daughter, wearing the same camouflage pants as her dad. She also wore the same white T-shirt, scrawled with Tamir Rice's name. Tamir was a 12-year-old boy killed by Cleveland police in November 2014. Like Tamir, Crawford's daughter carried a toy gun. This one, however, wasn't a replica airsoft gun, but a bright green toy gun. As he rounded a corner, Crawford stumbled upon four police officers \u2014 Indianapolis state troopers who had come to town to help Cleveland police patrol the Republican convention. He stood right in front of them. Cleveland police officers stand guard outside the site of the Republican National Convention.\n                \n                    \n                    Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Cleveland police officers stand guard outside the site of the Republican National Convention. \"I don't give a f*** about a pig,\" Crawford screamed. \"And a pig don't give a f*** about me.\" It was a scene that dramatized the raw feelings dominating a national debate on the relationship between police and people of color. Onstage and on the streets, the debate flared at both the Republican gathering in Cleveland and the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. The divide on stage at the conventions mirrors deep division in the country over the Black Lives Matter movement and attitudes toward law enforcement. Four in 10 Americans say they support BLM according to a recent Pew survey that also revealed white Democrats were more than three times more likely than white Republicans to support it. That day in Cleveland, the country was still reeling from the killing of police officers just a day before in Baton Rouge and just over a week before in Dallas. It felt like all of the protests, the killings of police and of young black men, and the riots had led to this moment of bald-faced confrontation. \"We are at a place of truth-telling in our history,\" Frank Leon Roberts, a professor at New York University who focuses on contemporary American social movements, said. We're at a point in history where cameras have forced a conversation about structural racism. \"We're at a place where it's no longer possible to pretend it's not happening,\" Roberts said. Pedestrians stopped. Some of them shook their heads. Crawford paced back and forth, playing a game with police officers. Crawford, joined by his daughter, speaks out against the shooting of 12 year-old Tamir Rice near the site of the Republican National Convention in downtown Cleveland.\n                \n                    \n                    Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"Which one of you is a pig?\" he asked. He pointed at one of the officers, looked him in the eyes and said, \"You're not a pig.\" He pointed at another officer. \"You're a pig,\" Crawford said. The officers were silent, their hands on their waists or folded in front of them. They looked straight ahead, no reaction apparent on their faces. Crawford stood there for seconds but it felt like an eternity, like that moment you hold your breath as a car spins out of control, and then finally exhale. \"We are missing the real issue in this world, in these United States,\" Crawford said. \"Murdering a 12-year-old child by a police officer and everybody just living a normal life accepting it means that every human being in the United States should take a real good look at themselves, because they are not who they think they are. How can you sit back? How can you live your life ... watching a 12-year-old child being murdered by the cops ...?\" Crawford finally lowered his gaze and he moved along, his little girl following behind him with her toy gun in hand. *** Later that day, a protest group took to the streets of Cleveland to denounce police. \"Indict, convict, send those killer cops to jail!\" they chanted as they walked up Euclid Avenue. Just a few blocks away from where Crawford confronted police, a Donald Trump supporter wearing a \"Blue Lives Matter\" button screamed at the protesters as they passed by. He would only give his name as Paul and say he was from Berea, just outside Cleveland, because he said he was afraid that someone might want to hurt him. He said he was angry at how little respect the protesters showed for police. No, he said, he did not believe that African-Americans were the victims of systemic racism. \"These people's rap sheets are so long and you want us, the smart America, to buy this crap?\" he said. \"That these people didn't deserve to be shot? I would've shot them.\" *** In some ways, the streets were just a more dramatic version of the kind of divide that was evident inside the Cleveland and Philadelphia arenas where the political parties gathered last month. In her speech accepting the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton promised to reform the criminal justice system \"end-to-end,\" while Trump channeled President Nixon, promising to \"restore law and order in our country.\" Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, an African-American studies professor at Princeton who wrote a book putting Black Lives Matter into historical perspective, said Democrats have cultivated a relationship with the movement in order to shore up the African-American vote this November. They haven't offered very many policy specifics, she said, beyond acknowledging that there's a problem with policing in the country. The GOP focus on law and order, on the other hand, she said, was \"a direct rebuke of the thousands of people who have been on the streets demanding that the police be reined in.\" Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who came into the convention having said that the real danger to young black children is other black kids, thanked police. Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke salutes the crowd before delivering a speech on the first day of the Republican National Convention.\n                \n                    \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"When they come to save your life, they don't ask if you are black or white, they just come to save you,\" Giuliani said to huge applause. Perhaps the most striking surrogate on the issue for Trump, however, was Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, who blasted the Black Lives Matter movement, saying their actions \"transcend peaceful protest\" and bleed into \"anarchy.\" Clarke began his speech by remembering the police officers who were killed in Dallas and Baton Rouge and also said there was \"good news\" out of Baltimore, where one of the officers charged in the death of Freddie Gray was acquitted. Mothers of the Movement (from left) Maria Hamilton, Annette Nance-Holt, Gwen Carr, Geneva Reed-Veal, Lucia McBath, Sybrina Fulton, Cleopatra Pendleton-Cowley, Wanda Johnson and Lezley McSpadden.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Democratic National Convention featured the Mothers of the Movement \u2014 a group of mothers whose children had been killed in high-profile incidents, many of them involving police. Geneva Reed-Veal was one of them. She's the mother of Sandra Bland, a young black woman who was found hanged in her jail cell after police stopped and detained her following a traffic violation. Reed-Veal was emotional, saying she was on that stage because Clinton is not afraid to \"say our children's name.\" \"She knows that when a young black life is cut short, it's not just a loss,\" she said. \"It's a personal loss. It's a national loss. It's a loss that diminishes all of us.\" Taylor said that the police killings in Dallas and Baton Rouge complicated things for Democrats. \"The DNC was always going to make a concerted effort to reach to certain people in the movement,\" she said. \"I think the events in Dallas and Baton Rouge made it important for the Democratic Party to show that it still is a party that is supportive of police and that also believes in law and order.\" Attempts to strike that balance created some tension. On the final night of the Democratic convention, Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez came onstage to defend police officers, most of whom, she said, \"are doing the best they can to protect our communities.\" Valdez also called for dialogue and decried the shootings in Dallas and Baton Rouge. \"Violence is not the answer,\" she said. Then she asked for a moment of silence. As it came to an end and before Valdez introduced the families of fallen officers, two people in the crowd screamed, \"Black lives matter!\" Samaria Rice, mother of Tamir Rice, who was killed by a policeman at the local community center.\n                \n                    \n                    Gabriella Demczuk for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Samaria Rice, mother of Tamir Rice, who was killed by a policeman at the local community center. *** In Cleveland, the killing of Tamir Rice still casts a shadow on the relationship between the community and the police. At the recreation center where Tamir was killed, a memorial remains. Teddy bears and artificial flowers crowd the little gazebo that became emblematic of the shooting. On that cold, fall day, Tamir was playing with a replica gun when someone called police. Seconds after arriving and just as he stepped out of his police cruiser, Officer Timothy Loehmann opened fire. A grand jury declined to bring charges and Tamir's case became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. A memorial is set up at the gazebo at Cudell Recreation Center in Cleveland, where Tamir Rice was killed.\n                \n                    \n                    Gabriella Demczuk for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Tamir's mother, Samaria Rice, has become an outspoken critic of both political parties. Tamir's death, she said, changed her deeply. She's a woman with a criminal record and, as she puts it, has had many interactions with police. \"I haven't had one of those racist cops. I have never experienced it,\" she said. \"I thought they were here to help us at the end of the day and it's just like my eyes were covered until my son got murdered.\" Rice said that she's still trying to come to terms with what happened. She doesn't understand why Officer Loehmann was not charged and she doesn't understand why black men continue to be killed by police. In the weeks leading up the RNC, Alton Sterling, who was selling CDs outside a convenience store, was killed by police in Louisiana and Philando Castile was killed by police during a traffic stop in Minnesota. Rice said she doesn't understand why the country has retreated to ideological corners \u2014 black lives vs. blue lives. To Rice, that's just a symbol of a country in turmoil, a country in desperate need of a reckoning, but with a political class unwilling to help it. \"People are living in fear and the police is living in fear, too,\" Rice said. \"I think America should have an open dialogue, because it's not gonna get any better. If they don't [the country] is going to crash. It's going to crumble right before our eyes.\"",

An estimated 50,000 people are expected in Cleveland, including hundreds of protesters and members of the media. In a year when the topic seems virtually unavoidable, race has been a major focus of coverage of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. There was the MSNBC panel Monday evening in which Iowa Rep. Steve King questioned whether nonwhites have made any contributions to civilization. There was the speech in which Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke Jr., who is black, shouted \"Blue lives matter!\" and equated the Black Lives Matter movement with anarchy. There was the viral hashtag #FamousMelaniaTrumpQuotes, inspired by accusations of plagiarism directed at the Republican presidential nominee's wife, whose speech included notable similarities to remarks Michelle Obama gave in 2008. Satirists using the hashtag had Melania Trump saying things like, \"I have a dream!\" and \"Say it loud! I'm black and I'm proud!\" drawing attention to the fact that a white woman was being accused of stealing from a black woman. (On Wednesday, Trump Organization employee Meredith McIver took responsibility for the remarks, saying Melania Trump \"always liked\" Michelle Obama and, while preparing her speech, had read passages from the 2008 speech to McIver, who says she wrote them down and later included them in Mrs. Trump's speech.) All this as the Republican Party faces scrutiny over diversity \u2014 or lack of it \u2014 in its ranks. The party sent fewer black delegates to this convention than at any point in the past century, according to The Washington Post: 18 black folks out of 2,472 total delegates. Here's more from the Post: \"This year's gathering will almost certainly rank among the bottom tier. The 2008 convention had the second-lowest density of black delegates, excluding 2016, trumped only by the 1964 convening that nominated Barry Goldwater. That was the year after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, one of the precipitating events that moves black Americans firmly into the Democratic camp. \"A poll from Quinnipiac University earlier this month showed Trump earning 1 percent of the black vote nationally. NBC News/Wall Street Journal polling in Ohio and Pennsylvania had worse news: In those states, Trump's share of the black vote was at zero.\" The New York Times reported on a sense of fatigue expressed by some black Republicans at the convention. Day One, the article notes, was seen by some as a \"white national convention lecturing African-Americans about the police and race relations.\"  \"Mike Hill, a black Republican state representative in Florida, grew steadily more disheartened as he watched television clips of his party's overwhelmingly white national convention lecturing African-Americans about the police and race relations.  \"There was Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, nearly shouting Monday night that the police only wanted to help people, regardless of race. A sea of white convention delegates, cheering wildly as two black speakers ridiculed the Black Lives Matter movement and unconditionally praised law enforcement officers. And a series of speakers pushing Donald J. Trump's law-and-order message and arguing, as he has, that the United States had lost its way.  \" 'When a lot of white Republicans get together and bring up race, even telling black people how they should see police and the world, it evokes the worst kind of emotion,' said Mr. Hill, who supports Mr. Trump but decided to skip the convention. 'We have so few black Republicans to begin with. Talking about race won't bring us more.' \" This fatigue was mirrored in a \"letter of concern\" that minority Republicans wrote in response to the overwhelming whiteness of the convention. The letter, addressed to RNC Chairperson Reince Priebus, calls attention to \"deficits\" in the party's outreach to more diverse communities, and problems those deficits could create for the party. Here's part of the letter: \"This deficit allows the perception of a willful or often intentional low-prioritization of multicultural inclusion within the Republican Party structure. \"We have watched in dismay as the presumptive nominee of our Party, the Party of Abraham Lincoln, has caused massive defection, disgust, and disinterest with comments and behaviors that are offensive to the very demographics we need to win this election. \"The unfortunate reality of the points expressed above is more readily and recently evidenced by the unexplained exodus of Black and Hispanic staffers at the RNC headquarters.\" At Fusion, Collier Meyerson wrote about Melania Trump's speech, saying this \"apparent plagiarism\" shouldn't be written off as a \"silly mistake,\" and that it's important to consider the context in which Michelle Obama's similar words and phrases were originally delivered: \"The words were not only an insight into the Obama couple's shared values, but a way to make their skin color more palatable to skeptical white voters. Michelle drew on themes that are, unfortunately, not often associated with black America by white America: that being honest is paramount, that working hard is a must, and that she and her husband take serious stock in the American dream \u2014 a dream that has largely excluded black Americans. They were important words for a black woman, specifically, to say on national television.\" It's worth noting that people of color have taken a stage at the RNC. There was also Sajid Tarar, a Pakistani Muslim immigrant who led a prayer for Donald Trump at the close of the second day. In an interview with Fusion, Tarar explains his rationale behind supporting Trump: \"In American politics, we like to use identity as shorthand: It's easy to conceptualize the 'Muslim vote' as a monolithic bloc. But as Tarar makes clear, voters are far more complicated than any single identity. He's Muslim, but he's also conservative and pissed off at the establishment and worried about terrorism. \" 'This is my country and this is my kids' country. That is my number one priority, the safety of America,' Tarar said. 'Donald Trump agrees with that.' \" On Day Two of the convention, Harmeet Dhillon, a Sikh American woman who formerly chaired the Republican Party of San Francisco, opened the convention day with a Sikh prayer. Her head was covered with a scarf, and she sang the invocation in Punjabi before translating it into English as white audience members bowed their heads. Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke Jr., a black Democrat, also addressed the mostly white crowd at the convention, saying in his speech that race is a \"heated issue\" in the United States. He talked about the shooting deaths of three police officers in Baton Rouge and the acquittal of an officer charged in the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore, which he called \"good news.\" \"What we witnessed in Ferguson, in Baltimore and Baton Rouge was a collapse of the social order,\" said Clarke in his speech. \"So many of the actions of the Occupy Movement and Black Lives Matter transcends peaceful protest and violates the code of conduct we rely on. I call it anarchy.\" The Washington Post's Janell Ross wrote about why someone like Clarke \u2014 again, technically a Democrat \u2014 might get invited to speak at the RNC. He was appointed to his current position by the then-governor of Wisconsin, a Republican. Part of what made Clarke a \"kind of Milwaukee attraction,\" Ross writes, was a sense that he was \"one of those elected officials able to draw large crowds, appeal to people across party lines and say things that no white politician, certainly no white Republican would without some kind of blowback in the very politically blue, nearly 1/3 black Milwaukee area.\" Ross talked with political scientist Juliet Hooker about this, and here's some of what Hooker had to say: \"The appeal of a black conservative like Clarke is that their views disrupt what I call racialized solidarity ... (i.e. that blacks and whites tend to have different views of the same events, as has been largely true of Black Lives Matter even with all the videos showing police escalation, culpability, etc.). \"This allows the critique of BLM [Black Lives Matter] to become an issue that Republicans can say is about ideology, not racism. Clarke himself does this when he talks about liberals not being willing to call them a hate group, etc. \"This narrative also fits in with the Republican base's feeling that racism against whites is a problem that is not being acknowledged and that is stronger than anti-black racism.\" Meanwhile, Iowa Rep. Steve King's remarks on the MSNBC panel \u2014 \"I'd ask you to go back through history and figure out where are these contributions that have been made by these other categories of people that you're talking about. Where did any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization?\" \u2014 inspired the hashtag #LessRacistThanSteveKing. Quartz responded cheekily to King's remarks with a post titled \"Dear Steve King: Here are some things not invented by white people.\" The list includes everything from mathematics and the seismograph to Pokemon and irrigation, and concludes with this statement: \"By defending white people's contributions to civilization, King is only carrying out one of their most longstanding ones \u2014 discounting the contributions of everyone else.\" On Wednesday, King offered further comment on his earlier remarks to Politico, saying he felt one of his co-panelists was \"disparaging a group of people\" in saying the Republican Party won't be led by \"old white people\" in the future. \"If you're sitting here as a seated member of Congress on a national television show and asked to swallow something like that and curl up, again, no other group of people would take that,\" King said. He also elaborated on his remarks about history: \"Offering a further explanation, King said he pointed out 'that Western civilization is the most successful civilization the world has ever seen,' and the foundation of the United States' 'ideological thought is rooted in the Enlightenment in Europe, and then this country was born at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, with that thought process and that coming over here to this country, like a giant Petri dish that was created for America to burst up onto the scene in the world. And we did a lot with that ... \" 'The sum total that's been contributed by Western civilization, it surpasses any other culture or civilization, partly because we borrowed from them along the way, and we're flexible enough to do that. And so I don't think we should apologize for our success. And the idea of multiculturalism, in that every culture is equal \u2014 that's not objectively true. And we've been fed that information for the last 25 years in this country, and we're not going to continue to become a greater nation if we don't look at this objectively.' \" This isn't a complete list of race-related happenings at the RNC, and let us remind you that this is just the beginning of convention season. We still have a long way to go, and the Democratic National Convention hasn't even started yet. With that in mind, we anticipate a sequel to this post in the not-too-distant future.

Bernie Sanders (center) reaches out to supporters after speaking at a get-out-the-vote canvass launch at the City College of San Francisco ahead of last week's California primary.\n                \n                    \n                    Meg Kelly/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Bernie Sanders (center) reaches out to supporters after speaking at a get-out-the-vote canvass launch at the City College of San Francisco ahead of last week's California primary. Three days ahead of California's Democratic presidential primary, Bernie Sanders made several appearances in Southern California before headlining a rally in San Diego. There was a Sunday morning walk through a farmers market in Downtown Los Angeles. There was a walk through West Hollywood, LA's gayborhood, with a pre-drag brunch address to diners at a hamburger joint on Santa Monica Boulevard. That was followed by a stroll through Santa Monica Pier, where the candidate rode a merry-go-round and even interrupted an outdoor spin class fundraiser to give an impromptu stump speech. And there was a stop at Plaza Mexico, an outdoor market that caters to a primarily Latino audience in Lynwood, a bit south of LA. Once Sanders arrived, with traveling press in tow, he walked through the crowded mall, which happened to be hosting a music festival that day. After shaking hands and hugging fans, Sanders tried to take the main stage of the festival. As he and his entourage approached the side of the stage, he was denied by several of the event staff. There were vigorous head shakes of disagreement and, as a female event staffer pulled a barricade closer to keep Sanders and his crew out, she said, angrily, \"This is our event.\" Passers-by pushed through and ran to the crowds that gathered as Bernie Sanders made unplanned stops across San Francisco.\n                \n                    \n                    Meg Kelly/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sanders staffers walked away from the exchange flustered, some muttering profanities. Sanders himself seemed befuddled. It was the exact opposite of the reception he received earlier in the day when he took over the stage at that outdoor spin fundraiser, stumping in front of stationary bikes and large images of the black and brown inner-city youth the event was raising money for. Sanders' experience in Southern California offers glimpses into everything that went right \u2014 and wrong \u2014 for his campaign. In more ways than one, at Lynwood and in Santa Monica and all throughout the primary season, Sanders was a party crasher. Sometimes that worked out for him. And sometimes it did not. At each stop on Sanders' scheduled tour of the San Francisco Bay Area, he was greeted with excitement, intense interest and rousing support from crowds.\n                \n                    \n                    Meg Kelly/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Love and anger This week marked the final presidential nominating contest for the Democratic Party, in Washington, D.C. Bernie Sanders lost. And he isn't throwing in the towel just yet, he says. But Sanders also says he can do \"arithmetic.\" And that math shows he did not get enough votes or delegates to be the Democratic nominee. (He trails Clinton by millions in the Democratic popular vote, and hundreds in party's delegate count, with or without superdelegates.) Hillary Clinton was declared the \"presumptive nominee\" last week, and she is now campaigning as one would expect a presumptive party nominee to campaign, complete with the endorsement of a sitting president. It'd be fair to say that the only thing keeping Bernie Sanders' campaign alive is that he hasn't yet said it is dead. Sanders met with Clinton on Tuesday night for what both campaigns called a \"positive discussion,\" but did not drop out. He has said he will do everything he can to defeat Donald Trump \u2014 even if Sanders is not the nominee. And he will address his supporters Thursday evening, online, in a live stream. His plans for the future aren't yet clear, but looking back, Sanders' insurgent campaign accomplished more than anyone could have expected \u2014 even the senator himself. From the way he fundamentally changed how presidential campaigns can raise money, with the millions he raked in from small donations from supporters, often averaging $27 (as he repeatedly proclaimed on the stump), to his introduction of many of the ideas of Democratic socialism into the mainstream. In many ways, his successes seemed to come out of nowhere. Sanders had been a senator from Vermont for decades, with low name recognition and single-digit showings in early presidential polls. And he wasn't even a Democrat. It would be easy to see the Sanders campaign as something that just happened. But, in fact, he was part of a concerted effort, the outgrowth of a social movement that began a few years back in Zuccotti Park in New York. The Sanders campaign has direct links to the Occupy Wall Street movement. Sanders supporters Genei Baker (left) and Palmer Lamb (right) both came dressed to inspire and impress for Sanders' last rally before the California primary.\n                \n                    \n                    Meg Kelly/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Winnie Wong, founder of the online group People for Bernie, is one of the former Occupy Wall Street activists who helped draft Bernie Sanders to run. And she said Sanders actually wasn't the first senator activists approached. \"We started the Draft [Elizabeth] Warren effort first,\" she told NPR. \"Ready for Warren came out of Occupy. And People for Bernie came out of Ready for Warren.\" Wong is not shy about identifying Sanders and his candidacy as a tool to get Occupy Wall Street ideals into the mainstream. \"It was always a tactic,\" she said at a Sanders rally in San Francisco. \"In every way, at every step of the way.\" But if Sanders was in some ways an outgrowth of Occupy, his reach quickly expanded beyond that movement's confines. It would have been hard to predict that from the beginning, though. Sanders' press conference announcing his run in April of last year had little in common with the rock concert-like rallies he's become known for this campaign. That April announcement was small, organized on a lawn outside the U.S. Capitol, with Sanders seemingly startled by the microphone itself, urging reporters to keep it quick because he had to get back to his day job as a senator.

In fact, many of Sanders' campaign staff had day jobs as well; early on, a lot of them worked for the campaign for free, after they finished those. But within months, Sanders had made a movement. Tapping into a new wave of progressive populism, first hinted at during the Occupy movement, Sanders' self-described \"political revolution to transform our country economically, political, socially and environmentally\" quickly became a force. By February, Sanders' razor-thin finish with Clinton in the Iowa caucuses (he lost by only 0.3 percentage points), it became official: The Sanders campaign was now no longer outsider, but insurgent. Secret service agents guarded Sanders' podium at his Los Angeles rally after he lost the California primary June 7.\n                \n                    \n                    Meg Kelly/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Secret service agents guarded Sanders' podium at his Los Angeles rally after he lost the California primary June 7. Sanders rallies grew larger and took on their own feel \u2014 part concert, part picnic, part love fest. Sanders' fans danced freely before his rallies began. Mothers breast-fed their young children in the aisles. Tie-died shirts could be spotted throughout the crowds. Sanders himself seemed like a kind, loving grandfather to many of his supporters. Famously, at one Sanders rally in Portland, Ore. (because Portland), a bird landed on the candidate's lectern. In many ways, the Sanders campaign was a love revolution, with a message of unity, diversity and prosperity for all. But under the surface, the Sanders movement was just as much an exercise in anger. Over time, another side of the Sanders phenomenon began to reveal itself: a palpable disgust not just for Sanders' opponent, Clinton, but for the party she is a part of, the media that covered her and a system that many Sanders supporters thought was rigged. Heavy police and Secret Service presence surrounded Sanders as he made unplanned stops in neighborhoods across San Francisco on June 6.\n                \n                    \n                    Meg Kelly/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption One big \"rigged\" conspiracy The night of California's presidential primary, Sanders held a rally in an airplane hangar at the Santa Monica airport. The tall and wide half-circle roof made for a dramatic scene as thousands of supporters poured into the space to support their candidate, even as his chances at winning the Democratic nomination were all but zero. Beneath the sweeping metal roof, while a man dressed as Jesus holding a Sanders sign paced the room, the anger that had been building in Sanders' supporters for months was on full display. When a big screen at the rally showed Hillary Clinton leading in the California race, the crowd chanted \"Bullshit!\" over and over again until the image on the screen changed. The crowd also chanted things like \"CNN sucks!\" When Clinton's name was mentioned in Sanders' speech, the crowd booed. Many in attendance cornered reporters to share disgust with their coverage of the election, particularly reporting on the Associated Press' announcement the night before that Clinton had secured the support of enough superdelegates, or unpledged party leaders and elected officials, to put Clinton over the top to become the party's presumptive nominee. A lone supporter lingered in the stands after Sanders' primary-night rally on June 7.\n                \n                    \n                    Meg Kelly/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption A lone supporter lingered in the stands after Sanders' primary-night rally on June 7. Many of Sanders' supporters didn't believe he lost fair and square. (Sanders himself still hasn't said he has. The day President Obama endorsed Clinton \u2014 and told Sanders in the Oval Office that he was about to do so \u2014 Sanders pointed to ballots still out in California. On Tuesday, after a statement about the Orlando massacre, Sanders talked about long lines in Arizona.) Instead, Sanders supporters, in the crowd in Santa Monica that night and elsewhere, called the delegate count itself a conspiracy. A day earlier, Sanders surrogate Nina Turner (a former Ohio state senator) suggested the AP call, coming the night before California voted, was intended to suppress voter turnout there. Dutch Merrick was in the crowd that Tuesday night. He said he was hopeful that Sanders would take his fight to the Democratic convention, and \"demand an actual count of the actual votes.\" He felt the Democratic Party establishment had decided Clinton would be the nominee months ago, before the primary election was complete. \"It's a fait accompli. ... That message had not changed in a year,\" he said, holding a Sanders poster. \"All the coverage went to one woman candidate: Hillary.\" For Merrick, the entire system was rigged in Clinton's favor. He pointed to voting irregularities in several states over the past few months, long lines at polling places in Arizona, and names disappearing from voter lists in places like New York. \"She [Clinton] just puts a friendly face on fascism,\" Merrick continued. \"I was excited, eight years ago, to vote for an African-American for president. But it essentially put someone that pushed the same agenda, kept the same Defense Department, the same CIA, the same Wall Street policies, with a black face. It didn't do us any good. So now we're going to get a female face on the same policies. Not going to do us any good.\" He concluded, \"I would probably vote for Trump, to burst the bubble, to finally pop the zit.\" Sanders' call to a revolution has been answered at recent rallies with gestures of anger toward the status quo and distrust of the Democratic Party's primary process.\n                \n                    \n                    Meg Kelly/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sigma Scott, who was at the rally with Merrick, said, \"If she takes it [the nomination] by petty theft, or grand theft, I would rally and vote that she's impeached.\" That mood seemed to be present at Sanders events all throughout California in the lead-up to the primary in these waning days of the campaign. It wasn't just that Bernie Sanders was the truth and the light to these super supporters \u2014 it's that in their eyes, Hillary Clinton was the lie and the darkness. An empty chair left behind after Sanders' final rally in San Francisco.\n                \n                    \n                    Meg Kelly/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption An empty chair left behind after Sanders' final rally in San Francisco. Clinton wasn't just an opponent to many Sanders supporters; she was a cheater, perhaps even a criminal. The Democratic Party wasn't just a political party; it was an apparatus focused solely on doing whatever it took to grant Clinton the nomination. And whatever math would justify her win was fraudulent, because the system itself was an undemocratic sham. At a San Francisco rally for Sanders the previous day, Sanders supporter Aaron Selverston seemed to crystallize the emotions of many who felt alienated by the Democratic Party and the primary process. \"I think the whole argument about the [delegate] math is irrelevant to most Bernie supporters,\" he said, as Dave Matthews played in San Francisco's Crissy Field before Sanders took to the mic. \"Because it's not about some sort of allegiance to a party. The party has failed. The party has failed half of the people who typically vote Democratic. And those are the people who are supporting Bernie.\" Despite Sanders' ability to connect with younger voters of color and gestures of support to the Black Lives Matter movement, his campaign has struggled to gain support from older minority voters.\n                \n                    \n                    Meg Kelly/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mistakes were made Though much of the anger some Sanders supporters show is directed at the media or Clinton or Trump, some of the blame for Sanders' failing to reach the nomination is his own. From the start, Sanders said he would run a positive campaign, on the issues, refusing to directly attack his primary opponent, Clinton. He famously declared at one Democratic presidential debate, \"The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails,\" when asked about Clinton's use of a private server during her time as secretary of state. The emails have been a constant line of attack for Republicans against Clinton, but Sanders refused to hit her on the issue, even as staffers urged Sanders to find some line of attack on her. Over time, Sanders did attack, particularly on paid speeches she gave to Wall Street executives after her time as secretary of state, repeating in stump speeches, \"I kind of think if you get paid a couple hundred thousand dollars for a speech, it must be a great speech. I think we should release it and let the American people see what the transcript was.\" \"Jesus,\" a regular at Sanders rallies, poses with supporters after Sanders' loss in the California primary.\n                \n                    \n                    Meg Kelly/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption By the time that message stuck, though, Clinton's lead had become all but insurmountable. Another sore spot for his campaign, that would perhaps inflict even more damage, was an inability to connect with large numbers of minority voters. In several nominating contests throughout the primary season, Sanders did win a majority of black and Latino primary and caucus voters ages 35 and under. But in South Carolina's primary, after strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, Sanders lost the black vote by almost 70 percent, even admitting himself, \"We got decimated.\" At a Seattle rally last year, Sanders was forced from the stage by two Black Lives Matters protesters; he had to end his own event without finishing his stump speech. For many minority voters, Sanders' message on income inequality failed to connect the dots between wealth disparity and institutional racism, and many people of color felt that white Sanders supporters were too eager to dismiss them as low-information when they did not support the Vermont senator. Sanders responded. He hired minority staff in key positions, namely hiring Symone Sanders, a BLM activist, as his national press secretary soon after the Seattle incident. Sanders' campaign recruited surrogates of color as well, like the rapper Killer Mike and actress Rosario Dawson. And he had no shortage of key celebrity endorsements from the likes of Danny Glover and Spike Lee. But it wasn't enough. Sanders' coalition of liberals, working-class whites, and young voters of all colors couldn't shake Clinton's lead with women and older minority voters. Sanders' campaign also did not focus on the sweep of Super Tuesday states on March 1. That's when Clinton put real separation between herself and Sanders. His campaign was often outmatched by Clinton's superior ground game, with its infrastructure seemingly never dismantled after her 2008 Democratic primary loss, and bolstered, even, by remnants of the Obama political machine. As time went on, Clinton racked up an increasingly bigger lead, one that Sanders would never be able to overcome, even as he regularly out-fundraised his Democratic opponent and his rallies filled stadiums throughout the country. Maybe there's nothing Sanders could have done to overcome the Clinton machine on the ground. But University of Vermont professor Huck Gutman, a close friend of Sanders and his former chief of staff, seemed to predict the problems Sanders would have with minority voters in an interview with NPR soon after Sanders launched his presidential campaign. \"One of the differences between Bernie and so many other people who are liberals,\" Gutman said, \"is that Bernie's central concern has always been with the condition of what he calls working-class families. He is consumed by the need for economic justice.\" Even as Gutman pointed out Sanders' track record of support for other progressive causes, he said of Sanders, \"His central concerns have never been war or civil rights or gay rights or women's rights.\" Sanders' supporters, including Winnie Wong (bottom right), founder of the online group People for Bernie, celebrated as though they had won even after significant losses in the June 7 primaries, which had been touted as critical to the campaign.\n                \n                    \n                    Meg Kelly/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"The very idea that something has failed, it's not a part of our language\" The day of the California primary, after the AP had declared Clinton the presumptive nominee, it was really hard to find anyone saying Sanders actually lost the race \u2014 or would lose it soon. You didn't hear it as Sanders block-walked and greeted thousands on Hollywood Boulevard and at coffee shops and the farmers market in Silver Lake in Los Angeles. You didn't see it when the senator was on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, greeting fans and celebrity impersonators alike. You didn't hear it in his speech that night, or even later in the week, after President Obama endorsed Clinton. Sanders campaigned that day, and in many of the days before and after, like a winner. And if you just saw those scenes from the trail in California, and not the news, you could have been convinced that Sanders had actually won the whole thing. And perhaps that is the lingering juxtaposition of the Sanders campaign. Numerically, he has lost. Sanders will not be his party's nominee. But in so many ways, he has won, just by surviving this long. And not just surviving, but at many points thriving and influencing a movement that could have a very long tail. \"One of the great successes of this campaign is that Bernie Sanders has really electrified a whole new generation of young people to become engaged in the political process,\" Winnie Wong said. \"And they're young, and they're not apathetic, and they're energetic, and they're smart.\" After the crowds disperse from Sanders' large-scale rallies, their scope and scale becomes all the more visible.\n                \n                    \n                    Meg Kelly/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Wong contends that Sanders fundamentally changed America's political conversation, making a movement like Occupy, and an ideology like Democratic socialism, mainstream. \"Prior to Bernie Sanders, nobody ever dared utter the word socialism,\" she said. \"Forget about the 10 million who cast their vote for a Democratic socialist. Think about the many more millions, across this country, who are talking about it, probably right now. That's even more important.\" If you look at Sanders' campaign as part of a larger progressive, populist movement that had been building for years \u2014 from Zuccotti Park to Burlington, Vt., and almost to the White House \u2014 all of a sudden it makes more sense. And it also feels, in many ways, not finished just yet. \"People in social movements don't really see an end to their work,\" Wong said. \"The very idea that something has failed, it's not a part of our language.\" Getting real Sanders enters a vehicle in his motorcade, disappearing behind the sea of supporters still standing on the street.\n                \n                    \n                    Meg Kelly/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption After being rejected from the stage at Plaza Mexico in Lynwood, Calif., that Sunday before the state primary, Sanders walked into a Mexican restaurant at the mall and enjoyed a meal with his family. A mariachi band played and, at one point, Sanders danced with one of his grandchildren. The embarrassment of the moments before seemed to have been forgotten; the candidate was having a good time. And when he left the mall, a large crowd was waiting to greet him. Regardless of what happened at the stage, he was able to interact, positively, with hundreds of potential voters. But already, tweets and videos recounting the details of Sanders being blocked from the stage were circulating on social media, with many using the moment to mock Sanders and critique his record of outreach to Latino communities. Traveling press asked for comment on the incident, and soon spokesman Michael Briggs told a Washington Post reporter that, in fact, Sanders hadn't been denied a microphone in Lynwood, contradicting multiple eyewitness reports. Briggs told a Washington Post reporter that another supervisor at the event had come to offer Sanders a place on the stage and \"to say Bernie was welcome.\" But, Briggs said, it was, in fact, the Sanders campaign that denied the festival organizers. \"By that point,\" he said, \"we had moved on.\" It was a moment that, in several ways, could symbolize Sanders' entire campaign \u2014 a victory and a defeat, all at the same time. And, in spite of it all, a dogged determination to keep pressing ahead \u2014 and to seemingly never, ever admit you've lost.",

This election year, both the Democrats and the Republicans may be pushed into increasing the government's role.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: I'm David Greene in Bozeman Mont. And Steve, there's a large audience here who wants to say hello to you. (APPLAUSE) STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Hey, good morning. GREENE: You know, this state, Steve, I've realized this week, a good place to explore a really big American issue. And that is the debate over the role of government. INSKEEP: Which is a big divide in national politics, whether the government should do more or less in American life. This goes back to the founding fathers. Alexander Hamilton wanted more. Thomas Jefferson wanted less - or at least, Jefferson did until he was president and found he wanted to do more. In the 2016 presidential campaign, we could argue that both political parties are being pulled toward more. NPR's Ron Elving is here in Washington. Ron, how are both parties going that way? RON ELVING, BYLINE: You know, I'm not sure that either party would want to advocate for greater size in the federal government. But they're all talking about a more powerful government, a little bit like what you just said about Thomas Jefferson. They want a government that's, you know, able to deliver on the promises that they've all made and on a grand scale. Trump sees a very powerful government as a tool to change the world, you know, deporting 11 million people, building a 2,000-mile wall. Sanders sees an equally big increase in government programs and commitments. And Hillary Clinton's been getting pulled a lot closer to Bernie Sanders' agenda. INSKEEP: Well, how different is that from where the parties were? ELVING: You know, the parties were quite different over a long period of time. You know, Ronald Reagan was saying that big government wasn't the solution; it was the problem. And Bill Clinton said, the era of big government is over. But since then, in the last 15, 16 years, we've seen the return, if you will, of big government with two major wars. And we've seen a stimulus package. We've seen the bailout of Wall Street and the bailout of auto industry. We've really started to going back in the other direction. GREENE: Ron, it's David here in Montana. And I wonder if you could think about how this region really fits into the national picture you're describing. ELVING: Well, everyone in the rural West knows the initials BLM. That's Bureau of Land Management. GREENE: Yes. Heard it a lot here this week. ELVING: It's the largest of five federal agencies that administer 640 million acres of land in the United States and that includes 27 million acres in Montana alone. That's about 30 percent of the whole state. And that's a stewardship that's supposed to preserve these lands for everyone and for posterity. But the Montana folks, and people in the rural West in general, see these lands as theirs, at least in some sense. And they don't like the notion of themselves as either tenants or people making use of something that's not theirs. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

He said the bill lowered the country's crime rate, which benefited African-Americans, achieved bipartisan support, and diversified the police force. He then addressed a protester's sign, saying: \"I don't know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out onto the street to murder other African-American children,\" Clinton said, addressing a protester who appeared to interrupt him repeatedly. \"Maybe you thought they were good citizens .... You are defending the people who kill the lives you say matter. Tell the truth. You are defending the people who cause young people to go out and take guns.\" The Clintons have faced criticism from BLM activists and younger black voters for months now over that bill, which they say put an unfairly high number of black Americans in prison for nonviolent offenses. After a protester interrupted him repeatedly, Bill Clinton began to take on that critique directly, making the claim that his crime bill was being given a bad rap. \"Here's what happened,\" Clinton said. \"Let's just tell the whole story.\" \"I had an assault weapons ban in it [the crime bill]. I had money for inner-city kids, for out of school activities. We had 110,000 police officers so we could keep people on the street, not in these military vehicles, and the police would look like the people they were policing. We did all that. And [Joe] Biden [then senator and chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee] said, you can't pass this bill, the Republicans will kill it, if you don't put more sentencing in it.\" \"I talked to a lot of African-American groups,\" Clinton continued. \"They thought black lives matter. They said take this bill, because our kids are being shot in the street by gangs. We have 13-year-old kids planning their own funerals.\" Throughout the spirited defense of his policy, Clinton continued to be interrupted, and he repeatedly seemed to single out one protester. \"She doesn't wanna hear any of that,\" Clinton said to the protester. \"You know what else she doesn't want to hear? Because of that bill, we have a 25-year low in crime, a 33-year low in murder rate. And because of that and the background check law, we had a 46-year low in the deaths of people by gun violence, and who do you think those lives were? That mattered? Whose lives were saved that mattered?\" For several minutes, the discussion of the crime bill, Clinton's exchange with the protester and the crowd's attempts to yell and chant over her were missing one thing: any mention of Hillary Clinton, the one Clinton running for president this election cycle. Bill Clinton did finally address her. \"Hillary didn't vote for that bill, because she wasn't in the Senate,\" Clinton said. \"She was spending her time trying to get health care for poor kids [referencing her advocacy for the Children's Health Insurance Program]. Who were they? And their lives mattered. And her opponent [Bernie Sanders] did vote for it. But I don't blame him either ... There were enough Republicans in the Senate to kill this bill, and nobody wanted it to die. That's what happened.\" \"But she [Hillary Clinton] was the first candidate, the first one to say let's get these people who did nonviolent offenses out of prison,\" Clinton continued. \"And guess what? A lot of Republicans agreed. They know they made a mistake.\" Clinton went on to further defend his administration, referencing the financial crisis: \"It reminds me of when the Republicans try to blame me for the financial meltdown.\" He turned back to his wife and said: \"This election is about the future. They're trying to blame her for something she didn't do. So I'll tell you another story about a place where Black Lives Matter? Africa.\" The former president went on to speak of his wife's work fighting AIDS in Africa while secretary of state. Late Thursday night, NPR spoke with Philadelphia resident Erica Mines, one of the protesters at the Bill Clinton event. \"I'm not mad at Bill Clinton,\" Mines said. \"I'm not mad at him as a person, he's a human being. But his politics are very wrong.\" She said of her actions yesterday, \"I don't necessarily like the term protest, because that's not what we planned to do,\" Mines said. \"We did plan to express ourselves freely.\" Mines said after Hillary Clinton supporters in the crowd began interacting with her the situation became tense and words were exchanged, leading to the escalation captured on camera. Mines said in the moment she was not focused on Clinton's responses to her, but after the event she read up on exactly what he said. Still, Mines says her mind was not changed. \"I still feel the same way about Bill Clinton... He completely beat around the bush.\" She continued, \"Whatever policies and platform that she's [Hillary Clinton] running on now, [Bill] Clinton is definitely a part of that.\" \"Bill Clinton is a politician,\" Mines continued. \"He did his job, which was to counteract anyone who wants to talk to him or point out the truth about exactly what he did to affect our community.\"",

In this 2015 photo are Brad Steinle, Liz Sullivan and Jim Steinle, her brother, mother and father.\n                \n                    \n                    Eric Risberg/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption The family of Kate Steinle is suing San Francisco and two federal agencies over her killing last year. In this 2015 photo are Brad Steinle, Liz Sullivan and Jim Steinle, her brother, mother and father. The family of Kate Steinle, the 32-year-old woman who was killed in San Francisco last year allegedly by a man in the U.S. illegally, has filed a federal wrongful death lawsuit against the city and two federal agencies, blaming them for her death. The lawsuit was filed just before the anniversary of Steinle's death. The killing reignited an angry debate over so-called sanctuary city policies, which limit local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The suit alleges that then-San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi had eliminated all communications between his staff and agents of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement regarding immigrants in the San Francisco County jail who were in the country illegally. As a result, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a Mexican immigrant felon who had been deported five times, was released from jail despite the fact that ICE had issued a request to be notified of Lopez-Sanchez's release. A few days later, Lopez-Sanchez allegedly killed Steinle as she walked along the San Francisco pier with her father. The suit alleges ICE failed to detain or deport Lopez-Sanchez upon his release. It also blames the Bureau of Land Management; the gun that killed Steinle belonged to a BLM agent who had reported it stolen from his car in San Francisco just a few days before the shooting. Steinle's death prompted calls for the revocation of sanctuary city policies across the country, especially from conservative critics and politicians who demanded that such cities risk losing all federal aid. More than 300 jurisdictions restrict cooperation with federal immigration authorities in the belief that residents in the country illegally are more likely to cooperate with local law enforcement if they don't fear being targeted for deportation. The incident also contributed to the end of Mirkarimi's career as sheriff. He ran for re-election last year and lost to Vicki Hennessy, who pledged that she would expand communications with ICE. This week, the county Board of Supervisors unanimously approved a measure to preserve its sanctuary city policies. But it allows the new sheriff to share information with the feds if a detained immigrant is charged with a felony and was convicted of a serious or violent felony in the past seven years.",

It has been nearly a year since the death of Freddie Gray, the Baltimore man whose death in police custody set off days of street protests that turned violent. Since then, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, the city's mayor, decided against a re-election bid, leaving a vacancy that's drawn more than a dozen Democrat candidates. Among them is DeRay Mckesson, perhaps the most visible member of the Black Lives Matter movement. Since leaving a high-profile education job, Mckesson has amassed hundreds of thousands of loyal Twitter followers attracted to his brand of activism. But, like other BLM activists around the country, Mckesson has had trouble translating his online fame into a foothold in political office, even in a year that's seen success from other outsider candidates across the ideological spectrum. He tells NPR's Michel Martin that, despite his low poll numbers, his foray into politics isn't over. \"We won't undo 400 years of oppression in 400 days,\" he says.
