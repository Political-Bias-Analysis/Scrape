Ron DeSantis waves as he arrives for a news conference on Sept. 7.\n                \n                    \n                    Rebecca Blackwell/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis waves as he arrives for a news conference on Sept. 7. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis took something of a victory lap this weekend for his controversial flight sending migrants to the tony northeastern island of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. \"This is a crisis. It's now getting a little bit more attention,\" DeSantis said in Kansas during a leg of a tour organized by the conservative group Turning Point Action. It's hardly a coincidence that DeSantis' stunt came days before his stops in Kansas and Wisconsin, where he campaigned for Republican candidates. His political ambitions are well known. He has become a conservative darling and a potential heir to the MAGA brand \u2014 a more disciplined version of former President Donald Trump, who continues to heavily suggest he will run again for president in 2024. DeSantis is also up for reelection in Florida this year. And nothing fires up the Republican base quite like immigration. Trump used anti-immigrant rhetoric to vault himself to the top of GOP presidential contention in 2015. \"I think he got out of it what he intended: greater visibility for the issue,\" said Danny Diaz, a Republican strategist who ran former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's 2016 presidential campaign. \"And the reality is for about half the country, they entirely agree.\" DeSantis hinted that this was his goal during his two stops over the weekend. He said that more people are paying attention to the issue now and that it's \"on the ballot.\" Judging by the news coverage his move has received, it worked. There is risk, however, in potentially alienating voters who see the move as unserious in not addressing the core issue and using migrants as political pawns. Migrants, who made the trip, said they felt \"lied to,\" \"deceived\" and \"used for a political purpose.\" \"We didn't think these people would be so cruel, so cold-blooded to do this to us,\" Elid Aguilar, 27, of Venezuela, told the San Antonio Report. The move has echoes of the Reverse Freedom Rides of the 1960s, set up by white supremacists who persuaded poor Black families in the South to board buses to Cape Cod, Massachusetts. A Texas sheriff said Monday night he is opening a criminal investigation into what happened. \"What we understand is a Venezuelan migrant was paid a bird-dog fee to recruit 50 migrants who were then were lured \u2014 and I will use the word 'lured' under false pretenses \u2014 to staying in a hotel for a few days, then taken to an airplane where they were flown to Florida and then Martha's Vineyard under false pretenses of being offered jobs,\" said Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar, a Democrat. \"For what we can gather, a little more than a photo op, a video op, and then they were left there.\" The migrants had been at the Migrant Resource Center in Bexar County, where San Antonio is located. Diaz said he views what DeSantis and other Republican governors are doing in sending migrants to more liberal-leaning states and municipalities as an effort to fire up the base. \"At this juncture, 50 days from an election, with people entrenched on either side and the vast majority of independents having a dim view of the economy and both sides seeking to energize their bases,\" Diaz said, \"this is kind of par for the course on both sides.\" Inflation has been the top concern for voters, according to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. Abortion rights have been the top voting issue for Democrats. Since the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade, reproductive rights have shaken up the electoral landscape and increased Democrats' enthusiasm. Immigration, though, has been the No. 2 issue for Republicans, with more than 1 in 5 identifying it as their top issue. Just 1% of Democrats and 8% of independents said it was theirs. \"We need solutions and not theater,\" Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, said on CBS' Face the Nation on Sunday. \"The migrants are human beings, and we've got to treat them like human beings. They are being used as political pawns to get publicity.\" Immigration has, however, been a simmering issue, particularly in border communities like the district that Cuellar represents in Texas. The U.S. on Monday crossed 2 million migrants arrested this year at the southern border, the most ever. Cuellar thinks more still needs to be done, including publicizing immigration enforcement. \"When was the last time you saw \u2014 you saw a picture or video of people going back?\" he said. \"You only see people coming in. And you've got to have words, along with action to enforce it.\" Others think the Biden administration is getting a bad rap. \"This administration, I believe unfairly, is perceived as lax on border enforcement,\" former Obama Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said on Face the Nation. He noted that the U.S. has been \"sending back over 100,000 people a month\" for the last two years. That comes out to more than 2 million people, he said. Some of this, Johnson argued, is messaging. \"The lesson I learned managing this issue is, you've got to repeat yourself maybe 25 times before anybody will listen to you,\" he said. \"You have to show that we are, in fact, sending people back.\" Conservatives have predictably cheered it. They quite literally did so, giving DeSantis a standing ovation in Kansas when he mentioned it. They see the move as pointing out the liberal hypocrisy of creating \"sanctuary city\" and state statuses in places that are not dealing with the same influx that many border states are seeing. Democrats and progressives point to local communities, state governments and nonprofits scrambling to help the migrants in Martha's Vineyard and in places like the District of Columbia, where Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has also sent busloads of migrants over the past several months. DeSantis made a classic mistake: He gave New England liberals a chance to show how virtuous they are. https://t.co/EFwbLutE43 That's far different from luring people onto a plane with fake brochures and promises of \"sanctuary\" and work in Boston when none had been secured. Almost no one thinks the immigration system in the U.S. isn't broken. Americans do not see either political party as handling the issue perfectly. But the Republican Party has undergone much more of a political evolution in just the last decade. The GOP has come a long way from having a president who pushed for immigration reform to one that used it as a political football. Few, if any, Republicans left in Congress are seriously interested in fixing the immigration system to include a path to legalization for the millions of immigrants in the U.S. illegally. The closest Congress came in recent years was almost a decade ago when, in 2013, 68 senators, including 14 Republicans, voted for an immigration overhaul before conservatives in the House killed it. More recent efforts have failed to progress, particularly with such a narrow Democratic majority in the U.S. Senate. \"We can make the borders safe and have a system of legal entry into the United States to work, put these people on the books, have them pay taxes, make sure we've done a background check,\" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on NBC's Meet the Press. \"All of these things can be done. Are they controversial? You bet. Some of them are very controversial. But we know we need to do it. The United States is a nation of immigrants. I'm proud to be the son of an immigrant who came to this country. But I will tell you, if we're going to do it in this era, we can't wait another 30 years to get around to a solution.\"",

Saying that Latinos aren't monolithic is no longer novel, but it's a reminder we're still having to make every election season.

Adams is critical of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott as he sends busloads of migrants from Texas to New York City. New York City Mayor Eric Adams is criticizing Texas Gov. Greg Abbott for sending busloads of migrants to the city, saying that Abbott \"used innocent people as political pawns to manufacture a crisis.\" \"Unlike Governor Abbott, New York City will always do our part,\" Adams said via Twitter, after his office posted images of the mayor greeting migrants and refugees arriving at the Port Authority bus terminal in midtown Manhattan. \"This is horrific when you think about what [Abbot] is doing,\" Adams said  on Sunday, according to the Gothamist website, which reports that more than 4,000 immigrants had arrived from Texas so far. New York isn't alone: Abbott's office says Texas has already sent more than 6,100 migrants on buses to Washington, D.C., as NPR reported. Both cities are now the main targets in Abbott's program to send people who recently crossed the U.S. southern border to locations on the East Coast. Both Adams and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser are asking for federal aid to help their cities cope with the new flow of migrants, many of whom are being assisted by volunteers, non-profits and shelters in addition to city agencies. Abbott and Republican leaders in nearby border states are seeking to blame Democrats for the country's longstanding immigration crisis. On Friday, Abbott \u2014 who is in the midst of a reelection campaign \u2014 mocked Adams' description of New York as a \"sanctuary city,\" calling it an \"ideal destination for these migrants.\" Even before Adams spoke out, Abbott and his peers were accused of making political points off of the immigration crisis, with critics saying the politicians were risking the well-being of people seeking asylum. Abbott has unveiled a string of headline-grabbing immigration policies this year, first as he faced two staunchly conservatives challengers in the GOP primary and now as he tries to shore up his lead over Democratic candidate Beto O'Rourke ahead of the November vote. Some of Abbott's policies have opened up the governor to criticism within his own state: his April order imposing safety inspections on trucks crossing the border from Mexico created massive slowdowns and was later blamed for billions of dollars in U.S. trade losses. The highly publicized border inspections by the Texas Department of Public Safety resulted in \"zero apprehensions,\" Texas Public Radio reported.",

Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., leaves a meeting where she was elected House Republican Conference chair on May 14, 2021. Stefanik replaced Rep. Liz Cheney, who voted to impeach former President Trump. Stefanik's loyalty to Trump has roiled a pro-democracy group where she serves on the board. In October 2021, New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik stepped onstage at an event in Washington, D.C. \u2013 a celebration of human rights activists from Central America. \"I am honored to present you with the 2021 Democracy Award,\" Stefanik said, as the room applauded a group called Nicaragua Nunca M\u00e1s. The event was organized by the National Endowment for Democracy, a congressionally funded pro-democracy group where Stefanik serves on the board of directors. In her speech, Stefanik talked about Nicaragua's \"consolidation into dictatorship\" and the importance of \"promoting and strengthening democracy around the world.\" But when it comes to domestic politics, the No. 3 House Republican strikes a different tone. She voted to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. In the weeks before the Endowment's award ceremony, her campaign published a controversial Facebook ad making an unfounded accusation: that \"Radical Democrats\" are colluding with immigrants to stage \"a PERMANENT ELECTION INSURRECTION.\" This month, she's been one of Donald Trump's most vocal defenders \u2013 and one of the House Jan. 6 committee's biggest critics. \"We want to make sure that every American knows that this is not a serious investigation. This is a partisan political witch hunt,\" Stefanik said in an interview with the conservative outlet Newsmax. In her defense of Trump, Stefanik regularly spreads election conspiracy theories \u2013 some of the same ideas that motivated a violent mob to storm the U.S. Capitol. Her statements and actions have prompted some of the Endowment's staff to demand her removal from her leadership role. But when her position on the board expired in 2022, she was renewed for another term. When she won her first term, at age 30, Stefanik was the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. She was known as a principled hard worker \u2013 and somebody who worked with Democrats on all kinds of issues. By one index, she was ranked the 13th most bipartisan member of Congress. Stefanik also spent much of her career working with organizations that defend democratic and civic institutions, including the Foreign Policy Initiative and Harvard's Institute of Politics. The National Endowment for Democracy embodies all the values the United States traditionally stands for. Congress appropriates the money, and the Endowment writes grants to help activists and civil society groups in countries with autocratic leaders. But after Stefanik was chosen for the board in early 2019, her politics changed. Now, some people who work at the Endowment say that she is undermining their mission and harming their work from the inside. Stefanik has never said explicitly that the election was stolen or rigged \u2013 her rhetoric is more polished than Trump's \u2013 but she amplifies much of the same mis- and disinformation as the former president. \"Tens of millions of Americans are rightly concerned that the 2020 election featured unprecedented voting irregularities, unconstitutional overreach by unelected state officials and judges ignoring state election laws, and a fundamental lack of ballot integrity and ballot security,\" Stefanik said on Jan. 4, 2021. Election experts say 2020 was the most carefully watched election in American history. Both Republican and Democratic officials across the country oversaw it and never found any evidence of widespread fraud or irregularities. Stefanik condemned the violence on Jan. 6. But after police had cleared the rioters from the Capitol grounds, she voted against certifying President Biden's win in Pennsylvania. At the National Endowment for Democracy, a lot of people on staff were livid about Stefanik's Jan. 6 vote. One former staffer told NPR that the Endowment's values were \"totally undermined and mocked\" by its own board member. More than 60 people signed an internal letter describing Stefanik's actions as \"upsetting in the extreme.\" \"Nothing could be more incompatible with the democratic values which are enshrined in the Endowment and its sacred mission,\" the letter read. \"It is our desire to know how it could be possible that Representative Stefanik will remain part of the NED board of directors following her abuse of office in ways that contradict NED's core values in the starkest terms, and what steps will be taken to resolve this contradiction.\" An image of the letter staff sent to the National Endowment for Democracy's leadership on Jan. 7, 2021. It was addressed to Andrew Card and Carl Gershman, who are no longer at the organization.\n\n                    \n                    NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The letter was the focus of some heated staff meetings. The organization put out a statement about Jan. 6, saying that the Endowment is \"appalled by the violent and seditious assault\" on the Capitol. But they decided not to remove Stefanik. The Endowment declined to do an interview for this story. But NPR spoke with people who were part of the staff discussions at the Endowment after Jan. 6. They didn't want to give their names because they weren't authorized to speak to the media and feared they could lose their jobs or face career backlash for doing so. The staff was told that the Endowment is bipartisan and that it cannot get dragged into domestic politics, the sources said. The organization's funding has come under threat in the past \u2013 most recently during the Trump administration \u2013 but it's had consistent backing from both Republicans and Democrats in Congress, and the leadership wants to keep it that way. The leadership also argued that Stefanik is supportive of the Endowment's work abroad and is a critical ally in Congress, staffers said. Then conversations about Stefanik died down. Her role on the board of directors did not change. Some staffers told NPR they hoped the Endowment would quietly let Stefanik go, or put some distance between the organization and the congresswoman. Instead, Stefanik spoke at the 2021 award ceremony. And when her position on the board expired in January of this year, she was renewed for another term. Meanwhile, Harvard's Institute of Politics did remove Stefanik from an advisory role after Jan. 6. Stefanik accused the university of \"bowing to the woke, far-left mob.\" NPR reached out to Stefanik for this story, but her office did not respond to our request. However, a spokesperson did comment on a related story in Politico, which first reported on the internal turmoil at the Endowment over Stefanik's role last year. The spokesperson told Politico that Stefanik was \"proud to have one of the strongest records in the House supporting and leading bipartisan efforts to fund the National Endowment of Democracy and the mission of supporting and strengthening democratic institutions around the world.\" The current and former staffers interviewed for this story argued that the Endowment's decision not to remove Stefanik was hypocritical. \"She participated in an attempt to overturn an election. It's hard to think of anything more fundamental to the issues we care about,\" one person said. Another source said it's \"embarrassing\" that Stefanik is on the board because the Endowment \"is supposed to be a leader in this fight for democracy.\" \"This was something that transcended partisanship,\" a third person said. A lot of the staffers were sympathetic to the leadership's point that the Endowment's funding has been at risk in the past and could easily be jeopardized again if the organization is perceived as choosing sides in political battles. \"We have seen a vindictiveness in some quarters of the Republican Party aimed at efforts to hold them accountable for what one might call counter-democratic actions,\" the third source said. \"It's not something to be dismissed out of hand.\" But they wanted more transparency on the decision to embrace Stefanik, they said, and wanted to know how the Endowment would react to attacks on American democracy in the future. For years, Larry Diamond was co-editor of the Endowment's Journal of Democracy. In a farewell piece earlier this year, Diamond wrote about the \"deterioration of democratic norms and institutions in the United States\" and around the world. \"This is the darkest moment for freedom in half a century,\" he wrote. Still, he suggested that firing Stefanik would have been a careless move for the organization. \"How does that serve democracy or the great work we're doing around the world to help democrats in desperate need, who need funding for their civil society organizations, funding for independent media, funding and training to resist authoritarian rule?\" Diamond told NPR. He added that in this moment of intense polarization, it's crucial to have \"protected spaces where partisan politics is not going to intrude. And I think it's important that the National Endowment for Democracy be one of those institutions.\" But as Republican Party leaders embrace increasingly extreme views \u2013 like the false notion that the 2020 election was stolen \u2013 it may become more difficult for traditionally bipartisan groups to stay out of the fray. \"These are tough issues and I think we're all trying to figure out, is bipartisanship possible these days?\" said Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at MIT. \"We could be longing for the day when the biggest worry we would have was with a Stefanik on the National Endowment of Democracy board,\" Stewart said. Stefanik is one of 30 board members, and it appears the Endowment believes bipartisanship is still possible. They've indicated that they want to include politicians of all stripes as they make decisions and write grants \u2013 even someone who votes to overturn an election.",

Vance speaks with prospective voters on Monday in Troy, Ohio. Former President Donald Trump has waded into the crowded and contentious Republican Senate primary in Ohio to offer an endorsement with just over two weeks until the election. Trump on Friday backed J.D. Vance, a venture capitalist-turned-Midwest memoirist, whose best-selling Hillbilly Elegy launched his career as a conservative media commentator. The GOP contest has several candidates who have touted their allegiances to Trump, but the former president said in a statement that, \"In the Great State of Ohio, the candidate most qualified and ready to win in November is J.D. Vance.\" The endorsement comes ahead of a Trump rally in Ohio next weekend. The state's Republican primary has been a race to the party's right, as Vance and a trio of his opponents \u2014 businessman Mike Gibbons, former state Treasurer Josh Mandel and former state GOP Chair Jane Timken \u2014 worked to mirror Trump's style and elevated his pet issues of alleged election fraud and illegal immigration. Vance has made a particularly striking evolution on Trump. The Republican has lived much of his life in San Francisco \u2014 in 2017, he announced in a New York Times op-ed that he would return to Ohio \u2014 and in advance of the 2016 election called Trump \"noxious\" and said he was considering voting for a third-party candidate. In a since-deleted tweet from March 2017, first reported by CNN, Vance wrote: \"In 4 years, I hope people remember that it was those of us who empathized with Trump's voters who fought him most aggressively.\" Now, Vance will rely on the president's endorsement to buoy him in a crowded field of candidates. \"Like some others, J.D. Vance may have said some not so great things about me in the past, but he gets it now, and I have seen that in spades,\" Trump said in his statement on Wednesday. \"He is our best chance for victory in what could be a very tough race.\" The open contest follows the announced retirement of Republican Sen. Rob Portman. \"I've studied this race closely,\" Trump, who won the state twice in his presidential runs, said in his statement, \"and I think J.D. is the most likely to take out the weak, but dangerous, Democrat opponent.\" The leading Democratic candidate is Rep. Tim Ryan. Trump's endorsement follows a surprise endorsement of television personality Dr. Mehmet Oz in the Pennsylvania Republican Senate primary last week, one of a number of endorsements Trump has granted nationwide to candidates willing to back his lies about widespread election fraud in the 2020 presidential election. It remains to be seen how influential the former president's endorsements will be. In the Georgia governor's race, Trump has endorsed former Sen. David Perdue over incumbent Brian Kemp \u2014 though Perdue has continued to lag Kemp considerably in the polls.",

As the Biden administration prepares to lift Title 42 on May 23, more Democrats in Congress, and running for office, say they have concerns about the decision and are asking the administration to reconsider or have a more concrete plan in place for the influx of migrants expected to arrive at the southern border. The Trump-era public health order was put in place in early 2020 and prevented migrants and asylum-seekers from crossing the border into the U.S. due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 1, the Centers for Disease Control said the measure was no longer necessary from a public health standpoint. Now, more centrist Democrats like Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., and Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., who are often vocal supporters of the president's agenda, are expressing reservations about lifting the policy. \"In the region where I'm from, we're seeing infections rise. I think Philadelphia, for example, just returned to a mask mandate. So my hope is that that will be reconsidered appropriately,\" Coons said on CBS's Face the Nation on Sunday, referring to Title 42 getting lifted. \"Unless we have a well-thought-out plan, I think it is something that should be revisited and perhaps delayed. I'm going to defer judgment on that until I give the administration the opportunity to fully articulate what that plan is,\" Peters, who is also chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said Monday, The Hill reported. Several top Democratic Senate candidates are also asking the administration to slow down on lifting Title 42. And recent polling from Morning Consult shows that a majority of Americans oppose lifting the measure; while support and opposition break down predictably by party lines, just 31% of independent voters support Biden lifting Title 42. So far, the White House has pointed to a plan the Department of Homeland Security released at the end of March that outlines preparations for a potential increase in migrants. And they've criticized the holdup on the bipartisan $10 billion COVID aid bill. The bill was supposed to pass before Easter recess but Senate Republicans and some Democrats wanted to hold a voice vote on extending Title 42. \"The Department of Homeland Security and the secretary put out a comprehensive plan for what they were going to do to prepare for any increase or influx. ... That's something they're having ongoing discussions with senators, members and their teams and staff about,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday. \"The core issue is that it is being used to tie down and hold back the COVID funding,\" Psaki said. But, beyond what DHS has already released, the White House has not laid out any further details or plans. DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has said the department is increasing its capacity to process new arrivals at the border and evaluate asylum requests. In the last several weeks, the department has added at least 600 more law enforcement officers at the border and is ramping up its COVID-19 vaccination program. Coons and Peters' comments come as a bipartisan group of senators introduced legislation earlier this month to delay the end of Title 42 by at least 60 more days. Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, who have both signed onto the bill, are up for reelection this November, underscoring the likelihood that immigration will once again be a hot-button issue for vulnerable Democrats this year. \"The Biden administration was wrong to set an end date for Title 42 without a comprehensive plan in place. ... We need a secure, orderly, and humane response at our southern border and our bipartisan legislation holds the Biden administration accountable to that,\" Kelly said in a statement. Republicans, meanwhile, are demanding answers from  Biden administration officials including Mayorkas. House Judiciary Committee ranking member Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, has asked the secretary to discuss the administration's plans after Title 42 is lifted when he appears at a House Judiciary hearing on April 28.",

Vice President Harris says the Biden administration is prepared to do what it can to manage an expected surge of people trying to seek asylum at the southern U.S. border when pandemic border restrictions end, but said it's up to Congress to put in place broader reforms to deal with the issue. Title 42, the Trump-era public health order that restricted migrants from crossing the southern border, had been set to expire on Wednesday, until the Supreme Court issued a temporary halt on the expiration late on Monday. Republican attorneys general from 19 states have argued that lifting the restrictions would likely cause a surge of illegal immigration at the southern border. There has already been an increase of people attempting to migrate to the U.S. in recent weeks. \"I think that there is so much that needs to happen to address the issue,\" Harris said in an interview with NPR, hours before the Supreme Court issued its stay. \"And sadly, what we have seen in particular, I am sad to say, from Republicans in Congress is an unwillingness to engage in any meaningful reform that could actually fix a lot of what we are witnessing,\" Harris said. Harris, who has the role of addressing the root causes of migration at the southern border, said the White House plans to boost technology to help process asylum cases more efficiently, and add more agents at the southern border. But she emphasized that Congress needs to lead on the larger issues. \"Reform of our immigration system can only happen through Congress in terms of the passage of an immigration bill that allows for a legal pathway to citizenship and a legal presence in the country,\" she said. Harris also criticized some Republicans for using migrants to try to score political points. In recent months, Republican governors including Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis have bused thousands of migrants in their states to more liberal-leaning parts of the country, including Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, New York and to Washington, D.C., right outside the vice president's residence. Democrats' success in the Georgia runoff election that took place earlier this month meant the party gained a bit of a cushion in passing their agenda through the Senate. That win also frees up Harris, who has served as a tie-breaking vote in the upper chamber 26 times since becoming vice president. She said she expects that means she will be able to travel more next year, now that she's not on call for Senate votes. In 2022, she invested significant time meeting with advocates and state legislators from around the country to talk about the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v Wade. But on that issue, Democrats still don't have enough votes in the Senate to make good on President Biden's pledge to codify abortion rights. Harris said she sees the issue as a \"movement\" where the focus has to be on supporting state and local leaders who are trying to protect reproductive rights \u2014 and on pushing Congress to act. \"The work cannot be anything other than a matter of urgency to protect and fight for these rights, for all people to put pressure on the United States Congress to do what is the right thing to do and put the protections of Roe v Wade into law to codify it,\" she said. Since Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has taken charge of Twitter, the website's rules and operations have been up-ended. Over the weekend, Musk suspended the accounts of several journalists who have reported about his ownership of the company. The accounts were mostly all reinstated after a few days. Asked whether she saw a point where she would stop using the platform, Harris did not directly comment. But she said she is concerned about the rapid spread of disinformation on social media platforms, something she investigated when she was on the Senate Intelligence Committee. \"I fully expect and would require that leaders in that sector cooperate and work with us who are concerned about national security and concerned about upholding and protecting our democracy to do everything in their power to ensure that there is not a manipulation that is allowed or overlooked,\" Harris said.

The fishermen at his caf\u00e9 look out over the Mediterranean where their colleagues prep wooden boats with traps and nets for the next day's work. \"The sea always has something to offer,\" he said. His face is lined from decades in the sun, and his voice gravelly from years of smoking. \"You can always get fish from the sea. It's God who gives us these blessings.\" For 41 years the Mediterranean has provided. It's how Bin Mohammed Issa educated his two older daughters and how he supported his teenage son.

He pulled them onto his fishing boat and took them to Zarzis. A woman gave birth on the journey to the shore.

In the harbor, fishermen are often witnesses to the difficult choices that people make to leave their homelands and risk the journey across the sea on makeshift boats to Europe. So many people drown off the coast of Zarzis that there are two cemeteries for unidentified non-Tunisians found at sea. One is named the Garden of Africa, created by an Algerian artist to give the unnamed a beautiful place to rest. Ornate tiles create the walkways between grave and olive trees grow on the perimeter. But now Bin Mohammed Issa is seeing more and more Tunisians\u2014 men, women and children\u2014 making the decision to go. As of October 2022, more than 45,000 Tunisians have tried to cross to Italy, some successfully, according to the Tunisian Forum for Social and Economic Rights. The International Organization for Migration has also tracked a sharp increase in the number of Tunisians making the journey since 2020. Increasingly, it's families and children boarding these boats including children traveling alone. This year at least 150 Tunisians have drowned off the coast. What's driving them is years of post-revolution political paralysis and infighting that has failed to reform an economic system built on cronyism and systemic corruption. Add to that the pandemic and Russia's war in Ukraine and people are facing food shortages, soaring energy prices, acute inflation and growing unemployment. Tunisia's economy is on the brink of collapse if the country doesn't get an infusion of cash through an IMF loan. To get it, the state has to make cutbacks that will be painful and unpopular.

Meanwhile, nearly 12 years after a revolution that overthrew a dictator, there's widespread concern, that the budding democracy that was being built here is at risk under the current President Kais Saied as he consolidates power and arrests political opponents. Saied rejects the criticism and this week he blamed unnamed \"foreign forces\" for shoring up opposition to his rule in an interview with the Washington Post. He's in Washington DC for the Africa Summit. The steps he's taken, he claims, are to \"correct the course of the revolution.\" Bin Mohammed Issa is worried about a future in Tunisia without a generation of its youth. \"Young people now, they cannot afford anything even if they work their whole life,\" he said. He remembers when Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire in 2010. The fruit vendor doused himself in gasoline after a police officer slapped him and took his street cart and produce. His act of desperation was for dignity and a better life. It made the rest of Tunisia erupt in protest and force a decades-long dictator out of power. \"We had hopes, big hopes. Then those people, those politicians came.\" Bin Mohammed Issa said. \"We thought they were going to create a better situation for us. But it was a cake. They split it between them and they left us the leftovers. That wasn't enough for us to stop feeling hungry.\" If Bouazizi were alive today, he said, the fruit vendor would set himself on fire again.

The desire to leave Tunisia, particularly among the young, is spreading.

They don't think about death anymore,\" He said. \"All they think about is how to make money, how to make their families happy, how to stop their mothers from working in houses and their fathers from working in construction.\" Now his youngest child begs his father to help him make the same journey. \"My son said to me 'either I go illegally or get me a visa to leave the country,'\" Bin Mohammed Issa said. \"I wish my son would stay with me. I want him to help me when I become old the way I help my 105-year-old mother now.

So, Bin Mohammed Issa may grow old without his children. His daughter already left for work in Switzerland after sitting in Tunisia unemployed for years even with her college diploma. Nowadays, so many young people in Zarzis have left that the city feels emptier. In the city center where people shop and dine, a group of 21-year-olds are sipping coffee and scrolling through their phones at a caf\u00e9. Of the four friends, only Muntaser Kardami still lives in Tunisia. The others have all migrated to France and are home for a visit. He wants to leave like his friends have. \"There are no jobs.

Florida Republicans won elections up and down the ballot by staggering margins this year. Some political experts say this election could mark the end of Florida's longtime status as the biggest swing state in the country, but Democrats and third-party groups say they are not convinced Florida is officially a Republican stronghold. They say there's a more complicated explanation for what happened in Florida during the midterms. Dwight Bullard, a former state lawmaker and senior political adviser for a social justice advocacy group called Florida Rising, said this year's election was always going to be a tough one for Democrats. He said he and other groups who predominantly work with Black and Latino voters in Florida \u2014 key voting blocs for Democrats \u2014 were dealing with unmotivated constituencies and a well-funded and well-organized opposition. \"You know a lot of the political tailwinds had already been established,\" Bullard said. \"If we were going to use the analogy of a track meet, folks had already started running a few meters ahead by the time large scale Democratic organization got off the ground. So, it was really going to be a game of catch up.\" And they just didn't catch up, he said. Anthony Verdugo, founder and executive director of the Christian Family Coalition Florida, said conservative mobilization efforts like his have been working hard for years. He said they really caught a lot of momentum, though, in the past year. \"The governor's office and the Republican Party focused on a very aggressive voter registration campaign,\" he said. \"Florida has always \u2014 since its founding \u2014 been a majority Democrat registered state. December of last year we crossed the threshold.\" Verdugo said his own group registered about 1,300 conservative faith voters in just a three-week period last fall. He also credits Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who he said did an effective job rallying the party's base by running on a lot of cultural issues. As a result, Verdugo said, Republicans had a more consistent and clearer message for their voters than Democrats. \"I think that combined with everything that the Republican Party did right made it lopsided and became all the difference in the world,\" he explained.

Ron DeSantis holds his son Mason as he celebrates winning reelection, at an election night party in Tampa, Fla., on Nov. 8.\n                \n                    \n                    Rebecca Blackwell/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Incumbent Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis holds his son Mason as he celebrates winning reelection, at an election night party in Tampa, Fla., on Nov. 8. DeSantis won his reelection by almost 20 percentage points. Up and down the ballot, other Republicans did almost just as well. Joshua Karp, a Democratic strategist, said he's skeptical that this amounts to a huge political victory led by DeSantis though. \"He won about 4.1 million votes four years ago,\" Karp said. \"He won about 4.6 million votes this time. So, he certainly increased by a few hundred thousand people the size of his coalition. In a state like Florida that's a few percentage points. What really happened is Democrats did not show up to the polls.\" Statewide turnout was down by more than half a million votes compared to 2018. Karp blames a lot of this lack of motivation among Democratic voters in Florida on money. Tessa Petit, executive director of an immigrants rights group called the Florida Immigrant Coalition, said the electoral arm of her group was pleading with national donors to help them get out the vote. But she and other groups fell millions of dollars short in fundraising. \"The investment went down a lot,\" Petit said. \"The donors pulled back because I think they kind of \u2014 I don't know maybe they lost faith in the party altogether.\" Four years ago, money was flowing into Florida for groups like the Florida Immigrant Coalition, Petit said. That year, DeSantis won the governor's race by a mere .04% of the vote. Petit said this lack of funding is why Miami Dade County in particular saw a 10 percentage point drop in turnout this year compared to the last midterm election. Because of the diversity in the state, she said, it takes a lot of money to get out the vote in communities of color. Petit said this is why national donors should not pick and choose what years to invest here if they want to see results. \"Florida is not a state that you can date,\" she said. \"You gotta get into a you know \u2014 you gotta get into a relationship, a committed relationship with Florida.\" In examining the results of the election, voting rights groups and Democrats in Florida say there was a toxic environment around voting this year created by Republicans. Karp said in the past two years DeSantis signed two voting bills that went from making it harder for third party groups to register voters to \"making it harder to collect the absentee ballots and drop them off for people who might have trouble accessing a polling location.\" Karp said he was most concerned, though, by DeSantis' announcement earlier this year that his new election crimes unit arrested 20 people who voted in 2020. In interviews, those individuals said they thought they were allowed to vote because the state gave them a voter registration card. Bullard said this created a \"chilling effect\" among some voters who, at one point, were in trouble with the law. \"What we were hearing on the ground was people who had the right to vote feeling as though, 'If I did it, it might actually get me arrested again,' \" he said. Bullard and other Democratic and left-leaning groups say none of this, though, has deterred them from continuing their work in Florida. They say they hope the 2024 election will show Democratic donors that Florida is still a state worth investing in.",

The Republican Party will officially take control of the House of Representatives and its committees come January. Leadership roles in House committees will then transition from Democrats to Republicans. Democrats traditionally use the seniority system to select chairs and ranking members on committees, and they do not enforce term limits. House Republicans adhere to a six -year term limit for chairs and often see competitive races for top committee gavels, like Appropriations and Ways and Means. Here's a look at some of the Republicans who will likely chair House committees and why it matters. The next leader of the House Oversight and Reform Committee will likely be Rep. Jim Comer, R-Ky., currently serving as the Republican ranking member.\n                \n                    \n                    U.S. House of Representatives photo\n                    \n                \nhide caption The next leader of the House Oversight and Reform Committee will likely be Rep. Jim Comer, R-Ky., currently serving as the Republican ranking member. As the main investigative panel in the House, the Oversight and Reform Committee has the authority to probe the federal government and its agencies, including matters within other committee's jurisdictions, according to the House website. It's currently made up of 25 Democrats and 20 Republicans, with Carolyn Maloney, D-NY, currently serving as chairwoman. But Republicans will soon become the committee's majority, and Jim Comer, R-Ky., will likely assume Maloney's position. Comer was among Republicans who recently accused President Biden's son, Hunter, of influence peddling, and labeled him a national security threat. They accused Biden and his family of crimes, including defrauding the United States, tax evasion, money laundering and more. \"The president's participation in enriching his family is, in a word, abuse of the highest order,\" Comer said. \"I want to be clear: This is an investigation of Joe Biden, and that's where our focus will be next Congress.\" Returning fire, the White House called the likely investigation into the Biden family another Republican conspiracy theory, arguing that the GOP is more concerned with revenge than politics. \"Instead of working with President Biden to address issues important to the American people, like lower costs, congressional Republicans' top priority is to go after President Biden with politically-motivated attacks chock full of long-debunked conspiracy theories,\" White House Spokesperson Ian Sams said. \"President Biden is not going to let these political attacks distract him from focusing on Americans' priorities, and we hope congressional Republicans will join us in tackling them instead of wasting time and resources on political revenge.\" Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio during a House Judiciary Committee hearing, July 14, 2022 in Washington, D.C.

Jim Jordan of Ohio during a House Judiciary Committee hearing, July 14, 2022 in Washington, D.C. Jordan will likely become the committee's chair in the next Congress. The Judiciary Committee oversees issues relating to the legal system, including overseeing the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security, has jurisdiction over all proposed constitutional amendments and handles issues such as regulatory reform, anti-trust laws, crime and terrorism and immigration reform. It's currently led by Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., but power will likely transition to Republican Jim Jordan of Ohio once his party assumes responsibility. According to the Republican's House Judiciary Committee page, Jordan is a fiscal conservative, advocating that people, not the government, are best equipped to make decisions about their personal finances. He also served as the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee. Less than one week before polls closed for the midterm elections, Jordan sent letters to the heads of the FBI and Justice Department requesting documents ahead of an expected GOP-led Judiciary Committee investigation. The congressman has accused the FBI and DOJ leadership of operating under a political bias. On Nov. 4, Jordan and Judiciary Republicans released a 1,000-page-report, FBI Whistleblowers: What Their Disclosures Indicate About the Politicization of the FBI And Justice Department, accusing the agencies of political corruption. The FBI told NPR that it conducts itself and its investigations without political influence. \"Put quite simply: We follow the facts without regard for politics,\" the FBI said in a written statement. \"While outside opinions and criticism often come with the job, we will continue to follow the facts wherever they lead, do things by the book, and speak through our work.\" Representative Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., at a House Financial Services Committee hearing, Sept. 30, 2021 in Washington, D.C.

McHenry and other Republicans on the committee announced they would launch an investigation into the Treasury Department, claiming the agency has become politicized by creating the Advisory Committee on Racial Equity. This committee oversees all the components of America's housing and financial sectors. According to the committee's website, this includes banking, insurance, real estate, securities as well as public and assisted housing. It's headed by Chair Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, and North Carolina's Patrick McHenry currently serves as Republican's ranking member. McHenry, who will likely assume Waters' role when the new Congress forms, was one of a few House Republicans who announced last month that they would launch an investigation into the Treasury Department and its newly formed Advisory Committee on Racial Equity. They accused the Biden administration of politicizing the department by forming the advisory committee, which aims to explore aspects of the economy that have resulted in what it called \"unfavorable conditions\" for minority groups and persons of color. Republicans said in a news release that the group is led by \"radically partisan\" politicians on the left, and that the committee will deter the Treasury from focusing on primary functions that benefit all Americans. In a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, McHenry and ranking member Republicans from three other House committees sought answers about the advisory committee's role, goals and membership criteria. \"Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee are deeply concerned about the makeup and goals of this so-called 'advisory committee' and will get the answers from the Treasury Department that the American people deserve,\" the letter reads. The role of the 25-person committee is to provide insight and guidance to Treasury leaders so they can address racial disparities and advance racial equality, according to the committee's bylaws. The advisory committee chair, Michael Nutter, teaches professional practice in urban and public affairs at Columbia University in New York. Before that, he spent eight years as the mayor of Philadelphia, where he says he improved high school and college graduation rates. Vice Chair Felicia Wong is the president and CEO of the Roosevelt Institute, a nonprofit think tank working to advance progressive policies. She works with officials across the country on practicing progressive economics. Other members come from assorted backgrounds, including business, law and academia. Ohio Rep.

The House Committee on Intelligence oversees the nation's intelligence agencies: the Department of Defense as well as the Homeland Security, Justice, State, Treasury and Energy departments. The panel is currently led by California Rep. Adam Schiff but will likely transition to Rep. Michael Turner of Ohio in January. Both parties have launched partisan probes and inquiries in recent years. In August, Schiff and Democrats from the Oversight and Reform Committee asked the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to review the documents seized from former-President Trump's Mar-a-Lago home and conduct a damage assessment of what was missing from the National Archives and Records Administration. Meanwhile, Turner and committee Republicans were working to get documents and communication records from the FBI, the National Archives and Department of Justice about the matter, according to a committee minority news release. Turner, however, hopes both parties can put their political differences aside so the committee can focus on its duties. He said in an interview with the New York Times last month that should he become committee chair, he plans to work with Democrats so committee members can focus on the nation's national security and intelligence needs, in spite of pressure from his own party. \"We need to do the job that we were intended to do,\" Turner told the New York Times. \"I believe that there is a hunger between both sides of the aisle \u2014 members who are national security-focused, intelligence community-focused \u2014 to get this committee back on track.\"",

Spain a prolific producer of strawberries, and the jurisdiction of Huelva is where 80% of the country's berries are grown, in an industry that is increasingly demanding. The work is year-round and requires field workers who take on the repetitive task planting seedlings and then harvesting when ready. This job usually falls on migrants, many from Africa. They describe challenging conditions in the fields and with their bosses, who are often slow to give them work papers. Listen to our full report by clicking or tapping the play button above. Mallika Seshadri contributed to this report.  JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: The U.N. Climate Change summit ended with a promise - to help developing countries deal with the impacts of a warming planet. Many people on the front lines of climate change have decided it's not worth waiting to find out whether countries keep those promises. Some of them are leaving. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: We're tracing a path from Senegal to Morocco to Spain, connecting the dots between climate change, migration and the political far right. Near the end of our journey, we arrived in southern Spain, where many people who came from sub-Saharan Africa discover the distance between their dreams of Europe and the reality. HOPE JOSEPH: Because, you know, I don't have documents. I walk anywhere I got to walk. SHAPIRO: There are two ways of looking at the life of Hope Joseph. First, you could see her through the eyes of her family. JOSEPH: Everyone respect me in my family now. SHAPIRO: To them, the 29-year-old is a provider, a pillar. JOSEPH: My mother's called me that, say, this is my pillar. They say, my daughter, I cannot have problem with you because you are my pillar. SHAPIRO: Her older sister says the same thing, and that's a big deal. As a younger sister, Hope is supposed to be secondary, but her whole family in Nigeria looks up to her. They depend on her, especially her 10-year-old boy. JOSEPH: The other day, he said, when are you going to come back? I said, when I have document, I can go. For now, no. SHAPIRO: She hasn't seen any of them in years because Hope Joseph has been working in the strawberry farms of southern Spain, sending half of every euro she earns back to Nigeria. We're sitting in her makeshift home built of wooden shipping pallets wrapped in tarps to keep out the rain. This is beautiful. You have so many, like, pink and blue and flowered sheets... JOSEPH: My color. SHAPIRO: ...On the walls - your color. JOSEPH: This my favorite. SHAPIRO: The blue. JOSEPH: Yeah. SHAPIRO: Yeah, nice. The floor is concrete. There's no electricity or plumbing. So here's the second way you could look at Hope's life. JOSEPH: Life is very difficult. SHAPIRO: She struggles every day just to survive here. Is it difficult to be a woman here in the camp? We hear about people drinking, people violent. JOSEPH: You can't sleep. Just yesterday, around 2 o'clock in the night, there is fire here. Everybody have to wake up and stand. They take drugs. They take smoke. They drink a lot. But I don't fight. I don't drink. I don't smoke. I look for my daily bread. That is it. SHAPIRO: Life is difficult for everyone living in this settlement, even more so for a woman on her own. She has a big dog named Guapo to keep her safe. Do you ever think, life was better in Africa - I should not have left? JOSEPH: It's not better because I live there. It's not better. It's better here because at least my mother won't be hungry. I can feed her. Back in Africa, I cannot feed anybody. Here, I can feed somebody. (SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS CRUNCHING) SHAPIRO: When you step outside of Hope's shack, you see hundreds of structures like hers. FRANCISCO VILLA: (Through interpreter) This is a village. It's a village inside of a village. SHAPIRO: Francisco Villa is with a nonprofit organization that works with the people who live here. VILLA: (Through interpreter) So the population is very difficult to estimate because it fluctuates a lot. Right now, we're in the planting season. SHAPIRO: He says the population could be between 200 and 800 depending on the time of year. And there are other settlements like this one across the region. Everything here hinges on the season. Strawberry farms stretch for miles in every direction. On one side of the settlement, endless rows of raised planting beds reach to the horizon. Sprinklers irrigate new seedlings. (SOUNDBITE OF SPRINKLER RUMBLING) SHAPIRO: On another side of the settlement, warehouses with load-in docks sit still and quiet, waiting for harvest season. When we began this journey back in Senegal, we met people who'd been to Spain and returned home. They warned young men how hard life in Europe can be. This settlement makes the point. There are piles of trash everywhere. But people living here have gotten creative. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED SPORTSCASTER: (Non-English language spoken). SHAPIRO: In one hut, where someone hooked up a TV to a solar panel, everyone's watching a soccer game. There's an ad hoc garden just a few houses down. (SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS CRUNCHING) SHAPIRO: Just growing among the trash is a bunch of squash - like, pumpkins. And then there's a little plot of mint where there's just tons of mint. And I guess when people eat squash, they throw the seeds there, and then people can harvest the squash when they grow. People secure their homes with padlocks on the doors. (SOUNDBITE OF LOCK CLINKING) SHAPIRO: One man from Senegal has a couch in his two-bedroom structure. On the wall behind him, he's written, VIP ghetto. He left home in 2014 and spent years getting here, passing through many countries on the way. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Togo. After Togo, I come in Niger, Niger entering Algeria, Algeria to Morocco. SHAPIRO: He asks us not to use his name because he doesn't want his family to know how he's living. They still think Spain is the promised land. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Through interpreter) If one is living in a good house, a nice house, yeah, it's OK. But if you're living in a camp or in a house like this and then the family sees how you're living, they're going to say, well, it wasn't worth it to go to Europe in the first place. SHAPIRO: Spanish law says people are eligible for permanent residency after they've been working three years as long as they meet certain conditions. That's more generous than the U.S. and many other countries. But the reality for guest workers in Spain is that it often takes much longer. This man has been at it for four years and still doesn't have his papers. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Through interpreter) I speak Spanish. I can write Spanish. I'm searching from - with my - the bosses I've worked with here to give me a contract for a year. But I don't have it because they think if they give you a contract and you get your papers, you'll leave. And they don't want you to leave. They want you to work and continue working for them. SHAPIRO: We spoke with a farmer who leads an organization of small strawberry producers in the area, and he denied that farmers take advantage of the workers. But we also spoke with a local prosecutor who handles crimes against migrants, and he confirmed that farmers have all the leverage, and some of them abuse workers. The Senegalese man in the VIP ghetto says it's just the luck of the draw. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Through interpreter) That just depends on the boss. Sometimes there's people who come after you who only work a little bit, and then they give them their papers. I work a lot, and they haven't give me the papers. SHAPIRO: Then, he says unprompted... UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Through interpreter) I want to see my wife. I want to start a family with her. But I can't go back because of the papers. That's why people here, you know, become crazy - because they're thinking about these things all the time, and they can't go. SHAPIRO: He says that's why fires break out all the time around here. Sometimes someone's careless with a propane cookstove, but often people just snap from all the stress. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Through interpreter) My mom - you know, she messages me sometimes. She says, I really want to see you. I want to see you before I die. I want you to come back. I hope that you have your papers so you can come back. SHAPIRO: The fires and the violence have provided useful talking points for far-right politicians. RAFAEL SEGOVIA: (Through interpreter) We're sorry to see the situation that many migrants experience in Europe. SHAPIRO: Rafael Segovia is local president of a Spanish political party called Vox. The party offices are full of green balloons with the Vox logo. A banner on the wall lists their agenda for Spain. It talks about fighting the globalists, defending Western values and upholding traditional families. In Segovia's talking points, you hear some of the same phrases that like-minded politicians use all over the world. SEGOVIA: (Through interpreter) Vox, just like other political leaders around the world such as Trump in the U.S., Orban in Hungary - we're all patriots. We are not against regulated immigration, but we are against the illegal migration we are seeing in all these countries, which the globalists support. SHAPIRO: He specifically worries that international refugee law will begin to recognize people displaced by climate change. SEGOVIA: (Through interpreter) If we hope to defend our cultural identity, we need to reject the idea of the climate refugee. If that notion is accepted, all these illegal migrants would have to be admitted because they would legally be considered refugees. SHAPIRO: Vox is still a minority party in Spain, but it's growing fast. And all over Europe, right-wing politicians are winning elections on similar platforms. Segovia believes that informal settlements are a threat to stability, security and the culture of Spain. He accuses his political opponents of advocating for open borders. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Non-English language spoken). SHAPIRO: A young man from Senegal named Seydou Diop takes a different view. Borders are already open, he says - just not for everyone. SEYDOU DIOP: (Through interpreter) I ask you, how could it be that you were able to travel to my country with your passport? And me with my passport - I can't just go to the United States and travel with dignity. SHAPIRO: Seydou Diop runs a community center for people who live in a nearby settlement of strawberry farm workers. For a membership fee, they get access to hot showers, Wi-Fi, even legal help and Spanish language lessons. It's all paid for by the migrants themselves. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Non-English language spoken). SHAPIRO: People watch TV while they wait for their turn to do laundry. On this journey, we've asked dozens of migrants, what drove you to leave your home? Why did you make such a dangerous choice? Seydou Diop reframes the question. Why shouldn't anyone be able to travel for any reason or for no reason? DIOP: (Through interpreter) I think that traveling is part of being free. SHAPIRO: And now that you are here, how does the reality of Spain compare to the dream that was in your heart? DIOP: (Through interpreter) I was speechless when I saw the reality here. I couldn't quite understand that the situation was so, so difficult. I became an activist the moment I arrived in this country because I felt hungry in this country. I slept on the streets in this country. And this is happening in societies that are supposed to be supportive and democratic. SHAPIRO: While far-right politicians accuse immigrants of polluting Spanish culture, Seydou Diop views it differently. As he sees it, he's trying to help the country live up to its ideals. (SOUNDBITE OF TINO DI GERALDO'S \"POR DIGERALDINAS\") SHAPIRO: Tomorrow, our journey concludes in Madrid. We'll meet a man who grew up in a Senegalese fishing town, worked for years in Spain without papers and is now an elected political leader, one of very few Black people ever to have succeeded in modern Spanish politics. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: (Through interpreter) Honestly, it is a lot of pressure. That's why I have to think carefully about every single word, every step I take - because it's not just me. It's the whole community. SHAPIRO: And you can find all of the stories from this trip at npr.org/climatemigration. (SOUNDBITE OF TINO DI GERALDO'S \"POR DIGERALDINAS\") Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

Donald Trump, who tried to overthrow the results of the 2020 presidential election and inspired a deadly riot at the Capitol in a desperate attempt to keep himself in power, announced he is running again for president in 2024. \"I am announcing my candidacy for president of the United States,\" Trump, 76, said flanked by massive American flags, at his Mar-a-Lago club and home in Palm Beach, Fla. The announcement \u2014 and official filing \u2014 comes just a week after the 2022 midterm elections, which saw a lackluster performance from Trump-backed Republican candidates in key Senate races and competitive House elections. As a result, Democrats were able to retain control of the Senate. \"America's comeback starts right now,\" Trump said, claiming, \"Your country is being destroyed before your eyes.\" The dark vision hearkened back to Trump's inauguration speech of a country suffering \"American carnage\" and in need of him to fix it. Trump running sets up a potential rematch against President Joe Biden, who will turn 80 on Sunday and says he intends to run for reelection in 2024. Exit polls showed inflation to be the top issue with midterm election voters overall. They said they trusted Republicans more on the issue than Democrats by a wide margin. And the electorate was nearly three-quarters white, reversing a decades-long trend of a decline in white voters as a share of the midterm electorate. And yet, Republicans underachieved \u2014 and fingers are being pointed in Trump's direction, even from within his own party. Anger over the Supreme Court's ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, which made abortion legal in this country, buoyed Democrats in these elections. But voters also sent a message that they didn't want extremes, rejecting Trump candidates up and down the ballot who peddled his baseless election lies. Republicans lost in competitive Senate races in purple states, like Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Arizona and Nevada. Democrats could further expand their majority with a runoff election three weeks from now in Georgia, with yet another Trump endorsee, who has struggled mightily. For the House, Republicans are on the precipice of control, but by a far smaller majority than they were hoping for, likely hampering their ability to pass legislation next year. Of the 64 House race contests the Cook Political Report rated as toss ups or leaning toward one party or the other, Trump endorsed in 21. Only seven have won. It was even worse for Trump candidates in the most competitive races. Of the three dozen toss-up races, Trump backed nine candidates. Only one has won. And yet, Trump is launching another run for president and falsely claiming his candidates did well, despite the evidence that his brand and his style of politics have proven radioactive in competitive states and districts for multiple election cycles in a row now. Trump's move shows a degree of vulnerability \u2014 an effort to freeze out the GOP presidential field and force Republican elected officials to get off the sidelines and endorse him. He also doesn't want to give any oxygen to any potential rivals, who may be sensing a chance, especially someone like Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. Many in the party have begun to openly question whether it's a good idea to continue to hitch their wagon to the former president, especially with DeSantis waiting in the wings. DeSantis easily won reelection as Florida's governor last week. He's a staunch conservative and landed in controversy for flying migrants from Texas to Martha's Vineyard and other liberal cities and enclaves, but is widely seen as a more disciplined version of Trump. The Rupert Murdoch-owned New York Post, which turned on Trump during the Jan. 6 congressional committee hearings' revelations, dubbed DeSantis \"DeFuture\" \u2014 and Trump \"Trumpty Dumpty,\" who \"couldn't build a wall\" and \"had a great fall.\" Today's cover: Here\u2019s how Donald Trump sabotaged the Republican midterms https://t.co/YUtDosSGfp pic.twitter.com/vpI94nKuBh Some conservative groups also released polling \u2014 very soon after the midterm results \u2014 showing DeSantis beating Trump in early presidential primary states and places like Texas. The message was clear \u2014 it's time for someone else. But Trump's hold on the GOP base can't be underestimated. There have been other moments when the \"fever\" might break, but never has \u2014 not with criticizing the late-Republican Sen. John McCain's status as a war hero, not the Access Hollywood tape in which he bragged about assaulting women, not the two dozen women who accused him of sexual misconduct or assault, not even the Jan. 6 insurrection. But this latest setback may be threatening the thing Republican officials care about most \u2014 winning. Their resolve will be tested, as the party is in for a reckoning over the next two years. He recently nicknamed DeSantis Ron \"DeSanctimonious\" and touted polling, prior to Election Day, that he said showed him well ahead in a hypothetical GOP presidential primary. He has taken to his own social media platform \u2014 which he formed when he was booted from mainstream platforms like Twitter and Facebook for spreading misinformation and inciting the insurrection \u2014 to blast the naysayers, the media and to spread unfounded election conspiracies. Expect more of the same from candidate Trump once again. But it's hard for his party to escape the reality that Trump's brand simply hasn't played well in purple states from the beginning of his time on the national stage, especially now that they've suffered because of it. He may have won the presidential election in 2016, but several swing states were very close, and he wound up losing the popular vote by 3 million votes. In the 2018 midterms, his party lost 40 House seats and control of the chamber. After four years of his presidency that saw majorities of voters disapproving of the job he was doing consistently and mishandling the coronavirus pandemic, Trump lost his reelection bid in 2020. Several swing states were close, but he lost the popular vote by an even wider 7 million votes. Instead of conceding, and with no other off ramp to explain away his loss, Trump retrenched and cried fraud. After recounts, audits and dozens of court cases, Biden's election was upheld, over and over again. Yet Trump continued on with lies and inspired rank-and-file Republicans to turn toward dangerous conspiracies that have eroded their faith in the electoral system. Courts have proven the 2020 election was fair and that there was very little fraud, certainly not enough to overturn the results anywhere. Despite that, Trump made his false narrative of a stolen election something of a litmus test for those he would endorse in these midterms. They bought in, were boosted in primaries and many lost in the general election, giving seats to Democrats that might have been won by non-election-denying Republicans. A majority of Americans continue to say they have an unfavorable opinion of the former president. But, at least before the midterm elections, he was by far the most popular and powerful figure within the Republican Party. He continues to be the favorite for the GOP presidential nomination despite recent losses. It will take a lot to defeat him \u2014 time, money and fighting against, yes, the GOP establishment in many ways. The Republican National Committee and many state parties are now filled now with Trump acolytes. Trump's grip on the party had seemed to be loosening \u2014 at least marginally \u2014 this past summer because of the Jan. 6 hearings and just sheer time and distance removed from power. But the FBI's search of Trump's Florida home ironically seemed to tighten his grip, as GOP base voters saw Trump as a victim. And the former president has perpetually used victimhood, especially white victimhood and grievance, as fuel to his political fire. It's not just DeSantis who could challenge Trump for the nomination. And it's unclear if DeSantis will. He's only 44 years old and will likely tread carefully to not upset the base of loyal \u2014 and he perhaps hopes formerly loyal \u2014 supporters of Trump. Other Republicans have also been circling, positioning themselves and taking steps for a 2024 presidential run of their own, like Trump's former vice president, Mike Pence, former Trump United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem. Trump's unorthodox move to officially get in now is an effort to blunt those efforts, clear the field and refocus the attention on him, especially as he faces multiple civil and criminal investigations in multiple states. Trump also faces criminal investigations into his finances, including his tax filings and how the Trump Organization has been run, and he is fighting multiple lawsuits. Trump's announcement comes as Biden is facing several political challenges. Biden's popularity has suffered, as inflation has continued to rise, gas prices went up and variants of the coronavirus pandemic have continued to pop up. The president's approval ratings took a dive in the summer and fall of 2021 after the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, initiated under the Trump administration, was widely panned for its chaotic execution under Biden. While Trump faltered against Biden largely because he lost significant backing from the large swath of suburban and independent voters across the country, he retains significant support among Republican voters. Biden, on the other hand, has struggled to keep his base fired up. In this age of extreme polarization, maintaining popularity with a president's own party and winning over the narrow slice of remaining swing voters in the country is the pathway to election. Trump's victory in 2016 was one of the most stunning results in American history. He became an unpopular president, who made more than 30,000 false or misleading claims while in office, was impeached twice and who Americans saw as mishandling the coronavirus pandemic. That helped lead to Trump losing his reelection bid to Biden. But now with Biden's popularity waning and the economy at an uncertain moment, Trump sees an opportunity to rise to power again. During his time as president, Trump weaponized white cultural grievance, right-wing nationalism and, ironically, considering his status as an Ivy League-educated billionaire, an anti-elitist economic populism. The foundation of Trump's 2016 candidacy and ensuing presidency was nativism \u2014 he campaigned on building a wall to keep Spanish-speaking immigrants out of the United States; in his early days in office, he banned people from some mostly Muslim countries from coming to the country; he inflamed racial tensions like when he said there were \"very fine people\" on both sides of a white nationalist protest in Charlottesville, Va., where a counter-protester was killed; and he regularly exaggerated dangers to trigger anger and fear in many Americans. \"[T]he crime, and the gangs, and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential,\" Trump said during his 2017 inaugural address, despite the country having seen an overall downward trend in violent crime. \"This American carnage stops right here and stops right now,\" Trump said in the enduring line from his first speech as president. With violent crime up in big cities, Republicans have used the issue in these midterm elections to motivate their voters \u2014 and it will undoubtedly be a plank Trump uses again. Trump removes his mask upon his return to the White House from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Oct. 5, 2020. Trump spent three days hospitalized for COVID-19.\n                \n                    \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Trump removes his mask upon his return to the White House from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Oct. 5, 2020. Trump spent three days hospitalized for COVID-19. Many Republicans would say privately, including on Capitol Hill, that they did not like Trump personally, but were still supporting him \u2014 despite the chaos they often saw during his presidency. This confounded many on the left, but the reason for it was that Trump was pushing many policies conservatives agreed with. He enacted tax cuts that mostly benefited the wealthy and corporations, installed three conservative-leaning justices on the Supreme Court and oversaw a time of economic growth \u2014 until the coronavirus pandemic swept through the world. The appointment of those justices has borne fruit for conservatives, 50 years in the ripening. The court outright overturned Roe v. Wade, sending abortion policy back to the states and shutting off access to abortion for millions of women in this country. The court has also upheld the rights of gun owners and appears poised to further enshrine conservative social structures in coming terms that would have effects for generations to come. After losing reelection, Trump refused to concede and did not go along with the American tradition of a peaceful transfer of power, departing Washington hours before Biden's inauguration. He remained dug in and invented fraud claims, saying the \"real insurrection\" came on Election Day in an effort to downplay the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol inspired in part by his own words at a rally hours earlier. In private, he unsuccessfully pressured state and federal officials to take unprecedented and even illegal actions to overturn his defeat. It gave him an exit ramp without ever having to admit defeat. Despite audits and reviews in many states, there has been zero evidence of widespread fraud. Still, Trump continues the lie. The depth of Trump's efforts have been detailed in the several Jan. 6 committee hearings, which have featured testimony from multiple witnesses who served in Trump's White House, worked on his campaign to elect him, and top DOJ and state election officials. Trump's lies about fraud in the last election have helped erode faith in the electoral system among many in the GOP base.\n                \n                    \n                    Jeff Kowalsky/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Even considering his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection, most Republican officials, fearing his hold on the GOP base and potential retaliation, declined to stick to criticism of the 45th president. Those who did, like Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney,  faced his wrath from Trump-backed primary challengers. Cheney lost her reelection bid, as did other Republicans, who voted for his impeachment. In fact, just two of the 10 Trump House Republican impeachers remained on the ballot. Jaime Herrera Beutler, who voted for Trump's impeachment, was ousted in a GOP primary, and, ironically, a Democrat won the seat for the 3rd Congressional District in Washington state. Trump has the money to run again \u2014 amassing hundreds of millions of dollars through his political operations. His formal announcement for president means he will consolidate Republican resources, as the former real-estate developer and reality TV star gets to reprise familiar ground \u2014 that of the outsider throwing stones, rather than the insider president responsible for the country's security and prosperity.",

            "article_content": "NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Linda Chavez, former White House official in the Reagan administration, about what the midterm results say about the challenges ahead for the Republican party.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Along with the vote count this weekend, we're also paying attention to what the midterms tell us about the opportunities and challenges for both of the country's main political parties. Once all the votes are counted, Republicans might still eke out majorities in both houses of Congress, but that's a lot different than the significant gains many analysts and historians predicted. Instead, it was the worst midterm performance for a party out of power in two decades. So what now? We decided to get a view from someone who served under one of the most popular Republican presidents in the modern era. Linda Chavez served in several roles in the Reagan administration as the director of the Office of Public Liaison and as staff director of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. She currently leads a center-right think tank called the Center for Equal Opportunity. Linda Chavez, welcome back. Thanks for joining us. LINDA CHAVEZ: Great to be with you. MARTIN: So just briefly, if we could just remind people of your background, you began your political life as a Democrat, but then you turned to the Republican Party. And I remember your telling me at one point that you voted for Ronald Reagan while you were still registered as a Democrat. So as briefly as you can, because these issues are always complex, but what was it that mainly attracted you to the Republican Party? CHAVEZ: Well, I think it really had more to do about the Democratic Party, which had gone, in my view, too far left. I was very interested in foreign policy and defense issues and very, very disappointed in Jimmy Carter. And so I cast my vote as a Reagan Democrat in 1980 and again in 1984 and didn't become a Republican until 1985. MARTIN: Then there was an historic shift for you in 2021. You announced you were leaving the GOP in a - frankly, in a fairly blistering message, which you delivered on Twitter and other platforms. Why is that? CHAVEZ: Well, I think, again, as the Democratic Party drove me to the Republican Party, the Republican Party drove me out of the Republican Party. It really did have to do with election denialism. I saw people that I thought, you know, should be behaving much differently behaving in a way that I thought was antithetical to democracy. And I decided I just couldn't be a member of the party anymore. MARTIN: Overall, what struck you about the midterm results, those that we know about so far? What stands out to you? CHAVEZ: I think in many ways, this was a real boon for democracy. I think that, you know, everybody said that democracy was not a big issue in the campaign. I don't agree. I think the election results showed that most Americans want to be - see sensible candidates. They want to see candidates who are not crazy and denying elections. And I think that's what we saw. MARTIN: You know, people have often said the midterms are really - it's a referendum on the party that holds the White House, that it's often a referendum on the economy. Why do you think that that strategy did not succeed as well as Republicans had hoped? CHAVEZ: The one thing that I think Republicans have to learn is that the more that Donald Trump is either actually on the ballot or is perceived as hovering over the ballot, the less well Republicans are going to do. And we saw that in the closing days of the campaign. Donald Trump was running around the country having rallies, and many of the people that he was trying to help ended up being hurt, I think, by his presence. MARTIN: You remember that after the 2012 presidential election, there was this so-called autopsy report by the Republican National Committee. It was led by people who had had high positions in the party, had been successful as both candidates and political leaders themselves. And the report said that the party should expand its outreach to communities of color, to women and young voters. Of course, in 2016 and then beyond, the former president Donald Trump, you know, ran campaigns where he demonized immigrants from Mexico and Latin America. He focused on kind of white grievance and issues like abortion. This year, Republicans did field a substantial number of candidates of color. That's a fact. But many of them leaned into the same extremist positions that you were just talking about. Is there some mechanism for the kind of discussion that the party had in 2012? Does that even happen? Is that even possible? CHAVEZ: It is difficult right now because the party itself is divided. And a lot of people like me have left the party, those of us who have a more moderating influence, not so much moderating in terms of our position on issues but moderating in terms of our style, in terms of the way we kind of approach the issues. And I think that is going to make it more difficult to do the kind of 2012 autopsy. But they've also - even though they have fielded minority candidates, they - often, those candidates are mouthing the same kind of election nonsense that the people like Steve Bannon have been mouthing. And I think what we find is that that doesn't necessarily help the Republican Party win those suburban voters that they need to woo back in order to be able to actually win elections. MARTIN: And so, of course, I guess all roads lead back to the former president, Donald Trump. Is that about right? I mean, is this basically the issue for the party is what he does or doesn't do? CHAVEZ: Donald Trump is the elephant in the room, no pun intended. He really is going to make or break the Republican Party. If he insists on injecting himself, if he insists on making everything about him, Republicans are going to continue to lose elections. MARTIN: I guess the question would be, are there any candidates that you currently see or any officeholders who you think would be listened to who can present the case to the Republican Party that the way forward is this and not that? Is there anybody sounding that message in a way that you can get behind or that you consider credible? CHAVEZ: Well, I'm waiting to see what Liz Cheney is going to do because I think she is going to try to present a kind of third way, if you will, for Americans who are more conservative. We've seen that kind of movement among Democrats. And it actually - the Democratic Leadership Committee from back in the Clinton era was very transformative of the Democratic Party. It's one of the reasons Bill Clinton got elected. I think there needs to be something similar in the Republican Party, and - I don't know - Liz Cheney may be the person to do it. She may be too polarizing for some of those people who held their nose and voted for Donald Trump but still think that he was badly treated in impeachment and in the January 6 hearing. But somebody has got to try to reach out to those Republicans who still hold right-of-center views on issues but cannot support the kind of election denialism that Trump has been pumping out there for the last two years. MARTIN: That was Linda Chavez. She's the chair of a conservative think tank, the Center for Equal Opportunity. She is a former official in the Reagan administration, and she's held a number of positions in public life. Tomorrow, we look at the road ahead for the Democratic Party. Linda Chavez, thanks so much for joining us today. CHAVEZ: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Ron DeSantis, his wife Casey DeSantis and their children walk on stage to celebrate victory over Democratic gubernatorial candidate Rep. Charlie Crist during an election night watch party at the Tampa Convention Center on Tuesday in Tampa, Florida. Follow live updates and election results here. MIAMI \u2014 Florida voters have given Republican Ron DeSantis a second term as the state's governor. DeSantis overcame a challenge from Charlie Crist, a former Democratic congressman who, as a Republican, served as Florida governor more than a decade ago. DeSantis won with nearly a 20-point margin. And he did it by carrying Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties, longtime Democratic strongholds. At his victory party in Tampa, he called it \"a win for the ages.\" DeSantis told the crowd, \"We not only won election, we have rewritten the political map.\" The victory gives DeSantis a second term and a national platform as he eyes a potential run for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. He was first elected governor after receiving an endorsement from then-President Donald Trump. The resounding win enhances DeSantis' profile among Republicans and sets up a potential rivalry with Trump. Trump has already signaled he's ready with attacks, calling DeSantis \"DeSanctimonious\" at a recent rally. On Tuesday, Trump told reporters DeSantis shouldn't consider entering the presidential race. If he does, Trump said, \"I would tell you things about him that won't be very flattering \u2014 I know more about him than anybody \u2014 other than, perhaps, his wife.\" Loading... In his first term, DeSantis courted Trump supporters with incendiary attacks on the Biden administration. DeSantis opposed the president's COVID policies and made White House medical adviser Anthony Fauci a prime target for criticism. DeSantis opposed policies requiring COVID vaccinations and facemasks. He also signed into law measures that restrict how public schools teach students about race, sexual orientation and gender identity. Those measures have put him at odds with local school districts and with federal education policy. They also raised his profile as a potential presidential candidate, making him a frequent guest on Fox News. DeSantis has been a vocal critic of the Biden administration on immigration, accusing it of not doing enough to stem the flow of migrants over the southern border. In September, his administration organized flights that delivered nearly 50 migrants to Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts. Democrats and immigrant rights groups decried the flights as political stunts that used people as pawns. But the move won acclaim among conservative Republicans. In the weeks leading up to the race, DeSantis dropped the political attacks as Hurricane Ian devastated Southwest Florida. That put him at the top of the news throughout the state for weeks as he directed the response and aid for struggling communities. DeSantis' win is another sign that Florida, long considered a swing state, now is firmly under Republican control. It's been 28 years since a Democrat has been elected governor in Florida.

NORTH CAROLINA \u2014 Apple season is winding down in the Blue Ridge Mountains of western North Carolina, and farmer Kenny Barnwell's coolers are filling up with thousands of bushels of Red Delicious, Honeycrisp, and Pink Lady \u2013 apples that all had to be picked by hand. That wouldn't be possible, Barnwell says, without immigrants and migrant workers. That's why Barnwell, who is a fifth-generation apple grower and a registered Republican, has been urging his GOP representatives to open the country's doors to more agricultural workers for years. \"We have finally started to convince a few people of the need for immigration in this county,\" says Barnwell. \"We need to get this done while we've got this narrow window.\" That narrow window is the upcoming lame duck session of Congress. Ambitious plans to overhaul the nation's immigration system have failed, yet again. But immigrant advocates say there's a chance that more modest proposals can find bipartisan support now that the heat of election season has passed. Growers and dairy farmers across the country say the farm labor shortage is getting worse. They're pushing a bill that would expand a temporary work visa program for seasonal workers, allowing some to work in the U.S. year-round. The legislation would also create a pathway to permanent legal status for workers with a demonstrated history of farmwork. The Farm Workforce Modernization Act, as it's known, has already passed the House of Representatives twice, with at least 30 Republican votes each time. But it's stalled in the Senate. \"This is becoming the kind of the last hope,\" says Rep. Mike Simpson, a Republican from Idaho who co-sponsored the farm workforce bill. \"This is the best chance we've got of getting it done,\" he tells NPR. It's not just the farmworkers and the agriculture industry who are pinning their hopes on the lame duck session. A broad range of immigrants and their allies will be urging Congress to act when lawmakers return to Washington this week. Advocates for Afghan evacuees are urging Congress to pass a bill that would give them permanent legal status. Nearly 600,000 DACA recipients who are in danger of losing their protections are looking for help, too. So are more than 300,000 beneficiaries of Temporary Protected Status, who are seeking more permanent protections. But they will all have to persuade key Republicans, who are more focused on the record number of migrant apprehensions at the southern border. \"I can't imagine a path forward until we find some way to deal with the crisis at the border,\" said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas at a hearing in September. \"It's hard for us to make progress on areas even where there is consensus on the topic of immigration while the border is on fire.\" Still, some Republicans see a window of opportunity in the lame duck session. \"I would argue that actually passing this bill will help at the border,\" says Simpson, the co-sponsor of the farm workforce bill, which he argues will discourage illegal immigration. \"I don't think we'll have as many people coming across because these people will be here legally,\" he says. \"They'll be able to come and go.\" The bill would create a pathway to permanent legal status for farmworkers who can show they've worked in agriculture for at least eight years. Immigration hardliners don't like that, arguing that it's giving \"amnesty\" to immigrants who've been working illegally in the U.S. for years, at the expense of native-born workers. But the bill's supporters say the pathway to a green card is not easy, and it's not quick. \"It's not going to take a job away from a citizen,\" says Barnwell, who's been growing apples in North Carolina since the 1980s. He now farms about 160 acres, featuring several different varieties of apples and supplying businesses such as Gerber and McDonald's, as well as local farmers markets around North Carolina. Barnwell says growers in the region have long depended on migrant and immigrant labor to harvest apples and other crops that need to be picked by hand, including peaches and tomatoes. \"You're not going to get a person that's born and raised in the United States to go out into the field and pick apples, or go into that field and harvest tomatoes. It is hard, hard work,\" Barnwell says. Barnwell has been trying for decades to convince his GOP representatives to support a bill like this one, he says. \"It's not everything we need by any stretch of the imagination,\" he says. \"But it is a good first step about ensuring us a stable workforce.\" Some advocates go even further. Rebecca Shi, the executive director of the American Business Immigration Council, argues the bill would help fight inflation by stabilizing the cost of farm labor. \"We go to the grocery store. We see the price of eggs or milk, our poultry meats rising at historic rates,\" Shi says. \"Now inflation's going to keep going up unless we address this at the root cause, which is labor. We need more workers.\" Skeptics doubt that the bill would do much to reduce food prices in the near-term, noting that high energy costs are also a major factor. Supporters say the farm workforce bill represents a delicate balance between the interests of farmworkers and their employers. And while that compromise hasn't satisfied everyone in either camp, backers say it has wide-ranging support across both. The version passed by the House would expand the use of H-2A agricultural visas, which are currently seasonal, to allow some workers to stay in the U.S. year-round. It also mandates the use of the E-Verify system to confirm that all agriculture workers are eligible to work legally. The bill's sponsors in the Senate are expected to release their version soon. If it doesn't pass before the end of the year, its supporters will have to start over again in the next Congress, when Republicans could have a narrow majority in the House. Even the bill's GOP co-sponsor Mike Simpson believes that would be difficult. \"It will be harder in a Republican conference to get this bill through,\" Simpson says. \"They'll want to make too many changes.\" It won't be easy in the lame duck session, either. \"There are some quiet negotiations. There are member-level talks happening, which is critical to moving anything in immigration,\" says Kristie De Pe\u00f1a, an expert on immigration policy at the Niskanen Center in Washington, D.C. De Pe\u00f1a rated the chances of the bill passing before the end of the year as \"slim\" \u2013 but she didn't rule it out, either. \"I wouldn't put them at zero,\" she says.",

            "article_content": "Mail-in voting might keep election night from being results night. Supreme Court takes up Indian Child Welfare Act and adoption. Italy's new government is taking a hard line on Mediterranean migrants.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Today is the last day to make your voice heard with your vote in this year's midterms. But even though it's election night, it might not be results night. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Yeah, because mail-in voting gets more popular each election cycle. It takes time to go through all those mail-in ballots. And states with widespread mail voting include Pennsylvania, where just one election could decide the Senate and where the Republican Party is already pushing to disqualify some ballots. MARTIN: NPR's Hansi Lo Wang joins us now from Pennsylvania. Good morning, Hansi. HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: So what is happening there that will likely slow down vote counting today? WANG: Well, I'm watching two big factors that help determine whether state election officials can report results on election night - one, how many people vote by mail, and two, how much time before Election Day do officials have to process the mail ballots, to get them ready for counting? And in Pennsylvania, more than 1.4 million mail-in ballots have been requested for this year's general elections. And Pennsylvania election officials have zero time before Election Day to start processing mail-in ballots. So this puts election officials here at a major disadvantage in terms of turnaround times, especially when you compare them to officials in states like Florida, where both processing and counting ballots starts before Election Day. MARTIN: So I don't get it. Why can't Pennsylvania election officials start counting mail-in ballots earlier? WANG: They can't do it because of Pennsylvania state law that says processing cannot start until 7 a.m. local time on Election Day. And by the way, there's the same restriction in Wisconsin, another swing state. You know, a lot of people don't know about or don't pay attention to this processing work. It's often called pre-canvassing. And it can include, you know, checking voter signatures on the return envelope for the ballot, opening the envelopes, taking the ballots out of the envelopes, flattening the ballots and then stacking the ballots so they're ready for scanning. It can sound very mundane, very tedious. But these are all critical steps in ensuring an accurate vote count. And, you know, the Bipartisan Policy Center has recommended setting aside at least seven days before Election Day for this pre-canvassing work. MARTIN: Wow. So, you know, Trump supporters made false claims about the validity of mail-in votes in the 2020 election. In light of that, was there any effort to change the law to try to give more time for processing these ballots and give less grist to those who are spreading disinformation? WANG: Well, in Pennsylvania, there were multiple efforts. But before the midterm elections, Pennsylvania's legislature, which is controlled by Republicans, could not with agree with the governor, who's a Democrat, on a legislative package that would include pre-canvassing changes. And Republican state lawmakers here in Pennsylvania did not advance bills that were more tightly focused on pre-canvassing. But, you know, I should note there is a swing state with similar challenges that recently did make some changes to pre-canvassing There's a law it passed last month in Michigan that allows communities there with at least 10,000 residents to start pre-canvassing two days before Election Day. But it came too late for some local election officials, who had already finalized their plans for the midterms. So really, who knows how long it will take to get results? MARTIN: Meanwhile, Republicans are already saying that some mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania should be thrown out. Explain what's going on. WANG: Well, there are thousands of mail ballots that arrived on time in Pennsylvania but may end up getting rejected from final vote counts. The reason is because the envelopes they're in, the ballots that are in - they don't have dates handwritten by voters, or they have incorrect dates. And the thing is, these handwritten dates are required by Pennsylvania state law. But there is a federal lawsuit over whether that date is enough to disqualify a person's vote. So we'll have to see what happens. MARTIN: NPR's Hansi Lo Wang reporting from Philadelphia on this Election Day. Thanks, Hansi. WANG: You're welcome, Rachel. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: The U.S. Supreme Court is hearing an argument tomorrow that could determine the fate of Native American children. It pits several prospective adopted parents and the state of Texas against a federal law aimed at preventing Native American children from being separated from their extended families and their tribes. Joining us to talk about the case, NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg. Good morning, Nina. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: Any case that includes the potential of separating children from their families has got to be very emotional. TOTENBERG: You know, this case, more than usual, is steeped in American history and the sorry way that the United States treated the people who lived here before the rest of us arrived, the American Indians. And it's also a case that, more than usual, will resonate with the justices, seven of whom are parents, including two who have adopted children. So this case is rooted in the Indian Child Welfare Act, known by the acronym ICWA. It was enacted in 1978 after Congress found that public and private agencies over time had taken hundreds of thousands of Indian children from their homes, sometimes by force, and placed almost all of these children in institutions or with families who had no ties to the tribes. So ICWA established minimum federal standards for removing Native children from their families. It required state courts to notify tribes when an Indian child is removed from her home. And it required that in foster and adoption placements, preference be given first to a member of the child's extended tribal family, then other members of the tribe and if neither of those is available, a home with a different tribal family. MARTIN: OK. So why is that law being challenged? TOTENBERG: The state of Texas and several families who are adopting Indian children contend that the law amounts to an unconstitutional racial preference and, in addition to that, that the federal law impermissibly intrudes on state law. MARTIN: OK. So tell us about the lead plaintiffs in this case. TOTENBERG: Jennifer and Chad Brackeen are one of the several couples challenging the law. They had previously adopted an Indian boy, now age 7. And when they learned that his younger sister was in foster care, they had her transferred to their care. And now they're trying to adopt her, too, over the objections of the tribe and her great-aunt. I talked to the Brackeens earlier this month. JENNIFER BRACKEEN: We feel like her closest living relative is her brother. That's why we pushed to try to get her place with us. CHAD BRACKEEN: It's heartbreaking to us that there are laws out here that say it is better for her to live in a tribal home, any tribal home, before she is allowed to stay in our home with her brother. MARTIN: All right. So that's their argument. But what does the law say? What are the conflicting legal arguments? TOTENBERG: So those challenging the law, like the Brackeens, say it unconstitutionally categorizes children and prospective adoptive parents based on whether they're Indian or not. The tribes, on the other hand, note that the Constitution actually singles them out for special treatment. Under the Constitution, they're deemed sovereign nations, essentially a political, not a racial group. MARTIN: NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg. Thank you, Nina. TOTENBERG: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: Italy's new right-wing government is taking a harder line on the NGOs that rescue migrants in the Mediterranean Sea. INSKEEP: Migrants from Africa and Asia who are trying to get to Europe. Italy is blocking men from leaving the ships, and that has prompted at least one standoff at a Sicilian port. MARTIN: We're joined now by NPR's Sylvia Poggioli in Rome. She has been following all this. Good morning, Sylvia. SYLVIA POGGIOLI, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: What can you tell us about the situation at the ports right now? POGGIOLI: Well, the worst is Catania in Sicily, where the rescue ship, Humanity 1, which flies a German flag, was finally allowed to dock over the weekend. Of the original 179 migrants rescued, 35, all males remain on board. They're from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Egypt. The head of operations of the charity SOS Humanity, Till Rummenhohl, is on board and describes the situation. TILL RUMMENHOHL: We see frustration. We see them getting more and more depressed. People are having problems to eat properly because they don't understand the situation. They have so much uncertainty about their future. They are afraid of being pushed back into international waters by Italian authorities. POGGIOLI: And that's what the Italian government is threatening. MARTIN: So what's the scope of this situation? I mean, how many ships are trying to dock now with how many migrants? POGGIOLI: Another NGO ship, the Norwegian-flagged Geo Barents, was allowed to disembark some 500 migrants, leaving around 250 on board. The government is applying selective entry, insisting it's acting humanely but firmly. But the ship's captains refused to leave Catania Port, insisting the remaining migrants must be allowed to land and be allowed to apply for asylum. SOS Humanity is failing legal actions, with two Italian courts appealing the government's selective methods. MARTIN: So explain, Sylvia. You said that dozens of men are being kept on one of these ships, but lots of people have been let go. What are the criteria to determine who gets to get off the boat and who has to stay? POGGIOLI: Italy is allowing women and children and ill people to disembark. A team of doctors is sent on board to determine who's ill. Now there's a third ship, a German-flagged Mission Lifeline. With 89 migrants on board, it was allowed to dock at Reggio Calabria on the toe of the Italian boot. And the - all 89 migrants were allowed to leave the ship. The Italian authorities say that migrant rescue took place in a section of the sea that's under Italian jurisdiction, as determined by some international convention, while the other two ships rescued migrants in waters not under Italian jurisdiction. MARTIN: Is this a different position for the Italian government when it comes to migration? POGGIOLI: Well, it's - the new Italian government is just installed two weeks ago. It's a far-right coalition, and it wants to send a message to irregular migrants. It claims migrants should seek asylum in the countries under whose flags the rescue ship sail. In this case, it would be Norway and Germany. The government of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has accused the charity rescue ships of acting as a de facto taxi service for the many migrants from Africa and Asia trying to reach Europe and therefore allegedly encouraging human trafficking, although the U.N. has said that NGO rescues account for only 15% of migrants who arrive in Italy. But the deputy justice minister says Italy will no longer be migrants' punching bag. And here's what Lucio Malan, an MP from Meloni's Brothers of Italy Party, said Monday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LUCIO MALAN: (Speaking Italian). POGGIOLI: He said Ukraine migrants are women and children. African migrants are young males who shouldn't abandon their women and children. And then they staged these organized shipwrecks, he said, as if they were victims of the Titanic. Now, the government has threatened the boats with $50,000 fines if they don't leave the port of Catania. But the U.N. agencies for migration and refugees, as well as European Union officials, have called on Italy to allow all the migrants to be disembarked without delay. MARTIN: NPR's Sylvia Poggioli in Rome. Thanks, Sylvia. POGGIOLI: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Shoppers continue to face high prices on everyday goods. Inflation is the top voter concern in the midterm elections. Follow live updates and results from Election Day 2022 here. Like a movie monster from the 1970s, inflation is back and drawing crowds at a polling station near you. Rising prices are the number one concern for voters in this year's midterm elections, outpacing abortion, crime and other hot-button issues. More than one in three voters cited inflation as their most pressing priority, according to the latest NPR/PBS Newshour/Marist poll. \"Preserving democracy\" was a distant second. Republicans were seen as better than Democrats at tackling inflation by a wide margin. The election comes as consumer prices are climbing at near the fastest pace in four decades. Annual inflation in September was 8.2%. That's down only slightly from the 9% rate in June, which was the highest since 1981. The consumer price index for October is set to be released on Thursday. The surge in prices has fueled anxiety among Americans, who are paying more for gasoline, groceries and other necessities. Inflation was not on the radar two years ago Inflation was of little concern when President Biden first took office. Although the pandemic had triggered isolated price increases for things like lumber \u2014 the overall cost of living was climbing at less than 2% per year. The incoming administration was more concerned about jobs \u2014 fearing a repeat of the sluggish recovery that followed the global financial crisis. The unemployment rate in January of last year was 6.4% \u2014 down from nearly 15% in the early months of the pandemic. But with COVID-19 cases climbing, the economy had lost 115,000 jobs the month before Biden was sworn in. Congressional Democrats quickly passed a $1.9 trillion economic relief bill, which included direct payments of $1400 to most adults, along with expanded unemployment benefits and a new child tax credit. As economic stimulus, it was a success. Employers have added more than 10 million jobs since Biden took office. But Republicans blame the aggressive relief bill \u2014 which passed with no GOP support \u2014 for fueling runaway prices. \"Inflation is caused because of reckless Democrat spending,\" Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., told NPR's Morning Edition last week. Inflation is a global problem Other factors have undoubtedly contributed to high inflation, including the lingering effects of the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Inflation  has been even higher in the Eurozone and the United Kingdom than in the U.S., largely as a result of soaring energy costs tied to the Ukraine war. But some prominent Democrats acknowledge that last year's relief package played a role in overheating the economy and pushing prices higher. \"Now the bathtub is overflowing,\" said former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who had cautioned his fellow Democrats about just such an outcome.  \"And it's much easier to stop a bathtub from overflowing than it is to get the water back.\" The Federal Reserve responds For much of last year, the Federal Reserve believed that prices would cool off on their own, once supply chain snarls caused by the pandemic came untangled. But inflation proved to be higher and more stubborn than the central bank expected. This spring, the Fed began raising interest rates in an effort to tamp down demand and bring prices under control. Since March, the Fed has raised its benchmark rate six times, driving up borrowing costs for anyone trying to buy a house or a car or carrying a balance on a credit card. Fed chairman Jerome Powell warned last week that rates will likely have to go even higher than expected next year, although the increases may come in smaller increments. The Fed's crackdown, along with similar moves by other central banks, have raised the risk of a global economic slowdown. A GOP advantage Nearly half the voters surveyed in the NPR poll say Republicans would do a better job of controlling inflation, compared to just 27% who think Democrats would be more effective. While Republicans have capitalized on voters' frustration over rising prices, they've offered few concrete prescriptions for bringing inflation down. Asked about the GOP strategy on Morning Edition, Sen. Scott suggested spending cuts and increased domestic energy production. \"Step one, we've got to do in government what families do. You live within your means,\" said Scott, who chairs the Republican Senate Campaign Committee. \"On top of that, we've got to figure out how to produce energy in this country safely.\" Gasoline prices are a particularly potent symbol of inflation, and President Biden's approval rating seems to fall whenever pump prices jump. The average price of gasoline nationwide hit a record high of $5.01 a gallon in June, when sanctions against Russia sent world crude oil prices soaring. Gas prices have since declined to about $3.80, according to AAA.",

Michelle Steel are battling for California's 45th Congressional District, home to the largest Vietnamese community in the nation.\n                \n                    \n                    Jay Chen's campaign; Paul Bersebach/MediaNews Group/Orange County Register/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption From left: Democrat Jay Chen and Republican Rep. Michelle Steel are battling for California's 45th Congressional District, home to the largest Vietnamese community in the nation. Little Saigon in Orange County, Calif., boasts the largest concentration of Vietnamese people outside Vietnam. Democrat and congressional hopeful Jay Chen showed up one day in September, dressed in his uniform from the U.S. Navy Reserves. He was there to visit the Museum of the Republic of Vietnam, a one-room collection of artifacts donated by veterans and refugees of the country's civil war, tucked in the back corner of one of the shopping centers. Qu\u00e2n Nguy\u1ec5n, one of the founders of the museum, showed Chen around. A local reporter for a Vietnamese-language paper tagged along. \"When politicians come by, they always bring their own newspaper people,\" Nguy\u1ec5n said. Candidates come to such local highlights \u2014 and make a point of commemorating their visits in the press \u2014 because Vietnamese Americans make up the largest Asian American voting bloc in the area, a constituency that can swing an election. In the newly drawn congressional district of CA-45 that Chen is running in, they comprise 16% of all voters. Other key AAPI groups in the area include people of Korean, Chinese and Indian descent \u2014 together accounting for a third of all registered voters. Chen is Taiwanese American, and he is running against Republican incumbent and Korean American Michelle Steel. The election is a truly California affair: intersectional and immigrant, where race and political identity meet. The fight for Orange County underscores the complexity of the Asian American vote. Demographics are not destiny here \u2014 both Republican and Democratic strategists can pull data suggesting an AAPI swing one way or the other. It has become one of the most closely watched congressional races this election cycle, and will likely trigger a rethink for politicos on how they've traditionally surveyed Asian Americans. \"We're at a point now in our community where we can elevate two Asian Americans from both parties,\" Chen said. \"But I think we also have to look beyond that and recognize that it's the issues that matter, and hopefully Asian Americans are at a point where we don't vote just on a party or on an ethnicity, but we're voting based on what these individuals would do for the community.\" Nationally, Asian Americans are one of the fastest-growing groups of the U.S. electorate, with record voter turnout in 2020. Experts say the voting bloc cares about the same domestic issues as other voters. But with overseas connections still strong for many, especially first-generation voters, U.S. foreign policy ends up playing an unusual role in Asian American voter choice, a phenomenon known as homeland politics. The term describes how the political choices of immigrants are influenced by their attachments and concerns about their home country. The Museum of the Republic of Vietnam, for example, underscores the enduring ties people have to a place an ocean away, and suggests that current affairs in Asia remain a concern to many. \"China continues to be a key issue for Vietnamese American voters, particularly those concerned with nation-state or trade issues,\" explained Long Bui, an international studies professor at UC Irvine who studies Asian American populations. In contemporary geopolitics, Vietnam resents China's naval activities in waters it considers its own, and distrusts the growing power of the Chinese Communist Party. Little data is available tracking Asian American sentiment in this way, and surveys often do not account for differences within diaspora groups. Polls, for instance, jumble those from Taiwan under the umbrella \"Chinese American\" category \u2014 which, given Beijing's threats against Taipei and growing numbers of Taiwanese who reject that identity, fail to capture that group's assessment of the rise of China \u2014 one that is markedly different from immigrants directly from the People's Republic of China. For many Americans who have fled authoritarian states, there is often a preference for the party they believe has a tougher approach to non-democratic states. \"The Vietnamese American community really pays attention to U.S. foreign policy towards Chinese Communist expansion in the Asia-Pacific region,\" said Tri Ta, Republican mayor of Westminster, and supporter of the Steel campaign. \"We are strongly anti-Communist.\" Asian American Republicans may push that narrative, but the picture is complex. In the 2020 election, two-thirds of Asian Americans voted for Joe Biden; Donald Trump likely lost supporters with his anti-Asian rhetoric, particularly surrounding COVID-19 (\"Chinese virus,\" \"kung flu\"). But it's also true that in the same election, the GOP flipped two seats in California, ousting Democratic incumbents. Rep. Michelle Steel (2nd L) talks with reporters during a news conference with (L-R) House Republican Conference Chair Rep. Elise Stefanik, Rep. Mike McCaul and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise following a House Republican caucus meeting at the U.S. Capitol Visitors Center on October 20, 2021 in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Two Asian American women from Orange County won those districts: Michelle Steel and Young Kim. For many years, Kim had served as the outreach director and head of Asia affairs for now-retired Congressman, Ed Royce, and became a fixture in the AAPI community. While voters care most about domestic issues, both also campaigned as anti-Communist hawks. In Congress, Steel sits on the Congressional Executive Commission on China, which monitors Chinese human rights violations, while Kim has introduced bills such as the DICTATOR Act, which calls for investigating China's potential assistance to Russia in evading war sanctions. Encouraged by their success and in a drive to appeal to more AAPI voters, the Republican National Committee (RNC) opened a field office in Little Saigon last year. It's one of several across the country that the GOP has set up. \"The RNC has invested millions in authentically engaging with Asian Pacific Americans,\" said Nainoa Johsens, director of Asian Pacific American Media at the RNC. \"We are putting down roots in the community, having conversations, and earning votes.\" According to AAPIData, support for Democrats has dropped some 10 percentage points since 2020, though Asian Americans still lean Democrat. While the economy, education and crime are some of the group's top concerns, a majority of those polled also said U.S. foreign policy and national security are \"very important\" or \"extremely important\" to them, and AAPI voters remain split over which party is doing a better job on those two issues. \"This group is up for grabs,\" said Cliff Li, Executive Director of the National Committee of Asian American Republicans. But, he warned, \"It's so diversified you've got to do tons of homework to get to them.\" In CA-45, that means appealing to anti-Communist feelings among Vietnamese Americans. Wartime family histories also mean a common pro-military stance, which is where Chen and his service with the U.S. 7th Fleet could resonate. \"You have this Vietnamese community that's very cognizant of China's claims to the South China Sea, and just China's overall menacing presence,\" Chen said. \"And for the Taiwanese Americans also, this is top of mind.\" At times, it feels as if the two candidates are working to outdo the other with their tough-on-China credentials \u2014 and to cast suspicion on the other. Chen speaks at a veterans' event for his campaign. A member of the U.S. Navy Reserves, he has been emphasizing his military credentials to more moderate and conservative Asian Americans \u2014 and how he cares about their homeland politics.\n                \n                    \n                    Jay Chen's campaign\n                    \n                \nhide caption Steel recently sent out mailers to voters in Little Saigon suggesting Chen is sympathetic to China and is a Communist \u2014 complete with a doctored photo of him holding The Communist Manifesto. The Steel campaign cites his vote from a decade ago while on a local school board to work with the Confucius Institute, a Chinese government language outreach program that has since come under scrutiny for its attempts at some locations to censor criticism of China's human rights record. Chen has hit back, pointing out that Steel voted against the CHIPS Act, a multi-billion dollar government investment to catapult America's semiconductor industry, and a parry against China's own ambitions. Steel has only doubled down, recently airing an ad where two actors playing Chinese spies crow that Chen is \"one of us.\" The spot has received backlash from the Asian American community, including a rebuke from Committee of 100, which represents prominent Chinese Americans. Steel declined to be interviewed for this piece. Both candidates must tread with care and consider each slice of the AAPI community. Chinese Americans, for example, have \"a unique situation being sandwiched between two superpowers,\" said Li of the National Committee of Asian American Republicans. Many want to see improved relations between the United States and China. And for younger Asian Americans, \"homeland politics\" may not even play a role in their election decisions. \"There is an intergenerational dialogue happening now, where liberal ideas are on the rise but traditionalist ones have not yet been eclipsed,\" said Bui at UC Irvine. This group cares about social issues such as abortion and anti-racism. That too, must enter the calculus for candidates hoping to win here. Sunny Park, a Democrat and mayor of Buena Park in CA-45, sees a future where Democrats will gain in the once-conservative bastion where Richard Nixon was born and where Ronald Reagan kicked off his 1984 presidential reelection campaign. Actively mentoring future political leaders, Park said she's \"been working with other female political candidates in many other cities in Orange County.\" Until then, however, Orange County remains fluidly purple. For Chen, that means making that pitch to more moderate and conservative Asian Americans by emphasizing his military credentials \u2014 and how he cares about their homeland politics. \"I have a top secret security clearance,\" he said. \"I've served on the Korean Peninsula.\"",

            "article_content": "New York Times reporter Alexandra Berzon says election deniers are joining the electoral process at the precinct level. Their hope is to remake the machinery of American elections.  DAVE DAVIES, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross. Today's interview focuses on the midterm elections and concerns they could be marred by violence, intimidation or other challenges that undermine confidence in the results. FRESH AIR guest contributor Arun Venugopal has our interview. Here's Arun. ARUN VENUGOPAL, BYLINE: With just days to go before the midterm elections, millions of Americans have already cast their vote. And in some states, there are reports that turnout is greater than it's ever been. A lot is on the line including control of the House and Senate and the extent to which President Joe Biden can fulfill his agenda. But that's not all that's at stake. According to a joint intelligence bulletin obtained by ABC News, the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and the National Counterterrorism Center have issued a warning about a heightened threat of domestic violent extremism during the midterm elections due to perceptions of election fraud. And these perceptions could, in turn, be shaped by another phenomenon. In states across the country, Republican activists who believe the last election was stolen have been getting involved in the electoral process and attempting to reshape the very machinery of American elections. Well, many of those people say they're merely committed to election integrity. Democrats and some Republicans are concerned about disruptions at the polls that could end up casting doubt on the election. Our guest, Alexandra Berzon, is a reporter at The New York Times who's been following this process over the last year. Before joining the Times, Berzon worked at ProPublica and at The Wall Street Journal, where she was part of the team that won a Pulitzer Prize for its investigation of secret payments by Donald Trump to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal. Alexandra Berzon, welcome to FRESH AIR. ALEXANDRA BERZON: Thank you so much. VENUGOPAL: Let's go back to an in-depth piece you co-wrote with other reporters last year when you were at ProPublica. At the time, you said that Steve Bannon, who served as chief strategist in the Trump White House, had galvanized thousands of listeners of his podcast called \"War Room\" back in May of 2021. This was in the wake of the failed insurrection. Bannon proposed a different idea, a call to action in which listeners would seize control of the GOP from the bottom up. What exactly did he mean? BERZON: Yeah, what he was talking about - there was this idea that you would have activists really coming into the local Republican parties through the sort of ground up. And it had been around for a while, this sort of precinct strategy idea. But the notion was that we - that the Republican Party wanted to really get this kind of what they would call, like, the MAGA Republican, the really pro-Trump sort of Republicans, and especially also people who were going to continue this idea that the election was stolen. And one of the reasons why it was so important to have those people in there is because there are certain things that the party can do vis-a-vis elections that is somewhat different than just any outside activism. It really varies state by state. In some cases, it's more structured that way than others. But there are ways that the party can sort of appoint people into election offices. They can - in some states, they kind of point - poll workers. Poll watchers often come through the party. So that was one of the reasons why it was impactful to have people actually coming in through the Republican Party. But you also, at the same time, had a lot of other outside activist groups. Oftentimes, they were really kind of rebranding or repurposing of Tea Party groups, actually, that were now forming around this idea that the 2020 election was stolen and keeping it going all over the country. These groups were going on sort of both - so, again, within the party and then also outside of the Republican Party. VENUGOPAL: So we're talking about positions - like you said, precinct officers, but also election judges - right? - and inspectors. BERZON: Yeah. So the precinct officers or party officers - and they're also then often becoming part of what the leadership of the party is going to look like, both the county level and, in some cases, at the state level. But they also, in some cases, have some kind of role in saying, like, who should be poll workers? It really varies state by state. Sometimes, they just sign up - poll workers just sign up separately with the election offices. And in some states - like, in Colorado, for example, there was a situation where the Republican and Democratic Parties actually appoint the poll workers. And the Republican Party in El Paso County was actually pulling back some of the poll workers and saying, we don't want you, and we're not going to allow you to work. And the clerk there, who's a Republican himself - but he really felt strongly that these people were very - should be allowed to work. They had been longtime poll workers and were very able to do so. But because of their - they weren't people that were election deniers, they - the party didn't want them to work. But that was - a lot of other states don't necessarily operate that way, but that's just an example of the kind of - what can happen with a party. VENUGOPAL: You wrote that Steve Bannon has encouraged a kind of election vigilantism. What is that? And how do you think that can play out in the election? BERZON: Yes. So the election vigilantism, which I will say, you know, Bannon is certainly a mouthpiece for it, a very important one - but there's many others that are involved in kind of creating this idea and keeping it going and many of whom, I think it's important to note, were including Bannon, who we know, you know, had a strong role in the efforts in 2020 around trying to overturn the election at that point. So there's sort of - philosophy around it is Democrats cheat and steal elections, and the only way the Democrats really win is to cheat. And so we need to find this cheating, and we're going to kind of root it out of the system. And so they're coming at it from that perspective. They would also themselves say, you know, look, what we're doing is we're just trying to make the system run better and be legal and run in a legal way. But from the perspective of election officials and others who have looked at this closely - I mean, you know, you have just constant public records requests. You have people at the - just asking questions over and over again. And, you know - and in some ways, you know, a lot of this is - like, on its face, there's nothing wrong with this. There's - you know, the idea of a transparent election system is one that everyone should support. But it does become almost to a point where it's made the jobs very difficult to do. And the other thing it's done is created this whole idea of, like, let's look for problems. And then, what they did last time was they had all these people who looked for issues. And then, after they wanted to challenge the results, they then presented that as sort of supposed evidence that would justify overturning an election. And I think that's the concern this time around as well, is that you could use this kind of thing to continue to challenge results as well as to continue to just undermine the idea of fair elections in the country among a very large number of people. VENUGOPAL: Let's talk about Steve Bannon's call to action. To what extent did people get involved in the election process, and where? BERZON: So it's a little hard to judge right now. Bannon, for himself, is very boastful about it. He has said that it's - that - he's basically said, look, we're a hundred times or more organized than we were last time in 2020. We have a complete plan - that he talks about as far as challenging all the ballots that they can and at the polling places and especially at the counting places and that they're going to be a very constant presence. I don't think we know yet, you know, to what extent this is really borne out. There's one network that I've looked at closely through Cleta Mitchell, who's been on Bannon's show a lot and speaks a lot about this network of activists that she's organized. She was one of the lawyers that was involved in trying to overturn the results in 2020. And she's talked about recruiting 20,000 people through that network. That network also works a lot with the RNC, which has also talked about recruiting thousands - somewhere around that number - or more. That's for both poll watchers and poll workers through this recruitment effort. And they've really said, look; this is going to be a much more organized kind of situation this time around. And a lot of the elections officials already this week are saying they're getting much more people signed up to be poll monitors, poll workers. There's groups in Michigan saying - there's officials in Michigan that are saying that they have a number of more activist groups signed up to be the poll monitors than they ever had before. So certainly, this is - does seem to be appearing. VENUGOPAL: Our guest is New York Times reporter Alexandra Berzon. We'll be back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF CUONG VU AND PAT METHENY'S \"SEEDS OF DOUBT\") VENUGOPAL: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Arun Venugopal, back with Alexandra Berzon, a reporter for The New York Times. One person who's leading the process of training these people entering the system is Cleta Mitchell. You mentioned her earlier. She runs the Election Integrity Network. She says she's trained more than 20,000 people, according to your reporting. What exactly is she training people to do that's different from the norm? BERZON: So her training is around the idea of - as you had mentioned, this idea of vigilantism. She calls it the citizens detective agency. So the idea is there is wrongdoing, as I mentioned earlier, that, you know, Democrats cheat. The only way they're going to win is to cheat. And we're going to catch them. They have manuals. They have a lot of training seminars they've done all over the country. And then they form these statewide coalitions, as well as encouraging people to form local, county-level task forces. And what they're telling people to do is basically go to election offices. Constantly spend time at election offices. Talk to election the election officials and then to be extremely vigilant in their kind of monitoring the elections, with looking for any sort of potential thing they could consider an anomaly. And more recently, there's been some reporting that has showed how they're then talking now about using that to then create challenges to the results, if that's what they choose to do. VENUGOPAL: Cleta Mitchell's manual, \"The Citizen's Guide To Building An Election Integrity Infrastructure,\" has worried certain election experts, in part because it involves ideas like surveillance. What kind of surveillance is she advocating? BERZON: Well, one of the things they were saying even was to investigate your local elections officials, your local - the folks at the attorney general's office that deal with elections and to see, you know, are they friend or foe? So it's this idea of, like, our side and our people kind of with us and really trying to figure that out. And that was concerning amid a lot of attacks on election officials and, just in general, them feeling really like they're almost being driven out by this kind of vigilantism. I've talked to a number of election officials who have either resigned recently or are planning to under this kind of stress that they have felt that they're experiencing. There was also to basically spend a lot of time at election offices. I mean, they do talk a lot about, like, being polite, following rules and - but just being of really constant presence in any way possible under the - that the law allows. VENUGOPAL: In Cleta Mitchell's training, as you say, she's been telling people to spend time at election offices. What are they supposed to do there? BERZON: Well, they're supposed to be talking to - you know, they're asking questions. They're just looking at all the procedures. They're seeing, is there anything at all that they - you know, you could see that's not something they say should happen? In some cases, that's then led to lawsuits. And so, you know, document - they say document everything. Document, document, document. It's also just, you know, constantly kind of just being - trying to kind of tell the election officials, no, you should be doing it this way. One of the things that some of these groups have been doing recently is, there's been a number of lawsuits and other efforts to try to force some of the local elections offices to use their poll workers or Republican poll workers or theirs in particular, the ones they want to use, and to also put those positions into leadership positions. And the idea is just to be kind of a constant presence. And more recently - I think I mentioned earlier, but more recently there's been - you know, we've been seeing that there's more explicit parallel, where they're drawing between this idea of sort of document everything, find these issues and then telling people that we're going to then use that information to make challenges if the results end up in a way that we want to challenge the results, then we'll have all of this to use, which is exactly what happened in 2020. Now, the courts rejected that. But we saw just what can happen when you bring these cases and you bring all these challenges is, you create more of a sense in the public that something is really wrong. And we saw where that led in 2020. So the - you know, even just recently, Politico had a story where they quoted John Eastman, who was involved in the efforts in 2020 to overturn the election, was saying that - he was telling people to document everything they're seeing. And then he's saying that becomes the basis for an affidavit in a court challenge. VENUGOPAL: And how does this concern, I guess, election experts or, you know, polling site workers who might be used to a different kind of culture? In what sense does that sort of disrupt the norm? BERZON: Yeah. I mean, I think that it's been very disruptive for election officials to feel that they're, you know, constantly explaining things to people. But then, there's this sort of refusal to accept that, and they just keep pushing further. And that has been frustrating to the officials I've - that I've talked to. And then, there's also just a us-against-them sort of attitude that doesn't - it really hadn't been brought into the elections process in this way until more recently, the idea that, you know, we're out to catch you and that you're doing something wrong, instead of starting from the idea that, you know, this is just a process that maybe if you make a mistake, like, OK, you'll fix that. But this is really more, like, trying to kind of be very oppositional to the elections procedures, is the sense that the elections officials have. And, you know, again, I think these groups will say, OK, we're trying to just - we're trying to, like, make the process go better. But that has not been the experience from the officials that I've spoken to where they've experienced this. VENUGOPAL: This week, a federal judge ruled in a situation involving a group that was trying to, I guess, execute this kind of surveillance you're referring to and that, too, with, you know, armed men and women. The party - the group is called Clean Elections USA. What kind of surveillance were they, I guess, hoping to commit to? And what did this judge rule? BERZON: Well, the judge has now ruled - my understanding is that the - there's limitations on what the group can do in terms of their surveillance. This is a group that also has grown out of this kind of just larger conspiracy theory world that has developed since the 2020 election. And one of the conspiracy theories that really took off is this idea that there's these ballot mules, they call them, that are people that are dropping off ballots on behalf of other people and that that somehow is creating all this fraud. And there's really no basis for it. The movie that publicized this idea has been really debunked in numerous ways as well as the ideas that the group behind it were promoting. But the - there was a woman who kind of took that idea and decided to create a national campaign around it. And she then has been promoting it very much on Steve Bannon's show as well as social media. And they've been recruiting people to kind of be these vigilantes of the drop boxes. So people go, and they kind of stake out the drop boxes. They watch people. They videotape people as they're dropping off ballots. And they're trying to supposedly catch these people that they think are doing something illegal though there's really no sign that this is some kind of widespread problem. VENUGOPAL: The idea of election fraud is largely premised on noncitizens voting in U.S. elections - immigrants, right? Among the groups you've been covering, is it ever made explicitly clear that what some people are opposed to is not simply election fraud, which is actually extremely rare, but changing demographics and a multiracial democracy? BERZON: In terms of - especially, I had mentioned earlier this movie \"2000 Mules,\" which came out. And the idea behind that movie is that there's these groups that are basically taking ballots to - on behalf of other people. And it's this idea of - they call it ballot mules or ballot trafficking. A number of my colleagues have - who are out on the campaign trail more than I am, they've reported on kind of seeing that used in a way that is amplifying this kind of tropes, racist tropes about, you know, they're going to replace you. And the sort of idea behind that is that there's all these people that shouldn't be voting that are voting although it's not necessarily explicitly in that movie. But that's the way it's kind of being used or suggested and that it's kind of playing on a lot of those ideas. And that movie, \"2000 Mules,\" has definitely been a presence. VENUGOPAL: And of course, mule, a play on the idea of the drug mule, who is presumably coming across the border bringing in something toxic from elsewhere. BERZON: Exactly. So it's the idea that there's people who are - right. Exactly. It's people that are coming across the border, and they're this thread. And it's really kind of evoking this fear in people that comes out of this idea. DAVIES: New York Times reporter Alexandra Berzon speaking with our guest interviewer, Arun Venugopal. They'll be back after a short break. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF JESSICA WILLIAMS TRIO'S \"BLUES R US\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. Some of Donald Trump's supporters are still hoping to overturn the results of the 2020 election. But others have turned their attention to the upcoming midterm election. New York Times reporter Alexandra Berzon has been reporting on this movement to get activists who believe the 2020 election was stolen to run for local election offices. Berzon spoke with FRESH AIR contributor Arun Venugopal. VENUGOPAL: At least in my experience, polling sites tend to be kind of sleepy, uneventful places. If you're lucky, you're in and out, and you have an I-voted sticker to show for it. What are the implications of what Bannon and all these other Republicans have done? BERZON: Yeah, I mean, one of the things is just to make people think that this is some kind of widespread - you know, when we were reporting on it and we're talking about it, then people kind of think even more, like, there's this really widespread intimidation that I'm going to get at my polling place or I'm going to get if I drop off my ballot. And a lot of elections experts and officials I've been talking to, especially in the last week or two, are quite concerned about this. There was some polling that came out that showed that people really think that, like - there are - a very high percentage of people think that they're going to face intimidation or problems voting. And a lot of voting advocates lately have said, look, like, most people - like, it's really not going to be common. You're going to be able to vote. It's going to be fine. I mean, there really is not widespread - we should say, like, there is not widespread problems with voting. There's not, you know, major issues we're hearing about so far. There's early voting going on, both with absentee as well as in person. And the kind of idea of incidences - you know, the groups that are monitoring this are not seeing major problems. The issue is really more of what - you know, what could play out in just - in the time ahead from the - from having challenges and legal cases and having this just - if the results are close. I mean, that's really where you might see more issues. But the actual voting process really has not been - seems to be holding up just fine as far as anything we can see with that. So that's definitely very important to kind of - for, you know, folks to understand, I think. VENUGOPAL: Some of the people who preached the precinct strategy also threatened violence. You quote one person, a far-right blogger by the name of Jim Condit Jr. of Cincinnati, who described the strategy as the last alternative to violence short of resorting to the Second Amendment, he said, adding, which none of us want to do. Another activist, Daniel Schultz, said at a conference call, make sure everybody's got a baseball bat. I'm serious about this. Make sure you've got people who are armed. Are you seeing these threats materialize? Is there reason to believe baseball bats and guns are going to be part of this precinct strategy? BERZON: The fact is there are - there have been violent threats within the election denial movement. Specifically, there are people who talk about, you know, these people should be hung for treason. There are violent words said. There has not, at this point, translated into any kind of sense that there's violence at the polls or any risks or threats to people voting or to any specific idea around that. And I think that's important for people to understand. Because you can get - you know, you can - you could start to get nervous just to, like, go and vote. And that hasn't materialized, and - but clearly, there's - you know, the rhetoric has been heating up over the last year or so. We saw it obviously with the - Paul Pelosi. VENUGOPAL: The husband of Nancy Pelosi, who was recently violently attacked. BERZON: Yeah. So, I mean, there is definitely - and just the amount of - you know, you're continuing to convince people, and people are continuing to be convinced that there is this incredibly - that there is basically this conspiracy. I mean, and some part - some aspects of this idea is that there's this global conspiracy to hack voting machines and that - or Democrats are stealing election. There's - the ideas are very extreme that are being spread. And so the - that is creating - I think the concern from people that really study this and from election officials is that it's creating an atmosphere of this just complete undermining of a faith in democracy if you really think that the election system in this country is broken. And that is when eventually you could end up getting to some sort of violence. And yes, there is rhetoric around it. We're not there yet. But clearly, there's warnings of risk that, you know - and there is concern. And I think it comes from just this undermining of the idea that the elections are secure. And the conspiracies around them are so - they sound so terrible to people. And they're being spread quite widely. And the belief has been held, and it hasn't gone away. VENUGOPAL: It's not like longtime election officials are just taking all this lying down. You write that some have spent months preparing for potential disruptions and even participated in exercises organized by the FBI. What can you tell us about how they are preparing for possible problems on Election Day? BERZON: Yeah, there's been a lot of preparation around this. You know, there's a lot more awareness, I think, about the idea of misinformation and disinformation and somewhat more kind of just trying to figure out ways to communicate and combat that. There's also been increases in security. Some of the places have changed the layout of where they kind of put certain things and have created different procedures. As you mentioned, we had reported about these FBI tabletop exercises. The FBI has set up these election task forces in - people that are in, I believe, all the states - that are point people for this. And there's definitely a lot of awareness and preparation around all of this this year. VENUGOPAL: When it comes to elections for secretary of state, what could be the potential impact on the 2024 election? How many states could this make a big difference in? BERZON: Yeah, there's actually a number of states where the Republican secretary of state candidates are really part of - in some cases, really very much part of kind of this election denier and really kind of conspiracy theory type of world about elections that have grown out of that. One is - and some of them are in quite significant states for the presidential election - Arizona, Nevada and Michigan being the main ones for that. And those candidates also - one of the things we reported on - had really gotten together and done this in quite a concerted way through an effort organized by some of the same folks who had been involved in trying to overturn the 2020 election. So this has been - there's a group called the \"America First\" slate of candidates, and there's a number of them that are now on the ballot. And so this is - there's some very significant secretary of state races. VENUGOPAL: What are the ways in which a secretary of state can impact an election and its results? BERZON: Well, there's many ways a secretary of state can impact - I mean, one of them is - they do a lot of the investigations and make sure that elections are functioning properly. They do a lot of the - they often are giving out rules and guidance to local officials, the local election officials. And so, you know, for example, you know, they can be very proactive in terms of just rooting out any potential issues or concerns. And they also issue guidance often on things like the role of poll monitoring and just any kind of - they basically are kind of guiding the local election officials on how to follow the law. And so there's a lot of influence that can come from that office just in terms of directing or telling local officials how to do things. I think that one of the things is, like, we're really - you know, if some of these folks win, we're going to kind of see how far that goes. I mean, some of them want to move to things like hand-counting ballots, which, you know, experts and election officials say is really - could be a major problem because you would end up having - you know, there's more inaccuracies than machine counting. Ballots are so extensive and so long in this country typically that it could take an incredible amount of time. So people will realize, you know, election results will not be decided quickly if this were the case. I think the other thing the secretary of state does is just also offers kind of the - you know, it's just important to get very good information about elections. And often that comes from the secretary of state's office. So if you had people in office that are, you know, already giving out bad information about elections, misinformation, then that could become a potential, you know, issue. VENUGOPAL: Have you had any direct interactions with people who are planning poll-watching actions like the drop box vigilantes? BERZON: I have not spoken myself to the drop box folks. I've certainly been in touch with many activists in general. I've gone to many of their conferences, and I've gone to a number of these types of meetings. I've spoken to many folks. And one of the things that really comes out of it - and these are the people that are really now devoting their lives to this issue. So it's not at all representative of your average voter or person in the Republican base or whatnot. But there really is very strong passion among many activists on that side about this issue because there is this belief that the system has been stolen away from them. And so it's really a certain sort of passion or zealotry, whatnot, within this particular activist base of people, I would say. VENUGOPAL: Alexandra Berzon, thanks so much for joining us today.

America First Legal, an organization launched by former Donald Trump aide Stephen Miller, is behind many of the political ads targeting transgender kids that have run in at least 25 states. Research from the Human Rights Campaign indicates that \"a significant portion\" of the ad spending has been directed toward Black and Spanish-speaking voters through radio, mail, TV and digital means. America First Legal spent $4 million to get its ads on Black and Spanish-language radio in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas, according to the Human Rights Campaign. The narrator of an America First Legal radio ad accuses President Biden of pushing children to take cross-sex hormone medication and get gender-affirming surgery. \"The Biden administration is pushing radical gender experiments on children, changing their names, clothes, identities and bodies,\" the narrator says. \"They want boys in our daughters' bathrooms and sports teams.\" Citizens for Sanity, another group formed by former Trump administration aides, spent $20 million on TV ads in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania that focus on illegal immigration, crime and other issues. Both America First Legal and Citizens for Sanity do not make any mention of candidates running for office in their ads. Polling shows that transgender-related issues are not typically a top priority for voters, but controversies surrounding transgender athletes competing in women's sports have made headlines this year. Yale University swimmer Iszac Henig and then-University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas broke records in the Ivy League championships in February, stirring debate as to whether transgender women should be allowed to compete on women's teams. In June, the world governing body for swimming, FINA, voted to effectively ban transgender women from women's swimming competitions. Another radio ad funded by America First Legal that spread in October promoted claims of \"anti-white bigotry\" and accused the White House of putting white people last in line for COVID-19 relief funds. \"When did racism against white people become OK?\" the narrator says. \"The left's anti-white bigotry must stop.\" Miller has been seen as pushing for an anti-immigrant, white nationalist agenda since his time as Trump's chief immigration adviser. In 2019, the Southern Poverty Law Center said it obtained hundreds of leaked emails in which Miller detailed white nationalist ideas. America First Legal was created as the conservative version of the American Civil Liberties Union, a nonpartisan and nonprofit organization that advocates for abortion rights and transgender rights.",

The fight for the Senate couldn't be tighter. The chamber is 50-50 and the top Senate contests are as close as they can get. Republicans need to net one pickup to take control. As the election nears, it is coming down to only half a dozen seats or less with really four that could provide the key \u2014 Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona. Pennsylvania is so important to Democrats, because if Lt. Gov. John Fetterman can hold on against celebrity TV doctor Mehmet Oz, then Republicans would need to win two of three of Georgia, Nevada and Arizona. If Oz is able to pull it out, then Republicans' path to control opens up. Of course, those aren't all the races. Here's a look at our last top 10 seats (which we are expanding to 11 in this issue) most likely to flip before final votes are cast Tuesday (Toss Up and Lean ratings are based on the Cook Political Report). Check out our previous look at where things stood in the key races, which also ranked them in order of most likely to change hands. Left: Dr. Mehmet Oz speaks onstage at the Good Health is Good Business panel at The Town Hall during 2016 Advertising Week New York on Sept. 29, 2016, in New York City. Right: Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate John Fetterman holds a rally at Nether Providence Elementary School on Oct. 15 in Wallingford, Pa.\n                \n                    \n                    Slaven Vlasic/Stringer via Getty Images; Mark Makela/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption With Republican Sen. Pat Toomey's retirement, this state has become Democrats' top pick-up opportunity. Despite the difficult national landscape for Democrats, Republicans have struggled because Oz has not been well liked. Conservatives didn't like that Trump endorsed him, and his favorability ratings with independents are upside down. A flood of ads from Republican outside groups hitting Fetterman on crime helped close the gap in this race, but Fetterman has won statewide before, is a known quantity and is better liked than Oz. Democrats are betting those factors mostly insulate him from a difficult debate performance that exposed his auditory processing difficulties in recovering from a stroke earlier this year. Previous: 1 Republican Herschel Walker, left, is challenging incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga. Walker is facing allegations he paid an ex to have an abortion despite his hard-right stance on the issue.\n                \n                    \n                    Megan Varner/Getty Images; Elijah Nouvelage/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption This race pits Democratic incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock against former University of Georgia and NFL star Herschel Walker. Republicans have struggled to define Warnock in this race, though they have tried to tie him to Biden's policies in this state that leans Republican, especially in a midterm with high inflation and Biden's approval rating under water. But then there's the complication that is Walker for Republicans. Walker was boosted to the nomination by Trump, but has had a seemingly endless stream of controversies and scandals, from domestic violence accusations to the number of children he's fathered to women who say Walker urged them to get abortions. Walker is staunchly \u2014 publicly \u2014 against abortion rights. This is a state that will see lots of crossover voters, voting for both incumbent Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Warnock. Kemp is the heavy favorite in his race for reelection over Democrat Stacey Abrams. That means there are going to have to be a whole lot of Kemp-Warnock voters for Warnock to pull off reelection. Another factor: if no one gets above 50%, this race would head to a runoff on Dec. 6. If that happens, there's the very real possibility that control of the Senate won't be known until some time after then. Previous: 2 Republicans in recent weeks have started to feel very good about their chances here. Trump-backed challenger Adam Laxalt, a former state attorney general who denies the result of the 2020 presidential election, is a political scion in the state. His father was a senator and his grandfather a governor. Democrats continue to say incumbent Catherine Cortez Masto is running a good campaign, but the political environment makes it an uphill battle. The state has high white- and Latino working-class populations, which have struggled to recover financially from the effects of the pandemic. Latinos are a key voting bloc here for Democrats, and the party needs them to turn out to vote. In past years, Democrats have been able to mobilize their base to eke out close victories in Senate and presidential elections, but with the late Sen. Harry Reid no longer running the state's political machine, that traditionally vaunted get-out-the-vote effort is going to be put to the test. Previous: 3 Democratic incumbent Mark Kelly, left, is holding up well against Trump-backed Republican Blake Masters, right, in the Arizona Senate race, but it's shaping up to be a tight finish.\n                \n                    \n                    Julia Nikhinson/Bloomberg via Getty Images; Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Incumbent Democrat Mark Kelly has led this race against Trump-backed Republican challenger Blake Masters for months, but as operatives in both parties have expected, this race has tightened considerably. Arizona is a place where Republicans outnumber Democrats and where independents really matter. That's the hurdle for both incumbent Kelly and Masters. For Kelly, it's the difficult economy and immigration in this border state that have put him on defense. He has tried to distance himself, for example, from Biden's border policies. For Masters, it's been his shifting positions on whether Trump won the 2020 election and abortion. He ran an ad during his primary claiming falsely that Trump did win, but in the general election he says he now believes he didn't. He also backtracked on his hardline stance on abortion, having called himself \"100% pro-life\" and even advocating for a federal \"personhood\" law \"that recognizes that unborn babies are human beings that may not be killed.\" Both of those have been scrubbed from his website, and he now describes his position in ads as \"common sense,\" while trying to paint Kelly as an \"extremist\" on the issue. Putting Masters at a disadvantage is the finger pointing between the Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell-tied Senate Leadership Fund and Masters' billionaire mentor, Peter Thiel. Thiel poured in millions at the beginning of the campaign to boost Masters, and McConnell's group wanted Thiel to spread it around more to other GOP campaigns. That hasn't happened, Senate Leadership Fund has pulled out of Arizona and Thiel hasn't been supporting Masters' campaign financially as he had been in the primary. Previous: 4 Incumbent Ron Johnson seems to have an edge in this race, although both sides expect this one to be close because of the state's evenly \u2013 and hotly \u2013 divided electorate. Johnson hasn't backed down from controversial positions, and isn't very well liked in the state. That said, he's well aware of how he's viewed, has run a hard-nosed campaign and may have the slightest edge. Republicans have run a deluge of ads attacking Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes on crime \u2014 and Johnson has seen a boost in the polls as a result. Barnes is going after Johnson on abortion now, and Democrats expect this race to tighten and likely be a 1-to-2 point race, as so many statewide races in this sharply politically polarized state have been. Previous: 5 Left: Representative Ted Budd speaks during a Save America rally for former President Donald Trump at the Aero Center Wilmington on September 23, 2022 in Wilmington, North Carolina. Right: North Carolina Democratic Senate candidate Cheri Beasley speaks to a crowd during an election night event on May 17, 2022 in Raleigh, North Carolina.\n                \n                    \n                    Allison Joyce/Getty Images; Sean Rayford/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Put simply: Republicans have the advantage here because of the partisan lean of the state. It's not because Republican Rep. Ted Budd has run a particularly effective campaign. Budd got Trump's endorsement and that got him through the primary, but Budd has been outraised and outspent by Democrat Cheri Beasley. Budd's campaign spent a paltry $7 million on TV ads through Oct. 17. So outside groups, like SLF, have had to come in to keep a pro-GOP presence on the airwaves in a significant way, spending $64 million on Budd's behalf. Previous: 6 This race has quickly receded as a top GOP target. Republicans saw incumbent Democrat Maggie Hassan as a generic Democrat, someone they could pick off in a swing state in a year when the president's approval rating is upside down. The problem is the GOP didn't get a generic Republican out of their primary.  Republicans missed out on recruiting Republican Gov. Chris Sununu, who is popular in the state, and wound up with controversial retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc. Bolduc has aligned himself with Trump, denies the 2020 election results, has boosted vaccine conspiracies and has raised and spent very little money. Republican outside groups had been playing heavily in this state, but after a $26 million investment from the Senate Leadership Fund, it pulled up stakes recently. But pay attention to the margin here. Polls close at 8 p.m. ET, and if Hassan is struggling or behind, it could be a big night for Republicans. If not, control of the Senate will be fairly narrow, as expected. Previous: 7 Left: Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, speaks during a rally on May 2 in Lorain, Ohio. Right: J.D. Vance, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Ohio, speaks during a rally hosted by former President Donald Trump at the Delaware County Fairgrounds on April 23 in Delaware, Ohio.\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption This is a state where operatives in both parties strongly urged ignoring the polls throughout this campaign. While Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan held eyebrow-raising leads here for some time over struggling Trump-backed Republican J.D. Vance, people close to both campaigns emphasized that the Republican lean of this state would likely move it in Vance's direction. That was helped by the Senate Leadership Fund pouring in about $30 million to boost Vance, and relatively little spent by Democratic outside groups on behalf of Ryan. Ryan's campaign has spent about $35 million on TV, while outside groups only spent $8.5 million through Oct. 17, a signal that Democrats haven't been confident about this as a real potential takeover. Vance was never the conservative favorite. Trump came in, surprisingly endorsed him and Vance won. Now, ironically, Vance has had to rely on McConnell's group to help him try and get across the finish line. Previous: 8 Democratic incumbent Michael Bennet has been pushed in this race by wealthy Republican businessman Joe O'Dea, who has struck a moderate chord, particularly on abortion rights and partisanship. The race looks like it could be decided in single digits, though Bennet is still favored. Democrats started to spend more money in the state to help shore it up. They have hit O'Dea on gun safety and are accusing him of \"talking out of both sides of his mouth\" on abortion. Republican outside groups, on the other hand, perhaps seeing the Democratic lean of the state, have not played as strongly here as some other places. Resources are finite, and Republicans are happy to see Democrats have to use some of theirs in this Democratic-leaning state. Previous: 10 Left: Rep.

He's gone after the \"radical left\" \u2014 even airing ads claiming, \"They indoctrinate children and try to turn boys into girls. ... If you speak out, they ban you on social media and call you a racist.\" His strategy has been to try and tie his challenger, Democratic Rep. Val Demings, a former police chief in Orlando, to progressive policies. Demings has raised significant amounts of money and polls had shown her making this a race over the summer. But, as so often happens, as voting gets closer, the partisan lean of a state tends to weigh out. Something to watch in Florida elections is what effect the recovery from Hurricane Ian will have. The campaigns were still scrambling to figure that out in the final weeks. Previous: 9 The Senate race here has become one where Democrats are taking no chances. Incumbent Democrat Patty Murray has been trying to stave off a fairly strong challenge from Republican veterans advocate Tiffany Smiley. Smiley has hammered Murray on inflation, crime and homelessness in the state, and recent surveys have shown her outpacing Murray with independents. Murray is still the favorite in this state Biden won by 20 points, but her lead in public and private polling has gone into single digits in the last few weeks. Outside groups Women Vote and EMILY's List have poured in more than $6 million on TV ads in recent weeks to boost Murray, focusing on abortion rights. Murray has touted her tenure and some pieces of recently passed Democratic legislation, even as Smiley has tried to use those very things against her.

One force behind that shift is the county's growing share of Asian American voters. Nationwide, Asian Americans are the fastest-growing racial or ethnic group. And while it is an ethnically diverse group of voters, nearly two-thirds of them voted Democrat in the last two elections. But now, in these midterm elections, Democrats are worried that some of that recent Asian American support could erode, which could make all the difference in close races, like California's 45th District. The campaign for the Democratic candidate in this race is unfolding on the second floor of a strip mall, right above a pho restaurant in the heart of Orange County. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Getting out the vote? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: We need all the luck right now (laughter). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Yeah, we'll take all we can get. CHANG: This is the campaign office of Democrat Jay Chen, one of two Asian Americans competing for this seat. And on a recent weekend, volunteers like Malia Williamson (ph) prepare to canvass voters in this majority Asian American congressional district. MALIA WILLIAMSON: Asian American voters are - there's a bit of hesitation when it comes to voting. And we need to reach out to them and let them know that their vote does matter. CHANG: Their vote does matter to Chen's campaign because Republican Michelle Steel is slightly favored to win this race. And, you know, even though Chen's a Democrat, his volunteers have been courting Republican Asian American voters who've grown disillusioned with their party. It's a shift that Huang Nguyen (ph), a Chen volunteer, has seen happening in his own Vietnamese American family. HUANG NGUYEN: They were formerly Republicans, and they just feel like the Republican Party has been too extreme for them. And that is saying something. These are lifelong Republicans. KARTHICK RAMAKRISHNAN: Over time, the Republican Party lost its way in terms of not investing enough in the growing Asian American population and diversifying Asian American population in Orange County. CHANG: Karthick Ramakrishnan is a professor at UC Riverside, and he directs the National Asian American Survey. He says this movement of Asian American voters away from the Republican Party - it's been happening all over this country in recent decades. RAMAKRISHNAN: What you saw between 1992 and 2012 was the most dramatic shift for any group - not just racial group - any voting demographic in this country - shift from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party. So Asian American voters voted for George H.W. Bush over Clinton. And by 2012, you know, they had among the strongest levels of support for Obama over Romney. CHANG: One of those voters who swung to the left for Obama is Eugene Hung (ph), a 51-year-old Chinese American voter in Orange County. EUGENE HUNG: 2012 was the first time I voted Democratic for the presidency. CHANG: Hung says, look, he voted Republican for decades, but he voted for Obama in 2012 because he says he saw the Republican Party changing in ways that didn't make him feel included. HUNG: We don't seem to be as welcome in the Republican Party. I mean, they purposely seem to be emphasizing rhetoric and policy that seems to say to people like me that we don't really need you. CHANG: And now, Hung isn't registered with either party. To better understand how this political shift is playing out today among Asian American voters, we talked to two longtime Republicans who are in the middle of rethinking their allegiance to the GOP. The first is a former Republican politician from Orange County, Tyler Diep, who is Vietnamese American. He was a state assemblyman and served on his city council. Now, Diep supports Republican Michelle Steel, but he recently de-registered from the Republican Party. TYLER DIEP: I just can no longer wear the Republican label at this time, especially after the Republican Party tried to whitewash what happened on January 6, 2021. It was really the last straw for me. I believe, at this time, the Republican Party is not a party of ideas or principle. It is now becoming a party of one person. And because of that, I re-registered to no party preference or, in this case, like an independent. CHANG: Meanwhile, Violet Ji, who's still a registered Republican, is volunteering for her district's Democratic House candidate, Katie Porter. Ji is a Chinese American voter in Orange County. VIOLET JI: At this moment, I feel like registration doesn't really matter, right? I want to do the right thing and to choose the right leader rather than see the party. So I'm looking for a good candidate. CHANG: I asked Diep and Ji what values first drew them to the Republican Party. JI: So at that time, I feel like the Republican policies better to the middle class. They also cared about, like, family values, right? But I think, back then, family values doesn't mean you are, like, homophobia, you know? So there was no such divided opinions like today, you know? But back then, I feel like it was pretty calm and friendly. CHANG: It didn't feel as polarizing - the politics back then. JI: Yeah, exactly. CHANG: What about you, Tyler? What drew you to the party? DIEP: It was opportunity and the ability to make something out of my life by being a Republican. And what attracted me to stay in the party - the GOP - because of freedom, the ability to work hard and make something out of your life. As a first-generation immigrant, I valued that a lot. And I think that's something that also attracted a lot of Asian American to the Republican Party. CHANG: Well, yeah, we just heard Tyler articulate some of the values that he believes are Republican values. Violet, was there some point - a time where you felt the Republican Party lost you in some way - lost your vote? JI: Yeah, I feel like it is, right? So I think since Donald Trump, I started losing the faith on this party. I don't believe this party is Republican anymore, to be honest. CHANG: I want to delve into that a little more. You felt alienated from the Republican Party increasingly during the Trump administration. Can you explain why? What did you see? What did you feel during the Trump administration that made you disconnect from the party? JI: Yeah. Like, starting in 2016, I personally experienced, like, racial discrimination, you know, on the street. Like, for example, one night I was in, like, a nearby Target parking lot. I was in a car, and I saw a white lady. She made that Asian face - like, the eyes - to me, like, kind of, like, insulting to an Asian woman. CHANG: Right. JI: That's not acceptable. So I feel like, you know, a lot of Asian hate that's coming from there. Since 2016, Trump become president, and he promoted that environment. Before, it was not, like, that obvious. But after 2016, it was really obvious to the community. CHANG: Tyler, I want to turn to you now. You're a voter in the 45th District now, which is a closely watched swing district in California. I know that you no longer work in politics full-time, but you did endorse the Republican candidate in your district, Michelle Steel. So it seems like there are still elements of the Republican platform that appeal to you. Can you talk about what those elements are? DIEP: I believe that we should have less taxes in this country and less government involved in our daily lives. Like, a lot of my friends are small business owner, just like a lot of first-generation immigrants, where, you know, they just don't have the ability to go to college. So to make a better life for them and their family, they tend to open up a small shop, a small restaurant. And what they want and what I want is less regulations. You know, like, these days, in order to open a small company - right? - in California, you have to go through so many layer of governments. We just want to be left alone so that we can run our own noodle shop or do the thing that we want without seeing a government inspector breathing down our neck. CHANG: Well, I am curious - which party now do you think does a better job at engaging Asian American voters or seems to be intentionally engaging Asian American voters? JI: I don't know if it is intentional or not - right? - but we care about the results, right? So I feel like, even, like, in our district, I'm a volunteer for some, like, high school or middle school. I heard from the kids that, often, they invite, like, Republican candidates. Hardly anyone accepts the kids' invitation, but all the Democrats accept the invitation and share stories with the kids. CHANG: Tyler, you know, many of the candidates running for congressional seats in Orange County are Asian American in this upcoming election, including both candidates in the district where you vote. Let me ask you - when it comes to cultivating Asian American candidates rather than cultivating Asian American voters, per se, do you think the Republican Party has done a better job in recent years? DIEP: No. From my observation, after - what? - 70 years of being on the front lines, the Democratic Party and its apparatus are much more intentional in growing a young farm team of future Asian leaders than the Republican Party. I can give you many example of the infrastructure that the Democratic Party has in place in California to mentor and train young Asian American to come into civic or political life. Not only is there a party, but they have invested heavily into nonprofit group that really acts as advocacy group for all things related to a progressive agenda. Whereas, on the Republican side, if you will, there's not a lot of that. CHANG: Can I ask - any plans to return to politics for you? DIEP: Maybe someday. When I feel like my personal politics can appeal to whether Republican or Democratic voters, then I'll come back. But I think, right now, I see a lot of extremes on both sides. And where I fall on the political spectrum, I won't get out of any political primaries. CHANG: Tyler Diep is a voter and former Republican politician from Orange County. And Violet Ji is a voter in Orange County as well. Thank you to both of you so much. This was such a joy to speak to both of you. JI: Thank you. DIEP: Thank you.

Progressive activist LaLo Montoya estimates he's knocked on 10,000 doors around Las Vegas in the months leading up to Election Day. \"I know that what I'm doing is with the right intentions and with my heart on my sleeve, and I'm hoping to motivate and inspire people when I do this,\" he told NPR. Montoya is an organizer for PLAN Action, a progressive state-based group that focuses on helping low and moderate income families. Like many Democrats in Nevada, he's on edge. \"I'm nervous about everything, I think we do our best but there's so much misinformation that we're going up against.\" Republican candidates are in a dead heat with Democratic incumbents for governor, Senate, House and several statewide offices in large part by making fresh inroads with Latino voters. In the final days of the 2022 campaign, Nevada is proving to be the most competitive state in the country. Latinos in Nevada historically vote Democratic. Donald Trump won 35% of the Latino vote here in 2020, and lost the state by about 2 points. However, small inroads with this voting bloc by Republicans could swing tight races in their favor. \"We believe that we're going to have a red wave here in Nevada because we are focusing on the issues that concern Latinos,\" said Jesus Marquez, a conservative activist in the state who is advising Republican Adam Laxalt's campaign against incumbent Catherine Cortez Masto, the first Latina to serve in the Senate. Republican campaigns are heavily focused on the economy in a state hit hard by inflation. Even Democratic voters like retiree Mike Sanchez concede life is pretty punishing right now in this predominantly working class state, with skyrocketing housing costs and the second highest gas prices in the country. \"It's high all over. You go anywhere and it's a problem,\" Sanchez said. With this economic climate as a backdrop, Democrats believe threats to abortion access can help tip races in their favor. Nevada is one of 16 states that protects abortion rights under state law. It was the single motivating factor for Namir Sanchez, a 31-year-old first time voter who voted early at a local community college. \"It seems like Democrats are way more open-minded,\" Sanchez said. But here's what makes Nevada hard to predict: Like a plurality of the state's voters, Sanchez is an independent. And she split her ticket between Democrats for governor and U.S. House, an independent candidate for U.S. Senate, and then Republicans for all local offices down the ballot because she thinks the GOP will do a better job supporting police. \"Because Democrats just kind of seem like they're not helping them out,\" she said. \"They're not going to make people want to like join the [police force] by like demoting their pay.\" Ruy Teixeira is a liberal scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who has studied shifting demographics and how they can change politics. He says Democrats face a two-fold problem with Latinos right now: the party is not meeting their economic needs in real-time, and many feel socially alienated from the party's values. \"The Democratic Party has become a much more culturally liberal party, pretty much down the line: race, gender, crime, immigration, what's taught in the schools, you name it.\" Nevada is not just critical to the balance of power in this election \u2014 which party wins the Senate race, for instance, will almost certainly determine which party controls the chamber next year \u2014 but a potential bellwether for how competitive Republicans can be with this voting bloc in future elections. \"I think it's going to be a trend that is going to end up with the Latinos coming up and saying, 'OK, we know Democrats should no longer take our vote for granted.' I think that is something that is here to stay,\" said Marquez. Democrats likewise see Latinos at the heart of their party's future. Democrats in the state are lobbying the Democratic National Committee to change the presidential nominating calendar to make Nevada the new first-in-the-nation state for 2024.",

Heading into the final week of voting, some of Democrats' key base voters' levels of enthusiasm are far below that of Republican-base voter groups, the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found. It is the last NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist survey before voting wraps up Tuesday. The crosscurrents of this election are combining to make for uncertainty and volatility with just days to go. Most midterms are referenda on the sitting president and the party in power. That is largely the case with President Biden's approval rating slipping again, Democrats losing ground on which party voters want to control Congress and inflation being the top issue \u2014 with voters saying they trust Republicans more on the issue by 20 points. But preserving democracy and abortion have also been key and hugely motivating factors, as former President Trump, whom the poll found is equally unpopular as Biden, has weighed in heavily in these elections. He's endorsed scores of candidates, many of whom have emulated him, perpetuated his election lies and struggled in purple states. The poll also found, though, that Republican voters are largely OK with voting for an election denier, as long as they agree on policy positions \u2014 and it found in this age of hyperpartisanship, a huge shift away from people thinking divided government is a good thing. The survey of of 1,586 adults and 1,469 registered voters was conducted Oct. 24 through Oct. 27 by the Marist Poll and sponsored in partnership with NPR and PBS NewsHour. There is about a +/- 4 percentage point margin of error, meaning results could be 4 points lower or higher than what's listed. While white women with college degrees, who are an important bloc for Democrats, are among the most enthusiastic to vote, Black voters, Latinos and young voters are among the least. At the same time, older voters, Trump voters, white evangelical Christians and rural voters \u2014 all key GOP groups \u2014 are fired up to vote. Those without college degrees are less enthusiastic about the election, but that's driven by voters of color without degrees. Notably, showing why midterm elections tend to be base elections, independents are also way down the list when it comes to enthusiasm. Loading... Before the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision overturning Roe, Democratic enthusiasm was way below that of Republicans'. But Democratic activism, fundraising and interest in these elections went way up. Democrats closed the enthusiasm gap and were on par with GOP voters over the summer and into September. In the last few weeks, however, as more voters have begun tuning into the election \u2014 and with inflation persistently high \u2014 Republican enthusiasm has outpaced Democrats'. It's not so much that Democrats aren't gaining in their enthusiasm levels \u2014 they are \u2014 it's that Republicans have increased theirs by more in that time. Democrats are also losing ground on the generic congressional ballot test. That's when pollsters ask who a respondent would vote for if the election were held today, a Republican or Democrat. In this survey, it's tied 46%-46% \u2014 and that tends to be bad news for Democrats. Historically, they have needed a substantial lead on that question to do well in the House, because of how districts are drawn and with swing districts largely in right-leaning places. The survey found inflation continues to be the top issue for voters heading into the final days of voting with 36% saying so, followed by preserving democracy (26%), abortion (14%), immigration (9%), health care (8%) and crime (7%). Predictably, it's different when looking at preferences by party \u2014 slightly more than half of Republicans and 40% of independents said inflation was their top voting issue, but for Democrats, it was preserving democracy (42%) followed by abortion (22%). Loading... Republicans are trusted by wide margins on inflation (R+20), crime (R+16) and immigration (R+12), the three issues the GOP has focused on most in these elections. Democrats, on the other hand, are trusted most on health care (D+14), abortion (D+13) and preserving democracy (D+7). More than four-in-five Republicans said they would \"likely\" vote for a candidates they agree with on most issues \u2014 even if that candidate thinks the 2020 election was stolen, which it was not. In contrast, only a third of Democrats said they would, while slightly more than half of independents would. A majority of Republicans (53%) said they would \"very likely\" vote for someone who thought (incorrectly) that the election was stolen, as compared to one-in-five Democrats and a third of independents. Loading... Republicans were also less likely to say their preferred candidate should \"definitely\" concede if they were declared the loser in their race. While almost two-thirds of Democrats said so, only 39% of Republicans did. Three-quarters of Americans said they have confidence in their local and state governments to conduct a fair and accurate election, though. Republicans were less likely to say so, but still almost two-thirds of them said they do have that confidence despite extreme rhetoric coming from candidates and people like Trump. For a long time, Americans tended to think divided government was a good thing \u2014 a way for a party in power's worst instincts to be checked. Not anymore. Loading... Now by a 53%-to-38% margin, they say it's better for the government to be controlled by the same party. Democrats, who are seeing their majorities threatened this year, are driving that with 73% saying so, but a slim majority of independents and about half of Republicans feel the same way. Also, overall, 27% of Americans say they have already voted with another 28% saying they plan to vote before Election Day. Forty-three percent say they will vote in-person on Election Day. Sixty-two percent of Democrats said they have already voted or plan to do so, while 46% of Republicans said so. A majority of Republicans said they plan to vote in-person on Election Day.",

And while politicians attempt to compete for the \"Latino vote\" in battleground states, the nuances and complexities within the community are often erased in the process. Like most other voters, Latinos are also not single-issue voters. According to the Pew Research Center, the economy remains the top issue ahead of midterms for Latino voters polled, followed by health care, education, violent crime and gun policy. Immigration stands in ninth place. While immigration continues to be an important threshold issue for Latinos, politicians often make it the singular issue to attract and potentially sway Latino voters. Connecting with Latino voters does not come with a one-size-fits-all approach, so we asked Latinos themselves what issues they wish politicians would focus more of their attention on ahead of the midterms.

            "article_content": "Political rhetoric is dividing many Americans. But for those in refugee and immigrant communities, that language gets filtered through another layer of history and lived experience.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: As the election approaches, hot-button issues are dividing refugee and immigrant communities. And as NPR's Huo Jingnan reports, coming from somewhere else with its own history can influence how you might see politics in this country. HUO JINGNAN, BYLINE: When I talked to Michelle Le and My-Linh Thai, I was struck by how similar they are. MICHELLE LE: I'm able to come to this country, so I will protect it with all my life. MY-LINH THAI: Oh, my God. This country get me a chance at life. HUO: They're both in their 50s. Both came to America as child refugees fleeing Vietnam after the war. They both live in the Seattle area, went to the University of Washington and have friends in common. Here's My-Linh. THAI: We became friends simply because she married to my friend. HUO: Michelle campaigned for My-Linh when she successfully ran for state representative as a Democrat in 2018. But in the divisive year of 2020, Michelle gravitated towards the Republican Party. Immigration is a top issue for her, and she references how her own family entered the U.S. LE: We came to this country. It took six months for the U.S. government to vet us before we were able to enter the country. Now our border is widely open for anybody, you know, with fentanyl, drugs. HUO: While that's a popular talking point on the right, migrants crossing the border are not the main source of fentanyl entering the U.S. Michelle now sees Democrats' policies as akin to the communism she escaped. Her shift has created a rift between her and her children. LE: So they get their information from the schools that are trying to push Marxism and socialism because they think that people can just be happy, you know, the rich helping the poor and everybody lives equally. That is not the reality. HUO: Michelle was among the protesters at the Capitol on January 6, though she didn't enter the building. She's now campaigning for Republicans. My-Linh, who is running for reelection as a Democrat, frames things the other way around. THAI: When our community is successful, the individual who live in that community have such good soil and good water and good amount of sun and good fertilizer to lift you up in the way that you, too, will be successful. HUO: My-Linh has been an outlier in her generation. Many Vietnamese Americans who have fled the communist government have often backed Republicans. GOP politicians have accepted the community as they fled the war and are also seen as more anti-communist. On the other hand, younger generations who grew up in America are often more liberal. Rachel Moran and Sarah Nguyen at the University of Washington analyzed Facebook posts during the 2020 election. They found that history makes some messages, including misinformation, more salient than others for Vietnamese Americans. Here's Moran. RACHEL MORAN: You know, it's not a coincidence that the most significant spread of misinformation we found was mostly tied to narratives around communism. HUO: Interpretations of facts are often filtered through a political lens. Take the word socialism. My-Linh told her aunt and uncle that Social Security and Medicare are socialist programs. THAI: And they was like, that's not true. That's safety net. HUO: Those kind of disagreements might lead to a conversation about what the word socialism means - in Vietnam, in America, both past and present. But the researchers found that what follows is often silence. That's the case for Michelle and My-Linh these days. THAI: We show up at, like, really important cultural events for our community together. We greet each other, and then we went on and do our own work. HUO: My-Linh says she is willing to talk to Michelle when she is ready. Huo Jingnan, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "It's the final day before Brazilians go to the polls and according to polling, the gap between President Bolsonaro and former President Luiz Ignacio Lula da Silva is getting ever closer.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Misinformation, threats to democracy, political violence - those aren't just concerns playing out in our elections. Voters head to the polls to vote in a presidential runoff tomorrow in Brazil, South America's largest country. Brazil's far-right incumbent president Jair Bolsonaro has repeatedly cast doubt on the country's voting system. He is running against leftist former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and tensions are running very high across the country. There's been a spike in political violence during the election, and according to reports, both candidates have even shown up at events in bulletproof vests. Meanwhile, polls show the vote is going to be very close. We're joined now by NPR's Carrie Kahn, who's in Brazil's largest city, Sao Paulo. CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: Thanks for having me, Michel. MARTIN: This has been one of the most divisive elections in Brazil's history. Tell us a bit more about what is at stake. KAHN: A lot for Brazilians and the world. You know, for Brazilians, the economy here, like many countries recovering from the pandemic, is hurting. Growth is weak, and hunger is on the rise, as is poverty and inequality. And for the world, there is the Amazon that has seen a dramatic increase in deforestation, which leads to climate change, and that has accelerated under the incumbent Bolsonaro, who is very pro-business and has eliminated a lot of protections and enforcement in the rainforest - so major issues here in how to handle the economy, help the poor, protect the rainforest and ag business, which is a huge part of Brazil's economy. And unfortunately, those topics, especially the health of the Amazon, have not been center stage here. It's been an ugly contest, lots of disinformation spread on social media - and like you said, everything from cannibalism to communism. MARTIN: If the candidates aren't talking about those major issues, what are they talking about? KAHN: Bolsonaro has portrayed da Silva as a God-hating communist, bent on closing down churches here if he wins and turning Brazil into Venezuela and Cuba. Da Silva's camp has capitalized on misstatements he's made about cannibalism, he said, in reference to Indigenous groups, and pedophilia when he was talking about young Venezuelan migrants. Last night, they held their last debate. It was quite a drag-out, face-to-face match, and they spent most of the time calling each other liars. Here's one of my favorite exchanges. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LUIZ INACIO LULA DA SILVA: (Non-English language spoken). KAHN: De Silva said it's been reported that Bolsonaro is the biggest liar in the history of Brazil and has lied 6,498 times. Bolsonaro shot back, saying that he has the best reputation in the world, and the world likes him way better than it does da Silva. And at the end, Bolsonaro threw up his hands in the air and praised God, country and family. That's his campaign slogan. MARTIN: You know, the pollsters significantly underestimated the level of support for President Bolsonaro in the first round of the election. You know, I don't know if there's any way to assess this, but do you think they got it right this time around? KAHN: That is the big question here. It's going to be very close. Pollsters were really wrong in the first round of voting. They had Bolsonaro down by double digits and he narrowed that significantly. They had a real hard time polling his conservative base. Analysts are saying that the poor could be decisive in the contest, and we see both camps trying to play to the poor. Da Silva's big base of support is the poor, and Bolsonaro has been handing out a lot of money lately. MARTIN: And before we let you go, Carrie, you know that there's this big movement in the United States, particularly among Republicans, to refuse to accept election results if they lose. Now, if is the same thing going on there, has Bolsonaro, for example, said that he'll accept the result? KAHN: That's a great question because there are a lot of doubts. Donald Trump is his big political idol. Bolsonaro has repeatedly called into question the fairness of the electoral process here. MARTIN: That is NPR's Carrie Kahn. She's in Sao Paulo. Carrie, thank you. KAHN: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "Massachusetts could join the states who allow undocumented people to get driver's licenses.  Residents will vote on this issue on election day.  JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: Voters in Massachusetts are about to decide whether undocumented immigrants should be able to apply for driver's licenses. Seventeen other states, along with the District of Columbia, already allow this. New York is one of those states, and Chris Burrell from member station GBH reports how their law is having a big impact on road safety. (SOUNDBITE OF CAR DRIVING PAST) CHRIS BURRELL, BYLINE: Traffic zips past a supermarket in Saugerties, N.Y., a town of 23,000 a couple hours north of New York City. Police Chief Joseph Sinagra says those motorists are a lot safer than just a few years ago. The reason is simple, he says - a huge decline in unlicensed drivers now that undocumented immigrants here can get licenses. JOSEPH SINAGRA: People aren't running from the police now. They're stopping. And we haven't had a chase around here, to be honest with you, which is really good. It's community safety. BURRELL: Statewide, police in New York used to arrest about 57,000 people a year for unlicensed driving. Two years after lawmakers passed the Green Light law, arrests plummeted to about 30,000. Police like Sinagra say most of those unlicensed drivers are long-time residents, not recent immigrants. And that decline in arresting unlicensed drivers translates into better policing, he says. SINAGRA: My officers now are spending more time on the street. They're spending less time detaining individuals. BURRELL: It's also changed immigrants' everyday lives. ALICIA RIOS: (Speaking Spanish). BURRELL: In a small town near Albany, Alicia Rios is stepping into her white Toyota Camry. She and her husband have raised three children here and run a landscaping company, with many of their clients an hour away. She takes me for a spin past her daughter's high school and local apple orchards while an interpreter rides up front. RIOS: (Through interpreter) And now we feel more free, being able to drive. So I'm really happy. So it has helped me go to work, pick up my children, run errands at the store. BURRELL: In a city not far away, Dalila Yeend pulls up to her house in a black SUV. Four years ago, she was arrested after rolling through a stop sign. An unauthorized immigrant at the time, Yeend didn't have a valid license. She spent the next three months in a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility four hours away from her home and two kids. DALILA YEEND: What happened to me, I just was like, I don't want this to happen to anyone else. Just from a simple traffic stop, our whole lives were changed in the blink of an eye, and it was a scary time. BURRELL: Now, armed with a driver's license for the last three years, she says she was able to start a home health care business and afford her own home. The law reform in New York that helped Yeend and Rios get licenses is about to happen in Massachusetts next summer. But an effort to stop the law from getting implemented got underway just days after Massachusetts lawmakers passed the law. A petition drive, led by Republicans, put a referendum on the November ballot. Backers like Paul Craney at the right-leaning Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance argue it's common sense to voters that ICE is the right agency to deal with undocumented immigrants, not states. PAUL CRANEY: And it's not because they're a xenophobe or racist. We can't ask the Registry of Motor Vehicle to do the work that our federal government is supposed to be doing. BURRELL: Polling data in Massachusetts shows 56% of registered voters want immigrants who can provide valid identification to be able to get a driver's license. Labor unions and a large car insurance company are the biggest donors to the effort to save this law from repeal, building a $1.2 million campaign fund. SARAH O'CONNOR: I think that we can hit 400 doors today. BURRELL: Immigrant rights advocates like Sarah O'Connor, rallying canvassers last week in Lynn, a multiracial city just north of Boston, say losing this campaign for immigrants' access to driver's licenses would have a chilling effect for years. O'CONNOR: There would probably be no real reform in the Massachusetts state level on immigration for the next decade. BURRELL: Immigration advocates also say that repealing the driver's license law in Massachusetts would reverberate nationally, hurting the momentum of states trying to help undocumented immigrants living and working in their communities for decades.

Voters in two districts have a chance to decide control of Congress this fall. They're inundated with ads and speeches.

Some Democrats voiced concerns about crime and inflation \u2014 issues Republicans highlight. Abortion rights supporters are motivated by a Supreme Court ruling \u2014 but so are abortion opponents. Republicans prepared to vote  even as some talked of a successor to former President Trump, or criticized the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. NPR's Morning Edition visited these two districts because each has a hotly contested House seat \u2014 and is in a state with a close Senate race. The Senate candidates are all distinctive: In Pennsylvania, a former small-city mayor and lieutenant governor (John Fetterman) faces a TV host (Mehmet Oz); in Ohio, a writer and venture capitalist (J.D. Vance) contends against an old-style Rust Belt Democrat (Tim Ryan). For the House, Ohio's 13th District features a state legislator (Democrat Emilia Sykes) against a former campaign staffer and former Miss Ohio (Republican Madison Gesiotto Gilbert). In Pennsylvania's 17th District, a business owner (Republican Jeremy Shaffer) faces an Iraq war veteran and lawyer (Democrat Chris Deluzio). Signs for Republican congressional candidate Jeremy Shaffer are scattered across an affluent neighborhood in Beaver, Pa.\n                \n                    \n                    Steve Inskeep/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Signs for Republican congressional candidate Jeremy Shaffer are scattered across an affluent neighborhood in Beaver, Pa.

Many Democrats would like this election to center on preserving democracy \u2014 and for some voters, it's top of mind. Richard Kramer of Akron said he'd been watching coverage of the Jan. 6 hearings on MSNBC, and found it \"so very frightening that we came so close to losing it all.\" But other issues felt more immediate to many. In a community center in West Akron, several members of a senior citizens' dance class said they were concerned about shootings on urban streets and inflation. \"A bucket of chitlins,\" said Margaret Bush, \"used to be $8.99. ...

The women in this class will help determine the outcome of a competitive race in Ohio's 13th Congressional District. Several in the room plan to vote for Democrats \u2014 but their concerns reflected issues Republicans have campaigned on. Beaver, Pa., is prosperous: Unlike many smaller cities, the downtown stores are mostly occupied, and stunning historic homes line a park overlooking the Ohio River. But at the downtown grocery, owner Mark Ondrusek said the numbers no longer add up for him: \"My labor is up 30 to 40% versus four years ago. The cost of everything \u2014 utilities, electric, gas \u2014 every vendor is tacking fuel charges onto the bills.\" Ondrusek, who leans politically right, plans to vote for Oz for Senate even while dismissing him with faint praise as \"a politician\" who \"means well.\" Beaver Falls native Cameron Mobley, pictured in front of his home, says he favors Democrat John Fetterman in Pennsylvania's competitive Senate race.

The names of Mobley's children are etched into the sidewalk. It's easy to stereotype both Pennsylvania and Ohio: demographically, both are older and whiter than the country as a whole and can seem to reflect an earlier time in America. Republicans have a slight advantage because they draw more support from older and white voters. Yet the districts we chose reflected some diversity. Beaver Falls, Pa., recently elected Kenya Johns its first Black mayor. Akron is trying to make up for its population loss by welcoming immigrants and refugees. Akron's newcomers build on the foundations laid by immigrants who came before. A former Italian center in Akron, built in the 1930s, when European migrants were drawn to Akron's rubber plants, is now called the Royal Palace: refugees from Bhutan have turned it into a South Asian-style wedding hall. Diversity may affect the election in various ways. In Akron, Hsa Win is a refugee from Southeast Asia \u2014 one of the Karen people who have settled there in some numbers. \"I became a U.S. citizen in 2019 and also voted for the first time in the 2020 elections,\" he told us. \"I have already planned for this Nov. 8: I'm going to take two friends.\" The recently opened Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex as viewed from a residential street in Monaca, Pa.

Deborah Lewis said she was concerned about the loss of free speech \u2014 and when asked how that might be reflected in her daily life, she said it was difficult for Christians born in the U.S. to communicate with immigrants from other backgrounds without feeling \"restricted.\" We also met people struggling to collaborate regardless of party, background or belief. Elected officials in both places seemed determined to avoid partisan remarks \u2014 especially officials in smaller cities, where their work demands that they get along with neighbors who disagree. Some local officials welcomed us to town but declined to talk politics at all. Our interviews revealed signs of what millions of dollars worth of campaigning has and has not accomplished. Many people have heard or seen campaign ads. Several people have seen the candidates in person. Some voters are deeply conversant with issues. But most seemed to have little idea who was running, especially for the House. Many seem likely to cast ballots along party lines. Even better-informed voters seem to feel compelled to vote this way. In Beaver Falls, Joline Atkins (left) and Christine Kroger say they plan to vote Democratic this fall. Both are concerned about climate change and waning access to abortion.\n                \n                    \n                    Ally Schweitzer/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption In Beaver Falls, Joline Atkins (left) and Christine Kroger say they plan to vote Democratic this fall.

I would love to be able to say I'm voting for the person, but there's just too much at stake. I can't do that.\" Atkins thinks of climate change and abortion, among other issues. Because many people vote along party lines, it matters where the House district lines are drawn. Pennsylvania's 17th has long been a swing district \u2014 mixing the Pittsburgh suburbs in Allegheny County with more conservative rural areas. Ohio's 13th has long been a Democratic stronghold, but redistricting for this year's election reshaped the district and made it a toss-up.

Few voters seemed inclined to make the election about Donald Trump, but the former president is on their minds. While Trump still has many devoted supporters, it's common to hear frustration or impatience. In Barberton, Ohio, Republican city council member Thomas Heitic suggested he'd like a president who's under 70. \"The Constitution says you have to be 35 for president,\" he said. \"It doesn't say 35 times two.\" Asked about Trump's attempt to overturn his 2020 election defeat, Heitic recalled an instance in his own career when he lost an election. \"I didn't blame anybody,\" he said. \"I didn't look at the Board of Elections and demand a recount. I looked at myself and said, 'How can I do better the next run?' \" Outside Hartville, Ohio, a woman who asked that we use only her first name, Glenda, said she first became a Republican during \"the election when Trump came on board. And I'm not saying I like Trump. I don't like what's happening in our country right now.\" She voted twice for Trump, but \"after Jan. 6, I just don't trust him ... I never dreamed in a million years he would do something like that ... I won't vote for him again.\" She nonetheless remains a Republican \u2014 and says she will vote for Republicans in this fall's election, which could return Congress to the control of Trump's party.

            "article_content": "NPR's Ailsa Chang talks with Tampa Bay Times Political Editor Emily Mahoney about Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, as he faces Democrat Charlie Crist in a debate Monday.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Tonight, Florida's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, is facing off with his Democratic challenger, the former Florida governor Charlie Crist, in their first and only debate before next month's election. Polling shows DeSantis with an average 10 point advantage. And the outcome of the race might tell us how his leadership has resonated with Florida voters, like his response during the pandemic, pushing against federal guidance on masking and vaccines. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RON DESANTIS: In Florida, we reject the biomedical security state, which erodes liberty, harms livelihoods and divides our society. CHANG: Voters might also be thinking about his stances on education, like his push against critical race theory and his support for the bill that restricted how schools teach about LGBTQ topics. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: What critics call the Don't Say Gay bill is on the Senate floor. DESANTIS: Does it say that in the bill? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Do you support... DESANTIS: Does it say that in the bill? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: I'm asking... DESANTIS: I'm asking you to tell me what's in the bill, because you are pushing false narratives. It doesn't matter what critics say. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Hold on. It says the advanced classroom instruction on sexual identity and gender orientation. DESANTIS: For who? For grades pre-K through 3. CHANG: More recently, voters have watched DeSantis respond to Hurricane Ian and, separately, his controversial decision to fly dozens of migrants from Texas to Massachusetts. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DESANTIS: But yes, if you have folks that are inclined to think Florida is a good place, our message to them is we are not a sanctuary state, and it's better to be able to go to a sanctuary jurisdiction. And yes... CHANG: And a reelection for DeSantis could have some national political stakes beyond the midterms. We're going to talk about all of that with Emily Mahoney, political editor for the Tampa Bay Times. Welcome. EMILY MAHONEY: Thanks so much for having me. CHANG: So it might be worth remembering, as we listen to some of those moments that we just mentioned above - you know, Ron DeSantis, he wasn't always seen as someone so aligned with former President Trump. Like, when did that shift happen for DeSantis, would you say? MAHONEY: Well, his rise to prominence has been really fascinating to follow. So I covered his campaign in 2018. And back then, you have to remember he was a somewhat unknown congressman representing the northeast part of Florida. And he was able to win that election in large part because he was endorsed by then-President Donald Trump. He won over a much more established Republican in the primary and squeaked out a victory, just barely, in the general. But then when he took office, there was a sort of a honeymoon period where he championed a lot of bipartisan issues for about the first year of his administration - teacher pay, raising teacher salaries was a big one, cleaning up Florida's waterways. Some Democrats were expressing surprise that this guy who they expected to be really hard right was really sort of finding compromise. And really all of that changed when the pandemic hit. He really embraced this combative style of rejecting the advice of pretty much the medical establishment and wanted Florida to be out in front early, opening up schools, opening up businesses. He, you know, prohibited local municipalities from enforcing mask mandates, for example. And so that really, I think, accelerated his rise to national prominence. And he's really found this rhythm of being on the national stage and positioning himself as a foil to President Biden and what he calls the radical left sort of on a daily basis. CHANG: I want to pivot to a moment to his challenger. This is former Governor Charlie Crist. And just to remind people, Crist was a Republican himself when he was governor more than a decade ago but switched his party affiliation back in 2012. It is worth noting that even with more voters registered as Republican in Florida compared to years past, there are still a number of unaffiliated voters in the state. What do you think might sway them to Crist? MAHONEY: Yeah. Well, that's always the big question in Florida. We have so many independent voters here. And I think that if you asked for that question of Crist, he would say probably abortion. He has been hammering his abortion messaging constantly in the last few weeks and has been warning voters that if DeSantis is reelected, that he will pass an even more stringent ban on abortion than what exists currently, which is a 15-week ban with no exceptions. And so I think that that's where he is hedging his bets. And I would say that the Republicans believe that it is the issue of the economy. That has sort of been their closing argument in the state of Florida. And I think, you know, the results will sort of start to tell us which issue is resonating more. CHANG: I also want to talk a little bit about the effect Hurricane Ian might have on this race. Like, earlier this month, we had reporting on how Florida has had to scramble to get polling places ready after Hurricane Ian. How is that recovery and response impacting the race politically, you think? MAHONEY: It impacted the race in a really big way, I would say. Charlie Crist has had an uphill battle from the start because of his huge disadvantage with fundraising, for example. But he was starting to pick up some momentum before the hurricane hit. He had some planned fundraisers. And all of that was scrapped because of the hurricane. Instead of that, what we saw was DeSantis on television standing next to Biden. And, you know, all that does is really position DeSantis as looking gubernatorial at solving an issue in a bipartisan way, which is popular with voters and really sort of marginalize any conversation about Crist for a few weeks. One Democratic pollster said it was sort of the final nail in the coffin for Charlie Crist. CHANG: Well, of course, winning a second term as governor for DeSantis could help put him in a better position to possibly run for president in 2024. Can you just remind us, like, what signals has DeSantis given recently suggesting he really does plan to run for the White House? MAHONEY: Well, if you ask him about it publicly, he'll always downplay it and say that, you know, everyone is obsessed with 2024, but I'm just focused on winning 2022. But he has continued to hold fundraisers around the state. He's campaigned for other Republican candidates. So he's kind of lending his star power in a way that is sort of Trumpian. And so I think that that's really undeniable in terms of fueling the 2024 buzz. CHANG: So what do you think? Has DeSantis' first term as governor put him on a clear path to run for president, or do you think he may have alienated too many voters nationally to make a realistic run for the White House? MAHONEY: I think that his first term has definitely positioned him to run for a 2024 Republican primary. Like we talked about, he has this combative political style that's popular with Republicans and really has positioned himself as a national figure among Republicans. Now, whether that translates to a general presidential win, it's very hard to say, obviously. It's a lot of sort of hypotheticals built into that. But, you know, the sort of elephant in the room here, no pun intended, is Donald Trump as well, which, you know, if he were to run against DeSantis in a hypothetical 2024 race, that obviously complicates things for Governor DeSantis considering he owes much of his political rise to Trump. CHANG: That is Emily Mahoney, political editor with The Tampa Bay Times. Thank you so much. MAHONEY: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Republicans are making inroads to appeal to Latino voters.\n                \n                    \n                    Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Nevada Republican U.S. Senate candidate Adam Laxalt (center) takes a group photo with supporters during a Hispanic Heritage Month Fiesta at the RNC Hispanic Community Center on Oct. 13, in Las Vegas. Republicans are making inroads to appeal to Latino voters. Recent polling shows a majority of Latino voters plan to back Democratic candidates in next month's midterm elections, continuing a trend that has held for decades. But that support is on the decline. While Democratic strategists make renewed pledges to woo Latino voters, Republicans are also making inroads to appeal to the second-largest and fastest-growing group in the U.S. electorate. Democratic strategist Chuck Rocha worked on both of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential runs and told NPR that while Senate campaigns have been airing Spanish-language ads for more than six months, a lack of outreach in races for the House of Representatives could cost the party a majority there. \"It's very important for folks to know Democrats are going to win the Latino vote and Latino voters,\" Rocha said about the November midterms. \"But what's happening is we're losing a little support, a little at a time, to Republicans.\" According to a recent Washington Post-Ipsos poll, Democrats have a 27-point advantage with voters who identify as Hispanic. That's a generous margin, but it's down significantly from the nearly 40-point advantage the party had in 2018. One of the biggest reasons for this shift, Rocha said, was Republicans have been stepping up their efforts to gain the support of Latino voters. \"Republicans used to not compete for this vote,\" Rocha said. \"Up until about eight years ago, Republicans would just walk past a Latino neighborhood. They would never see themselves trying to do a Spanish-language advertisement.\" Mike Madrid, a Republican political consultant with an expertise in Latino voting trends, said Republican efforts to reach Latino voters reflected changes in the party. While working on George W. Bush's 2000 and 2004 campaigns, Madrid was helping with \"aggressive\" Latino outreach efforts. But the party's efforts slowed until 2020, he said. \"What has happened since 2020 is math,\" Madrid said. \"2016 was not a good year for Trump with Hispanic voters. He was kind of directly assaulting [them].\" In 2020, Madrid said strategists realized they would have to focus on Hispanic communities in places like North Carolina, Texas, Nevada and Colorado to run viable campaigns. \"Everyone realizes this is a demographic that's really popping up everywhere now. And so it's something you've got to deal with,\" he said. Both parties are trying to appeal to the Latino community these midterm elections.\n                \n                    \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Both parties are trying to appeal to the Latino community these midterm elections. Republican strategists have told NPR that they have appealed to the group with a three-pronged approach \u2014 on the economy, crime and progressive policies \u2014 which began during the 2020 election when Trump used \"democratic-socialism\" to appeal to Latinos, particularly to those of Cuban and Venezuelan descent. Republicans now have a program in nine states in this election called Operation Vamos. Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, for example, has made concerted efforts to appeal to Latinos in Wisconsin, that while not a huge population in state, still accounts for 8% of votes. Every bit on the margins could be the difference-maker in a state likely to be decided by a few points. Meanwhile, what Democratic strategists have realized is that immigration can be an important \"threshold issue,\" but the concerns of Latinos go well beyond that, particularly to issues such as the economy for a group that has a high working-class population. This is especially true in a place like Nevada, where Latinos who worked in the culinary union, for example, have been frustrated with Democratic leadership and COVID policies that cost them money. No racial or ethnic group votes in lockstep, and the Latino vote is expected to diversify even more in the coming years. The age of the Latino voting base is also a double-edged sword for Democrats, Rocha said. While younger Latino voters tend to be more progressive, younger people in general were more infrequent voters. \"They're more apt to not participate in an off-year election, which harms Democrats more than Republicans,\" Rocha said, who added that younger and Latino voters were more likely to not vote than to support Republicans. Madrid sees demographic changes as an opportunity for both parties. \"I think the best way to characterize it, is to say that the party that understands a multi-ethnic working class ... is going to be the dominant party in the next decade,\" he said. Pew Research reports have found that the economy remains the most important issue for Latino voters. Other high priority issues include abortion, health care, crime and education, with the diverse voting population split by age, region and religious affiliation. Both Madrid and Rocha emphasized the importance of appealing to working class voters. \"Democrats have had a better time with the multi-ethnic part than the working class part,\" Madrid said. \"Republicans have always had a better time with the working class and not been multi-ethnic.\" Domenico Montanaro contributed to this report.",

Election season is upon us, and if you spend any time scrolling through social media, listening to the radio or watching TV, you're probably getting a barrage of political ads. Unprecedented political ad spending is estimated at nearly $10 billion this election cycle, surpassing even the 2020 presidential election. While the may phrase \"this is the most important election of your lifetime\" may feel like a clich\u00e9 at this point, ad spending shows that campaigns and major parties are feeling that sentiment. We asked two veteran political strategists to analyze an ad from their party, and why they think it works. We also dig into what's at stake this election cycle \u2014 more on that further down. But first, the ads. Tim Ryan campaign ad. Analysis by Democratic strategist Joel Payne I think one of the reasons [it works] is because he is appealing not just to his base, but he's appealing to voters in the middle, to independents. And I think this ad is a great example of that. This is not a base turnout ad, it is an advertisement to say, \"Hey, if you're someone who doesn't agree with me, it's safe to support me. Even when we disagree, we can do it without being disagreeable.\" He's using his family to demonstrate a very common disagreement you might have around the home. It's a really effective spot because I think for a lot of voters who may not know who Tim Ryan is, I think it portrays him in a positive, reasonable light. There are other ads that might be kind of considered more turnout ads that are just going to be to juice your base and to get them excited. This is not, this is an ad that is much more of a persuasion biographical piece. Analysis by Republican strategist Alice Stewart The thinking by the Oz campaign is that crime is through the roof in parts of Pennsylvania, specifically in the Philly suburbs, and people are concerned about who is going to represent them and really be tough on crime. And Oz is accurately depicting [John Fetterman's - his Democratic opponent] record on the [Board of Pardons] at letting off convicted murderers, and it's a valid and accurate contrast on how they will handle crime. He also touches on reducing taxes and the economic issues that are really impacting people across the state of Pennsylvania. So he was not only just talking policy points and what Oz plans to do, he was able to point to specifics in Fetterman's record that he views as a direction that the people of Pennsylvania don't want to go in. And I think it's a extremely impactful closing ad as we get to the end of the election cycle. And based on what the polling numbers show, crime and the economy are our top issues for people in Pennsylvania. The fight for control of Congress is one of the major factors driving ad dollars. Currently, Democrats hold a narrow majority in the House, and the Senate is split at an even 50/50, with Vice President Kamala Harris holding a tie breaking vote. \"Obviously, Democrats are fighting with everything they can to hold on to that position,\" Stewart told NPR. \"Republicans look at this as an opportunity to put a check and balance on what they see as the very liberal, very progressive policies of the Biden administration ... so any money spent now to change the trajectory and the direction of this country is money well spent.\" Stewart said the polls she is watching show the issues that matter most to voters are inflation, economy, crime, and immigration. Payne agreed the economy is a top priority, but added other issues were also motivating voters. \"They're also talking about things like abortion rights ... [and] democracy issues \u2014 January 6, voting rights, issues of preserving democracy. Those are on the minds of Democratic voters,\" he said. In the world of political advertising, TV remains king, accounting for about 51% of the ad dollars spent this cycle. And while many consider it as tried and true, the methodology behind TV ads has evolved over time. \"I think with regards to TV, it is changing,\" Payne said, adding that advances in analytics technology has allowed for more sophisticated targeting. \"There is a real science to it, and a real art to it. And it's a lot more precise than it used to be.\" Yet while TV ads remain the most prevalent, campaigns are certainly not ignoring other platforms to get their message out, especially when it comes to younger voters. \"We're also seeing tens of millions of dollars on social media ads, and Google ads and Facebook,\" Stewart said. \"Campaigns recognize the fact that the younger generation is not watching television and certainly not watching commercials when they come on.\"",

            "article_content": "As Republicans seek to win control of Congress, Democrats are doubling down on abortion. They are hoping that outrage over the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade will turn the tide in their favor.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: We are less than three weeks out from the final ballots being cast in the 2022 midterm elections, and Republicans are confident that they will take control of the House of Representatives. But Democrats are hoping they still have one advantage around how voters feel about abortion rights. After the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade, Democrats think promising to protect abortion access is their key to holding on to the House. So what do voters make of all the messaging right now? Well, to discuss how the conversation about abortion rights is playing out on the campaign trail, we're joined now by NPR political correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben and NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro. Hey to both of you. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hey there. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey. CHANG: OK. So, Danielle, I want to start with you because you have spent the last several months traveling the country, talking to voters about abortion and how it's impacting the way they're going to vote in this election. Tell me, how has the Democratic Party's focus on abortion messaging resonated or not resonated with voters? KURTZLEBEN: Well, with Democratic voters and also Democratic-leaning independent voters, it's resonating quite a bit. And to be honest, it's not even necessarily that the Democratic messaging is doing the work here. It's just that a lot of these voters heard the Dobbs decision and were so upset and after that were looking for candidates who were just as upset as they were. Here is Wisconsin voter Joelle Beth Timm. I met her this summer when she answered the door to a canvasser for Democratic Senate candidate Mandela Barnes. JOELLE BETH TIMM: I'm pretty angry. And, you know, I have some T-shirts that say, you know, mind your own uterus. So they're getting a lot of wear recently. So, yeah, it's, you know, absolutely an issue - absolutely. Quite frankly, it's probably the No. 1 issue that I voted on in my life. KURTZLEBEN: Now, of course, it's not every Democrat for whom this is No. 1. I mean, there are a lot of concerns out there, but there are so many voters who have their own personal stories, who know their friends' and families' personal stories. There are a lot of those people, and they are very, very fired up. CHANG: Right. OK. Well, obviously, Domenico, Democratic voters are not all the same. So I'm curious, like, what kinds of breakdowns do you see on on age, on gender, on race when you look at polling on abortion? Like, for example, do women's voting patterns seem to be changing? MONTANARO: Well, first of all, abortion rights as an issue has clearly fired Democrats up across the board. And that's a huge thing because, you know, historically, the party in power loses seats, lots of seats in the House, 26 seats on average since World War II, for example. And Republicans only need five seats to pick up the House. So that's a big deal to have that sort of - that water sort of rise for Democrats to be able to go to the polls. And, you know, that's really important because Republicans had a huge advantage when it came to the overall environment, inflation, the president's low job ratings. And this has really been able to fire up Democratic voters in a way, in particular women, that we hadn't seen before that. CHANG: Right. Well, you know, as we've been saying, we saw a lot of organizing around abortion when it came to voter registration and fundraising, etc. I am wondering, like, has that enthusiasm remained strong now several months on, or has it waned? KURTZLEBEN: It's still very strong amongst the people who care. I mean, my sense is that the enthusiasm is pretty baked in at this point. I mean, people who were energized by Dobbs very much still are. But as far as persuasion, it's hard to imagine Democrats swinging someone over to their side on this. Now, it is true that we have seen bumps in women registering to vote in some states since the Dobbs decision, and that's no small thing. The big question for Democrats is if they can continue doing that and, furthermore, if it's this topic, reproductive rights, or something else that will get voters out the door. CHANG: Well, Domenico, are there any particular key races where abortion is playing an outsized role at this point? MONTANARO: You know, there's only about half a dozen or so really competitive Senate races that are likely going to decide the chamber. And it's playing in all of them, frankly. You know, from Georgia to Arizona, we're seeing it all over the place and we're seeing it all over the place in congressional ads. I've actually, frankly, been surprised in House races how much it's been used because so many of these places that are swing districts are center-right districts. And not only is that anecdotally telling me that it's key with independents who Democrats so badly need to win over to win those seats, but it also shows up in the data as well that, you know, we've seen majorities of independents say that the Supreme Court's decision actually makes them more likely to vote in this election and overwhelmingly for Democrats. So that's why you see Republicans using crime, for example, as one way to try to offset Democrats' perceived advantage with suburban white women to sort of pull at their dueling priorities. CHANG: Danielle, as we've just heard Domenico explain that there are some moderate voters out there that could be influenced by the abortion issue, how are Republicans approaching the issue of abortion access? You know, Democrats, they keep talking about it. It feels like Republicans just want to talk about anything else, right? KURTZLEBEN: Right. Republican candidates, as far as I've seen, they're not bringing it up if they don't have to, which is to say they will talk about it when they are attacked on it. And when they are attacked, they tend to have a sort of two-pronged response. One is they counter by trying to argue that their Democratic opponents are the ones who are extreme on abortion. Many of them also argue that states should be the ones deciding what abortion policy should be. Now, the benefit of that response for those Republican candidates is that it doesn't mean endorsing any particular solution or position that one could argue against. What it means is that those candidates don't have to come down specifically on what they want to do, just how they want to do it. CHANG: Interesting. Well, Domenico, as you mentioned earlier, Republicans are instead focused on inflation and on crime, like, hoping that fears about economic uncertainty will deliver them this huge victory in November. I am wondering, does the polling indicate that that is a safe bet for them to make? MONTANARO: Inflation's still overwhelmingly the top issue, and clearly, that's the reason why they're using that because it's far easier to just blame President Biden and Democrats for inflation when polling is showing that people overwhelmingly trust Republicans more right now on the economy. So Republican strategists will say focus on the economy. They're using crime and immigration as well as ways to also fire up their base and, again, to sort of try to mitigate Democrats' advantage with suburban women. CHANG: That is NPR's Domenico Montanaro and NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben. Thank you to both of you. MONTANARO: Hey. Thank you so much. KURTZLEBEN: Yeah, thanks. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

Val Demings, greet each other before a televised debate at Duncan Theater on the campus of Palm Beach State College on Tuesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Thomas Cordy/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, and his Democratic challenger, U.S. Rep. Val Demings, greet each other before a televised debate at Duncan Theater on the campus of Palm Beach State College on Tuesday. MIAMI \u2014 Democratic U.S. Rep. Val Demings of Florida went on the attack Tuesday in her first debate against Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, accusing him of being a serial liar, while Rubio criticized her for supporting President Joe Biden's economic agenda. Rubio, a two-term senator, and Demings, a three-term congresswoman and former Orlando police chief, faced questions at the debate in Lake Worth on topics including inflation, abortion, voting rights, gun violence, immigration and foreign policy. Florida has increasingly shifted rightward in recent election cycles, giving Rubio the advantage as Republicans now lead Democrats with voter registration in the state. But Demings clearly saw the debate as an opportunity to take Rubio on forcefully as she tries to become the state's first Black senator. Rubio skirted a question on whether he would support a federal abortion ban with no exceptions and instead called Demings' position extreme because she would not say what limits on abortion she would support. \"Every bill I have ever sponsored on abortion and every bill I've ever voted for has exceptions,\" Rubio said. \"What we know is that the senator supports no exceptions,\" Demings responded. \"He can make his mouth say anything today. He is good at that, by the way. What day is it and what is Marco Rubio saying?\" Following the Supreme Court's decision in June to overturn Roe v. Wade, Rubio has expressed his personal opposition to abortion in all cases while saying he'd back abortion-restricting statutes that include exceptions. Demings supports abortion access at least until fetal viability, saying the government should not be the one to determine that. On gun control, Demings accused Rubio of not doing enough to change laws to prevent shootings, including mass killings at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in 2016 and at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland in 2018. \"How long will you watch people being gunned down in first grade, fourth grade, high school, college, church, synagogue, grocery store, movie theater, a mall and a nightclub and do nothing?\" Demings said. But Rubio defended his opposition to gun restrictions, saying some proposals would not have stopped many of the mass shootings and Americans have a Second Amendment right to protect themselves. \"Everything she is for would have done nothing to stop any of those shootings,\" Rubio said. \"Every one of these shooters would have passed the background check that she keeps insisting on. No one here is in favor of mass shootings and violence.\" To address inflation, Rubio said the U.S. needs to stop spending so much money, citing some pandemic relief funds, and to boost domestic oil production. He chastised the Biden administration for its decision to release more oil from the U.S. strategic reserve to help bring down prices at the pump. \"Oil reserves do not exist to win midterms,\" Rubio said. Demings said the pandemic relief money was necessary to help hurting families and businesses. \"Of course the senator who has never run anything at all but his mouth would know nothing about helping people and being there for people when they are in trouble,\" Demings said. Rubio also attacked Demings for not passing legislation in Washington, saying all she had done was get post offices named after people. Demings angrily rejected his characterization, noting the buildings were named after police officers who died in the line of duty. \"It's embarrassing that you think that honoring a person who was a hero by naming a federal building after them is nothing,\" she said. Demings repeatedly accused Rubio of distorting her record and positions on issues. \"I am really disappointed in you, Marco Rubio, because I think there was a time when you did not lie in order to win,\" she said. Rubio maintained that Demings was simply there to support Biden's and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's agenda, while calling himself the most effective senator. \"In the two terms I've been there, no U.S. senator has gotten more done than I have,\" he said. \"The only thing she does is vote 100% with Pelosi.\" Asked whether he would accept the results of the 2022 election, Rubio said, \"Sure, because I'm going to win.\" Later, he clarified that \"no matter what the outcome is, I'll support it, because Florida has good laws. They're not some crazy laws like they have in Pennsylvania and these other places.\"",

            "article_content": "President Biden gave a speech about abortion rights Tuesday, billed as a political event ahead of the upcoming midterm elections.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: President Biden made a full-throated plea to young voters today, urging them to cast ballots in the upcoming midterm elections and promising that if Democrats win Congress, they will enshrine into law the right to an abortion. It's something that Democrats have elevated as a central issue since the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Let me tell you something. The court and the extreme Republicans who have spent decades trying to overturn Roe are about to find out. (APPLAUSE) BIDEN: As they say in one of the towns I grew up, they ain't seen nothing yet. CHANG: Biden was speaking at Howard University in Washington, D.C., a historically Black institution. And NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson was listening in. She joins us now. Hey, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: OK. So abortion is something that Democrats have already been talking a lot about on the campaign trail. What struck you the most about Biden's remarks on abortion today? LIASSON: What struck me is how directly he addressed the current worry for Democrats, which is their concern that the fervor over the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision overturning Roe is now subsiding. Twice in his speech, once near the beginning and again at the end, he invoked what he called, quote, \"the anger, the worry, the disbelief\" that Democrats felt when the Supreme Court ended the longstanding constitutional protection for abortion. Here's what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: I'm asking the American people to remember how you felt, how you felt the day the extreme Dobbs decision came down and Roe was overturned after 50 years. LIASSON: Yeah, remember how you felt. This was the moment that spurred a lot of new Democratic voters to register. And for a while, Democrats seemed energized because of the abortion issue. But now, there's a sense among Democrats that they might have peaked too soon. Biden wants to take people back to that moment when Democrats seemed to be successfully turning this election from a referendum on Biden and his performance in office into a choice between extremist Republicans and more moderate Democrats. Lately, it seems like some of that momentum has ebbed. And the issues that are now coming back to the fore are inflation and crime and immigration, where Republicans have big advantages. And also, don't forget, it was no accident that he went to Howard because in his audience were two important constituencies for Democrats, young voters and African American voters. CHANG: OK. Well, with respect to the issue of abortion, I understand that President Biden made a couple of promises in his speech. Let's take a listen to the first promise. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: If Republicans get their way with a national ban, it won't matter where you live in America. So let me be very clear. If such a bill were to pass in the next several years, I'll veto it. (APPLAUSE) CHANG: I mean, Mara, what did you make of that argument - I'll just veto it? LIASSON: That struck me as very odd. If you are trying to revive the importance of abortion as a motivating issue for Democratic voters, that sounds counterproductive... CHANG: Right. LIASSON: ...Saying that, don't worry, if Republicans pass a nationwide ban, I'll veto it. You have nothing to worry about. If the whole point is to scare the daylights out of Democratic voters and get them to the polls, that doesn't sound like a really good way to do it. CHANG: Exactly. OK. So what did you make of the other promise that President Biden made today - if Democrats take the House and Senate, they will pass a law to codify Roe v. Wade in January? LIASSON: That would be very popular. You know, polls show about two-thirds of voters want abortion to be legal up to a point, with exceptions and restrictions. Roe is a kind of middle ground. And the problem is for Democrats, when they put these bills up, the reason why it failed recently in the Senate is they often go further than merely codifying the protections in Roe. But yes, a bill to just codify Roe, that would be very popular. CHANG: And we should know that Biden - I mean, he spoke very directly to young voters in this speech. Can you explain why young voters are such an important part of the Democratic strategy for the midterms? LIASSON: Young voters just don't turn out as much for midterm elections, and Democrats want them to go to the polls. Biden talked about how critical young voters were to his own victory in 2020. He listed all the things he's done that are priorities for young voters, like climate initiatives and the Inflation Reduction Act, gun safety laws, forgiving up to $20,000 of student debt. So far, 12 million people have applied for that, including 4 million yesterday. He also reminded them that he kept a promise to pardon people convicted of marijuana possession under federal law. The big question is, will that actually motivate young voters to go to the polls or is voter behavior just driven so much by negative partisanship, the only reason they go to the polls is to vote against the other side? CHANG: That is NPR's Mara Liasson. Thank you, Mara. LIASSON: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: Montana is 1 of 6 states adding seats in the U.S. House of Representatives this year due to population growth. More voters identify as Republicans than Democrats. But the GOP candidate in this race has to live down his bumpy time in the Trump administration in order to win. Montana Public Radio's Shaylee Ragar reports. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: You know him, you've known him, you've trusted him - Commander Ryan Zinke. (APPLAUSE) SHAYLEE RAGAR, BYLINE: At a campaign rally outside Bozeman this summer, Ryan Zinke, a retired Navy SEAL, painted himself as a patriotic champion of conservative priorities, like restricting immigration, amping up energy production and cutting taxes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RYAN ZINKE: What are we going to do? We're not going to give them the flag. We're not going to give them the Constitution. And we're going to fight. RAGAR: Zinke previously won two races to represent Montana in the U.S. House, but left his last term early when former President Donald Trump tapped him to lead the Interior Department in 2017. But he quit Interior early, too, in the wake of 18 ethics investigations. This year, the Interior Department's inspector general, a Trump appointee, released two reports that concluded Zinke lied to investigators on multiple occasions and used his office to advance a project of personal interest in Montana. Zinke brushes the investigations off as politically motivated. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ZINKE: When you want to get things done in Washington, D.C., and you actually want to push back against the bureaucracy, what we call the swamp, they don't like it. And that's exactly what happened. RAGAR: But there's evidence that Montana voters might not be buying that. Zinke only won the Republican primary here by a razor-thin margin. Jessi Bennion teaches political science at Montana State University. JESSI BENNION: The close results of the primary probably made him kick it into higher gear on the campaign trail. RAGAR: Election analysts with Roll Call initially dubbed this race likely Republican, but recently updated it to leans Republican, meaning more competitive. Zinke's Democratic opponent is Monica Tranel, an attorney who's worked on energy and agriculture issues in Montana for more than 20 years. MONICA TRANEL: I've been here. I've been on the ground, in the trenches with you, by your side, in our communities, showing up. RAGAR: Montana hasn't elected a Democrat to the U.S. House since 1994. And Zinke has raised more than twice as much for the race. But Tranel is winning endorsements from prominent Republicans, including a former governor, secretary of state, and the former chair of the state GOP. And there's a Libertarian candidate in the race who could spell trouble for Zinke, says Montana State's Jessi Bennion. BENNION: Even if he got a few percentage points, that - in a close race, if Tranel is gaining traction, that can produce upsets. We've seen that. RAGAR: For Zinke to win, he's going to need Republican voters to stay loyal. Like Gerald Ryder, a retired National Park Service employee who was at the Bozeman rally. GERALD RYDER: Ryan Zinke, as far as I am concerned, you know, he's a hero for Montana, you know? I mean, he served the country. He did it honorably. There are hundreds of people trying to paint him in a different color. And I don't believe that. RAGAR: Zinke has Trump's endorsement. The former president won Montana by 16 points in the last election. This race is another test of Trump's political influence across the country. For NPR News, I'm Shaylee Ragar in Helena, Montana.

I spoke with Adrienne Elrod, a Democratic strategist, about what Harris has been doing, and she said it's a smart strategy for the VP to focus on this topic around the country. ADRIENNE ELROD: It drives not just national news, but it really drives some of those really important local headlines. So when the vice president is traveling to various states, I mean, her visit to those states will likely lead most of the daily papers in that state, or at least in that specific area. SHIVARAM: And Scott, I traveled with Harris to Connecticut last week for one of these abortion events that she did. It's a blue state, but there is a really close congressional race there. And there was local coverage of that event throughout Hartford. And even when she's not traveling, she's been doing local radio interviews in different states as well. So the strategy here is really to keep abortion rights in the headlines in these last few weeks of the election. SIMON: And, Deepa, what indications are there as to how voters might be responding? SHIVARAM: Yeah. Well, polling shows that topics like abortion are high motivating factors for both Democrats and independents. And the idea is to get them out to vote in elections that sometimes have lower turnout, like midterms. But abortion isn't the only thing. A majority of voters right now say inflation is the biggest concern for them. And issues around immigration are important, too. And that's one topic that some people think Harris hasn't spoken out on enough. Domingo Garcia, the president of a Latino advocacy group called LULAC, said that among people in his community in Texas, the enthusiasm to vote in the midterms is lukewarm. He feels that even though one of Harris' jobs in the administration is to focus on migration, it's been on a back burner for Democrats this election cycle. DOMINGO GARCIA: The silence has been deafening. And that's allowed the Republicans to take the lead and use immigration as a wedge issue in the midterms. SHIVARAM: And you'll recall, Scott, this is an issue that has quite literally come to the vice president's doorstep with the Republican governors like Greg Abbott from Texas bussing migrants to her home in Washington, D.C. Republicans often use the topic of immigration to get Republican voters out to the polls. So there is some concern that Democrats' response here, including Harris', hasn't been strong enough. SIMON: Well, what else are people expecting to see from the vice president in these final weeks? SHIVARAM: I think one thing to keep an eye on is her fundraising for the party. She was a top fundraiser for Democrats in the presidential election, so you can definitely expect more of that from her. And she'll be holding more events - especially ones that target women and young voters - that focus on the work the administration has been doing. But don't expect too many traditional events where she's standing next to candidates rallying on stage. Her political popularity, as well as the president's, are not very high. So there's some distance between the administration and Democratic candidates in tight races on the campaign trail. SIMON: NPR political reporter Deepa Shivaram - thanks so much for being with us.

            "article_content": "The Biden administration says it will immediately begin returning Venezuelan migrants who cross the border illegally to Mexico, while also creating a narrow legal pathway for some who can qualify.  LEILA FADEL, HOST: The Biden administration says it will begin expelling Venezuelans who cross the southern border illegally. A MARTINEZ, HOST: The number of Venezuelans making the dangerous journey to the southern border is soaring. Migrants are fleeing violence and insecurity in the face of economic collapse in their country. There is still a legal pathway, though, but it's narrow and whoever applies needs to have financial sponsors in the U.S. The new policy also requires Mexico to continue its parallel effort to take back Venezuelans who entered illegally. FADEL: NPR's Joel Rose covers immigration for the network and joins us now. Hi, Joel. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Hi, Leila. FADEL: So, Joel, why is the administration doing this now? ROSE: Well, the Biden administration wants to bring down the record numbers of Venezuelan migrants who've been arriving at the southern border this year. Venezuela's economy has been falling apart under authoritarian leader Nicolas Maduro and the impact of U.S. sanctions. The U.N. says more than six million Venezuelans have left the country in recent years. Most have resettled elsewhere in Latin America, but a growing number are making the journey to the U.S., many of them crossing on foot through the infamous Darien Gap jungle in Panama. More than 150,000 have crossed the U.S. border in the last fiscal year, including 25,000 in August alone. And that's putting a strain on immigration authorities at the border, and it's prompting mounting criticism from Republican governors, who've been sending thousands of these migrants north in buses to cities run by Democratic mayors. FADEL: So what's the Biden administration's approach? ROSE: It's part carrot and part stick. The administration says it will immediately begin expelling Venezuelan migrants who illegally cross the U.S. border and returning them to Mexico, which is a big change because previously the administration could not expel those migrants under the pandemic border restrictions known as Title 42, because Mexico had refused to take them in. That's the stick. The carrot is that the U.S. will create a new legal pathway for up to 24,000 Venezuelan migrants who can meet the eligibility requirements. It's modeled on a program for admitting Ukrainian refugees earlier in the year. One requirement under this new program is that Venezuelan migrants will have to show they have not crossed the border illegally. They have to apply from abroad before they fly here. And they will have to show that they have a financial sponsor who's already in the U.S., which is not, you know, going to be easy for many of them. FADEL: Right. ROSE: Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said he wants to make clear that there is a lawful and orderly way for Venezuelans to come to the U.S. and that it is, quote, \"the only way.\" FADEL: Now, Biden is under a lot of pressure to get border crossings down. With midterm elections coming up, is this going to help him in the midterms? ROSE: It might, but, you know, there are some major obstacles. For one thing, Venezuelan migrants are still, you know, just a small fraction of all migrant crossings. And another obstacle is that relatively few Venezuelans are going to qualify for this new legal pathway. Many of the migrants crossing this year, you know, simply don't have family or community connections already in the U.S. who could sponsor them. And that's a big difference between Venezuelans and many other migrants who've come before. And, you know, many of these migrants may still decide to just take their chances at the border. FADEL: What does Mexico have to say about all this? ROSE: The U.S. and Mexico announced this agreement together, but their respective press releases emphasized very different things. The Mexican government emphasized that the U.S. will be giving out more than 60,000 additional seasonal U.S. work visas for folks from Mexico and Central America. No one is publicly saying that there's a quid pro quo here, but the U.S., you know, can only expel these migrants under Title 42 if Mexico agrees to take them.

            "article_content": "The Jan. 6 panel presents evidence in a final hearing. More details are out on why the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago. White House expels illegal Venezuelan migrants as it offers some a legal path to entry.  LEILA FADEL, HOST: Today may be the final hearing from the House committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol. A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: Yeah. The committee plans to share new evidence and new testimony that sums up its case for the nation, a case that blames - that places blame for the attack squarely on former President Trump. FADEL: NPR congressional correspondent Deirdre Walsh joins us now with a preview of today's hearing. Good morning, Deirdre. DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Good morning, Leila. FADEL: OK, so the committee is promising new evidence. Any hint of what that could be? WALSH: Well, aides to the panel stressed that there would be new information. We know we're not going to hear from live witnesses today. But the panel is going to show some taped testimony from witnesses we - who haven't been featured in any of the eight public hearings this year. They haven't named names, but we know the panel has been meeting with witnesses in closed-door depositions and getting a lot more documents over the last few weeks. Last month, they met with Ginni Thomas. She's a Republican activist and who's also the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. She was communicating with John Eastman, one of former President Trump's outside legal advisers who was pushing this plan to overturn the 2020 election results. We could hear today some detail about what she told the committee in her hours-long testimony. Another area where we expect to see some new information today is related to what members of the Secret Service saw and heard on January 6. The panel has got hundreds of thousands of pages of evidence over the summer after sending the agency a subpoena in July. Remember, there was very dramatic testimony this summer about an angry Trump lunging for a member of his detail after agents refused his demand to be driven to the Capitol the morning of January 6 as his supporters were prepping to march there from a rally near the White House. FADEL: Now, this obviously centers around the former president. But the panel never actually interviewed the former president. Should we expect to hear more about Trump and his role? WALSH: Well, the committee is saying there's going to be a focus today on the former president's state of mind. But as you noted, they haven't talked to him directly. We're likely to, you know, hear more from testimony from senior White House aides who have cooperated with the committee. Here's what committee member Zoe Lofgren of California told CNN earlier this week about they would - what they would flesh out. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ZOE LOFGREN: What the president's intentions were, what he knew, what he did. WALSH: Another person that the panel hasn't talked to is former Vice President Mike Pence. He did signal at one point he might be willing to appear. But members of the committee now admit those close to Pence push back on that. So they don't have any new firsthand information from him. FADEL: Now, the last few hearings have focused on kind of specific themes - right? - the pressure on Vice President Pence... WALSH: Right. FADEL: ...The efforts to install supporters at the Justice Department. Is there a theme today? WALSH: Today is really expected to be more of a step back, according to aides. We're going to hear from the chair, Bennie Thompson, the ranking member, Liz Cheney. But also, the seven other committee members are all going to present evidence of the whole timeline of the events leading up to the attack on that day and after. We're going to see a synthesis of some of the evidence that's already presented in prior hearings. They're not calling this their closing argument, but this panel expires at the end of the year. So they realize there isn't really a lot more time to show what they've learned in their investigation. This is, really, basically, their last chance to make their case about the former president's central role in inciting the riot at the Capitol. One other thing they want to do is emphasize the ongoing threats to democracy. FADEL: Now, very quickly - now what, after all this investigation, all these hearings? WALSH: Right. Well, the committee is writing up a report that's going to be out by the end of the year. But really, the action has already shifted from Capitol Hill to the Justice Department in the last few months. We've learned more about what they're learning in their investigation. And we're awaiting information about any new charges they could possibly bring against the former president or those close to him. FADEL: NPR's Deirdre Walsh. Thanks, Deirdre. WALSH: Thanks, Leila. FADEL: And now we turn to another investigation involving Trump. There are new revelations about what led to the Justice Department's Mar-a-Lago probe according to reporting from The Washington Post. MART\u00cdNEZ: A witness told authorities that the former president told them to move classified material from the resort to his private residence after he got a subpoena for the documents And security camera footage reportedly corroborated that account. This all came before the FBI search of Trump's residence and private club, where investigators were looking for evidence of possible crimes. FADEL: And that's all according to people familiar with the case that spoke to, among the reporters that broke the story, Devlin Barrett. And he's one of those reporters. Hi, Devlin. DEVLIN BARRETT: Hi, Leila. How are you? FADEL: Great. So just how damning is this evidence in the Justice - in this Justice Department investigation? BARRETT: Well, it's been described to us as very important evidence, and important in two ways. One, obviously, it is important if you have a person describing instructions from the former president himself. And it's obviously important in the sense of there being security camera footage that seems to buttress that account. Damning or damaging, I think you have to look at the totality of everything they have. And there are still some things we don't know. FADEL: Right. BARRETT: But it's clearly very important. FADEL: Do we know anything about what was in the boxes that were being moved? BARRETT: So the boxes have always been described to us by people familiar with the case as kind of a mishmash of material, not a particularly organized set of documents or items. And some of these things aren't even documents. FADEL: I guess I'm asking specifically about the ones... BARRETT: Right. FADEL: ...Yeah, that are being directed to move from here to here. BARRETT: Right. So I don't think we have a good sense of that. But what we know from the other investigative steps they've taken is that many of these boxes - most of these boxes, in fact, had classified material scattered throughout them. FADEL: How reliable is this witness, according to those who you spoke to? I mean, in the story, you describe a witness that changed their story dramatically over time after being reinterviewed. BARRETT: Right. The first - in the first interview, we're told - this person denied moving any boxes or knowing anything about, you know, sensitive documents. In their second interview, they told a much different story and said that they did move boxes and they were told to do that. So obviously, that's a big difference. And that is - I think, a major issue that has yet to be sort of clarified is, how critical is that changing account? And what does the Justice Department ultimately make of that? FADEL: Now, you - did you reach out - you did reach out to the Justice Department, to Trump's people. What did they say? BARRETT: So as they have throughout, Trump's representatives have blamed the Biden Justice Department for what they say is unfair treatment and basically going after the former president for political reasons. You know, they continue to insist this is a simple dispute over document storage. And obviously, the Justice Department, through its filings and through some other steps they've taken, show that this is - they believe this is much more serious than that. FADEL: Devlin Barrett, thank you for your time and for your reporting. BARRETT: Thank you.

John Fetterman in the Pennsylvania Senate race.\n                \n                    \n                    Nate Smallwood/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Celebrity TV doctor Mehmet Oz, left, has benefited from millions of dollars spent on TV ads from outside groups to help him close the gap with Lt. Gov. John Fetterman in the Pennsylvania Senate race. With exactly four weeks left for ballots to be cast in the 2022 midterm elections, the landscape for control of the Senate is shifting again. The field has moved slightly back in Republicans' direction, in part because of a natural tightening closer to November as the races come into focus for more people, but also because of a deluge of television advertising in key races supporting GOP candidates. The Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell, has spent $52 million on TV ads in just the past two weeks, according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact. A new outside group, MAGA Inc., aligned with and sanctioned by former President Trump has now popped up and starting to spend significantly. They have poured in about $2 million in two states \u2014 Pennsylvania and Ohio, places where Trump-endorsed Senate candidates are struggling. Partisan control of the Senate is currently tied at 50-50, with Democrats in charge of the agenda because they have the White House. So Republicans need a net gain of one seat to wrest control of the chamber. The field of the top 10 most likely to flip continues to be the same group of races with Republicans making serious runs at five Democratic-controlled seats and Democrats contending in the other five. But control will likely be decided in just five of those \u2014 with Democratic targets in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and Republicans making a real push in Nevada, Georgia and Arizona. From our previous top 10, we moved Nevada and North Carolina up a spot each, while Arizona and New Hampshire moved down a place each. Here's a look at the field: 1. Pennsylvania (R-Open) It may be a natural and expected tightening, but following a month of millions of dollars in TV ads spent in the past month by Republican outside groups, the significant lead once held by Democrat John Fetterman over Republican celebrity TV doctor Mehmet Oz has shrunk considerably. At issue are Fetterman's health \u2014 he had a stroke that took him off the campaign trail for a considerable amount of time \u2014 and Oz's struggles with swing voters and his base. Oz has made several stumbles that Fetterman's deft social media team has capitalized on \u2014 from crudit\u00e9 to Oz's fundraiser in front of \"Hitler's limo.\" All eyes will be on the Oct. 25 debate between the two. This is still Democrats' top target and the most likely Senate seat to change hands. Previous: 1 2. Georgia (D-Warnock) Republican Herschel Walker, left, is challenging incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga. Walker is facing allegations he paid an ex to have an abortion despite his hard-right stance on the issue.\n                \n                    \n                    Megan Varner/Getty Images; Elijah Nouvelage/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican Herschel Walker, left, is challenging incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga. Walker is facing allegations he paid an ex to have an abortion despite his hard-right stance on the issue. If ever there was a test of whether scandals still matter in this era of hyper-partisanship, this is it. Republican Herschel Walker's problems continue with the allegation that he paid for an ex-girlfriend, who says she's the mother of one of his other children, to have an abortion. He denies the allegation. The Daily Beast presented a receipt for the abortion, a check Walker paid his ex days later and a get-well card he signed. The outlet also reported that a friend of the ex-girlfriend, who was not named but was told the story at the time, also corroborated the report. The New York Times reported that the same woman said Walker urged her to have another abortion two years later. She refused, which she says ended their relationship. Walker denies this allegation as well. NPR has not confirmed the details of the stories. Walker is staunchly anti-abortion rights, not believing in any exceptions, and his responses to the scandal have been muddled at best. Republicans are warily watching what happens here. Walker raised lots of money after the news came out, but even Republicans contend that any momentum Walker had has stalled for now. Still, Republicans in the state don't have any other GOP options, Brian Kemp is expected to do well in his gubernatorial election, which could help Walker in the end, and this is still a place that at least leans toward Republicans despite its swing-state status. But this is the kind of allegation that would have sunk previous campaigns. The result will say a lot about our politics \u2014 although Republicans already voted for a candidate who was accused of sexual misconduct by almost two dozen women and who bragged about assaulting women. Previous: 2 3. Nevada (D-Cortez Masto) Democrats continue to say incumbent Catherine Cortez Masto is running a good campaign, but she's started to slip behind Trump-backed challenger Adam Laxalt, who denies the result of the 2020 presidential election. The bottom line is Cortez Masto is the most vulnerable incumbent senator in the country right now. This is a state that has leaned Democratic in recent years, but their victories have been really close, and both sides expect another tight finish. Democrats say Laxalt has been vulnerable to attacks over his ties to Trump, and his lies that inspired the Jan. 6 insurrection, as well as on abortion rights. A big reason for the Republican opportunity here, though, is the economy. And some Democrats are concerned the party is focusing too heavily on abortion and not addressing the economy in a focused way. The state has a high population of working-class whites, Latinos and Asian Americans still trying to recover from the economic effects of the pandemic. Latinos are a key group to watch. They have helped tip the balance toward Democrats in previous years, but Republicans contend they have been able to appeal to the group \u2014 here and in other states \u2014 over the pandemic's economic effects, crime and their frustration with progressive Democratic positions. Democrats have traditionally done well in Nevada by turning out their base voters, and they say Cortez Masto has been up on the air with Spanish-language ads for months and is well-liked in the Latino community. But there are questions about the party's ability to get out the vote locally. Democrats believe they have the resources and organization to do it well, but this election will be a big test of whether they can keep the Nevada turnout machine going. If Democrats take Pennsylvania, Republicans would need to pick up two seats to win control. That makes Nevada critical to the GOP's chances. If they aren't able to take Georgia or Nevada, they'd likely need to sweep both Arizona (next on our list) and New Hampshire, which is tougher for them and has slipped down the list to No. 7 because of a weaker Republican candidate. Previous: 4 4.

As operatives in both parties have expected, this race has tightened. Arizona is a place where Republicans outnumber Democrats and where independents really matter. That's the hurdle for both incumbent Democrat Mark Kelly and Trump-backed challenger Blake Masters. Masters ran an ad earlier in the cycle, when he was trying to win the primary, saying that Trump won the 2020 election. In a general-election debate against Kelly last week, he called President Biden the \"legitimate president.\" It's quite the shift, and not the only one he's made. Masters also backtracked on his hardline stance on abortion. He had called himself \"100% pro-life\" and advocated for a federal \"personhood\" law \"that recognizes that unborn babies are human beings that may not be killed.\" Both of those were scrubbed from his website in the general election and now describes his position in ads as \"common sense,\" while trying to describe Kelly as an \"extremist\" on the issue. The Senate Leadership Fund, the well-heeled super PAC tied to McConnell, has pulled out of the state. That makes it even more challenging for Masters without that air support. Kelly, meanwhile, in this border state where Republicans outnumber Democrats, distanced himself from Biden in the recent debate, saying he criticized the president when he \"decided he was going to do something dumb\" on immigration. Previous: 3 5. Wisconsin (R-Johnson) Incumbent Ron Johnson hasn't backed down from controversial positions, and his favorability ratings have struggled. That said, he's well aware of how he's viewed and has run a hard-nosed campaign. Republicans are more confident about this race now than a month ago, though, as they've run a deluge of ads attacking Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes on crime -- and Johnson has seen a boost in the polls as a result. Barnes was slow to respond, but has now gone on the air with an ad featuring a retired police sergeant. \"Mandela doesn't want to defund the police; he's very supportive of law enforcement,\" the retired sergeant says in the ad. Barnes is also going after Johnson on abortion now and Democrats expect this race to tighten and be a 1-to-2 point race, as so many statewide races in Wisconsin have been. If Johnson holds on, Pennsylvania might be the only Democratic flip. And, as we noted, that race is tightening as well. Previous: 5 6. North Carolina (R-Open) That said, North Carolina, a Republican-controlled seat, has trended up the top 10, and both sides expect a close finish between Democrat Cheri Beasley and Trump-backed Rep. Ted Budd. Some Democrats have complained that there haven't been enough resources poured into this race, which they see as winnable, to push Beasley over the finish line in this state that has leaned toward Republicans in recent presidential and Senate elections. So lately, there's been a bit of an uptick in Democratic spending. We'll see if it makes a difference. Beasley, first Black woman to serve as chief justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court, has run a fairly nonantagonistic campaign in this state with a high number of right-leaning independents. She's focused not just on cities, but also Black voters in rural counties as well abortion rights, like other Democrats across the country. Budd's campaign, on the other hand, has confounded many Republicans. A former Republican governor called his campaign too \"risk averse,\" and Budd doesn't appear to be doing much to court independent voters. He has hugged Trump, talked of immigration, calling every county a \"border county\" and accused Beasley of being \"deceptive\" in painting herself as a moderate. His campaign says he will be focusing more on retail politics and inflation in coming day, and Republicans are hoping tens of millions spent by Republican outside groups in the final weeks can nudge Budd past Beasley. Budd is expected to have the advantage in the end, but this one has remained close so far. Previous: 7 7. New Hampshire (D-Hassan) Republicans got their candidate \u2014 and it's not the one the establishment wanted. Democratic incumbent Maggie Hassan looks to have an easier path than before the Republican primary, as she faces off against controversial Retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc. He's aligned himself with Trump, denies the 2020 election results and has boosted vaccine conspiracies. That's going to be a tough sell in this state, where about 40% of people identify as independents \u2014 and even Republicans acknowledge abortion is effective as an issue. And on Friday, it was reported that the National Republican Senatorial Committee has canceled their advertising for the state and redirecting the funds elsewhere. Previous: 6 8. Ohio (R-Open) Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan held eyebrow-raising leads in this right-leaning state for quite a while. That is until the cavalry came to Republican J.D. Vance's aid here. The Senate Leadership Fund poured in $28 million to boost Vance, and it has paid off. This is a state both parties expected to tighten \u2014 and never really believed polls would hold \u2014 because of the rightward tilt of the state. Plus, as voting nears, people naturally start to turn their attention to these races \u2014 and late deciders in these races tend to move toward the bend of the state. Because it's right-leaning Ohio, Ryan has deemphasized party and is focusing on a message of finding \"common ground,\" like in this ad with his wife. Vance has been trying to soften his image in ads with his wife \u2014 and hitting Ryan on crime \u2014 after coming across as a firebrand who won Trump's endorsement and made controversial statements about women. Previous: 8 9. Florida (R-Rubio) Incumbent Marco Rubio has continued to hold a consistent lead in this race against the Democratic challenger, Rep. Val Demings, despite Demings raising a significant amount of money. Something else to watch in this race, though, is what effect Hurricane Ian will have, which is unclear at this point as the cleanup continues. Lee and Collier counties, which took direct hits from the hurricane, are heavily Republican areas, but lots of other places, like Orlando, where Demings was police chief, up to Jacksonville are also reeling and dealing with the aftereffects of devastating flooding. The campaigns and committees are still trying to adjust with just a month to go in the election. Previous: 9 10. Colorado (D-Bennet) Republican challenger Joe O'Dea, who has struck a moderate chord, particularly on abortion rights and partisanship, is making this a race against incumbent Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet. The race could be decided in single digits, though Bennet is still favored. Democrats started to spend more money in the state to help shore it up. They are hitting O'Dea particularly on gun safety and accusing him of \"talking out of both sides of his mouth\" on abortion. Resources, however, are finite and Republicans are happy to see Democrats have to use some in this Democratic-leaning state. Previous: 10 Worth keeping an eye on: The Senate race in Washington state, between incumbent Democrat Patty Murray and Republican veterans advocate Tiffany Smiley, has been in single digits in the last several polls. Murray has led in all of them and touted her tenure and items in recent Democratic-passed legislation, even as Smiley has tried to use those very things against her, saying they've led to inflation. Republicans are even running an ad showing Murray morphing into Biden. Murray has focused on tangible items included in legislation she fought for, like lowering prices for prescription drugs and insulin.",

            "article_content": "OPEC Plus countries dealt a blow to the Biden Administration's hopes of keeping gas prices down, with just a few weeks to go before the midterm election.  AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: Some unwelcome news for the Biden administration just a few weeks before the midterms - a vote by OPEC+ countries to cut oil production in an effort to boost oil prices. Of course, higher oil prices means higher gas prices, adding to the anxiety many Americans feel these days about their own budgets and bottom lines. Joining me now to talk about what this all means politically is NPR White House correspondent Asma Khalid. Hi, Asma. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Hi, Ayesha. Good to be with you. RASCOE: So it was just a couple of months ago as gas was coming down from a national average of $5 a gallon that President Biden paid a visit to Saudi Arabia. Now, the White House said that wasn't about oil. And, you know, maybe that was or was not the case. People thought it was. But either way, Saudis are not producing more oil. You have this OPEC vote. So what can Biden do now? KHALID: So when the news broke, the White House issued a statement immediately saying that the president was disappointed by the, quote, \"shortsighted decision.\" And on Thursday, as President Biden was about to board the Marine One helicopter, he was asked by reporters, what's your reaction to the OPEC+ decision? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Disappointment. And we're looking at what alternatives we may have. KHALID: He was asked explicitly if Venezuela would be one of those alternatives. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: There's a lot of alternatives. We haven't made up our mind yet. KHALID: And one of the president's top economic advisers told reporters this week that nothing is off the table when you talk about alternatives. So a couple of options that experts have mentioned is lifting sanctions on Venezuela to allow the country to just produce more oil that other countries could obtain from there or placing export restrictions on U.S. energy or even trying to crack down on OPEC itself. The White House said this past week that it plans to consult with Congress on additional tools to reduce OPEC's control over energy prices. And one oil analyst I spoke with suggested that could be huge. He has not seen any president on the right or the left willing to push OPEC. There is talk in Congress of this NOPEC bill, as it's known, to curb OPEC's influence. It's been introduced, reintroduced over the years, never gone anywhere, and there's thought that maybe the momentum now is different. And, Ayesha, one last thing I should note is that one reason gas prices went down earlier this year was that the Biden administration released a record amount of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And after this OPEC news came out this week, the administration announced it would order the release of 10 million more barrels from the reserve in November. RASCOE: So we're expecting to see new economic numbers this week. You know, how much is the health of the economy resonating with voters? That's usually, like, a top issue, right? KHALID: And it has, I would say, consistently been a top issue for voters. If you look at Gallup polls for months, I would say, going back to at least October of last year, people have been saying that the economy is the most important problem in the country, and that's mainly because of inflation. You know, prices have been stubbornly high - and not just gas, but food, rent, utility bills. And economists that I've spoken with say that inflation registers emotionally with people in a way that other economic data just doesn't. And that's particularly the case for gas prices because, you know, people drive around. They see those big signs that flash what the gas price is, and so it has this inflated value in people's minds, and that is why, potentially, rising gas prices this close to the elections is not ideal for Democrats. RASCOE: So in the about - of the minute we have left, Democrats had been heartened by the sense that maybe there wouldn't be a red wave in the midterms and that maybe they could hold on to the Senate. With just about a month to go, what are the challenges for both parties? KHALID: Well, the main challenge for both parties is turnout. There is very little persuasion left in politics, right? So it's about making sure that your respective voters actually vote. Democrats have been trying to hammer home concerns over abortion, democracy and Donald Trump as a way to energize voters, and Republicans are trying to elevate concerns over immigration, crime and the economy. There are two main wildcards in this election. One is the Supreme Court Dobbs decision because it seems to be energizing Democrats despite the president's approval numbers. The second wildcard, though, is the former president. He seems to be ever-present, Donald Trump. And usually, midterms are a referendum on the president in power, but I would say Trump's presence has made this very unpredictable and more of a choice this election cycle. RASCOE: That's NPR White House correspondent Asma Khalid. Thank you so much for talking with us today. KHALID: My pleasure. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Political scientist Christina Greer (right) compares Abrams with other Black women politicians who have made history. It's been a long road of firsts for Stacey Abrams. She was the first female minority leader in the Georgia General Assembly. The first Black person in the state House of Representatives to take her party's top spot. And then, four years ago, the first Black woman to be a major party's candidate for governor. Most of us hadn't heard of Abrams until that landmark 2018 campaign, which drew both support and scrutiny from far beyond Georgia. In a year marked by record numbers of women running for office, Abrams became a leading Democratic figure and a symbol of the fight against voter suppression. Stacey Abrams on \"unfinished business\" around women's rights and abortion | It's Been A Minute Her razor-thin loss to now-Gov. Brian Kemp devastated party hopefuls. But it barely slowed her down. Abrams went on to found Fair Fight Action, a voting rights policy organization that later filed a lawsuit challenging Georgia's voting system. (Last week a federal judge ruled in favor of the state, saying that Georgia's election practices did not violate voters' constitutional rights.) She produced an Oscar-nominated documentary on the nation's history of denying Black people the right to vote. In 2020, she was floated as a possible running mate to President Joe Biden. Now Abrams is reaching for history again, in a second bid for the governorship. This time, she's armed with the experience of running for statewide office and four years' worth of coalition building. Will it be enough to make her the country's first Black woman governor? In her debut as the new host of It's Been a Minute, Brittany Luse talks to Stacey Abrams \u2014 about the power and pitfalls of being an icon; how her win would shift the politics of the Deep South; and how she balances pragmatism and hope. Then Brittany asks political scientist Christina Greer of Fordham University to discuss Abrams' strategy, and how the former minority leader mirrors other Black women politicians who made history. Y0u can listen to the full episode at the top of the page, or on Spotify or Apple Podcasts. These excerpts have been edited for length and clarity. On being an avatar for people's hopes Brittany Luse: You are again so close to making history as the first Black woman governor ever in the United States. But in 2018, you were fresh on the national stage, and now you are \u2014 I think it's an understatement to say \u2014 very well-known and something of an icon for many people. This aspect of savior-hood that I have noticed people projecting onto you, that would be a lot for me. Is that a lot for you? Stacey Abrams: So there is a recent story that said that, you know, have I lost my magic? I've always chafed at the \"Black girl magic\" narrative because it presumes a lack of agency on the part of the people voting. And it imbues me with almost messianic responsibility that I didn't ask for, don't accept and will not do. There's no way to go back and be who I was in '18 before people had heard my name, before they cared about it. And I don't want to, because that would also erase all of the progress we've made. My responsibility is not to solve everyone's problems. It's to help remove barriers and leverage the capacity of the state to solve the foundational, fundamental challenges that preclude people from getting access to opportunity, education, health care, housing, the ability to make a good living. Those are the things I can promise I will help with, but I will never be so arrogant as to believe that I alone have delivered or I alone am responsible. I am an avatar. And people pour into avatars both their loves and their hates. On how the political landscape has changed for women since 2018 Luse: [2018] was a really unique moment. We were a year out from the #MeToo campaign. And not only were there more women running for office, there were also more women registering to vote. In 2022, we're seeing some of the same trends, but this time we're having conversations about abortion and women's rights that we haven't really been having since 1973. And so I wonder, was \"the year of the woman\" bad branding? Abrams: When you see branded years, it is aspirational. It's opportunistic. And sometimes it is designed to cover the gamut of issues with a very simplistic notion. What we're facing in this election year is one not of a lack of enthusiasm or lack of energy, [but] a lack of trust. We have trusted our institutions for 50 years, almost, to protect us. And yet those protections have been eviscerated. We trusted our institutions to reflect our needs and our values. And yet we've been told that the quality of your citizenship depends on your geography. That based on the state that you live in, you may or may not have the protection to take care of your own body. Access to an abortion, if you're below the Mason-Dixon Line, is nearly impossible. And the idea that we call a year, a \"year of the woman\" because of either the policy issues that are galvanized or the people who run suggests that every year is not the year of the woman. That every year we shouldn't have women engaged. That every year women aren't facing an existential attack on our ability to navigate our spaces. It is facile and it is reductive, but it's sometimes necessary to focus the mind and focus the attention. But when it distracts us from the underlying fundamental problems, which are that women's rights are often completely subject to who gets elected, that should be what is galvanizing most often in our society. Luse: If you had to name the moment that we're in now, what would you choose? Abrams: \"Unfinished business.\" We have unfinished business on a range of issues. We have unfinished business with how women's rights, at least women's bodily autonomy, should be addressed. Racial justice remains an issue. When voter suppression continues to flare up, when it continues to have a dogged effect on our elections, then it's unfinished business here. When we are grappling with how we talk about the twin responsibilities of accountability and safety \u2014 I want law enforcement to help keep my community safe. I want my mom and my dad to be able to call for help and have someone answer. But I also want my brothers not to be worried about driving while Black. And so across the board, we have unfinished business in this country. But we get distracted by the shiny object. Or worse, we get defeated by the longitudinal failure to solve these problems in a permanent way. And I'm not saying we'll finish it in 2022. But we've at least got to return to the narrative thread and say we've got work to do and it is possible to do that work if we don't lose hope in the fact that the system we are a part of still has to answer to us. On changing the politics of the South Luse: How would a Stacey Abrams win in 2022 as governor of Georgia shift the political climate of the Deep South? Abrams: What that means in the Deep South is seismic. In Georgia, the governor is an extraordinarily powerful job. The way I frame it for people, you know, Stand Your Ground was signed by a governor, not by a president. The evisceration of the social safety net started with a governor, not the White House, not with Congress. Jim Crow started and was the product of Southern governors. And so having a governor from the South whose grandfather \u2014 my mother's father \u2014 was born 25 years after the end of slavery? I carry with me a legacy and a vantage point that says I'm going to work harder than anyone ever has to live up to the legacy and the opportunities I have been granted. On Black ethnicity and Abrams' heritage Christina Greer: I think it's really important to remember [former U.S. Rep.] Barbara Jordan as Black American, as is Stacey Abrams, as was [civil rights activist] Fannie Lou Hamer. As someone who wrote a book called Black Ethnics, I do actually think about the power of ethnicity. So Shirley Chisholm \u2014 Guyanese. Kamala Harris \u2014 Indian and Jamaican. Barack Obama \u2014 Kenyan and Kansan. When we think about people who are able to be on this kind of national stage, it isn't lost on me that they're not Black American. And this is not a divisive statement. I do think that there is still something about the dichotomous relationship between white people and Black people who are descendants of U.S. chattel slavery that is still unresolved. Luse: Tell me more. Greer: Like when people are like, \"Oh, where are you from?\" It's like, \"Oh, I'm from Detroit.\" \"No, where are you from?\" It's like, \"Louisiana, then Detroit.\" And there's like nowhere. \"Oh, I'm just Black.\" So, you know, in college we were just like, \"We're the JB's. We're the 'just Blacks,'\" right?  Because everyone else is like Guyana, you know, Bermuda, whatever. Luse: How does Stacey Abrams being a \"JB\" translate to how people read and understand her? Greer: I think being a descendant of U.S. chattel slavery does give you a perspective on what this country is and what she can be. On the research for my book, Black Ethnics, I asked a question about the pursuit of the American dream and how feasible it was. What I found in the data was that Black Americans \u2014 we know who this country is. You win some, you lose some. That is literally the phrase that people kept saying. So it's like, hey, you might end up going to a top college and getting a great job at NPR. You might get caught with some weed and end up in jail and the rest of your life is history. That's just what this country does. We've seen it. You can have all the success or none. A lot of Black Americans, Stacey Abrams included, fundamentally understand who this country is, but they also understand the possibility of this country. That there are some really great things that can come out of this country. And it's hard work. We're loyal to a country that's not always loyal to us, just as James Baldwin pointed out. When I think about Fannie Lou Hamer and Barbara Jordan and Stacey Abrams, I think of them as the quintessential patriots and not, you know, flag-waving on a horse the way we're sort of taught in elementary school. When I think about what these three women have done and continue to do to save this country from herself, to make her a better version of herself, to make her live up to all the documents that are so beautifully, crisply written from years and years prior, I think of them as the patriots that I aspire to be. That's why I call Stacey Abrams a pragmatic progressive. I don't think that she's like, \"I'm building a utopia.\" She's taking the facts that we have and understands the limitations and capacities of various people within the state of Georgia to move forward. And she's pushing them to think about a different vision. And it's not just whites, it's not just Blacks. It's a holistic vision of what Georgians could look for. On the odds of victory and the costs of defeat Luse: In addition to Stacey Abrams, there are two other Black women who are also running gubernatorial races, one in Alabama and one in Iowa. Do you believe that a Black woman will win a governorship in 2022? Greer: I would love to see it, but so much of what I teach my students is differentiating between what you want to happen and what you think will happen. I can't really speak to Alabama and Iowa because I don't really know their ground game. I think if we are going to see a Black female governor, the best chance that I've sort of seen is encapsulated in Stacey and her team. They're not putting all their eggs in the Atlanta basket. They fully understand this is a statewide strategy. But let's be clear. Brian Kemp, when he was secretary of state and ran for governor, is literally like having the referees as members of the team, right? So the fact that he still has a certain level of control over the voting mechanisms and the process of a free and fair election does not make me feel great. Luse: There was that measure that passed last year in Georgia, specifically with regard to voting, that I think some people would say rolled back a lot of the progress that was that was gained in 2020. Greer:  I think it's incumbent upon the press also to frame the stories as they are. You know, I remember there was a story out of Georgia in 2008 where it was heralded as like, \"90-year-old Black woman stands in line 10 hours to vote for Obama.\" Isn't it beautiful? No, it's not beautiful. It's voter disenfranchisement. It's a shame that anybody has to stand in line for 10 hours, let alone a 90-year-old Black woman. This is a story of voter disenfranchisement. This is a story of the egregious misconduct in the voting electoral process. There's certain communities where they are not waiting more than 10 minutes, let alone 10 hours \u2014 and if so, heads are rolling. So I think that we need to just be aware of the class and racial components in the narratives that we're telling about, \"Oh, isn't this exciting? People are lined up forever to vote for Stacey.\" But no, it actually shouldn't be that people have to wait in line forever to vote for Stacey. Luse: What are the costs if Stacey Abrams loses again? Greer: Yeah, I hope that it doesn't dissuade people who were really galvanized into feeling like this system is rigged and, you know, there's no need in participating. I really hope that that's not the case. Stacey Abrams has talked to voters about like, hey, sometimes your candidate doesn't win. That doesn't mean that you pack up your marbles and you leave democracy forever. That's not how it works. But especially for first time voters, if their candidate doesn't win that first time and that sense of disappointment is so severe, it is really imperative that you capture them to make sure that they don't feel like this has been it. Because that's a surefire way for nothing to change in the future. And so I think that there will need to be some healing. But also, as we saw after 2018, Stacey Abrams is like, \"OK, dust yourselves off. Let's get back to work.\" Let's just say she she isn't successful in November, I have no idea if she would run again. But I'd bet a year's salary that she wouldn't just be like, \"Woe is me,\" and disappear from [the] public sphere. I mean, the work that she's done in the state has made me fundamentally believe that that's not a strategy that she would even know how to employ. I think it would just be like, \"OK, well, we figure out a different strategy on how to do the work.\" This episode of 'It's Been a Minute' was produced by Barton Girdwood, Liam McBain, Jessica Mendoza, Janet Woojeong Lee and Jamila Huxtable.

Biden's approval rating is up to 44%, which marks a third straight month of increases to Biden's approval rating. With just over a month to go in the 2022 midterm elections, Democrats are starting to rally around President Biden, according to the latest NPR/Marist poll. Biden's approval rating is up to 44%, which marks a third straight month of improvement. He had bottomed out in July at about 36%. Democrats are also largely keeping pace with Republicans on enthusiasm about the elections this fall, a continued trend after the Supreme Court's June Dobbs decision, which overturned the guaranteed right to an abortion in this country. Loading... Those are good signs for Democrats, but there are warnings, too \u2014 7 in 10 respondents said they think the country is headed in the wrong direction, and inflation continues to rank as the top issue voters say they will be thinking about when they cast a ballot. And when it comes to enthusiasm, while white, college-educated voters \u2014 who have trended toward Democrats in the past decade \u2014 are among the most engaged group of voters, the poll found young and Black voters are among the least likely to vote this fall. What's more, Democrats are below where they historically have needed to be on the question of who people say they would vote for if the elections were being held today, the so-called congressional ballot test. And the survey also comes at a time when Republicans \u2014 on the back of a flood of multimillion-dollar ad campaigns \u2014 have started to see improvements in some critical Senate races that will determine control of that chamber. Whatever the results, the groundwork is already being laid for outcomes to be contested. The Trump factor in these elections has been clear with candidates mimicking the former president's bombastic style and spreading his lie about the 2020 presidential election being stolen. That is, of course, false. Biden won, and that's been proven repeatedly in and out of court. But the survey found that only half (49%) of respondents think the candidate they supported should definitely concede if their opponent is declared the winner \u2014 and only a third of Republican voters think they so. Loading... A president's approval rating has traditionally been one of the key indicators of how a president's party will do in congressional elections. And Democratic strategists had been worried that Democratic candidates could only overperform their president's numbers by so much. The increase is happening because Biden is seeing double-digit improvement with Democrats and independents. In July, just 75% of Democrats said they approved of the job the president was doing, well below where a president's party traditionally is. But now that number is up to 87%. In July, 28% of independents approved. But since then, there's been something of a thaw \u2014 39% approve, fewer are disapproving and more independents have moved into the undecided category. Biden has seen some wins over the last few months, including the signing of the Inflation Reduction Act. And while prices are still higher than last year on average, gas prices are down. Biden had also been suffering from an intensity problem. In July, just 11% said they strongly approved of the job he was doing. That's double in this poll \u2014 24%. That's the highest \"strongly approve\" score for Biden since July 2021, a month before the Afghanistan withdrawal when Biden saw his ratings decline. More than 8 in 10 registered voters who responded to the survey said they are \"definitely voting\" this fall \u2014 82% of Democrats said so, as did 88% of Republicans and 80% of independents. The groups most likely to say so were college-educated white women and men, men who live in small cities or the suburbs and Baby Boomers (those 58 and older). The least likely were Black voters, Gen Zers and Millennials (those 41 and younger) and those who live in rural areas. When asked about their interest in the election on a 1-to-5 scale, with 1 being very interested and 5 not interested at all, about 7 in 10 described themselves as very interested. Again, Republicans edge out Democrats slightly in their interest level. The groups mostly likely to say they were very interested were white college graduates, especially men and older voters. The least likely to say so were younger voters, people making less than $50,000 a year; Black voters; parents with children under 18; those who haven't graduated college, especially white women without degrees; and those who live in small towns. When voters were asked who they would vote for in their congressional district, a Democrat or Republican, if the election were held today, the parties are in a statistical tie. Democrats have a narrow 46%-to-44% edge in the survey. That's within the margin of error of +/- 4.2 percentage points, meaning results could be about 4 points higher or lower. Traditionally, Democrats need a wider advantage than 2 points on the congressional ballot to do well in congressional elections. That's because competitive races are taking place in areas that are more conservative than the country as a whole, how districts are drawn and how densely concentrated Democrats are in cities. Republicans need a net gain of five seats in these midterm elections to win control of the House. Taking a look at the data, when Democrats made big gains in the House in recent midterms (2006 and 2018) they had advantages of at least 7 points on the measure. When Republicans made gains (2010 and 2014), they didn't need leads that were quite so large. In 2014, for example, when Republicans picked up 13 seats, they only had a 2-point edge on the question, in an average of the polls. In 2010, when they gained a massive 63 seats, they had a 9-point advantage. From a choice of five issues \u2014 inflation, preserving democracy, abortion, immigration and health care \u2014 inflation once again came out on top as most top of mind when people think about voting in this election. (Last month's NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll had a deeper look at which issues were important to voters. Republicans are using crime more in their ads in key states like Wisconsin. Last month, it ranked sixth overall, though it was creeping up with Republicans in particular.) Almost 4 in 10 (37%) said inflation was top of mind, followed by preserving democracy (27%), abortion (13%), immigration (10%) and health care (10%). For Democrats, preserving democracy (32%) topped abortion (21%). A majority of Republicans ranked inflation as their top issue with immigration second (18%) and preserving democracy third (17%). Of course, what preserving democracy means to a Democrat and Trump-supporting Republican could be quite different things. For independents, it was inflation (38%), followed by preserving democracy (33%) and then immigration (12%). How people will vote is also very different. The pandemic reshaped voting procedures with record numbers filing votes by mail. A plurality of Democrats say they will vote by mail this November, but the overwhelming majority of Republicans say they'll still cast theirs in person. A slim majority of independents also said they intend to vote in person. Three-quarters of respondents said they have confidence in their state or local governments to run a fair and accurate election this November, the highest level since Biden's took office. But there was a significant gap on this between Democrats and Republicans \u2014 92% of Democrats said they had confidence, while 69% of Republicans said they did. (Three-quarters of independents also said so.) However, there were also racial and generational divides that cut across political and economic lines. In addition to Trump supporters, those without college degrees and those living in small towns and rural areas, also among the least likely to say they had confidence in the results of this fall's elections were Black, Latino and younger voters, groups that have leaned toward Democrats, as well as those making less than $50,000 a year. The most likely to have confidence: Biden supporters and white college grads, especially women with degrees. Despite their lagging confidence in elections, Republicans were, however, the most likely to say they always display an American flag on their property \u2014 almost 6 in 10 said so as compared to 22% of Democrats and 27% of independents. A majority of Democrats (54%) said they never do. Trump, like other right-wing populists around the globe, was able to use white grievance and nationalism as the fuel to his political power, something that will be a central piece of a 2024 Trump candidacy, if he decides to run. This survey of 1,690 adults was conducted Sept. 27 through 29 and has a margin of error of +/- 4 percentage points. It includes 1,562 registered voters. When voters are referenced, there is a +/- 4.2 percentage point margin of error.",

            "article_content": "Italy is set to usher in its first far-right government since World War II. Military-age men flee Russia after a partial mobilization is enacted. Later today NASA is going to try to move an asteroid.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Big changes in Italy. Italians have voted in what will be their first far-right government since World War II. LEILA FADEL, HOST: Yeah. Yesterday's vote saw Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy emerge as the single largest party. Her coalition of right-wing parties will be able to form the next government. And Meloni is expected to become Italy's first female prime minister. The move comes as the European Union struggles to remain united as Russia's invasion of Ukraine fuels economic turmoil in the continent. MARTIN: NPR's Joanna Kakissis is following all of this from Rome. And she joins us now. Good morning, Joanna. JOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: Is this result a surprise in Italy? Or had things been leaning in Meloni's direction for a while? KAKISSIS: Yeah, things had been leaning her way for quite a while. For weeks now, in public opinion polls, her party had been leading. Her party, the Brothers of Italy, they ran as part of a coalition that includes the hard-right, anti-immigrant party called League, which is run by former Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, and Forza Italia, which is run by three-time Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. But make no mistake, Salvini and Berlusconi, these are fading political figures. Meloni is the big winner now and the new star of Italian politics. MARTIN: So before we talk about the consequences of that and this far-right party coming into power, just tell us about the woman at the center of this. Who is she? KAKISSIS: Yeah. Meloni is young. She's 45 years old. And she grew up in this working-class neighborhood in Rome that's actually known for left-wing politics. And yet, when Maloney was a teenager, she joined the local youth chapter of a movement founded by supporters of Benito Mussolini after World War II. And she stuck by this ideology for years. But she also had big ambitions. When she took over the Brothers of Italy in 2018, it was a minor party. Now it's No. 1. And she made this happen in part by rehabilitating her own image, transforming from this young firebrand with a scary past into this reasonable everywoman fighting to save Italy's identity. MARTIN: So she made... KAKISSIS: Yeah. MARTIN: ...A transformation of herself, her political identity, but also her party's, clearly, in some way. Explain how she managed all this. KAKISSIS: Yeah. So I spoke to this Italian political scientist, Domeniko Fracchiolla. He says Meloni is a gifted politician who can read the room and learn from her mistakes. And that's how she campaigned. DOMENICO FRACCHIOLLA: She was selling herself as a moderate defender of the family values, as ardent supporter of Ukraine and also of NATO - and as she likes to say, as a woman, mother and Christian. KAKISSIS: And we stopped by her old neighborhood, Garbatella, this leftist neighborhood. And I even met voters who just shrugged off Meloni's past. Here's advertising manager Tiziana Pipistrello. TIZIANA PIPISTRELLO: (Non-English language spoken). KAKISSIS: She's saying, enough with this fascism business already. That's all in the past, you know? But many others, you know, they told me that, you know, they worry Meloni will roll back abortion rights or crack down on immigrants and the LGBT community. MARTIN: So Italian politics, Joanna, as you know, are such that prime ministers don't necessarily last that long. Governments can crumble... KAKISSIS: That's right. MARTIN: ...Really fast. How is she going to prevent that? KAKISSIS: So - well, her first challenge will be bringing together this very divided country, which she alluded to in her victory speech last night. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GIORGIA MELONI: (Non-English language spoken). KAKISSIS: She's saying, it's Important to understand that if we're called upon to govern this nation, we will do so for all Italians with the aim of uniting the people. And she's got a lot of uniting to do. Only 64% of Italians voted on Sunday, and that's the lowest turnout for a general election in nearly 50 years. MARTIN: NPR's Joanna Kakissis in Rome. Thank you. KAKISSIS: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: Russians are on the streets protesting President Vladimir Putin's mobilization order. Demonstrations are happening in dozens of cities across the country. FADEL: Putin's move has also prompted thousands of Russian men to flee the country. Cars were stretched for miles at borders with neighboring countries in recent days. Men also scrambled to catch flights to countries where Russians don't need visas for entry. MARTIN: One of the countries they're fleeing to is Turkey. NPR's Fatma Tanis was at the airport in Istanbul to meet some of them. And she joins us now. Hey, Fatma. FATMA TANIS, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: What was that scene like? Who did you meet coming off those planes? TANIS: You know, there was just a constant arrival of Russians, overwhelmingly men. And they are coming from all over, not just Russia. Some left through airports in Russia. Others drove to bordering countries, like Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Georgia. Many said they had a really hard time getting out between the sheer numbers at the border and the questioning from authorities. I met one man from Irkutsk, near Lake Baikal, who said he drove at night to the Mongolian border, where he waited in line for 6 hours to cross. And then he actually ran into several friends there who were also fleeing before he eventually caught a flight to Istanbul. MARTIN: Wow. So what are they telling you? TANIS: Everyone I spoke with said they were anti-war. And most said they were saying goodbye to their lives in Russia forever. They were also very much afraid of retribution from the Russian government for fleeing and didn't want to reveal their names. You know, they left with no future plans, limited money. And now they say they're going to try to get their families here as well. Some told me they decided to leave as soon as they heard the announcement of mobilization. Others said they waited a few days to see what was happening. And one man in his mid-30s said he made a decision to leave when his friends started getting rounded up in the middle of the night. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Non-English language spoken). TANIS: He said that they weren't just taking the reservists, but also men with no military history and even those with more than three children, something that Russian authorities had assured wouldn't happen. He and others told me that men who speak up against the war and mobilization are being arrested, beaten in custody and then sent to be drafted in the war. And that may be why we have overwhelmingly seen women take part in these recent public protests. MARTIN: So Fatma, though, if Putin isn't getting the men he needs from this particular mobilization effort because people are fleeing, is he likely to call up even more? TANIS: Well, these men certainly think so. Nearly every one of them said they believed a full mobilization is coming soon. Russia right now is conducting these so-called referendums, considered to be illegal under international law, in occupied Ukrainian territories on whether to formally join Russia. One 32-year-old man told me he thinks it's the first step for Putin to annex those areas as part of Russia. And then, he says... UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: And obviously, Ukrainian will start to attack because it's actually - it's their territory. And after that, I think he'll decide that, OK, they attack our territory. And we should make the full mobilization. TANIS: In other words, he's worried there's going to be even a wider call up soon. Another man didn't want to talk to me, but he said he just wanted to leave the airport and said everything is worse than you know in Russia. And Russian men are going anywhere they can go now. But there were also a couple of people who were still hopeful that the war could end soon and said they were just going to wait it out. MARTIN: NPR's Fatma Tanis reporting from Istanbul. Fatma, thank you so much for all this. We appreciate it. TANIS: Thank you for having me. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: OK. Later today, NASA is going to try something it has never done before. FADEL: It's going to attempt to move an asteroid. It's part of a mission to test technologies humanity may someday need to keep a space rock from striking our planet. MARTIN: Striking our planet? Joining me now to discuss what's going on, NPR's Geoff Brumfiel. Hey, Geoff. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: OK. Just to be clear, they are not trying to move this asteroid because it's headed towards Earth, right? BRUMFIEL: Right. I mean, we have enough problems. MARTIN: (Laughter). BRUMFIEL: So yeah, the - an asteroid's the last thing we need. But this is passing close to Earth. It's not on a collision course. Still, this mission is going to demonstrate how you might deflect a planet-killing asteroid. Tom Statler is a NASA scientist on the mission. And here's what he said at a briefing last week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) THOMAS STATLER: We're doing this test when we don't need to on an asteroid that isn't a danger just in case we ever do need to and we discover an asteroid that is a danger. MARTIN: OK, practice. This is practice. That makes me feel better. BRUMFIEL: (Laughter). MARTIN: So explain how this practice run's going to work. BRUMFIEL: Sure. So this thing's called the Double Asteroid Redirection Test - or DART for short. And it's all right there in the name. The target is actually two asteroids, a big one called Didymos and a second smaller one that's orbiting the big one. That one's called Dimorphos. So the spacecraft is going to try and slam into that little asteroid at more than 14,000 miles per hour. And the hope is that that's going to nudge or redirect, as the cool kids call it, the asteroid just a tiny, tiny amount. The nudge should change the time it takes the little asteroid to go around the big one, the time of a single orbit. Astronomers on Earth are going to attempt to measure that change. And that will let them know whether this thing had the desired effect. MARTIN: OK. You say nudge. So this is not like in the movies, where they try to blow the asteroid up? BRUMFIEL: Right. Yeah. I mean, in fact, the whole nuking an asteroid thing is actually pretty risky, it turns out... MARTIN: Is it (laughter)? BRUMFIEL: ...Because you might end up with a lot of asteroid parts headed in the same direction. So you might end up with two big chunks instead of one. MARTIN: Right. BRUMFIEL: So NASA thinks these little shoves are actually the way to go. Now, obviously, if this were a planet-killer, this spacecraft would be too small. NASA might have to build a bigger version. Or they might have to build a bunch of little ones to give several pushes over a period of time. But the thing to remember is space is really big. So it may not take all that much to move an asteroid out of Earth's path. MARTIN: So what are you going to be watching for specifically in this exercise today? BRUMFIEL: Well, the spacecraft's actually going to be livestreaming as it approaches its target. So we should see the asteroid getting bigger and bigger. It's steering itself using software that was developed for missile defense. And hopefully, we're going to see it grow right up to the last minute before impact. And Statler says this test is going to be a really important proof of concept. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STATLER: At the end of the day, the real question is, how effectively did we move the asteroid? And can this technique of kinetic impact be used in the future if we ever needed to? BRUMFIEL: But scientists say it could be days or even weeks before they know for sure how it went. That is assuming they don't miss. MARTIN: Geoff, just nailing me with the drama at the end. NPR's Geoff Brumfiel. Thank you so much. BRUMFIEL: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

            "article_content": "Italians head to the polls Sunday in what could be a pivotal election with far-right candidate Giorgia Meloni poised to be Italy's first female prime minister.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: And now to Italy, where voting is set for tomorrow in one of the most consequential elections for the country in decades. Public opinion polls show that a far-right party, the Brothers of Italy, is expected to win the most votes. Its leader, a young firebrand named Giorgia Meloni, seems poised to be Italy's first female prime minister and the first to come from the far right since fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. NPR's Joanna Kakissis is in Rome following developments, and she's with us now. Joanna, welcome. Thanks so much for joining us. JOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: Thanks for having me, Michel. MARTIN: So Giorgia Meloni - tell us a little bit about her and her background. KAKISSIS: Right. So Giorgia Meloni is 45. She grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Rome that is staunchly leftist. But instead, she joined the youth chapter of the Italian Social Movement, which was created by the supporters of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini in the aftermath of World War II. This youth group was heavily influenced by fantasy novels like J.R.R. Tolkien's \"The Lord Of The Rings,\" and Guido Calderon (ph), a journalist who covers the far-right in Italy, he told us why. GUIDO CALDERON: (Non-English language spoken). KAKISSIS: So he's saying that reading Tolkien gave these young people new ways to talk about their ideology, where they were not the bad guys, where they lived in a community whose traditions they were protecting. MARTIN: That's really interesting. So the views of the young Meloni, does she still hold them? KAKISSIS: Now, Meloni was much more explicit about her hardline views in her youth. But, you know, as she has grown, she's tried to maybe mute them a bit. At the start of this campaign, for example, she took pains to reassure Italians and the world of her party's pro-European and pro-Atlantic stance. But in some closing rallies in the last few days, her tone and content has been much more stridently nationalistic. And I should note here that her party, the Brothers of Italy, is not set to govern alone. They're expected to form a coalition with at least two right-wing parties, and one of them is led by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. MARTIN: How are people reacting to all this and her views in particular to the election and sort of more broadly? What are people saying? KAKISSIS: So yeah - so we wanted to find out. So we checked out the public mood at the Trionfale market in an upscale neighborhood in Rome. All the shoppers, they seemed unhappy at the prospect of a right-wing coalition in power. Middle-class professionals like Simona Romeo (ph), who works in the movie industry, was one of them. She called Meloni divisive and exclusionary. SIMONA ROMEO: She is a new evolution of fascism. I mean, Giorgia Meloni and her entourage is going to be like in United States, like in your country, when, you know, Trump - and people is angry. That's the mood. KAKISSIS: But the Romans running the stalls at the market called Meloni a hero. And Berlusconi and Matteo Salvini, who leads another party in her coalition, they call those two the two angels at her side. And those are the words of Manuela Ciarrone (ph), who sells gourmet mushrooms. MANUELA CIARRONE: (Non-English language spoken). KAKISSIS: So Ciarrone is saying Meloni will be focused on caring for Italians, not migrants, and that she will fight for the working class by pushing to provide better health care and lower electricity prices. MARTIN: So let's go back to something you mentioned earlier, her relationship to Europe. Is that a factor in the campaign? I mean, she does blame the EU for watering down the national identities of member nations like Italy. How is that whole issue playing out? KAKISSIS: Yeah, we heard a lot of concern about that in the market from the shoppers, of course. One person I spoke with said Italy really needs Brussels with all the debt the country has. And Guido Calderon, the fascism expert, he told us that Italians are also concerned that Meloni could take Italy down the path of illiberal democracy like Viktor Orban's Hungary. He says that may not be the fascism of Mussolini, but it is a very real threat that may soon present itself in Italy. MARTIN: That is NPR's Joanna Kakissis in Rome. Joanna, thank you.

            "article_content": "Stock market declines could complicate Democrats' hopes for the midterm elections, but former President Trump isn't helping Republicans' prospects either.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled yesterday to its lowest point so far this year. Other stock indexes also fell. Analysts said recession fears drove the declines. And where the economy goes, politics usually joins it. We look now - we go now to NPR's senior editor and correspondent Ron Elving. Ron, thanks so much for being with us. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott. SIMON: The Federal Reserve hiked interest rates also this week, another-three quarters of a percentage point. And you'd have thought the stock market might have been happy seeing that as a way to control inflation, but apparently not. Why? ELVING: The most fundamental force driving Wall Street at any point is the expectation of higher or lower future profits. We don't know yet whether the rate hikes will bring on recession, but higher rates will eat into profit margins, even if companies remain profitable. So that's the big thumb on the scales. And it's why the summer bounce is long gone and the markets are back to full-on bear mode. And the major indices are likely to continue seeking the bottom, as they say, for some time before they begin making their way back up. And it would help a lot if the next set of numbers on inflation were just a little more encouraging than they were this past month. That was really the buzzkill that ended several heady weeks when stocks were heading up. SIMON: House Republicans this week released their Commitment to America platform, and a lot of it seems designed to try and make the November midterm elections about President Biden and the struggling economy. How is it being received so far? ELVING: It's a campaign document. It's long on ideals and goals but short of specific plans or any difficult choices. There's an obvious homage here to the Contract with America. That was touted by Newt Gingrich and the Republicans of 1994, the year they took control of the House for the first time in 40 years. It's never been clear, really, how large a role that document had in the politics of 1994. But it certainly makes a good script for a campaign. And you won't find here some of the more controversial ideas we've been hearing from some prominent Senate Republican candidates this fall - things like making Medicare and Social Security subject to annual budget changes and cuts or banning all abortions nationwide after a stated period of time. And, Scott, by the way, we should mention that a court in Arizona has just decided that state ought to go back to a total ban on abortion, a ban with only medical exceptions that was first put in place in the 1800s. And that's a huge distraction from the rest of the Republican agenda. They'd much rather be talking about inflation or immigration and rather not be talking about the travails of former President Trump. SIMON: Which mounted again this week - an appeals court ruled against him. The New York attorney general sued him. Then he went on Fox News and said he could declassify documents just by kind of thinking about them. ELVING: Yes. And obviously, that last little bit has launched countless mocking internet memes all about things that Trump could do just by thinking about them or perhaps other things that any of the rest of us might like to change just by thinking about them. Trump's always been a big proponent of saying things with confidence, making even the most preposterous claims with a straight face and actually an attitude of wounded innocence. It's taken him a long way, Scott, and he cannot be expected to abandon it now. SIMON: This week, the House passed an Electoral Count Act. Will the Senate follow suit? ELVING: Hard to say. They got nine Republicans to vote for it in the House out of 200 and some. In the Senate, they're going to need 10 out of just 50 to support this. The bill clarifies that the vice president's role in the process is just ceremonial. So a future vice president could not even be asked to stop the certification of his own defeat the way Trump wanted then-Vice President Mike Pence to do on January 6. So we shall see if the dynamic works over there. It's probably going to have to be a version of the bill written by a Republican. SIMON: Vladimir Putin signaled that he intends to keep Russian forces in Ukraine for the long haul. What do you make of what he said this week? ELVING: It was a huge gesture of defiance, an expression of his anger at the West. He's calling up 300,000 more troops overnight and opening the door for a million or more. And it came after some of his better friends in the world, or closest thing he has to friends in the world, had started to back off and suggest he ought to find an off ramp in Ukraine. SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving. Thanks so much for being with us. ELVING: Thank you, Scott. (SOUNDBITE OF DESMOND CHEESE'S \"DOPE VHS MASTER\") Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Italians have elected their country's most right-wing government since the end of World War II. ROME \u2014 Italians have elected their country's most right-wing government since the end of World War II. That's no small matter in a country that has had 69 governments since 1946. Leading the coalition that secured the majority of seats in elections for Italy's parliament is Giorgia Meloni, leader of Fratelli d'Italia, the Brothers of Italy party. Her victory also makes history as she will become Italy's first female prime minister. Meloni, 45, grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Rome that's better known for cultivating leftist activists than producing fiery hard-right politicians. Her party has roots in the neo-fascist movement that emerged out of the ruins of World War II. Symbols point to the party's connection to that past too. The party flag includes a tricolor flame that was a symbol of fascism in the early 20th century. Meloni has refused to remove the flame from the party's logo. And many party members have shown an affinity for fascism and fascist leaders of the past. Just this past week, the party suspended a member running for parliament after an Italian newspaper revealed he had posted comments supporting Adolf Hitler in the past. Meloni has spent considerable time and energy trying to convince Italians and Europeans that the party is not fascist. When not on the radio or TV, she is on the road, creating videos she streams live and posts to all her social media platforms.

Meloni's Twitter feed is full of dozens of scenes that look nearly identical. They all show her as she takes the stage in various Italian cities, to the adoring cheers of supporters holding Brothers of Italy flags. In August, Meloni posted a video on social media saying she would introduce a naval blockade to patrol the Mediterranean, to interdict people whom she called \"illegal immigrants\" from North Africa. \"What is important in the campaign is not the policy itself. It's the message \u2014 'we will stop them at any cost,'\" says historian Lorenzo Castellani, a professor at Rome's LUISS University. \"She is proposing herself as a sort of defender of the borders, a very Trumpian approach from this point of view,\" Castellani says, referring to former President Donald Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric and policies. Even as she spends energy trying to dispense with the fascism label, Meloni also serves up red meat to the party faithful. At a recent event, she was yelling about the years of shame many have felt for holding what she often calls \"anti-woke\" opinions. Giorgia Meloni, leader of Italian far-right party Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy), flashes the victory sign as she delivers a speech at the Arenile di Bagnoli beachfront in Naples on Friday, closing her party's campaign for the Sept. 25 general election.\n                \n                    \n                    Andreas Solaro/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Giorgia Meloni, leader of Italian far-right party Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy), flashes the victory sign as she delivers a speech at the Arenile di Bagnoli beachfront in Naples on Friday, closing her party's campaign for the Sept. 25 general election. \"I have a dream of a nation in which people who have had to put their heads down for so many years ... can now say what they think and not lose their jobs because of it,\" Meloni said. Some Italians fear a Meloni-led government would move to outlaw abortion, legal in Italy since 1978. Meloni says she will not. Meloni has long been a Euroskeptic \u2014 and in the past has talked about taking Italy out of the common currency, the euro, and even of leaving the European Union. But she has repeatedly promised she'll work with the EU and can be trusted to manage the 200 billion euros ($194 billion) Italy has received in European pandemic recovery funds. That assurance was called into question on Thursday, when European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned there could be consequences for Italy, the EU's third-largest economy, if it moves in an anti-democratic direction after the election. Meloni has long insisted that she has no plans to go soft on Russia and has supported Ukraine since war broke out in February. But one of her coalition partners, Italy's former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, has a long friendship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and appeared on an Italian talk show Thursday, saying Putin invaded Ukraine to put \"decent people\" in power in Kyiv. Her opponent, former Prime Minister Enrico Letta, the head of Italy's center-left Democratic Party, has repeatedly said on the campaign trail, \"If the right wins, the first person to be happy will be Vladimir Putin.\" Enrico Letta, leader of the center-left Democratic Party, arrives at Piazza del Popolo in Rome Friday to hold a rally closing his party's campaign for Sunday's general election.\n                \n                    \n                    Alberto Pizzoli/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Enrico Letta, leader of the center-left Democratic Party, arrives at Piazza del Popolo in Rome Friday to hold a rally closing his party's campaign for Sunday's general election. With Italians facing spiraling energy costs, inflation and a lackluster economy, Meloni, whose party only won 4% of the vote in the previous election, has positioned herself as an outsider who will shake things up. Political writer Federico Fubini, a Meloni critic, says she was astute to sit out of the national unity government that just collapsed. It created a big opening. \"The main reason why she's leading in the polls is because she's perceived as the one that was not in power for the last 10 years,\" he says. Meloni is poised to take office almost exactly 100 years after Benito Mussolini took power in Rome. She insists his ideology is in the past. Many Italians and Europeans hope she'll stick to her word.",

If Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy party wins Sunday's election, she could also make history by becoming the country's first woman prime minister.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Italians vote on Sunday. It seems likely they'll elect the country's most right-wing government since World War II. If Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy Party comes out on top, she could also make history by becoming the country's first woman prime minister. Adam Rainey reports from Rome. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GIORGIA MELONI: (Speaking Italian). (APPLAUSE) ADAM RAINEY, BYLINE: Giorgia Meloni's Twitter feed is full of scenes like this, taking the stage in Italian cities across the country. They all look similar - dozens, sometimes hundreds of people waving flags for her Brothers of Italy party as she sprints to the stage. Milan, Palermo, Genoa - the feed is like a map of Italy meant to show her national, not just nationalist appeal. Although her party has roots in Italy's postwar neo-fascist movement, Meloni, who is 45, is making great pains to distance herself from fascism. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MELONI: (Speaking Italian). RAINEY: Speaking on one of Italy's main evening newscasts, Meloni sarcastically jokes that her opponent on the left don't seem to realize that fascism ended 30 years before she was born. Just this week, though, her party suspended a member after an Italian newspaper revealed he had made statements supporting Adolf Hitler on social media eight years ago. The fascism label may trouble Meloni. Hard-right positions clearly don't. Here she is in August. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MELONI: (Speaking Italian). RAINEY: She's saying her party supports a naval blockade to stop illegal immigration from North Africa. And here she is, fired up on stage. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MELONI: (Speaking Italian). RAINEY: She says she has a dream that Italians won't have to lower their heads in shame or worry they'll lose their jobs for their political beliefs, a clear message to people who support her party's pro-Catholic, anti-immigrant, anti-woke positions, as she has called them. Some Italians fear a Meloni government would move to outlaw abortion, legal in Italy since 1978. But she has gone on the record saying she has no plans to do so. She also says she has no plans to go soft on Russia. Meloni has long been a Eurosceptic but has repeatedly promised she'll work with the EU and can be trusted as a steady hand to manage 200 billion euros in European pandemic recovery funds. It's Meloni's opposition to immigration that has animated her and her base. LORENZO CASTELLANI: She is proposing herself as a sort of defender of the borders - so a very Trumpian approach. RAINEY: That's Lorenzo Castellani, a historian at Rome's LUISS University. CASTELLANI: The real majority of people who are concerned about illegal immigration are scared, and they are using this fear very well to convince people to support their political agenda. RAINEY: Political writer Federico Fubini is a Meloni critic but says she is politically astute for having refused to take part in the national unity government that just collapsed. FEDERICO FUBINI: The main reason why she's leading in the polls is because she's perceived as the one that was not in power for the last 10 years. RAINEY: Meloni's party won't win anything near a majority of seats in parliament alone. But her coalition with two other right-wing parties, including Forza Italia, led by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SILVIO BERLUSCONI: (Speaking Italian). RAINEY: ...Heard here trying to reach out to young voters on TikTok, is expected to win a clear majority. If Meloni's coalition wins and she is named prime minister, she'll take office almost exactly 100 years after Benito Mussolini took the reins of power in Rome. She says his ideology is in the past.

Ron DeSantis during a press conference announcing expanded toll relief for Florida commuters, Wednesday, Sept. 7, 2022, in Miami, Fla. TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2013 Despite a call for an investigation, and ongoing questions about whether Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis broke the law transporting migrants from Texas to Martha's Vineyard, Mass., the Florida governor is doubling down on his decision. DeSantis described the flights as \"voluntary,\" while speaking at a press conference on Friday. \"They're given a good ride,\" he said. \"It's a humane thing to do.\" But Democrats have accused DeSantis of using the migrants, who are thought largely to be Venezuelan, to help him get reelected as governor in November and to continue to build his political profile to run for president in 2024. \"We're not talking about a delivery of crates of shoes, we're talking about people,\" says Elizabeth Ricci, an immigration attorney based in Tallahassee. Flight records show the migrants boarded two charter planes in San Antonio, Texas and stopped in the Florida Panhandle. Then, one landed in South Carolina and the other in North Carolina before arriving at their final destination in Martha's Vineyard. As part of this year's roughly $109.9 billion state budget \u2013 which had bipartisan support \u2013  the legislature allocated $12 million \"to facilitate the transport of unauthorized aliens out of Florida.\" \"We're going to spend every penny of that,\" DeSantis said at Friday's press conference. Public records show the state paid a private contractor, Vertol Systems Inc., an aircraft solutions provider, $615,000 to transport the migrants to Martha's Vineyard. That's $12,300 per migrant. DeSantis said migrants were identified in Texas as wanting to relocate to Florida before they signed release forms to go to Massachusetts. If releases were signed, it's unclear whether it was true consent. \"What we're trying to do is profile: 'OK, who do you think is trying to get to Florida?' \" DeSantis said. \"If they get in a car with two other people, there's no way we're going to be able to detect that.\" Since President Joe Biden took office, the number of migrants crossing the U.S. Southern border has sharply increased. The U.S. Border Patrol is on its way to a record 2 million apprehensions in a fiscal year. DeSantis has complained the situation places an unfair burden on Southern border states, even though Florida isn't one of them. Still, he says a large number of undocumented migrants arriving in Texas want to relocate to Florida. \"If they end up coming to Florida, then that's going to impose a lot of cost on the communities,\" he said. \"We're trying to avoid that.\" Some of the migrants who arrived in Martha's Vineyard last week told NPR they were told they'd be flown to Boston where they could get expedited work papers, but that's not what they found upon arrival in Martha's Vineyard. Instead, local churches, homeless shelters and other aid groups had to scramble to accommodate them because they weren't given any notice of their arrival. Tallahassee-based immigration attorney Elizabeth Ricci explains there's a \"good faith argument\" to be made that luring the migrants onto planes with the promise of jobs makes them crime victims. And that means they could automatically qualify for a visa, she said. \"An enticement like that, regardless of whether you sign a waiver, is fraud and that is part of the definition of human trafficking,\" Ricci explains. \"I think that everybody on those planes has a case to legalize as a direct result of being transported by the governor.\" Rachel Self, a Massachusetts lawyer specializing in immigration, has been vocal about her interactions with the migrants while they were on Martha's Vineyard. \"We believe they are victims of kidnapping,\" she wrote in a statement, according to The Martha's Vineyard Times, \"it may well result in every individual who was induced onto those planes by fraud becoming eligible for a U visa.\" According to an analysis of federal immigration law by the U.S. Citizens and Immigration Services: \"Traffickers and abusers often use a lack of immigration status to exploit and control victims.\" They \"may lure individuals with false promises of employment and a better life.\" Ricci said she believes that's exactly what DeSantis has done. If law enforcement agrees, it could make migrants eligible for a special kind of visa that protects victims of human trafficking.  \"It would be so ironic for these families to ultimately legalize and become citizens as a result of his actions.\" Flying migrants to Martha's Vineyard is the latest action DeSantis says he's taken to try to curb the number of undocumented migrants traveling to the state. In 2019, DeSantis signed into law a measure banning sanctuary cities, where local agencies had limited cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Since then, DeSantis has signed legislation requiring law enforcement to work with federal immigration authorities to report undocumented immigrants. Public employers and contractors must also verify workers' immigration status. And state agencies may not work with organizations that help resettle undocumented immigrants. California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Florida's only Democratic state cabinet member Nikki Fried have requested the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate DeSantis' transportation of migrants out of Florida. DeSantis disputes claims that the migrants were \"enticed\" to get onto the planes bound for Massachusetts. \"The folks that are contracted, they gave them a release form to sign, they gave them a packet with a map of Martha's Vineyard.\" Democratic candidate for governor Charlie Crist, who's running to unseat DeSantis in November, has already launched a digital ad accusing DeSantis of \"putting politics over people's lives.\" \"Mocking their fight for freedom \u2013 that makes me sick,\" Crist said in the ad. \"But not surprising, because that's who he is.\" But, a recent NPR/Ipsos poll shows that a majority of Americans \u2014 including three-quarters of Republicans \u2014 say it's either somewhat or completely true that the United States is \"experiencing an invasion\" at the southern border.",

MARTHA'S VINEYARD, Mass. \u2014 About 50 migrants arrived by plane in Martha's Vineyard, Mass., Wednesday on flights paid for by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis that originated in San Antonio, Texas. The migrants touched down at about 3:15 p.m. local time. Later Wednesday, a spokesperson for DeSantis sent a statement to NPR and other news outlets confirming that the migrants were transported by Florida under a state program that was funded by the legislature earlier this year. The statement reads in part: \"States like Massachusetts, New York and California will better facilitate the care of these individuals who they have invited into our country by incentivizing illegal immigration.\" Flight trackers show two flights took off from San Antonio around 8 a.m. local time on Wednesday. A number of migrants told NPR their flight originated in San Antonio, and that they were being transported to Boston, not Martha's Vineyard. One flight took off from San Antonio and made a stop in Florida and South Carolina before landing in Martha's Vineyard. The second flight also stopped in Florida, but made another stop in Charlotte, North Carolina, before landing in Martha's Vineyard. A spokesman for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said his office was not directly involved in these plans. \"Our office has had conversations with Governor DeSantis and his team about supporting our busing strategy to provide much-needed relief to our overwhelmed and overrun border communities,\" the spokesman said. \"Though we were not involved in these initial planes to Martha's Vineyard, we appreciate the support in responding to this national crisis and helping Texans. Governor Abbott encourages and welcomes all his fellow governors to engage in this effort to secure the border and focus on the failing and illegal efforts of the Biden-Harris Administration to continue these reckless open border policies.\" The unannounced flight drew anger from Massachusetts officials. \"We have the governor of Florida ... hatching a secret plot to send immigrant families like cattle on an airplane,\" said state Rep. Dylan Fernandes, who represents Martha's Vineyard. \"Ship them women and children to a place they weren't told where they were going and never alerted local officials and people on the ground here that they were coming. It is an incredibly inhumane and depraved thing to do.\" NPR was able to interview three of the migrants late Wednesday. \"They (the migrants) told us they had recently crossed the border in Texas and were staying at a shelter in San Antonio,\" NPR's Joel Rose said on Morning Edition. The migrants said a woman they identified as \"Perla\" approached them outside the shelter and lured them into boarding the plane, saying they would be flown to Boston where they could get expedited work papers. She provided them with food. The migrants said Perla was still trying to recruit more passengers just hours before their flight. Two boys are shown staying at a shelter on Martha's Vineyard, Mass., after they and dozens of other migrants arrived unannounced by plane Wednesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Eve Zuckoff/WCAI\n                    \n                \nhide caption Two boys are shown staying at a shelter on Martha's Vineyard, Mass., after they and dozens of other migrants arrived unannounced by plane Wednesday. Andres Duarte, a 30-year-old Venezuelan, said he had recently crossed the border into Texas and eventually went to a shelter in San Antonio. \"She (Perla) offered us help. Help that never arrived,\" Andres said. \"Now we are here. We got on the plane with a vision of the future, of making it.\" He went on to explain why he boarded the plane with so little information in hand. \"Look, when you have no money and someone offers help, well, it means a lot.\" In Martha's Vineyard, the migrants are staying at a church shelter while local authorities and nonprofit organizations figure out what's going to happen next. Lisa Belcastro, who runs a homeless shelter on the island, said resources were initially scarce. \"Everything from beds to food to clothing to toothbrushes, toothpaste, blankets, sheets. I mean, we had some of it ... but we did not have the numbers that we needed.\" Most of the arrivals spoke little or no English, and Spanish-speaking high school students were pressed into service as interpreters. Edgartown Police Chief Bruce McNamee said many of the migrants were confused. \"We have talked to a number of people who've asked, 'Where am I?' And then I was trying to explain where Martha's Vineyard is.\" The Wednesday flight extends a tactic by Republican politicians in primarily southern states have used to send migrants to Democrat-controlled cities in the north. Republican leaders have used this step to protest the rise in illegal immigration during President Biden's time in office, and the issue figures to be prominent in November's midterm elections. Martha's Vineyard has a reputation as a destination for the progressive elite, and DeSantis has been regularly bringing up the island enclave at his press conferences. Republican governors in Texas and Arizona have also been transporting migrants from the border to northern cities at taxpayer expense. Democrats and immigrant advocates say those governors are essentially using migrants as political pawns. But the governors say are simply calling attention to a very real problem. The U.S. Border Patrol is on pace to record 2 million apprehensions in a fiscal year for the first time ever. Belcastro, who runs the Martha's Vineyard shelter where the migrants spent the night, said the group is resilient. \"There's some really sad stories. And then some people, the only thing they were expressing is how grateful they are to be here, and to be safe, and cared for, right? And, you know, their needs are immense right now.\" NPR spoke with Yesica, a migrant who gave only her first name because of her undocumented immigration status. She said she was uncertain about her future. \"Oh, goodness. I don't know what is going to happen to us,\" Yesica said, speaking in Spanish. \"The truth is I am worried. It will be whatever God wishes, no? We're here now and there's nothing we can do.\" \"Not even,\" she added, \"to take a step back.\" Eve Zuckoff is a reporter at WCAI.",

STOCKHOLM \u2014 Sweden awoke Monday to the prospect of weeks of political uncertainty after neither of the country's blocs secured a clear governing majority in elections that saw another boost for a far-right party that is now the country's second largest. With more than 94% of the ballots counted, the center-right opposition that includes Sweden's second largest party, the Sweden Democrats, had a razor-thin edge over the governing Social Democrats and their allies in the center-left bloc headed by Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson, who has not resigned. The result was so close that the election authority said a definitive outcome would not be known before Wednesday, when the uncounted votes, including those cast abroad, have been tallied. As of now, the preliminary results make it unlikely any party will secure a majority of 175 seats in the 349-seat Riksdag, Sweden's parliament. \"It's incredibly close. It's basically a coin toss with 50-50 for both sides. So, we don't know at the moment,\" said Zeth Isaksson, a sociologist at Stockholm University. The biggest winner of the evening was the populist anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, which had a strong showing of nearly 21%, its best result ever. The party gained on promises to crack down on shootings and other gang violence that have shaken a sense of security for many in Sweden. The party has its roots in the white nationalist movement but years ago began expelling extremists. Despite its rebranding, voters long viewed it as unacceptable and other parties shunned it. But that has been changing, and its result in this election shows just how far it has come in gaining acceptance. The Social Democrats, who have been in power in Sweden since 2014, remain the largest party with 30.5% of the vote. Andersson said it was obvious that the social democratic movement, which is based on ideals of creating an equal society and a strong welfare state, remains strong in Sweden. The conservative bloc was led during the campaign by the center-right Moderates, who won 19%. Leader Ulf Kristersson told his supporters that he stands ready to try to create a stable and effective government. However, Sweden is likely to face a lengthy process to form a government, as it did after the 2018 election. Andersson, a 55-year-old economist, became Sweden's first female prime minister less than a year ago and led Sweden's historic bid to join NATO following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February.",

            "article_content": "With the midterm election two months away, NPR's Scott Simon talks with political analyst and editor Amy Walter about voter sentiment and which races she's watching.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Midterm elections are traditionally considered a referendum on the president's performance. That can make the party in the White House feel vulnerable. For most of this year, it was thought President Biden's low approval ratings pushed down by the hasty U.S. departure from Afghanistan, high prices at the gas pump, and stubborn inflation would lead to significant losses for Democrats. But now, just two months from Election Day, maybe things have shifted. Amy Walter, editor-in-chief of the Cook Political Report, joins us. Amy, thanks so much for being with us. AMY WALTER: Happy to be with you, Scott. SIMON: The president remains unpopular among registered voters, according to polls. Yet voters also say they're still likely to vote for a Democrat in the midterms. What accounts for this? WALTER: I think it reflects a couple of things. The first is that this is a president who was elected, for many people, more as a vote against Donald Trump than a vote for Joe Biden. The other is that, you know, you have a lot of voters right now, as you pointed out, who are frustrated with the state of the economy, who maybe think that this president hasn't gone far enough on certain issues they would have liked him to tackle. But they also know that they do not want to see a Republican. Now, the big question is, No. 1, do these voters stay as committed to Democrats as they say they are? And No. 2, do these voters actually show up? What we know about these kinds of voters is that they tend to be younger. Right now, they're very much undecided. So when I'm talking about saying they're more likely to vote for Democrats, it's still a pretty low number. And for the next two and a half months, will a focus on President Biden and the economy by Republicans push these voters who already don't feel great about Biden into the arms of Republican candidates? SIMON: What issues seem to be most important to a lot of voters? WALTER: Well, if you ask Republicans what their top issues are, it looks very different from what Democrats say their top issues are. For Republicans - the economy, inflation, immigration. For Democrats - abortion, climate change and guns. Independent voters, though - and these are the key group of voters that I'm paying attention to - they do put the economy and inflation much higher than they do abortion. And that's why Republicans still feel pretty confident that they are going to have a successful midterm though it may not be as successful as it was looking to be before we had the Dobbs decision on the Supreme Court and before we had a focus, an almost singular focus, on Donald Trump and Donald Trump's legal troubles and his influence on what happened on Jan. 6. SIMON: Amy, there are a couple races you can tip us off about that you were watching and we might watch as some sort of indicators. WALTER: Absolutely. Actually, we're going to get a pretty good idea this next week about one race in particular that I'm watching. And that's the New Hampshire Senate race. Now, New Hampshire is a state that, at least at the presidential level, has been going blue for some time. But it has a Republican governor. But this is the kind of place where Republicans had felt very optimistic about their chances. But as we've seen in so many other primaries, the candidate who many sort of traditional-establishment Republicans say is too far out, too far on the extreme, is ahead in the polling. If that candidate wins the primary, that's going to make it a lot harder for Republicans to pick up a seat that they had very high on their list. So that's one to watch. And then, I'm paying a lot of attention to a race in - on the House side in Virginia down in Newport News. The incumbent, Elaine Luria, Navy veteran - she's being challenged by a Republican who's also a Navy veteran - and the issue of abortion now taking center stage. This is a district that got a little more Republican under redistricting. So it's a very marginal seat. Republicans continue to be very bullish on picking up a seat like this in a midterm election. But Luria is trying to use the issue of abortion to draw a contrast with her opponent and hoping that this issue is going to resonate with voters in this district.

Democrats have been feeling more optimistic about their prospects in this fall's midterm elections lately, but Republicans are looking to the Rocky Mountains to pull an upset in their campaign to flip control of the Senate. GOP leaders hope their nominee in Colorado \u2014 construction company CEO Joe O'Dea \u2014 can flip the blue seat red. He's a rare Republican who affirms that President Biden won the 2020 election, and thinks someone other than Donald Trump should lead the party in 2024. \"I'm going to campaign for somebody else and we're going to move the country forward, and that's where I've been,\" O'Dea said, mentioning Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as alternatives to Trump. Of the roughly dozen competitive Senate races this election cycle, O'Dea is the one Republican candidate not endorsed by Trump. In the primary, he defeated right-wing election denier Ron Hanks \u2014 even though Democratic groups in the state tried to elevate Hank's candidacy. The first-time candidate sticks to a centrist message. \"On the whole, we've got to get rid of this partisanship that's just keeping us from putting good policies in place that move America forward,\" O'Dea said. \"And that's why I'm running. I'm independent minded. I'm a conservative, but at the same time we've got to do what's right for Colorado, we've got to do what's right for America.\" A big part of O'Dea's strategy is outreach to Latino voters, who could be the second largest voting bloc in the state. At a Hispanic cultural event in Denver, O'Dea drank a Mexican lager and bought his wife earrings from a local vendor after talking to NPR about his pitch to voters. Unlike the bulk of his party, O'Dea backs protections for Dreamers and supports a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented workers. He says Congress should approve legislation that addresses both border security and legal status for immigrants. But he stressed Hispanic voters tell him they are focused on the same things as all Coloradans. \"They're worried about the price of gas and this record crime that's taking over the city that's spot on their mind right now,\" he said. O'Dea insists if his party takes control and there's a narrow majority that he won't vote in lockstep with GOP leaders when it comes to issues like abortion and immigration. \"If they want my vote, then they're going to have to earn it. And they're going to have to move things around to make sure that I can honor my word,\" O'Dea said. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has praised O'Dea's campaign. With other GOP candidates underperforming in polls in competitive races in Pennsylvania, Arizona and Georgia, there is a close eye out for whether the Senate Leadership Fund, the super PAC aligned with McConnell, will invest resources in the state. Over tea at a local coffee shop in Denver, incumbent Michael Bennet, who retains a significant advantage in fundraising heading into the fall, pushes back at the notion that O'Dea is a moderate who can compete here. \"That is the national media's interpretation of what's going on in this race,\" Bennet said. Bennet spent much of August traveling the state touting legislation Democrats passed to lower prescription drug prices and invest in climate programs. He agrees with his opponent that voters are very focused on inflation. \"What people are having to pay for food and gasoline is a challenge. But I think that my sense is that people are actually seeing Washington begin to work again,\" Bennet said. \"And after the chaos of four years of Donald Trump, that's really welcome.\" Most shoppers and vendors NPR spoke with at the final week of the Green Valley Ranch summer farmer's market north of downtown Denver don't know who's running in November's Senate race. But they had strong feelings about what matters for their vote this fall. Kettle corn vendor Leon Smith said \"housing and jobs\" are his priorities. Smith voted for former President Trump, but he told NPR he doesn't feel compelled to cast his vote for either party this fall. \"Right now, I'd just rather hold it,\" he said. \"I'd just rather hold it until I'm confident. And I see what each party is doing right now. Each party is just still doing tit for tat. They're not handling no business.\" For Linda Wilson, who leans Democrat, one issue is top of mind \u2014 abortion. \"When I was younger, I had the choice, because I was pregnant before I got married. It was a choice. It wasn't an option that I would have chosen for myself. But I had that option,\" she said. The Republican backs some abortion rights, but he's running in a state with a long history of protecting abortion access. The state codified its protections this year \u2014 a law O'Dea opposed. He also voted for a ballot measure in 2020 that banned abortions after 22 weeks with no exceptions. That was soundly defeated. O'Dea sidestepped whether those positions put him out of step with a majority of Colorado voters. Instead he emphasized when he thinks abortion should be legal: \"I believe, the first five months, the mother has the choice. After that, there should be some exceptions: rape, incest, life of the mother.\" But ODea said he supports Trump's Supreme Court appointees who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade. Abortion rights advocates argue that position is inconsistent. Pressed on his position, O'Dea told NPR, \"I believe in good conservative judges. I like that. But I don't believe in the decision that they made.\" He said he would represent his constituents if a nationwide abortion ban came up in the Senate. But Bennet argues O'Dea's position on abortion, along with his stances on other issues, will turn off Colorado voters: \"He's the nominee of the Republican Party here in Colorado. And he says that Trump bears no responsibility for what happened on Jan. 6. That should be disqualifying, to say nothing of his position on Roe v. Wade, to say nothing of, you know, his position on the trickle-down economics that have made Colorado and so many places in this country unaffordable for working people.\" As O'Dea deliberately pivots away from the former president, Bennet said, \"It's a reality that Trump hangs over everything.\" Bennet says in every town hall he's had since Trump was elected, he brings up the threat to democracy. Trump isn't on the ballot in November, but is someone who came up with most of the voters NPR talked to around the Denver metro area. Philip Cardenas, who sells freeze-dried candy at the Green Valley Ranch farmer's market, plans to back Bennet. He admits he doesn't know anything about O'Dea but says he's concerned about extremism from the GOP. \"I think a majority of Americans are purple. I mean, if the climate was different, I would definitely \u2014 and I thought a Republican president would do better \u2014 I would vote. But they're too far right, right now, with the MAGA crowd,\" Cardenas said. Leon Pommer, a Republican shopping at the outdoor store Cabela's in Thornton, Colo., said he voted for Trump and credited him for keeping energy prices lower during his tenure. \"He did real well on the gas prices. You know, he allowed fracking was going to have the oil pipeline come down from Canada, which would have kept prices lower.\" Pommer, along with his wife Karen, said they planned to back O'Dea, but Karen said she left the Republican Party to become an independent this year. \"I was disillusioned with Trump,\" she told NPR. \"I don't think he was honest.\" O'Dea called Jan. 6 \"a black eye to the country\" and praised former Vice President Mike Pence for his actions that day. Complaints about partisanship blocking real action are common from voters across the political spectrum. Lynette Vigil, a mom of seven, says housing costs are out of control. But she doesn't have much faith Congress will do much about it. \"It's a circus,\" she said. \"There's no other word for it. It's a circus. I feel like people are living in an alternate reality.\" Bennet told NPR he gets the frustration, but points to a string of recent bills as evidence that the Senate is working. \"I mean, it'd be hard to imagine somebody more disenchanted with Washington, D.C., than I am. But I will say that for the last 12 months or so, it's really been amazing to see what's been accomplished, mostly in a bipartisan way \u2014 Republicans and Democrats working together,\" Bennet said. \"And I don't think that should be discounted.\" ODea's pitch to attract independents and Democrats is that he's someone who is willing to compromise. But Bennet says this election is a choice \u2014 between a party that has made some headway to bring down high prices or a party dominated by a leader still fighting about the last election.",

Heading in the 2022 midterm elections, abortion leads as the top issue for Democrats. For Republicans, it is inflation. For independents, inflation also tops and abortion ranks second. Both major political parties are facing crosswinds heading into the 2022 midterms, with Democrats and many independents motivated by the issue of abortion, while Republicans have the advantage on the economy, according to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. President Biden is also seeing a marginal increase in his approval rating, going from 36% in July to 41% now, largely because of a 10-point jump with independents. Democrats also have a marginal advantage when people were asked who they would vote for if the elections were held today \u2013 48% said a Democrat, 44% said a Republican. But given that swing districts are in many right-leaning areas, Democrats usually need a fairly significant lead on the question. The survey of 1,236 adults was conducted Aug. 29 through Sept. 1. It has a margin of error of +/- 4.1 percentage points, meaning results could be 4 points higher or lower than what is shown. There are 1,151 registered voters surveyed with a margin of error of +/- 4.3 percentage points. Top of mind for voters when thinking about November's elections overall is inflation, followed by abortion, according to the survey. That's not surprising considering the economic landscape and how the Democratic base responded after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Overall, 30% identified inflation as their top issue, but that's down 7 points from the last time the question was asked in July. That was followed by abortion at 22%, up 4 points since July. Loading... For Democrats, abortion was the clear top issue (35%), followed by the Jan. 6 committee hearings (22%), health care (16%) and inflation (13%). For Republicans, inflation was by far the top issue (40%), followed by immigration (22%), and abortion (10%). Nothing else received double digits. For independents, inflation was also tops (37%), but abortion was second (22%) and health care after that (12%). Even though inflation was the top issue for independents, 58% of them also said that the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe has made them more likely to vote. Loading... So independents, who are so key in swing districts and purple states, are saying, yes, they are most concerned about inflation, but abortion rights are also a motivating issue. That makes for a tricky line for both parties to walk in how they try to appeal to the group. Abortion continues to be a key motivator for Democrats, as three-quarters (77%) said the Supreme Court's decision makes them more likely to vote, about the same as it was in the immediate aftermath of the June Dobbs ruling. Democrats are making abortion a key focus in their elections, running millions of dollars worth of advertising on the issue in an effort to get their voters out to the polls.

Most elections are, at least in part, reactions to the results of the last election. Usually, that means they function as a referendum on the last election's winners and their performance in office. It is unusual, if not unprecedented, for the midterm cycle to focus on the conduct of the last election \u2014 a kind of referendum on the legitimacy of the system itself. By that standard, 2022 qualifies as unusual indeed. Donald Trump and his followers, who now represent the activist core of the Republican Party, have insisted on making 2022 a do-over of 2020. Their essential argument is not that President Biden has failed or been a bad president, but that he was never legitimately elected president in the first place. Trump has in fact this past week demanded he be \"reinstated\" as the \"rightful winner\" of the 2020 election or that the election be re-run \"immediately\" because Facebook had been advised by the FBI not to trust certain stories about Biden's son, Hunter, during the 2020 campaign. Trump continues to insist, after 20 months, that he won an election that he lost by more than 7 million in the popular vote and by 306-232 in the Electoral College. Neither he nor his acolytes have produced any evidence to undermine those totals. But they have eroded confidence in the system and its caretakers to the degree that a majority of Republicans tell pollsters they think the election was \"stolen.\" The rest of the GOP, including prominent leaders such as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, would clearly prefer to talk about Biden and about inflation, gas prices, crime and immigration. But they cannot wrest the party's megaphone back from the man who has monopolized it since 2015. And whatever they think of Trump personally, they are as reliant as he is on the support and donations and votes of his followers. So they fall in line, or they fall silent. Moreover, a new generation of candidates has emerged and surged in GOP primaries by stressing their embrace of Trump's claims. Trump has endorsed 159 candidates who are election deniers for state and federal offices this year, and about 80% of them have already won their Republican primaries, according to a survey by The New York Times. A separate survey by The Washington Post found 87 election deniers among candidates for offices that will matter to the vote certification of the next election in six battleground states he narrowly lost in 2020 (Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin). Of that number, 54 have already won their primaries. \"The 2020 election was stolen,\" say the MAGA candidates who wear Trump's favor, adding, \"You know it and I know it.\" That statement of assurance is usually the only proof offered. And the crowd at the rally roars back its affirmation. The \"you know it and I know it\" mantra is also available in a variety of display formats. You can go on Amazon today and order it on a package of 10 waterproof vinyl car decals, or go elsewhere for it on a doormat or on a polyester flag measuring 15 square feet. From the standpoint of a fact-checker, there is no evidence of fraud sufficient to support that claim. After nearly two years of recounts, ballot reviews, expert examinations and court cases, that remains the bottom line. The 2020 election has been scrubbed and studied as none other in U.S. history, and the consensus conclusion remains that it was run more smoothly and counted more reliably than ever. So why do Trump's people continue to deny the outcomes, and why do crowds cheer? Perhaps, because in politics, myth can be as powerful as fact \u2014 and at times it may well be more so. Claims of voter fraud have become integral to Trump's brand. But he did not invent the idea of a stolen election. He exploited it as no one had before, to be sure, but he was mining a lode that had been opened long ago and tapped as a rich source of grievance for generations. For the \"election deniers,\" and for many Americans who accept the 2020 results but still think voter fraud is a big problem, the roots of these beliefs are deep. The Heritage Foundation, long an anchor on the right among think tanks in Washington, devotes a page of its website to voter fraud and offers a database of cases. It also offers a disquisition on ballot stuffing and voter intimidation and other forms of malfeasance common in the 1700s and 1800s and early 1900s. The prime example cited by Heritage is an election stolen by the notorious Democratic machine in New York City known as Tammany Hall. It happened in 1844. More recent examples cited include a mayoral primary in East Chicago, Ind., in 2003. The figure of 1,182 is cited for the total of criminal prosecutions for voter fraud in recent years, most of them dealing with improper registration or fraudulent use of absentee ballots. They are listed as 2022 cases, but on further inspection they date back over a period of years and arise from primaries as well as general elections. The database does not mention that in 2020 alone there were more than 50 million votes cast in primaries and more than 158 million in the November election. William Safire was a White House speechwriter for President Richard Nixon who later spent decades writing columns on politics and language for The New York Times. In his popular New Political Dictionary, he wrote extensively on \"ballot box stuffing\" and \"cemetery voting.\" He, too, went back to Tammany Hall rigging outcomes for the Democrats in New York City in the 1800s, while also allowing that the Republican strongholds in upstate New York were often suspect in their reporting as late as the 1920s. Safire noted that many had believed the 1960 presidential election was tipped to John F. Kennedy and running mate Lyndon B. Johnson by vote theft in rural Texas counties and the heavily Catholic precincts of Chicago, where the Democratic machine of Mayor Richard J. Daley held sway. One story often repeated among Protestant Republicans in Illinois described school buses shuttling nuns around the city on Election Day, unloading them to vote at every Catholic parish they passed. Still, in Safire's treatment, these phenomena were historical artifacts of an era before mechanized and later digitized voting became the norm and cheating became more challenging. The Florida vote counting fiasco in 2000, which struggled for weeks to ascertain a reliable result, ended the era of complacency on this score. In the end, the Supreme Court upheld a count by which George W. Bush won the state by just over 500 votes, thus securing Florida's crucial contribution to his minimum-margin win in the Electoral College. Since then, the administration of U.S. elections has been thoroughly examined and renovated. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) devoted billions to upgrading the election infrastructure, and many states instituted reforms of their own to facilitate and improve their voting and counting systems. At the same time, the Bush White House was directing the Department of Justice to investigate thoroughly the possibility that voter fraud in major cities was padding the Democratic vote in swing states. The probe began in 2002 and five years later had little to show for its work. The federal Election Assistance Commission, tasked with finding fraud, reported that while some abuses had occurred, they were far from systematic or pervasive enough to matter much. Nevertheless, the search went on and some U.S. attorneys around the country felt they were being pressured to prioritize prosecutions for voter fraud. Several resigned, and the allegations became part of the investigation Democrats began into the department after taking the majority in Congress in 2006. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, appointed by Bush in 2005, resigned in 2007. Talk of voter fraud simmered down a bit thereafter. But the issue returned to prominence when Trump, after years of pumping up the \"birther\" conspiracy about Barack Obama's citizenship, shifted his focus to voter fraud in 2016. The only way he could lose, he said often that year, was if the election were stolen. When he won that year, Trump still leveled angry allegations of voter fraud, perhaps because he had lost the national popular vote by nearly 3 million. He said between 3 million and 5 million non-citizens had voted in California alone, but he offered no proof whatsoever. He then appointed a bipartisan commission to find the proof, not just in California, but nationwide. The commission was soon identified with the aggressive tactics of its vice chairman, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who had sent requests around the country for extensive voter data. Many states, both red and blue, resisted or flat out refused. Dissension broke out within the commission, which disbanded after seven months without having found any evidence of voter fraud. Nonetheless, Trump was back in the 2020 cycle predicting he could only lose if there was fraud, and that stance once again segued into a fury of denial and denunciations when he lost. While he struck out in the courts at the state and federal level (the Supreme Court refused to hear any of the appeals), Trump took his case to the public and has had considerable success in sowing doubt among his sympathizers. At least one of the other Republicans eyeing the 2024 presidential election cycle, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, has also made voter fraud a signature issue. In August, he held a news conference at which he announced the filing of charges against 20 Floridians who he said had voted illegally in 2020. With rows of his \"election police\" posed behind him, DeSantis said he was outing ex-offenders who had no right to vote because of the seriousness of their crimes. It was later reported that at least some of the ex-offenders had believed their rights had been restored by a referendum Florida voters had approved by a big margin in 2018. Ricky Hatch is a Republican in Weber County, Utah, who has been an election official there since 2012. He is among several local election administrators from around the country who appear in a forthcoming book by CBS News reporter Major Garrett and David Becker, a previous longtime elections lawyer with the Department of Justice who founded the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation and Research. In The Big Truth: Upholding Democracy in the Age of \"The Big Lie,\" Garrett and Becker detail the travails of the ordinary citizens on the front lines of the voting struggle. Hatch said some of his neighbors cannot be persuaded even when he personally demonstrates to them how all the machinery of the process works right there in their home county. \"They say, 'I know your machines have been hacked by China,' \" Hatch reports. \"I show them there is no means to hack the machines, that nothing is connected. They just say, 'They have been hacked, you just don't know it.' \" Hatch says he has heard objections from skeptics over the years, but nothing like the wall of denialism erected by Trump. \"I hate saying this, but he has the same characteristics as a cult leader,\" Hatch says. \"He pulls people into a belief system. I thought it would die down. ... It's getting stronger.\" At a minimum, the issue of voter fraud seems undiminished in its ability to galvanize certain categories of voters and create doubt about the outcome of elections. Perhaps that should not be surprising. Voter fraud exists, but its prevalence and importance are less a matter of fact than of belief. Relying on that belief to explain away unpalatable election results is an exercise of faith, but one that millions find more acceptable than all the arguments and evidence from experts, courts and academics. In the end, articles of faith are just that. Whether you consider faith to be higher than reason or simply unreasonable, such beliefs can be largely immune to factual refutation or rational argument. And they can be powerful motivators of human behavior, including at the polls.",

President Biden has been speaking in increasingly dire terms about threats to American democracy, going so far as to describe some Republicans as \"semi-fascist.\" On Thursday, he is set to deliver a prime-time address from Independence Park in Philadelphia about the \"battle for the soul of the nation,\" kicking off a two-month fight Democrats are making to try to retain control of the House and Senate in midterm elections. His speech comes at a time when a majority of Americans believe U.S. democracy is in crisis and one recent poll found more than 40% think a civil war in the next decade is at least somewhat likely. The White House says Biden plans to argue the core values of the nation are at stake, outlining rights and freedoms that are under attack \u2014 such as access to abortion and reproductive health services, which have been limited in many states since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade earlier this year. Talking about the battle for the soul of the nation isn't new for Biden. It was a dominant theme of his race against former President Donald Trump starting with the video that launched his campaign. \"We are in the battle for the soul of this nation,\" Biden said after the video showed images of white supremacists marching in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017. \"I believe history will look back on four years of this president and all he embraces as an aberrant moment in time.\" After he won and officially became president-elect, Biden confidently declared that \"in this battle for the soul of America, democracy prevailed.\" Supporters of former President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as Congress tallied electoral votes.\n                \n                    \n                    Brent Stirton/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supporters of former President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as Congress tallied electoral votes. But then Jan. 6 happened. On the day the Electoral College votes were to be tallied by Congress, violent pro-Trump rioters stormed the Capitol, temporarily halting the proceedings. Since then, the threat of political violence hasn't waned. In an interview with Fox News earlier this week, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., predicted \"there'll be riots in the streets\" if the former president is prosecuted for mishandling classified documents. Biden is now returning to the \"soul of the nation\" theme again as Democrats are solidifying their message ahead of the midterm elections. \"It's not hyperbole, now you need to vote to literally save democracy again,\" Biden implored at a campaign rally for a Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Maryland last week. \"Will we be a nation of unity, of hope, of optimism \u2014 not a nation of anger, violence, hatred and division.\" Former President Donald Trump at a rally on Aug. 5.\n                \n                    \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former President Donald Trump at a rally on Aug. 5. Every election, the candidates say the stakes have never been higher. In midterms, where control of Congress hangs in the balance, presidents typically try to avoid making the race a referendum on their performance in office, and instead try to argue the race is a choice between competing candidates and visions. But Republican pollster Whit Ayers said this midterm election is unusual. \"We've never had a former president who has continued to deny that the current president was legitimately elected,\" said Ayers, the president of North Star Opinion Research. \"That's never occurred in American history before. And that makes the midterms a different environment than has ever happened before.\" Even as recently as this week, the former president was demanding on social media that he immediately be reinstated or to have Americans decide the 2020 election again in a revote, which is not how the American election system works. Candidates endorsing Trump's election lies have won primaries and will be on the ballot in November. But Ayers said for most voters, as a motivating issue, democratic erosion isn't as tangible as things like the price of gas. \"Most voters are moved by things that affect them personally and directly,\" he said. Republicans want to keep the campaign focused on things like inflation, immigration and crime. But that's a struggle because Trump is constantly in the headlines. \"One way you succeed with elections is by telling the nation what to be afraid of,\" said Jennifer Mercieca, a professor in the school of communications and journalism at Texas A&M University.

With this speech, Biden is trying to define the election as being about something larger than inflation, said Mercieca, who specializes in presidential rhetoric. \"He's providing this ultra-heroic frame,\" said Mercieca, explaining that Biden is making the case that \"this is an existential crisis, this is a threat to the nation, this is about our most important value,\" she said. And finding a frame, a theme that ties together seemingly disparate ideas and events, can be helpful when running a campaign. Take Democrat Pat Ryan. He just won a special election for a congressional seat in upstate New York in a race that was anything but a sure thing. He didn't shy away from talking about abortion rights, or as he put it, \"not pull our punches, not triangulate, not poll-test.\" He framed the Supreme Court's recent abortion decision as being part of a larger threat of extreme ideology. \"We stood up and pro-actively said this campaign is about freedom, this campaign is about choice,\" Ryan said. \"These are unifying American values that I think transcend even the very partisan corners that everybody's in right now.\" Ryan said campaigning on threats to democracy motivated Democratic voters and also resonated with independents. \"I mean it's very sad and dark that that's where we're at as a country, but that does represent, I think, that cumulative set of rights being ripped away and anxiety and division,\" Ryan said.",

In the heart of Atlanta's rapidly diversifying suburbs, Democrats have become a dominant force in local politics. But earlier this summer, Republicans gathered to stake their own claim in the community. Dozens of people packed a strip mall in Gwinnett County to celebrate the grand opening of the Republican National Committee's Hispanic Community Center, including Rey Martinez, who was the first Latino mayor in the state of Georgia when he took office in nearby Loganville in 2018. \"I'm a candidate for Georgia House District 111,\" he told the crowd. \"Now I'm back on the campaign trail again, and I know firsthand the benefit of grassroots efforts like what we are kicking off here with the grand opening of the RNC Hispanic Community Center.\" Though the GOP is largely supported by white voters, the party has recently made inroads with voters of color. In the 2020 presidential race, former President Donald Trump made gains with Black and Latino voters in part through community outreach centers opened in key areas across the country. Ahead of this year's midterm elections, Republicans have invested millions of dollars into expanding these centers into other minority communities in states like Georgia, Pennsylvania and Texas. There are more than three dozen centers now open that reflect the diversity of the communities around them, from heavily Jewish Boca Raton, Fla., to a Native American community in North Carolina to a majority-Black neighborhood in northwest Philadelphia \u2014 a city where Trump improved on his margins from 2016 to 2020. RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told the crowd at Georgia's newest outreach center that her party was committed to putting in the work and walking the walk when it comes to reaching voters of color. \"This is not us saying, 'We expect your vote, you owe us your vote,' \" she said. \"This is us saying, 'We want to earn your vote. We want to learn how we can better represent your community, how we can be here long-term.' \" Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel gives remarks to a packed room at the opening of the RNC's new Hispanic Community Center in Suwanee, Ga., on June 29.\n                \n                    \n                    Ben Gray/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel gives remarks to a packed room at the opening of the RNC's new Hispanic Community Center in Suwanee, Ga., on June 29. The RNC Hispanic center is one of three in Georgia, joining an Asian Pacific American outreach location in another pocket of Gwinnett County and a Black American outreach center just south of Atlanta. Paris Dennard, a former national spokesperson for the RNC, says these outreach spaces are not a new development, but rather continued investments that reflect the party's commitment in meeting voters where they are. \"What we understand is that all politics is local, but also politics is about relationships,\" Dennard said. \"Politics is about establishing a connection with the voters. The more the voters are connected to you \u2014 be it a political party or a campaign or a candidate \u2014 the more likely they are to support you, to vote for you, and also to advocate for you among their friends and family members.\" In the 2020 presidential cycle, Trump launched his \"Black Voices\" coalition in Atlanta and delivered a major policy speech for Black voters in suburban Cobb County weeks before the election. The campaign opened numerous Black Voices for Trump and Latino Voices for Trump centers across the country. And now, the RNC has been expanding the reach of those centers \u2014 and other minority outreach initiatives like helping prepare immigrants for their naturalization tests \u2014 to prepare for the midterms and beyond. Dennard also said another important aspect of the community centers is that they are staffed by locals who know the community and not out-of-state operatives coming in at the last minute. \"It's because we understand that this is a two-way street, meaning the RNC is listening and learning from the community about what their specific needs are, what their concerns are and how we can better address them as our candidates,\" he said. Someone who understands the importance of open communication is John King, Georgia's Republican insurance commissioner and the first Latino statewide officer in the state's history. \"It's incredibly important because we know not only are we creating a bridge for the Latino voice to be heard at the highest levels of our state, but also for established communities,\" he said. King says conservative policies are resonating with more nonwhite voters, especially Latinos and especially with the current state of the national economy. \"We're having a permanent presence and having a permanent conversation in Spanish, in English, about the values that the Republican Party brings, which are very much in line to the values that generally you hear from Hispanics,\" he said. \"They're interested in having conversations about opportunities to succeed, to improve the quality of their life for their families, and I think Republicans have a good case to make for creating opportunities for people to thrive.\" King also says the community centers show meaningful community connections and don't come across as pandering for votes by offering free stuff in exchange for votes. \"There's a common saying in Spanish that when you take free stuff from the government, you're giving up something in return \u2014 either a little bit of your freedom, or a little bit of your soul,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, that's not genuine, so people can see through that.\" \"They can continue to waste money in our communities trying to reach out to us, but we understand that they're not here to help us and they're just trying to use us in order to expand their power,\" said Nabilah Islam, a Georgia state Senate candidate of Bangladeshi descent who's running in a district that includes two of the RNC outreach centers. \"And we're not going to let that happen.\" That said, Democrats have also been accused of not investing consistently in voters of color \u2014 who the party often depends on, especially in the South. \"We must invest in our communities by doing ethnic media outreach, by reaching out to Black voters, Latino voters and AAPI voters and meeting them where they are,\" Islam said. \"So you have to always compete in order to win, and we can't take anyone for granted.\" Dennard, the former RNC spokesman, says the party is already seeing an uptick in voters of color supporting Republicans, including Georgia, where voter data showed the number of Black voters double in this spring's primary. \"It is by no surprise that when you saw the recent primary election, there was an uptick in voter participation across the board,\" he said. \"But also, we saw an uptick in support for minorities crossing over to vote Republican. That is a good thing.\" And while many of these outreach centers are located in areas that have seen Republican growth, they also overlap with places where Trump sought to invalidate votes following his 2020 defeat. Georgia will see two Black Senate candidates square off for a pivotal seat that once again could decide control of the chamber: Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker. Dennard said Walker is a prime example of a candidate who is \"changing the narrative of what it is to be conservative, what it looks like to be a Republican.\" \"And that's what you see across the country,\" he added. \"Because our party is more diverse, our party is an open tent and our party is more inclusive.\" Polling shows Walker's campaign is not resonating with Black voters in a significant way, and in this fall's elections, voters of color will still likely overwhelmingly vote for Democrats. But in a closely divided Congress, even a small shift in preference in battleground races could make the difference in who wins and who loses. Republican leadership says this investment into voters of color is not a onetime deal. Once all the votes are counted, you can expect these RNC community centers to keep their lights on and doors open with an eye towards 2024 and beyond.",

Four months ago \u2014 the last time we wrote about the top 10 seats most likely to change hands \u2014 Republicans were growing confident they would win the chamber. But a lot has changed in that time. The Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade has boosted Democratic enthusiasm (and fundraising); a handful of hardline or untested Republican challengers won their primaries; and the Jan. 6 committee hearings and the FBI search of former President Donald Trump's Florida home have put him front and center yet again, threatening to make the election a choice rather than a referendum on President Biden and Democratic governance. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell noted last week that \"candidate quality\" could hamper Republicans' ability to win the chamber. \"I think there's probably a greater likelihood the House flips than the Senate,\" the Kentucky senator said in his home state. \"Senate races are just different, they're statewide. Candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome.\" It's all giving Democrats hope of retaining the 50-50 Senate, which they narrowly control with Vice President Harris casting tie-breaking votes. But inflation remains the top concern for many voters, especially independents, and Biden continues to be unpopular \u2014 though many Democratic candidates are outperforming his approval. Here's where things stand in the key races, in order of most likely to flip: Democrat John Fetterman has held up well so far against Trump-backed TV doctor Mehmet Oz, despite suffering a stroke that kept him off the campaign trail for months. Fetterman is better liked, and he's pounded Oz's residency and wealth on social media. Oz, on the other hand, is coming off a bruising primary and hasn't quite found his footing. Still, Oz is in striking distance. For him to improve his odds, he will need to pierce Fetterman's brand, as Republicans try to figure out the best issue set to stick to Fetterman. Some operatives believe it's not tying the tough-talking, burly former mayor to left-wing politics, like Medicare for All or the democratic socialism of Sen. Bernie Sanders, but fracking and crime. So far, that message hasn't taken hold. Democratic U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock, left, aims to fend off a challenge from political newcomer Herschel Walker.\n                \n                    \n                    Elijah Nouvelage/Bloomberg via Getty Images; James Gilbert/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Very little separates the next four races, which are all expected to be extremely tight. Georgia has remained close, and incumbent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock has done well so far. Republicans acknowledge that earlier efforts to try and paint Warnock as a \"radical\" were a mistake. It's tough to make the pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church \u2014 the same post once held by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. \u2014 whose ads have featured him smiling with a beagle, look like a bad guy. Instead, the attacks to come are more likely to be simply making Warnock out to be a Democrat whose votes are out of step with Georgia. But Georgia is about as purple as it comes now, and Warnock's Trump-backed opponent, Herschel Walker, has his issues as a candidate. Still, the former NFL and University of Georgia running back has high name ID and appeal among Republicans. And Walker will likely benefit from the gubernatorial race of Republican Brian Kemp, who is currently favored to win reelection. This one will likely be a nail-biter. Incumbent Democrat Mark Kelly has a lead in the polls and has struck a moderate profile in this state Biden won narrowly. Plus, Trump-endorsed Republican Blake Masters won his primary and backs Trump's election lies. But this is Arizona, and operatives in both parties expect this race to tighten. Masters has landed in controversy on multiple topics, but Democrats have chosen to focus on his hardline stance on abortion. In fact, one of the first ads run against him after the primary was on that, showing what a salient issue Democrats think it is, especially with independents, which are so crucial in this state. But Republicans see inflation and immigration as the two most important issues. Plus, Masters is already making a tonal shift now that he's in the general election. Republicans also outnumber Democrats in the state by about 147,000, and with a third of the state not identifying with either party, independents are key for Kelly. Democrats have been able to win over independents in recent Senate elections in the state, but it's a tougher task in the first midterm of an unpopular Democratic president. Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto is the first Latina elected senator, while Republican Adam Laxalt is a political scion in Nevada.\n                \n                    \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images; John Locher/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Nevada's political leaning and demographics \u2014 with substantial Latino and Asian American populations \u2014 tend to favor Democrats. But Republicans continue to doubt the strength of incumbent freshman Catherine Cortez Masto's candidacy. Democrats, on the other hand, think Cortez Masto, the first Latina elected senator, has run a good campaign so far, focusing on local issues, like helping get drought funding in the Democratic-passed Inflation Reduction Act. Democrats outnumber Republicans in Nevada by tens of thousands of voters, and Democrats think abortion will fire up their voters to head to the polls. Republican Adam Laxalt is a controversial candidate who has backed Trump's election lies, but he is a former attorney general who is also a political scion in the state. (His grandfather, Paul Laxalt, was a senator and governor.) Incumbent Republican Sen. Ron Johnson is not very well liked in the state and has landed in numerous controversies related to the coronavirus vaccine and his ties to Trump and the Jan. 6 insurrection. Johnson hardly cuts the image of the vanilla businessman that helped him first win his seat in 2010. An early poll shows he could be in trouble, but Republicans are feeling positive about his chances. They say Johnson is doing a good job raising money and running a strong campaign, doing the groundwork, even reaching out to the small share of Latinos in the state. The Democrat here is Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who is less well known, though he has won statewide. While Democrats want to make this about Johnson, Republicans will seek to paint Barnes as progressive as anyone in the state, particularly on crime and ties to the \"defund the police\" and \"defund ICE\" movements, which he has tried to distance himself from in recent months. New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan finds out who her Republican opponent will be next month.\n                \n                    \n                    Charles Krupa/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption This is the one key Senate race that doesn't have its general election matchup set. That would be thought of as an advantage for incumbent Sen. Maggie Hassan, but New Hampshire is a purple state with a strong independent and libertarian streak, and Hassan's numbers have lagged. Biden may have won New Hampshire in 2020 by 7 points, but he's now very unpopular in the state. That makes it a tough place for a Democrat up for reelection. The GOP primary will be decided Sept. 13, and no candidate has really stood out from the pack. So far, Don Bolduc, a retired Army general who has backed Trump's election lies and whom Trump has praised, has a lead in polls over the more staid state Senate President Chuck Morse and others. Primary polls have moved quickly this year closer to elections, and this race hasn't gotten a lot of attention yet, but Republicans likely would rather make this a campaign between a more generic Republican and Hassan rather than with an election denier. These next two are close, but still lean in Republicans' direction. Democrats like what they've seen out of their nominee in North Carolina, Cheri Beasley, the first Black chief justice of the state Supreme Court. That's a statewide elected position, one she lost by just 401 votes out of more than five million in 2020. (Biden lost the state by more than 100,000 votes.) Notably, she has more than doubled the amount of money raised by Republican Rep. Ted Budd, the Trump-endorsed candidate, as of June 30. North Carolina has a Democratic governor, as well, but this has been something of a Lucy-and-the-football state for the party. Democrats have been close, but won no presidential or Senate races since Barack Obama (and former Sen. Kay Hagan) won in 2008. There are more Democrats in the state than Republicans, but independents here are more GOP-leaning, which has given Republicans the advantage in recent federal elections. What's more, while Republicans have seen their ranks stay about the same since 2020, Democratic registrations have shrunk since then, when Biden lost by 1.4 points. Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan has run a strong, middle-of-the-road campaign so far, Democrats say. And it's showing in the polls against Republican J.D. Vance, who has landed in controversies with his remarks on women and family. Vance has a lot of work to do to right his campaign's ship. He's been seen as running a weak campaign and Ryan has raised seven times the amount of money as Vance. But there's a long way to go. And the cavalry is about to come to Vance's aid. The Senate Leadership Fund is planning to plunk down $28 million to boost Vance, more than quadrupling what Republicans have already spent on his candidacy. Plus, this is a Republican-leaning state that Biden lost by 8 points. The president's approval rating is underwater in the state, and Ryan has distanced himself from Biden. Rounding out the top 10 are two states that are stretches for both parties, but where they are competing strongly. In Florida, Republican incumbent Marco Rubio has veered a long way from his 2016 anti-Trump days that won him the pejorative \"Little Marco\" from Trump. Since then, he's shrunk into the former president's shadow, denouncing the search at Trump's Florida home, for example, as a \"Third World Act.\" The fact is: Rubio needs Trump's supporters in a state Trump won twice and where conservative Ron DeSantis is governor. Challenging him is Democratic Rep. Val Demings. Demings, a former Orlando chief of police, was a Trump impeachment manager and has actually outraised Rubio, highly unusual for a sitting senator. At the end of the day, though, this is still Florida, and Republicans outnumber Democrats by more than 200,000 voters. The incumbent here is Democrat Michael Bennet. Republicans are happy their candidate Joe O'Dea, a more moderate construction company executive who supports abortion rights in the early months of a pregnancy, made it through the primary against an election denier who did not believe in any exceptions for abortion. (Trying to get through the primary, O'Dea touted on his website that \"pro-lifers\" had endorsed him.) Democrats aim to use abortion to fire up their voters in this state, where Democrats outnumber Republicans by about 100,000 voters. They'll paint O'Dea as a vote for McConnell for majority leader and the 51st vote to ban abortion \u2014 despite the fact that O'Dea has said he would vote to codify early-term abortion rights and later with exceptions. (He has likened himself to a \"Republican Joe Manchin.\") Republicans don't believe Bennet has been pushed and think he's potentially vulnerable. He won in 2016 with just 50% and by 6 points. (Republicans also believe they can give Sen. Patty Murray in Washington state a run for her money, but that hasn't borne out so far and is an even more left-leaning state than Colorado.)",

            "article_content": "It's been another extraordinary week in politics - from Rep. Liz Cheney's big primary loss to continuing legal issues for former President Donald Trump and those close to him.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Liz Cheney began her concession speech this week by saying, quote, \"our work is far from over.\" Her loss was no surprise, but still momentous. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LIZ CHENEY: Our nation is barreling once again towards crisis, lawlessness and violence. No American should support election deniers for any position of genuine responsibility where their refusal to follow the rule of law will corrupt our future. (APPLAUSE) SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving joins us. Thanks for being with us, Ron. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott. SIMON: What does Representative Cheney's loss mean for her future and that of her party? ELVING: It means that Liz Cheney and her party are going to be going their separate ways. As you say, she didn't just lose this week. She lost by nearly 40 points - this after having won her current office three times before by big margins. But each of those times she was on the Donald Trump train. And this time she not only stepped off that train, she laid down on the track in front of it. Now, there's been talk of her running for president in her present party, but it's hard to see it. Her party is no longer the GOP - the Grand Old Party. That acronym dates back to the Civil War, the forge of the party's founding. Liz Cheney has been casting herself as a throwback to the era of Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant - she quoted them this week - and to the party of Ronald Reagan and the Bush family and her own father, former Vice President Dick Cheney. But today's GOP is driven by nationalists and populist activists empowered by former President Trump, and they are not going away. SIMON: At the same time, we get what can almost seem like hourly updates on legal issues surrounding former President Trump and people in his orbit. What kind of danger does this perhaps pose for Republicans just a few months away from elections? ELVING: In one sense, we can say it's been a boon for them. It excites the sense of grievance many of their voters have when it comes to the federal government. The party needs that going into the elections this November and beyond. But it's also obviously a distraction. Most Republicans would much rather have the national conversation focus on inflation or the bad memories of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan just a year ago. Instead, we're talking again about Trump and the multifront war that various legal authorities are fighting to hold him accountable for his actions in office and since. Now, the Mar-a-Lago search is just the sharpest arrow in that quiver right now. We heard former Vice President Mike Pence this week saying, our party stands with the men and women who stand on the thin blue line at the federal and state and local level. And these attacks on the FBI must stop. That is the old Republican Party talking. It is not clear that the new Republican Party is even listening. SIMON: Let me ask you about contrast with the Democrats because, of course, this week, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act. Are they coming into clearer focus as the midterms approach? ELVING: We're about 80 days out from the midterms, roughly. That's at least 2 1/2 lifetimes away in political terms. Much is going to happen. Much is going to change. Right now, though, the Democrats are seeing remarkably encouraging polls in half a dozen toss up Senate races for this fall. So that's happening in Arizona and Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Those are states that voted for Joe Biden in 2020. But we're also seeing competitive races with close polls persisting in Ohio and North Carolina, where Trump won twice. By the time we get into the baseball playoffs and the fall campaign season, it's possible that all of this Mar-a-Lago search and all of these other cases will keep grinding on, but also possible that people will get bored with all that and focus on gas prices, grocery prices. Republicans are gearing up to make immigration a big focus again this fall. We still expect the House will go Republican in November, if only because of gerrymandering. But the Senate is quite a different story. There are individual candidates there who might matter more than party identity. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said as much this week, and that may have had mostly the purpose of sending a signal to Republican funders to get busy writing checks. SIMON: Ron, what lessons do you take from history as you look at all this? ELVING: We tend to look at the big midterm elections of the past, ones that really changed the landscape - 1994, 2010 - elections where Republicans captured the House. And they both happened right after a new Democratic president had taken office. But right now the polls suggest something much more modest may take place, something more like 1982, when Republican Ronald Reagan lost 26 seats in the House but held his own in the Senate. That, of course, raises again the cloud of election denialism, close races, rejecting the results, alleging some sort of nonexistent uncertainty - that kind of disruption now seems increasingly likely and has the potential to get ugly. SIMON: Ron Elving, thanks so much. ELVING: Thank you, Scott. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "A new NPR/Ipsos poll shows that big numbers of Americans believe incorrectly that \"most\" of the fentanyl entering the U.S. is smuggled by migrants. It's not the only misleading claim getting traction.  JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: A new NPR/Ipsos poll shows that misleading and false claims about immigration are widespread, and their reach may be growing. Our poll finds that large numbers of Americans hold a range of misconceptions about immigrants, from how likely they are to use public benefits to their role in smuggling illegal drugs into the U.S. NPR's Joel Rose reports. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Let's start with a quiz. True or false? Most of the opioid fentanyl that's entering the U.S. is smuggled in by unauthorized migrants crossing the border illegally. That's one of the questions we asked in this poll because fentanyl seizures are up, and it's become a big election-year talking point for Republicans. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RON DESANTIS: You have people coming across illegally from countries all over the world. And so what has that gotten us? We now, in this country, have the leading cause of death for people 18 to 45 as fentanyl overdose. ROSE: Notice how Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida jumps quickly from the record number of migrant arrests at the southern border to fentanyl overdose deaths. But experts say that's not an accurate picture. VICTOR M MANJARREZ: My name is Victor M. Manjarrez Jr. I am the director for the Center for Law and Human Behavior at the University of Texas, El Paso. ROSE: Victor Manjarrez served in the Border Patrol for more than 20 years, retiring as the sector chief in Tucson. Manjarrez says it's true that fentanyl is crossing the border - a lot of fentanyl - but it's not coming over on the backs of migrants, who are often turning themselves in to seek asylum. MANJARREZ: The probability they're going to carry some kind of illicit narcotic is probably close to zero. ROSE: Manjarrez says some fentanyl is brought in by cartels who are using migrants as a distraction, but the vast majority is smuggled through official ports of entry, hidden in cars and tractor-trailers. MANJARREZ: When you look at the chaos and clutter that occurs at a port of entry, just with the legitimate traffic - you know, trucks and personal vehicles - and so if you're looking at a couple of pounds of fentanyl hidden in that chaos - you know, if you're the bad guy, you kind of like your odds. ROSE: So the correct answer to our question is false. Most of the fentanyl entering the country is not smuggled in by migrants. But if you got it wrong, you're in good company. In our poll, 6 out of 10 Republicans did, too. The latest NPR/Ipsos poll shows that misleading and false claims about immigration are making deep inroads with the American public, and not just about fentanyl. More than half of Republicans say - incorrectly - that immigrants are more likely to use public benefits than the native-born population, even though many immigrants don't actually qualify for most federal benefits. And large numbers of poll respondents say immigrants are more likely to commit crimes, even though studies have shown repeatedly that they're not. SOPHIA JORDAN WALLACE: Once it gets out there, it's hard to correct, which means we have to deal with the consequences. ROSE: Sophia Jordan Wallace teaches political science at the University of Washington, where she studied false and misleading claims about immigration. WALLACE: There's a pretty long history of using different stereotypes and different negative framing of immigrants that have sometimes distorted facts intentionally. ROSE: Wallace says there's a tradition in American politics of blaming immigrants for real problems the country is facing as a way to mobilize voters. WALLACE: Regardless of whether there actually is an empirical connection between immigration and immigrants and those problems. ROSE: Our poll suggests that the reach of some false and misleading claims may be growing. Four years ago, we asked if, quote, \"immigrants are more likely to commit crimes or be incarcerated than the U.S.-born population.\" Back then, more than 60% of respondents correctly identified that statement as false. But when we asked again this year, less than half got it right. Joel Rose, NPR News, Washington. (SOUNDBITE OF MIRAA MAY SONG, \"INTERNET TROLLS\") Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "An ex-Trump Organization executive is set to plead guilty to tax fraud. A poll examines how Americans see things at the southern border. The FDA's controversial strategy for evaluating COVID boosters.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: A longtime executive at the Trump Organization is expected to plead guilty to tax fraud in Manhattan criminal court today. LEILA FADEL, HOST: That would make Allen Weisselberg the latest Trump ally to be convicted at trial or plead guilty to a felony. He worked for Donald Trump long before he ran for president. INSKEEP: NPR's Andrea Bernstein is here to explain. Good morning. ANDREA BERNSTEIN, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: What has Weisselberg done for Trump over the years? BERNSTEIN: So Allen Weisselberg is the closest any human being can come to being the physical embodiment of Trump's business. He's worked for the Trumps since the 1970s, when Donald Trump's father, Fred, was renting apartments in Brooklyn. Weisselberg really knows the ins and outs of the company, better than anyone excepting maybe Donald Trump. And as of today, if the plea deal is accepted, Weisselberg will be the highest-level Trump Organization official to admit to a felony. INSKEEP: Well, I'm just thinking about this. When you admit to a felony, you also have to state in court exactly what you did. What is he expected to say? BERNSTEIN: So we don't know exactly until the hearing concludes. But Weisselberg was charged with 15 felonies for carrying out a more than 15-year scheme to cheat taxpayers by taking part of his salary through untaxed benefits, like a luxury apartment, private school tuition for his grandchildren and Mercedes-Benzes for him and his wife. The prosecutors say he hid nearly $2 million of income in this way. The crimes he was charged with include fraud, conspiracy and grand larceny. INSKEEP: And why is he admitting to all of this now? BERNSTEIN: So last week, the judge in the case denied Weisselberg and the Trump Organization's motions to dismiss the case. That's often a time when these plea deals happen. INSKEEP: Well, what are the - what is known about the terms? Like, what is he getting in return in terms of a reduced sentence or whatever else? BERNSTEIN: So in this case, it looks like Weisselberg, who's in his 70s, will say he committed crimes and agree to a jail sentence of just months. Weisselberg may cooperate with prosecutors in some way, but it won't be certain exactly how that will work until the judge OKs the deal. What we very much know is that Weisselberg has worked hard not to do anything that could put him at odds with Donald Trump. INSKEEP: Although if he is needing to cooperate as part of a deal, that means aiming presumably at his boss. Investigators tend to go up the chain rather than down the chain. So what kind of cooperation could he potentially provide? BERNSTEIN: Well, it's complicated, but he can testify at a potential trial of Donald Trump's company. As of now, because Donald Trump's business is under criminal indictment in the same scheme and is not pleading guilty, there's a trial set for October 24, and under New York law, if top executives have committed crimes, that's imputed to the corporation. So if Weisselberg pleads guilty, his testimony could help make a case against Trump's company. But that might not necessarily implicate Donald Trump. INSKEEP: How does this case fit in with the wider docket of former Trump employees? BERNSTEIN: Yeah, Weisselberg isn't even the first top Trump executive to be - plead guilty to felonies. There was, for example, Michael Cohen, the former counsel and VP there. There was Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, who was convicted of tax fraud, money laundering and conspiracy against the United States. Political adviser Roger Stone convicted of lying to Congress. Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn convicted of the - lying to the FBI. And just this summer, adviser Steve Bannon convicted of contempt of Congress. Manafort, Stone and Flynn were pardoned by Trump. But all these aides were convicted of felonies. Weisselberg is just the latest. And though Trump is under investigation, he said he's done nothing wrong, and he says the investigations are politically motivated, quote, \"witch hunts.\" INSKEEP: NPR's Andrea Bernstein. Thanks. BERNSTEIN: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: A new survey illuminates a political reality as the fall elections approach. FADEL: That survey is a new NPR/Ipsos poll. It finds most people endorse negative views of immigration. Many say they agree with descriptions of immigrants that are false or misleading, and support for immigrants overall has declined. INSKEEP: NPR's Joel Rose has been looking at the findings. Joel, good morning. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: What do you see in that survey? ROSE: Well, one of the things that really stands out is that about half of Americans say the U.S. is experiencing an invasion at the southern border. INSKEEP: Completely or somewhat, they agree with the idea of invasion. I guess we should just pause to say, by the dictionary definition, that's not true. An invasion would be moving in with an armed force. That is obviously not happening. But you're saying that most Americans, when asked in this survey, say that they think it's really true or kind of true that there's an invasion. ROSE: Exactly, Steve. Yeah. Half of Americans say it is either completely or somewhat true that the U.S. is experiencing an invasion. And it's driven largely by Republicans. Three out of four agreed with that framing, including Michael Cisternino. He's a poll respondent from Nevada. MICHAEL CISTERNINO: The people that are coming in from different countries, I think many of them are being let in haphazardly. We are not actually screening enough people to make it safe for the rest of the country. ROSE: But not everyone agrees that invasion is the right way to describe what's happening at the border. Here's Neel-Gopal Sharma. He's a poll respondent and a Democrat from North Carolina. NEEL-GOPAL SHARMA: A lot of immigrants are coming here for safety, and a lot of them are coming here for a chance, I guess. Unfortunately, I feel like the rhetoric has just been that, like, there is this large, like, xenophobic kind of talk that's being thrown around. ROSE: I should say that Democrats and immigrant advocates say this invasion rhetoric is way off base because nearly all border crossers are unarmed. Most are fleeing from violence and poverty in their home countries. And advocates say this rhetoric is potentially dangerous because it could make immigrants a target for violence. INSKEEP: What else is in this survey and people's beliefs that you could describe as false or misleading? ROSE: Well, we found that large numbers of Americans hold, you know, a wide variety of misconceptions about immigrants - greatly exaggerating their role in smuggling illegal drugs into the U.S., for example, also how likely immigrants are to use public benefits or to commit crimes. And we found that Republicans are more likely to hold these negative views of immigrants. Mallory Newall is a vice president at Ipsos, which conducted this poll. INSKEEP: These statements of false or misleading or incomplete information are definitely gaining more traction among Republicans. ROSE: Let's take the illegal drug fentanyl as an example. It's true that overdose deaths from fentanyl are up and that a lot of fentanyl is smuggled across the southern border. But the vast majority of that fentanyl is smuggled through official ports of entry. It's not brought in by migrants who are arrested crossing the border between those ports, who often are just turning themselves in to seek asylum. However, 6 out of 10 Republicans in our poll said incorrectly that, quote, \"most of the fentanyl entering the U.S. is smuggled in by migrants.\" INSKEEP: So the difference between anecdotal information and statistical information there. Given all of these misconceptions, what has happened to the overall view of immigration? ROSE: Well, this is one of the most striking things in the poll for me. When we polled Americans on immigration back in 2018, 3 out of 4 respondents agreed that, quote, \"immigrants are an important part of our American identity.\" Today, that number has fallen sharply down to just 56%. INSKEEP: Joel, thanks so much. ROSE: You're welcome, Steve. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Joel Rose. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: Is the Food and Drug Administration using the right strategy to evaluate the next generation of COVID-19 boosters? FADEL: That's a question that's stirring debate as the agency works to make new, improved boosters available in September. INSKEEP: NPR health correspondent Rob Stein is covering this. Rob, good morning. ROB STEIN, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: Where do things stand with the next round of boosters? STEIN: The Biden administration is rushing to get new vaccines ready for a big new booster campaign in September. INSKEEP: Right. STEIN: And that's because, you know, even though it kind of may feel like the pandemic is essentially over, almost 500 people are still dying every day, almost five times the number who die from motor vehicle crashes. INSKEEP: Wow. STEIN: And another surge could very well hit the U.S. hard again this winter, when the immunity people have gotten from vaccines and infections will have faded, you know, even more. But instead of authorizing the first boosters the vaccine companies produced, boosters that target the original strain of the omicron variant, like the U.K. just did, the FDA wants to go with boosters that target the omicron subvariants that are now dominating. The hope is they'll provide stronger, longer-lasting protection. And that's why the FDA decided to use an entirely new strategy to evaluate them. INSKEEP: Oh, but this must be like turning an ocean liner. It is challenging to change your testing regimen because it takes so many months. So what's the new strategy? STEIN: Right. Right, exactly. Instead of requiring the companies to test the new boosters on people, the FDA, for the first time, is only requiring the vaccine-makers to test boosters in mice initially and plans to make a decision based on the results of those mouse tests, not people, along with data from people the companies collected about their first stab at boosters targeting the omicron variant. INSKEEP: How do independent experts or the companies themselves respond to this? STEIN: It's, you know - this is a big switch for the COVID vaccines. And the reaction has been mixed. You know, some experts say, look; billions of people have gotten the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. We know they're safe, and we know enough about how vaccines work to start handling COVID vaccines more like the flu vaccines. Here's Deepta Bhattacharya. He's an immunobiologist at the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Tucson. DEEPTA BHATTACHARYA: We're going to use all of these data that we've learned through not only this vaccine but decades of viral immunology to say the way to be nimble is that we're going to do those animal studies, we'll roll the vaccines out to the people who are at the highest risk anyway, and then we'll slowly start to make it available to the people who are at lower risk. We're really not going out too far out on a limb here. STEIN: But, you know, Steve, not everyone agrees with this perspective. INSKEEP: Well, what are the concerns of people who think we are going out on a limb? STEIN: The big concern is, you know, mice aren't people. The boosters may not work as well for people as they look like they work in the mice. And if regulators are going to make people wait longer for new boosters, it's crucial to get good evidence that they really do work better. Here's Dr. Paul Offit. He's a vaccine expert at the University of Pennsylvania who advises the FDA. PAUL OFFIT: We need to make sure that we have solid immunogenicity data in people to show that you have a dramatically greater neutralizing antibody response. I think anything short of that is not acceptable. You can't assume that what happens in mice is also true in man. STEIN: Some also worry this approach may make people even more skeptical about getting boosted. But the companies are expected to submit their data to the FDA by the end of the month, and the administration hopes to make millions of doses of the new boosters available in September.

            "article_content": "While the size of the economy shrank, the nation is still creating jobs at a surprising rate. Also, hedge fund managers end up ahead after negotiations on the Democrats' climate change bill.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Something unusual going on in the U.S. economy - inflation hit a 41-year high. The output of goods and services is shrinking. But employers keep adding jobs - more than half a million last month. And wages increased 5.2% compared to a year earlier. We now turn to NPR senior editor and correspondent Ron Elving. Ron, thanks so much for being with us. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott. SIMON: So was President Biden right last week when he said we're not in a recession? ELVING: These numbers certainly say he was right. This was double what we were expecting. So the job market is signaling anything but a recession. Still, we did have those weak numbers on growth. So the debate goes on. The official judgment comes from the National Bureau of Economic Researchers, and they are still pondering. Now, it might come down to what you mean by recession. Some people use that term when they mean they're facing challenges. That may mean high gas prices, bigger bills for rent and groceries. That's the economy for them. And they don't care what you call it. The point is that it hurts. It hurts enough that many people can't make it on one paycheck. So part of that hiring binge we've seen this year is people getting a second job. Now, that said, a jobless rate of 3.5% is astonishingly low, and the wage increase is welcome. But both will raise labor costs for businesses, which will raise prices that will fuel more inflation. The Federal Reserve, while it loves full employment, also has to hold down inflation. So look for another big move upward in interest rates next month. And when that happens, you can expect to hear more talk about a coming recession. SIMON: Full weak state primaries - voters in Kansas decisively defeated a referendum that would have significantly restricted abortion in that state. How do you read the vote there? ELVING: Above all, it proved the abortion issue can boost turnout, even in states that are historically conservative and Republican. The turnout in Kansas last week was nearly double what it was in the last comparable primary. Lots of unaffiliated voters showed up to vote on this anti-abortion measure alone, and they turned thumbs down on it. Now, late yesterday, the Indiana state legislature passed new tough restrictions on abortion, although not without some exceptions. They did that in the legislature, not by referendum. And we can expect to see more legislatures doing that going forward. SIMON: Meanwhile, in Arizona, four Trump-endorsed candidates won their races for statewide office. Was this unexpected? ELVING: Yes, especially perhaps Senate candidate Blake Masters, who is a venture capitalist with an outspoken streak who's about to get a lot more attention. He's an incendiary figure, much like Trump. One of his ads shows him with a gun he says isn't for hunting but for, quote, \"killing people.\" In the governor's race, a former new - TV newscaster named Kari Lake edged out a more establishment candidate. Lake said she would not have certified Biden's 2020 victory in Arizona, and some of the immigration coming from the South is an invasion. And the party's nominees for attorney general and secretary of state are also Trump-backed election deniers. So the question becomes whether these candidates are too Trumpian to win in a state that, after all, Trump lost in 2020. SIMON: Let me ask you about Michigan. Were Democrats a little too clever for their own good when they supported a Trump-endorsed candidate over a moderate in the Republican primary? ELVING: The moderate Republican was first-termer Peter Meijer, who voted for Trump's impeachment in 2021. His opponent, John Gibbs, had very little campaign of his own, but the Democrats paid for TV ads, saying he was too close to Trump. Of course, in the Republican primary, that gave him a boost. That was the idea. So the Democrats hope he'll be easier to beat than Meijer. But these kinds of things have a way of taking a funny bounce, Scott. And beyond that, it's hard to pose yourself as the high-minded defenders of democracy when you pull this kind of stunt. SIMON: A jury in Austin, Texas, found - I'm not going to call Alex Jones a broadcaster - conspiracy theorist - fined him for $45.2 million in damages for lying about Sandy Hook and the massacre there. What do you see in that verdict? ELVING: This is a Texas jury trying to mete out justice in an egregious case after a slam dunk of a trial. They first found Jones should pay 4 million in compensatory damages, but Jones may escape that by declaring bankruptcy. So the next phase is penalty damages - ten times greater - but possibly subject to a cap under Texas law. We should note this trial also exposed Jones to charges of perjury, which is a criminal offense, and there are suits pending against him in other states. So lots more to come for Mr. Jones. SIMON: Ron Elving, thank you. ELVING: Thank you, Scott. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "President Biden started his presidency only selectively referring to his predecessor as \"the former guy.\" But he's talking about Donald Trump frequently in recent weeks and months.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Biden started his presidency only selectively referring to his predecessor as \"the former guy.\" But he's talking about Donald Trump frequently in recent weeks and months. In the early part of the Biden administration, there was an unwritten rule: Don't talk about the former guy. But with the midterms around the corner, Donald Trump seems to be back on the tip of President Biden's tongue. Biden called him \"the great MAGA King\" in May. In early July he said Trump dismissed and ignored \"the forgotten people he promised to help.\" After the most recent Jan. 6 committee hearing, Biden went after Trump by name. \"The police were heroes that day,\" Biden said in a virtual appearance with a law enforcement group. \"Donald Trump lacked the courage to act.\" This Trump bump comes as the former president is endorsing candidates running in this year's midterm elections and as he loudly hints he'd like to be on the ballot again himself in 2024. \"The reemergence of the former guy is that he reemerges,\" said John Anzalone, Biden's pollster. Trump is \"the one that is becoming more visible and more contentious.\" Not only is Trump out on the campaign trail, giving speeches and making attention-grabbing endorsements, but the House Select Committee on January 6th has directed significant attention back to the waning days of Trump's presidency. Anzalone says calling out Trump is appropriately part of President Biden's midterm message. \"Joe Biden is the leader of the Democratic Party and Donald Trump is the leader of the Republican Party,\" Anzalone said, getting animated. \"For the leader of the Democratic Party to tell Americans what he is for and what the leader of the Republican Party is against is absolutely normal and expected.\" With the recent passage of numerous bipartisan bills and a deal among Democrats on the Inflation Reduction Act, Democrats expect to have an affirmative \"look what we've done\" message to run on this fall, in the face of economic headwinds. But it doesn't mean they can or should ignore the elephant in the room, says Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson. \"Typically, losing presidents ride off into the sunset with dignity,\" said Ferguson. Or after eight years of service, they quietly move on to their post-presidency. There is a long history of presidents facing down a tough midterm and running against their predecessors' policies or legacies. But this time is different, because Trump isn't in the rearview mirror. \"President Biden is not running against the former guy, he is setting up a midterm contrast against the current and most likely future leader of the Republican Party,\" Ferguson said. Late last month, Trump hinted he would be running for president again, \"a lot sooner than people think,\" while speaking to a convention in Washington, D.C. Former President Donald Trump acknowledges the crowd after speaking during the America First Agenda Summit on July 26 in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former President Donald Trump acknowledges the crowd after speaking during the America First Agenda Summit on July 26 in Washington, D.C. After that event, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he asked Trump not to declare his 2024 candidacy until after the midterms, the implication being that it would be better for Republicans if the midterms were about inflation, immigration, crime and not the polarizing former president. Senior Democratic strategist Karen Finney says that part of what Biden is trying to do by talking about Trump and Trumpism is prevent Republicans from keeping the former president at arm's length. \"You know it's not just about Trump,\" she said. \"Look at how many candidates in this Republican primary season, whether they got Trump's approval or not, were vying for it.\" And if there's one thing almost everyone can agree, it's that \"nothing motivates voters, both Democrats and Republicans, like Donald Trump,\" said former Trump campaign consultant David Urban. Faiz Shakir, a top political adviser to Bernie Sanders, used almost exactly the same words to describe Trump's effect on voters. \"Nothing propels the Biden coalition, Democratic voters and the people who voted for him \u2014 nothing propels them more than Trump,\" he said. Shakir says parts of the Democratic base are feeling lethargic and uninspired, frustrated that Biden and Democrats haven't made more progress. But then along comes Trump with all his teasing about a 2024 run. Shakir calls it a \"gift\" for Biden and Democrats. \"The challenge for Biden has been that he hasn't had a foil,\" said Shakir, referring to Biden's low approval rating, which reflects some of that Democratic lethargy. \"You have a stance on Biden one way or another. But what he's trying to make clear is, no, there's a choice. There's a directional choice.\" David Urban points to recent polls that show many Democrats want someone other than Biden to run in 2024. Still, he says in a head-to-head matchup with Trump, the same polls still show Biden ahead. \"And so I think [Biden] kind of likes to kind of thump his chest about that a bit,\" said Urban. Urban says talking more about Trump gives Biden relevance. \"When people are looking at turning the page and moving on to a new candidate, new future, somebody younger, brighter, shinier, it allows him to say, 'Yeah I'm the guy that beat the guy,'\" said Urban. In a recent interview, Biden was asked about a possible rematch with Trump in 2024. Biden said he wasn't predicting it, but he also \"would not be disappointed.\"",

In Republican primary races this year, few issues have come up more in TV ads than immigration. And one word in particular stands out: invasion. A few years ago, that word was confined to the fringes of the immigration debate. Most candidates would avoid it. In this election cycle, it's moved squarely into the mainstream. \"We're gonna end this invasion,\" Blake Masters, a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Arizona, says in a campaign ad. The word has also appeared in ads for Gov. Brian Kemp in Georgia, Sen. Rick Scott in Florida, and Kari Lake, who's locked in a close race in the Republican primary for governor in Arizona. \"Before these ideas might have been seen as outliers. But now, it is really troubling,\" said Vanessa C\u00e1rdenas, the deputy director of America's Voice, an immigrant advocacy group that's been tracking political ads. It's found dozens of ads that use the word invasion by Republicans campaigning all over the country. \"This type of rhetoric, it's meant to agitate people for political reasons,\" C\u00e1rdenas said, \"because it makes people feel anger and hate.\" It's been three years since a white gunman opened fire at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, killing 23 people, most of them Latino. The suspect was motivated by what he called a \"Hispanic invasion\" of people coming to the U.S. illegally. Since then, the number of migrant apprehensions at the southern U.S. border has climbed to new records \u2014 while the political rhetoric around immigration has gotten more extreme. The word invasion has a long history in white nationalist circles. For years, it was used widely by supporters of the \"replacement theory\" \u2014 the false conspiracy theory that says Jews or elites are deliberately replacing white Americans with immigrants and people of color. Until recently, you rarely heard it from Republican officeholders or candidates. So what changed? For one thing, former President Trump, who used the word invasion a lot. \"Trump kind of exposed the kinds of rhetoric that resonated with the Republicans,\" said John Thomas, a Republican strategist based in California. Thomas is working with several candidates for state office in Texas who've used \"invasion\" in their messaging this election cycle. That's partly because of Trump's example, he says. But for Thomas, the bigger issue is what's happening at the southern border, where the number of migrant apprehensions is on pace to exceed 2 million this year \u2014 breaking the record set just last year. \"The word invasion presses the hot buttons of Republican voters as they feel that it's a much bigger deal than it was before,\" Thomas said. \"The rhetoric is increasing its intensity to match.\" \"I've never ever seen what we're seeing today,\" said Brad Coe, the longtime sheriff of Kinney County, Texas, at a press conference last month. Coe said his deputies are overwhelmed trying to catch unauthorized migrants crossing through ranches and small towns. \"This is unprecedented in Kinney County,\" he said. \"Our numbers are gonna triple. We cannot sustain this type of invasion.\" Immigration hardliners argue that it's fair to use the word invasion even if the migrants crossing the border don't look like a traditional military force, in part because their sheer numbers have distracted law enforcement officers from responding to other threats. But immigrant advocates say the invasion narrative is fundamentally misleading. Almost half of all migrants apprehended at the southern border are quickly expelled back to Mexico. Nearly all are unarmed. Many are fleeing poverty and violence and autocratic governments all over the hemisphere, and turning themselves in to the Border Patrol in hopes of getting asylum or other protections in the U.S. \"They're mothers and children and fathers, people who are basically doing what any one of us would do if we were in their shoes,\" said Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat who represents El Paso in Congress. What worries Escobar is that this invasion rhetoric will inspire another tragedy like the mass shooting in the El Paso Walmart \u2014 or the shooting earlier this year in Buffalo, where the man suspected of killing 10 Black people was also motivated by the replacement theory. \"I am very, very concerned for communities like mine that we will see more acts of violence committed against immigrants, against Latinos, because of this rhetoric,\" Escobar said on a call with reporters last month. Advocates say this increasingly extreme language is putting a target on the backs of immigrants \u2014 one that will still be there when the midterm elections have come and gone.",

            "article_content": "The race for governor between incumbent Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and Democrat Beto O'Rourke is getting more competitive as Abbott tries to pull his base closer by laying into immigration.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Recent polls show the race between Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott and Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke is closer than ever before. Both candidates are ramping up their messaging, and Abbott is turning to immigration. The Texas Newsroom's Sergio Mart\u00ednez-Beltr\u00e1n has the story. SERGIO MART\u00cdNEZ-BELTR\u00c1N, BYLINE: Throughout his tenure, Governor Greg Abbott has helped grow the economy and has protected gun rights. Now running for his third term, Abbott has taken unprecedented steps to curb unauthorized migration into Texas. For example, he's called for Texas state troopers to perform additional commercial vehicle inspections along the Texas-Mexico border. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GREG ABBOTT: In Texas, we, once again, are going to try to step up and play a role by the state to address this catastrophe that President Biden is responsible for. MART\u00cdNEZ-BELTR\u00c1N: That was Abbott speaking after 53 migrants died in a sweltering truck found in San Antonio last month. In April, he implemented a similar policy of inspecting commercial trucks crossing from Mexico. That cost the state millions of dollars and ended up clogging the international crossings for days before Abbott called the initiative off. Many, however, have said Abbott is just trying to score political points. AILEEN TEAGUE: What goes on at the border is heavily exaggerated. MART\u00cdNEZ-BELTR\u00c1N: This is Aileen Teague, an assistant professor of international affairs at Texas A&M University. TEAGUE: It's political theater. MART\u00cdNEZ-BELTR\u00c1N: Teague says Abbott's policies may not be effective at all. She says history has shown that the over-policing at the border doesn't prevent migrants from crossing. TEAGUE: There are so many historical examples on this. For example, between 1994 and 2000, right after the passage of NAFTA, the United States doubled the size of its border patrol. And at the same time, illegal immigration between Mexico and the United States reached its apex. MART\u00cdNEZ-BELTR\u00c1N: To put it in context, in June, the number of apprehensions at the border was much lower than the month before, but still very high compared to past years. In an election year, Abbott seems to know what could work for him and his supporters. More than half of Republican voters in Texas consider immigration or border security the No. 1 issue facing the state. That's according to the Texas Politics Project. Joshua Blank is the group's research director. JOSHUA BLANK: By keeping attention on immigration and border security, you have a campaign issue that puts the Democrats on the defensive but also highlight an issue that really activates and speaks to your base voters. MART\u00cdNEZ-BELTR\u00c1N: Earlier this month, Abbott signed an executive order authorizing the Texas National Guard and the Department of Public Safety to apprehend migrants and return them to the ports of entry. Still, some hardline Republicans have criticized Abbott for stopping short of invoking a, quote, \"invasion under the U.S. Constitution.\" That's the same language used by a white man in 2019 before killing 23 people, most of them Hispanic, in El Paso. It's important to note that the enforcement of immigration laws is the responsibility of the federal government. Abbott is doing anything he can to win reelection against arguably the most well-known Democrat in Texas. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BETO O'ROURKE: Very few generations are afforded the opportunity to fight for the state of Texas when everything - and I mean everything - that we care about is on the line. MART\u00cdNEZ-BELTR\u00c1N: On immigration, guns, abortion and just about every other issue, Beto O'Rourke and Abbott have polar opposite views. And O'Rourke is trying to get the votes of Republicans and independents who are turned off by Abbott's rhetoric. O'Rourke is seeing some gains. The latest statewide polls show him trailing Abbott by just five points. O'Rourke also outraised Abbott by $4 million in the last fundraising period. However, Abbott has more money than O'Rourke. Now, Abbott is not the first Republican governor nor the last to push for ultraconservative immigration policies. In 1994, California passed a ballot proposal that targeted people who were undocumented, preventing them from using public services, including schools. Former Governor Pete Wilson was the face of the proposal. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PETE WILSON: And I'm working to deny state services to illegal immigrants. Enough is enough. MART\u00cdNEZ-BELTR\u00c1N: In 2010, former Arizona Governor Jan Brewer signed a Senate bill that required state law enforcement agents to verify the immigration status of all arrested individuals. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JAN BREWER: Though many people disagree, I firmly believe it represents what's best for Arizona. MART\u00cdNEZ-BELTR\u00c1N: But a look at Wilson and Brewer's legacy might give Abbott an idea of what could happen to him in the long run. Wilson tried to run for president, and his campaign lasted just one month. Meanwhile, since she left office, Brewer has not been a major player in Republican politics.

            "article_content": "Democratic groups are running ads designed to boost more extreme or more pro-Trump candidates in hopes of getting a Republican nominee who \u2014 in theory \u2014 would be easier to beat in the primaries.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: There's an unusual trend in political ads in this year's primary season. Democratic groups are running ads in hopes of boosting far-right candidates. The goal, as the theory goes, is to wind up with a Republican nominee who would be easier to beat come November. The latest such case is in a congressional primary in West Michigan. NPR's Don Gonyea reports. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: First-term GOP Congressman Peter Meijer comes from a well-known Michigan family with deep ties to the community. He has a business background and military experience, serving in Iraq. But there's also this on his resume. He is one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach President Donald Trump in January of 2021. Because of that vote, he has a primary challenger - former Trump administration official John Gibbs. Gibbs has little name recognition, but suddenly he is the subject of an ad on TV being funded by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: John Gibbs is too conservative for West Michigan. Handpicked by Trump to run for Congress, Gibbs called Trump the greatest president. GONYEA: But for an ad that purports to be an attack, its tone is pretty mild - no ominous music or scary sound effects. The announcer is downright pleasant. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Gibbs has promised to push that same conservative agenda in Congress - a hard line against immigrants at the border and so-called patriotic education. GONYEA: Asked about the ad, the DCCC had no comment. Political analysts say the real purpose is to build up Gibbs - to say things Trump supporters want to hear and to give this challenger a boost in the primary over the more moderate Meijer. The Michigan race is a toss-up congressional district, but ads like these, paid for by Democratic groups, have been seen around the country this year in Pennsylvania, Maryland, California and elsewhere, raising the profile of hard-core pro-Trump candidates. Political scientist Burwood Yost is at Franklin and Marshall College. BERWOOD YOST: That's the bet they're making - that you can lift up a candidate who would be appealing to primary voters but would be too extreme for general election voters, and that makes a Democrat's path to election easier. GONYEA: Congressman Meijer's campaign has called out such tactics as playing political games. One prominent Republican, Illinois Congressman Adam Kinzinger, who also voted to impeach Trump and who's a member of the January 6 committee, is very critical of such attacks. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"NEW DAY\") ADAM KINZINGER: I think it's disgusting. GONYEA: And he said on CNN to look for this to backfire in some races. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"NEW DAY\") KINZINGER: Don't come to me after having spent money supporting an election denier in a primary, and then come to me and say, where are all the good Republicans? GONYEA: Michigan's primary is scheduled for next Tuesday. Don Gonyea, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "NPR's Scott Simon asks political scientist Ruy Teixeira about growing support for Republicans by Hispanics and other minority voters. Texiera co-wrote 2002's \"The Emerging Democratic Majority.\"  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Ruy Teixeira co-wrote an influential book with John Judis 20 years ago called \"The Emerging Democratic Majority.\" It seemed to presage Barack Obama's election as president in 2008 and argued that demographic changes in America and the growth of Hispanic voters and other groups would make Democrats the majority in America in the 21st century. Now he's not so sure. In a series of interviews and posts, Mr. Teixeira has told Democrats that more voters of color - and we'll ask him how he feels about that phrase - are supporting Republicans. Ruy Teixeira joins us now. Thanks so much for being with us. RUY TEIXEIRA: Glad to be here. SIMON: What do you see happening? TEIXEIRA: Well, what I see happening - you mentioned my book with John Judis. We stipulated in that book that you needed a core level of white working-class support, since white noncollege voters are still such a large share of the population. Now, as it turned out, over time, we did see white working-class voters continue to move away from the Democrats. In some ways, Obama's 2008 election was a high point. Ever since then, they've been bleeding white working-class voters. That's really why Trump got elected. But what's interesting and very concerning, I would think, to Democrats - they tended to write off losing white working-class voters as kind of like, what can you do? You know, they're a declining population. They don't like the multicultural, multiracial America. They're all a bunch of racists and xenophobes. But I think what's underscored the potential overall class problem for the Democrats is the movement of nonwhite working-class voters away from the Democrats in recent period of time, particularly Hispanic working-class voters. And they gained, in terms of their advantage, among white college educated voters. So that's quite a shift. SIMON: Shifting, I'm sure you've heard the phrase, from the factory floor to the faculty lounge. TEIXEIRA: I have. Yes, indeed. SIMON: You thought the recent recall of school board members and the district attorney in San Francisco were especially telling. TEIXEIRA: Because I think it helped underscore for us the ultra-progressive wing of the Democratic Party privileging criminal justice reform over public safety. People want to be safe from crime, and that includes a lot of nonwhite voters. It is not a matter for them of choosing between the two, but rather above all, you've got to keep our community safe. We saw that in San Francisco, where the Asian population in particular was hugely important in these events. SIMON: We've heard some Democrats say that crime is a trumped-up issue - and that pun is intended - meant to discredit Democratic leadership in New York, Chicago, San Francisco. TEIXEIRA: Well, that's an example of something I call the Fox News fallacy, which is the idea that if something is reported on and pushed by the conservatives at Fox News, it must be essentially sort of a made-up story. But I think what we found is Democrats are very much in the hole, in terms of the view of voters, on who can best handle crime. They don't see the Democrats calling for putting violent criminals in jail; though they're willing to talk about, you know, let's get guns off the street and so on. But they're balking on what I would call the sweet spot of a progressive position on crime, which should be tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime. That was Tony Blair's famous phrase. SIMON: I was about to point that out, yeah. TEIXEIRA: And I think Democrats have been reluctant to do that on the theory that somehow that's giving in to racial animus and that - you know, just sort of being on the side of the reactionaries. But I'll tell you something. You know who is really hurt the most by the surge in crime? - poor Black people, poor Latino people, poor Asian people. SIMON: How do you feel about that phrase, voters of color? TEIXEIRA: Look, I mean, voters of color don't talk about voters of color. Who the hell lives in communities of color? The people I know live in neighborhoods, right? So there's this whole, you know, sort of rhetorical lexicon that the left of the Democratic Party has become obsessed with and insists on using, which basically just alienates normie voters, including normie nonwhite voters. I mean, we have people in and around the Democratic Party talking about how all white people have white privilege and how this is a white supremacist society and so on. And I just don't think this is the way people think about the world, including, you know, normie nonwhite voters. SIMON: You've heard Democrats say that inflation certainly is a concern, but look how low the unemployment rate is. TEIXEIRA: It is very low. On the other hand, inflation's very high. And the way that nets out for most people - that equation hasn't worked for them. If you look at the polling data, among the most negative groups about the economy in this country and about how the Biden administration has handled the economy are Hispanic voters. SIMON: How do you feel about the confidence some Democrats seem to have that widespread support, demonstrable support for abortion rights and gun control will win votes in the next few elections? TEIXEIRA: I think it's certainly possible that at the margin, these issues will help them in certain more educated suburban constituencies. I think, you know, some of these voters were thinking about sitting out the 2022 election or perhaps were otherwise, you know, sort of on the fence. Maybe this pushes some of them. But if we're getting back to our problems and the issues of working-class voters, it's not at all clear that an emphasis on abortion and gun control is really the magic potion that's going to move them over to the Democratic side, despite the fact they support moderate abortion rights. They support moderate gun control. You know, they think January 6 was a bad thing. But, you know, the salience level is just really different for these voters. Their concerns are much more mundane, much more close to the Earth. SIMON: But as someone who's given advice, what do you think Democrats should do? TEIXEIRA: I'm not a political consultant, but I do have views on what the Democrats would be better off doing. I think they should move to the center on a variety of these sociocultural issues and turning crime, immigration. I think they should stop putting so much emphasis on race essentialism and gender ideology. They should speak more in terms of the country as a whole, the working-class as a whole, working people as a whole, that they're trying to lift up everybody and that, you know, America is fundamentally a great country. We're patriotic. We think we have tremendous potential. We don't think it's a racist country. We think we made tremendous progress, and we need to make much more. And I think that'll go some way toward rebranding the Democrats as being the party that's on the side of sort of ordinary working people. SIMON: Political scientist Ruy Teixeira. Thank you so much for being with us. TEIXEIRA: Sure. (SOUNDBITE OF BROKEN SOCIAL SCENE'S \"PACIFIC THEME\") Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Walker/The Boston Globe via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A Guatemalan immigrant worker spreads lime while preparing fresh bedding for the cows at Stein Family Farms in Caledonia, N.Y on Mar. 8, 2017. Senate Republicans and Democrats are inching closer to a deal on an immigration bill that farmers say if passed could help reduce food prices in part by helping them hire more workers. This measure, known as the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, is focused mainly on updating the food production workforce, a system some call outdated and that has led to higher food prices especially for dairy, meat and vegetables. It would do this by allowing more farmers \u2014 like dairy and pork producers \u2014 to hire temporary workers year-round. Currently, year-round employers cannot use that worker visa program, known as the H-2A temporary agricultural program used by seasonal employers. It would also satisfy some goals for labor rights advocates by providing a pathway to legalization for workers who show a dedicated history of farm work. But Senate negotiators writing the bill are stuck on a little-known provision centered on those H-2A workers: whether they should be allowed to sue their employers if they believe labor laws have been broken. That provision's biggest foe is the American Farm Bureau Federation. The Farm Bureau, often known for its more conservative stances, has long been the agriculture lobbying giant in Washington. The bill received large GOP support in the House, where it passed twice. And members are anxious for their Senate counterparts to finally finish writing and introduce a bill. The split within the GOP over agriculture labor reform, led by Farm Bureau influence, threatens the prospects of a final deal as time runs out. Republicans on the Hill are accusing each other of not understanding the urgency of the bill, or even what it could do. \"It's sitting over on the Senate side waiting to move over there because there are people creating misperceptions about what the bill does,\" said California's Doug LaMalfa at a GOP-led press conference hosted by the American Business Immigration Coalition on the bill last week. \"Do people want to eat in this country or not?\" For over a year now, the top Senate negotiators on the bill \u2013 Democrat Michael Bennet of Colorado and Republican Mike Crapo of Idaho \u2013 have struggled to nail down a compromise for a handful of provisions. They've made progress, but the biggest hurdle is the lawsuit provision. It proposes to expand employee protections known as the Migrant and Seasonal Agriculture Workers Protections Act. That's one of the many laws establishing labor protections for farmworkers under the Labor Department, and it regulates the contracting, payment, record keeping, housing, transportation and other working conditions of farmworkers in the U.S. Proponents of the immigration bill argue many of these laws are already broader and wider reaching than MSPA requirements, or in many cases even the same. The biggest difference: the possibility of workers filing lawsuits against their employers. Unlike other farm labor laws, MSPA allows workers who believe an employer has violated a portion of the law to file a lawsuit in a federal district court. And unlike other laws, MSPA has specifically excluded H-2A visa workers \u2014 something the bill is looking to change. And there are more H-2A workers than ever before. Farmworkers, considered essential workers under the COVID-19 pandemic, harvest beans on May 12, 2020, in Homestead, Fla.\n                \n                    \n                    Lynne Sladky/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Farmworkers, considered essential workers under the COVID-19 pandemic, harvest beans on May 12, 2020, in Homestead, Fla. Farmers and ranchers are able to resource the H-2A visa program if they need workers to perform seasonal or temporary agricultural labor so long as they can prove that they were not able to hire a domestic worker, among other requirements. Demand for the visas has been steadily on the rise as producers face labor shortages, even before the pandemic. Although H-2A visa workers still make up about 11% of the overall ag workforce, the Labor Department noted the number of visas has more than tripled since 2012. Where is the divide? The lawsuit provision isn't new \u2013 it was included in the House version of the bill years ago by Democrats who wanted to increase labor protections for farmworkers. Labor advocates say the law helps protect workers from being shorted on wages and placed in unsafe housing and transportation by requiring record keeping. This and the ability to file a lawsuit, said Reyna Lopez, executive director of the Oregon-based Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste, does not differ from how employee rights work in other sectors. \"[We] really need these very basic documentations, very basic standards, very basic housing standards and licenses when people are driving and proof of their transportation when they're driving,\" Lopez said. \"This is the bare minimum we're asking from our employers when we're doing a lot to make sure that this economy continues.\" Advocates say that with the increased number of visa workers, it is even more important to ensure all workers that do the same job have the same protections. But the Farm Bureau and other employer groups argue the bill could potentially result in frivolous lawsuits costing producers, who are already operating on slim margins, thousands of dollars. \"That's an area where our policy is extremely clear. We do not support the inclusion of H-2A under MSPA in this manner,\" said Allison Crittenden, the bureau's director of government affairs. \"So we want to make sure that folks can be out farming and not dealing with frivolous lawsuits that could result from this.\" Producers, however, are generally split. And the lines seem to fall based on where they live. Those in the Southeastern region of the U.S., including North and South Carolina and Georgia, who may have more employers who solely rely on H-2A workers and have never dealt with MSPA before, have reservations. \"Our farmers, they love their workers and they're not opposed to a legalization program,\" said Lee Wicker, deputy director of the North Carolina Growers Association, the top employer for H-2A workers last year, but he added there is concern the law could be utilized by unions looking to organize or help employees retaliate against employers. Proponents of the bill argue the Farm Bureau is siding more with Southeastern growers, as opposed to those who may be willing to compromise. The New York Farm Bureau, who also happens to have a larger dairy industry, favors the legislation. \"It's very digestible. It's a good sound bite. And I think the legacy H-2A users in North and South Carolina, Georgia have done a very good job of messaging,\" said a Senate staffer familiar with negotiations. \"The American Farm Bureau has embraced the concerns echoed by those growers down there. If we can get the American Farm Bureau to a place where they're neutral, that would be huge.\" But many producers don't oppose the expansion of MSPA. Some say they already hire both domestic and visa workers, meaning they are already used to following the law. \"Honestly, there's a lot of ambivalence towards the issue here in the West. You don't hear it discussed in our circles as much as what you do in the Southeast,\" said Rick Naerebout, CEO of the Idaho Dairymen's Association, who noted most dairies have at least one domestic worker and are therefore already subject to MSPA. \"In terms of employees litigating issues with employers, that's largely a non-issue.\" The sentiment even exists among traditional growers in the Southeast. Charles Wingard, a vegetable farmer in South Carolina, told NPR that he uses a blend of H-2A and domestic workers and has never had an issue with MSPA, nor does he have an issue with the expansion. \"It goes back to if you treat your workers good and do right for them and by them. ...You shouldn't have any problems with them,\" Wingard said. Mike Gempler, executive director of the Washington Growers League, said many growers in the state are already subject to MSPA. Yet, his organization still supports the bill despite seeing the labor law as a \"confrontational\" option to resolving conflict. \"It's compromise,\" he said. \"I think what we have to do is make it work and make sure people are treated right and have protection. That's more important to have the H-2A program and have a good H-2A program that we can use that's affordable rather than hold out for keeping MSPA out of it.\" As of last week, Senate negotiators have reached tentative deals on a few provisions that had been holding them up \u2013 proposals that they say would help save employers money amid rising costs. For example, they agreed to freeze H-2A wages at current levels for the next year, and they are nearing a deal that would allow year-around employers to hire more workers than what the House proposed. But skepticism over the American Farm Bureau Federation's refusal to support expansion is the biggest hurdle. Crapo is not willing to put his name on a bill unless there is buy-in from a significant number of Republicans and unlocking support, or at least neutrality, from the Southeast is crucial, according to sources familiar with negotiations. But the Farm Bureau still maintains a stronghold and time is running out: production costs are only increasing and the November midterms are getting closer. Crittenden told NPR that the Farm Bureau is waiting to see the final bill before endorsing or opposing the effort and although it didn't support the House version, it didn't actively campaign against it either. Although the proposal is GOP-backed, minority leader Kevin McCarthy has said he won't put any immigration-related bills on the floor if the House flips following the November elections. Newhouse told reporters that even in a GOP-led House he would push to bring the bill back to the House floor for a vote if it is sent back with changes from the Senate and others are prepared to support him. \"I am living proof that you can actually go out and talk about immigration and win an election,\" said Idaho GOP Rep. Mike Simpson during the press conference. \"It's not as toxic as some people think...We need immigration reform, this is one part of it: ag immigration reform.\"",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court will issue opinions in two remaining cases. President Biden wraps up a week of high-level meetings with allies in Europe. Election denialism evolves into a nationwide movement.  A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: It's been a blockbuster term for the Supreme Court. And today, the newest justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson, will be sworn in, replacing retiring Justice Stephen Breyer. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: The court will also issue opinions in its two remaining cases, which we have been watching closely. One involves the remain in Mexico policy, and the other centers on the EPA's power to regulate greenhouse gases. MART\u00cdNEZ: Joining us to discuss the cases is NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg. All right, Nina, so what are these cases about? NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: Well, remain in Mexico is a Trump-era policy that required asylum-seekers, mainly from Central and South America, to either be detained in the U.S. or sent to Mexico, where they've lived in squalid camps while they wait for months, and some of them years, before they have their asylum claims reviewed. Last June, a year ago, the Biden administration tried to end the policy and substitute its own. But a Trump-appointed federal district court judge ordered the administration to restart the Trump program. And the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed. Today, the Supreme Court decides whether those lower court judges overstepped their authority, whether, as the Biden administration claims, the president has broad authority to make and revoke immigration policy under federal immigration law and under the Constitution's authority to conduct foreign policy - or in the alternative, whether the Biden administration overstepped its authority. MART\u00cdNEZ: All right. Now, the second one is a huge environmental case, as I understand it. TOTENBERG: Yep, because the decision could hamstring the EPA's efforts to regulate carbon emissions that cause climate change. Specifically, at issue in the case are rules adopted by the Trump administration and the Obama administration to deal with carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants. Those are the single biggest cause of carbon emissions in this country. The Obama plan was broad, the Trump one narrow. The Obama plan was temporarily blocked by the Supreme Court and then revoked by the Trump administration. But amazingly, most utilities continued to abandon coal because it was just too expensive. And even without the regulation in place, the Obama reduction targets for carbon emissions were met 11 years ahead of schedule. Now, what's so interesting about this case is that neither the Obama nor Trump plan is in effect. And the Biden administration doesn't have a plan on the table yet. But the Supreme Court still reached out to hear this case. And all indications are that to one degree or another, it's going to make it much harder to regulate carbon emissions and potentially many other things as well using this case as a vehicle, which has, of course, totally spooked environmentalists. MART\u00cdNEZ: Now, the court is also set to issue an orders list. What do we expect there? TOTENBERG: The court will announce some cases that it plans to take up or not take up next term. One big case that we're watching involves elections. It's from North Carolina. And it involves what's called the independent state legislature doctrine. Get used to that. Basically, the theory could reshape how the United States conducts federal elections. It would give state legislatures independent power that's not subject to review by the state courts. It would also allow them to set election rules that are at odds with their own state constitutions, giving them unfettered power to draw gerrymandered congressional maps, among other things. If the court does take that case, it will add to what's shaping up as another blockbuster term, with cases testing affirmative action in college admissions, gay rights in terms of equal access to commercial services and now, potentially, the election case - sometimes referred to in legal circles as the 800-pound gorilla. MART\u00cdNEZ: All right. NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg. Thanks a lot. TOTENBERG: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MART\u00cdNEZ: President Biden is wrapping up a week of high-level meetings with allies in Europe. MARTIN: Russia has been the focus. And the president says NATO and the G7 have sent a unified message. But that message has been overshadowed here in the U.S. by other big news events. Before he leaves for home today, President Biden will face questions at a press conference. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith joins us now from Madrid. Tam, how's the trip gone for President Biden? TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Well, you know, he has had some success here at the NATO summit. Most notably, Turkey dropped its opposition to the application from Finland and Sweden to join the alliance. And the White House says that during this trip, President Biden played a big part in that. He called the Turkish president on Tuesday and talked about Turkey's concerns about Finland and Sweden. And he said that this would be a great opportunity to resolve all of those issues so that the two presidents could sit down together and talk about other things at the NATO summit. And then that is exactly what happened. The White House insists that there was no sweetener offered by President Biden. Though, we do know that Turkey has been eager to buy U.S. fighter jets. And the Defense Department is saying that it supports that. That is something that would have to work its way through the contracting process. And Congress would need to sign off. But that is something I am sure President Biden will be asked about at the press conference today. Like, were there really no sweeteners? MART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah. Yeah. Now, while he's been away, focused on NATO and Ukraine, there's been a lot happening back home. Has that affected his trip at all? KEITH: Yeah. I mean, he has mostly just kept his head down here and stayed focused on these summits. I have been struck by just how little we've heard from him other than occasional brief remarks at the start of a meeting. He hasn't given any major speeches or addresses. He's barely responded to shouted questions. And this trip started and will now end with big Supreme Court decisions. First, the Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, that happened the day before he left. It has dominated the news - you know better than I do - in the U.S. ever since. And there's been a lot of frustration from his supporters that he hasn't said more about it in the last week. And now we know that there are going to be big decisions on immigration and environmental regulations today as he heads home. There was also that January 6 hearing on Tuesday with stunning revelations that really overshadowed that news about Finland and Sweden clearing the hurdle to join NATO. MART\u00cdNEZ: You know, it's been a minute since President Biden's had a formal news conference. What do you expect he'll be asked today? KEITH: Yeah. The last major news conference that Biden held, I was actually there. It was in March. It was also at the end of a NATO summit, that one in Brussels, so it has been a long time. This will be the first time that Biden has faced questions - that weren't shouted from a distance, at least - on what he plans to do now that abortion rights have been overturned. He did set up a commission some time ago to examine the Supreme Court. But he's never said whether he supports changes like term limits. So you can expect he will be asked about that. He might be asked about the economy. People's lives are really being affected by high gas prices and food prices. And some of that is being driven by big, global forces. But there was not a lot of obvious or immediate progress on those issues in these meetings that Biden had this week, at least they didn't talk about it much publicly. A new poll yesterday from the Associated Press showed 85% of people say the country is on the wrong track. That includes nearly 8-10 Democrats. So there is a lot of discontent ahead of the November elections. He could get asked about that. And I expect he could even be asked if he still plans to run again in 2024. MART\u00cdNEZ: That's NPR's Tamara Keith in Madrid. Tamara, thanks a lot. KEITH: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MART\u00cdNEZ: All right. For weeks now, we've been hearing from the January 6 committee about the efforts to subvert democracy using false claims of fraud in the 2020 election. MARTIN: A new NPR investigation that's out today explores how election denialism has evolved into a sprawling nationwide movement. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR voting correspondent Miles Parks is here to discuss the new findings. So what'd you find, Miles? MILES PARKS, BYLINE: So we found a real shift, A. For most of 2020, misinformation about elections was really headquartered in Donald Trump's Twitter account. But now the baton has sort of been passed to this core group of what you might call election denial influencers. These are people who have spent the last 18 months building large followings, claiming things like they found formulas that show how the 2020 election was rigged and things like that. Of course, these sorts of claims have all been debunked many times by paper ballot, hand counts, by audits, even by former President Donald Trump's own attorney general, Bill Barr. But still, these voter fraud evangelists have spent the last year and a half meeting with groups of concerned citizens in backyards, in hotel conference rooms, in car dealerships all across the country, spreading the gospel of voter fraud. MART\u00cdNEZ: All right. So tell us about these people and where they've gone. PARKS: They've really been everywhere. Our investigations team tracked them using social media data and local news reports to map this out. And we found a core group that appeared at more than 300 events across the country, traveling to almost every single state. Here's sound of one of them, Seth Keshel. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SETH KESHEL: Now I will say this, I went to 46 states in 2021, most of them beginning in June when my Telegram channel took off. Somebody named Donald J. Trump put me out a few times. And then things changed in my life. PARKS: NPR also tracked My Pillow founder Mike Lindell, as well as two other election denial influencers named Douglas Frank and David Clements. Now, this would be one thing if these were just events to just keep the lie alive that Donald Trump won the 2020 election. But they're not. These events often end with actionable items, things like telling people to go knock on doors in their neighborhoods to find election fraud. An NPR editor attended one meeting with David Clements where he told the audience to go to the offices of their county commissioners. They respond to fear, he told them. MART\u00cdNEZ: Wow, respond to fear. Now, you also found, throughout their travels, they met with a number of lawmakers. Tell us about that. PARKS: Yeah. So we found that over this time, these 18 months, they met or appeared with at least 78 lawmakers at the federal, state and local level. Many of these people will have a role in how future elections are run and even certified. Some of these lawmakers were already sympathetic to these sorts of claims, but others were skeptical. It's clear that part of this strategy is to get an audience with people who decide how voting works. These people also met or appeared with more than a hundred candidates who are running for election at some level of government this year. It's worth noting, A, that this reporting really confirms what we've been seeing on the ground for the last two years, that this fervor about fraud in this portion of the right is not going away as we head into midterms, you know? And as I talked to local election officials, they're really struggling with how to counter. And I talked to the secretary of state of Michigan, for instance, who said that each time there's an election denial event in Michigan, her office receives an uptick in threats and harassment. MART\u00cdNEZ: That's NPR's Miles Parks. You can hear more on this investigation tonight on All Things Considered. Miles, thanks a lot. PARKS: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

            "article_content": "Dozens of migrants are found dead in a truck in Texas. The House Jan. 6 panel schedules a last-minute hearing. NATO leaders meet in Madrid for what could be the most transformative summit in decades.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: We begin this morning with some grim news. At least 46 people were found dead after being trapped in a tractor trailer in San Antonio, Texas. AMART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: There was some hope, though. Police say 16 others, including children, were found alive and taken to area hospitals. MARTIN: Texas Public Radio's Joey Palacios is with us now. Joy, good morning. JOEY PALACIOS, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: You were at the scene, I understand, where authorities found this truck. Describe what you saw. PALACIOS: So Quintana Road is a very unassuming road. Most people really never drive down it. But yesterday there was a flurry of police vehicles. You could see the tractor trailer from where the media and the public was able to stand as these police vehicles were surrounding it. MARTIN: What do we know at this point? PALACIOS: There are still a lot of unanswered questions, like where the truck came from and where it was heading. We're still trying to learn more about who these victims were and their circumstances. We know three people have been arrested, but we don't know their connection to what happened. All signs point to this tragedy being related to human smuggling. San Antonio Fire Chief Charles Hood said the 12 adults and four children found alive in the truck were hot to the touch and suffered from heat exhaustion. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHARLES HOOD: No signs of water in the vehicle. It was a refrigerated tractor trailer, but there was no visible working AC unit on that rig. PALACIOS: And keep in mind, in San Antonio, we've been experiencing triple-digit temperatures in recent days. MARTIN: How was law enforcement able to find this truck, find these people? PALACIOS: San Antonio Police Chief William McManus said a worker at a nearby facility heard somebody crying for help. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WILLIAM MCMANUS: Came out to investigate, found a trailer with the doors partially opened, opened them up to take a look and found a number of deceased individuals inside. PALACIOS: Now McManus says the incident is under federal jurisdiction with homeland security investigations. MARTIN: This has happened before in Texas, hasn't it? PALACIOS: Sadly, it has. In 2017, 10 migrants died in a similar fashion. That trailer was found in a Walmart parking lot here in San Antonio and contained potentially more than a hundred people, but we don't know the exact number because some people fled. That trailer was unventilated and had no water as well. We've seen less tragic instances. Later that same year, another trailer with a dozen migrants was found in December in much cooler weather. All 12 were unharmed. And I'll say this happens a lot near San Antonio because of the geography here. It's close to the border. We're about 150 miles away. And Interstate 35, which goes from Mexico to Canada, passes through San Antonio, and it also connects with Interstate 10 here, which goes from Los Angeles to Jacksonville, Fla. So for many smuggling operations, it's a straight shot from border to border and coast to coast. MARTIN: And, I mean, it's just worth noting the politics of this, right? I mean, this happened in the state of Texas in an election year. No doubt it's going to become a political talking point. PALACIOS: Right. So an hour after the news broke, Governor Greg Abbott retweeted the conservative Daily Wire online newspaper blaming the incident on President Joe Biden's immigration policies. Meanwhile, his opponent, Beto O'Rourke, called for increased legal pathways to citizenship that don't incentivize these dangerous journeys. The League of United Latin American Citizens, one of the largest Latino civil rights organizations in the country, called for responsible dialogue on immigration following this tragedy. Now, they say the only way forward from a tragedy like this is Democrats and Republicans working together on immigration reform. MARTIN: Texas Public Radio's Joey Palacios reporting from San Antonio. He is also co-host of the Line in the Land podcast. Joey, thank you. PALACIOS: Thank you, Rachel. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: OK, the House committee investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol is holding a surprise hearing today. MART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah, at the end of last Thursday's hearing, the chairman said that the panel would postpone future hearings until mid-July, but something changed. And while the rest of Congress is taking a break for its Fourth of July recess, the committee is back to work in Washington today. MARTIN: NPR congressional correspondent Deirdre Walsh joins us now. Hey, Deirdre. DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: What's going on? WALSH: (Laughter) Well, the notice from the committee released yesterday suggests they have new information. It says the committee is going to convene to, quote, \"present recently obtained evidence\" and receive witness testimony. After last Thursday's hearing, the chairman, Bennie Thompson, said the hearings next month are going to focus on efforts by extremist groups to organize the attack and on what President Trump was doing at the White House while the Capitol was under siege, but we don't know what the topic of today's hearing will be. Committee has declined to disclose any details or even say if there's going to be more than one witness. MARTIN: Huh. So we've already seen testimony from some senior Cabinet and White House officials. Any chance we could hear from someone today who already spoke to the committee behind closed doors? WALSH: Yes, right. So far, the witnesses who have appeared in previous public hearings have already sat for closed-door interviews under oath by the committee. Punchbowl News and some other outlets are reporting that Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, is expected to testify today. NPR has not confirmed those reports. But, you know, we've seen clips of Hutchinson's testimony in previous hearings. For example, she named which GOP lawmakers sought presidential pardons after January 6. That was in last Thursday's hearing. MARTIN: Right. WALSH: The committee continues to reach out to potential witnesses. And some members have stressed that as new information comes in, they may want to reinterview some people. You know, Vice Chair Liz Cheney made a public appeal at one of last week's hearings to Pat Cipollone, who was White House counsel for President Trump. Other White House lawyers have appeared in tape clips, but Cipollone only had informal discussions about appearing under oath. MARTIN: OK. I guess we'll see what happens today. We've also got news, Deirdre, about John Eastman - right? - someone very central to an earlier hearing. What do we know? WALSH: Right. Eastman is the conservative lawyer who was pushing this theory to Trump and others in his inner circle that Vice President Pence could unilaterally overturn the election on January 6. We learned through a court filing that federal agents seized Eastman's cellphone last week. This happened on the same day that federal agents raided the home of Jeffrey Clark. He's the former Justice Department lawyer who also backed this Eastman scheme to block the election certification. But we don't know if those developments were related. In that court filing, Eastman says the FBI took his phone on behalf of the DOJ inspector general. That's the internal watchdog at the Justice Department. Like that Clark raid, subpoenas have gone out to people in several states allegedly involved in this fake elector scheme. This is just another sign that as investigations - you know, as these hearings are happening, there are other investigations happening behind the scenes. MARTIN: Yeah. NPR's Deirdre Walsh. Deirdre, thanks for this. We appreciate it. WALSH: Thanks, Rachel. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: All right, NATO leaders are meeting in Madrid, Spain, in what could be the most transformative summit in decades. MART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah, in the wake of Russia's ongoing aggression in Ukraine, the alliance is set to strengthen its own defenses. MARTIN: NPR's Frank Langfitt is at an airport in London, heading to Madrid as we speak. Hey, Frank. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Hey, Rachel. MARTIN: The central issue for NATO, clearly, is how much to continue helping Ukraine, right? What's the line they're trying to walk right now? LANGFITT: Yeah. You know, you have some NATO members who are concerned about provoking Putin, afraid that he would then attack a NATO state if they give too many arms, you know, stuff that is really - especially long range to the Ukrainians. And of course, amid rising inflation, these huge losses on the battlefield, worry about a recession, they're looking to - you know, for ways to end this war, at least get a cease-fire. The other countries, particularly those that border Russia - the Baltics, Poland - they want to arm Ukraine more heavily because the fact of the matter is Ukraine is defending Eastern Europe against Russia. And a couple of recent examples I'd like to mention - one is that earlier this month, French President Emmanuel Macron, he got people really mad among the allies when he said NATO should not humiliate Russia. Meanwhile, you've got the Estonian prime minister complaining that NATO's plan right now to defend her country is so lacking, she says, the Russians could overrun it quickly, and it would be, quote, \"wiped off the map.\" MARTIN: Wow. I mean, the countries that border Russia or Ukraine feel especially vulnerable. Are NATO leaders addressing that? LANGFITT: They are. I mean, we've already seen, during the war, major deployments of more troops to the Eastern Flank, and we're going to hear more troop commitments at the summit. The secretary general of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, he calls this meeting and what's going to happen on the Eastern Flank as the biggest overhaul of collective defense since the Cold War. This is what he had to say yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JENS STOLTENBERG: Competition is rising between democracy and authoritarianism. Moscow and Beijing are openly contesting the rules-based international order. LANGFITT: And that's compared to 40,000 now, so it's a huge change. And the idea is to get as many troops as possible who could react quickly if there's, you know, a Russian invasion. MARTIN: Right. So the war in Ukraine has compelled Finland and Sweden to apply for membership into NATO, but Turkey is holding it up. What's the latest on that, Frank? Is that going to be resolved? LANGFITT: I don't think it's going to probably be resolved at the summit. Turkey has been saying it objects to these two countries 'cause it says that they won't turn over people that Turkey views as terrorists. But most people that I talked to think Turkish President Erdogan, he's actually just holding this process hostage because he wants the U.S. to sell him fighter jets that he's been after for years. So this is seen more as a negotiating tactic, and Finland and Sweden will get in, but it might take a little time. MARTIN: So obviously, Russia, Ukraine - top of mind at the NATO summit. What are the other priorities being discussed, though? LANGFITT: Well, the thing that's really going to be interesting, Rachel, and I think people should pay attention to is, for the first time ever, NATO is going to focus on China. You know, despite the invasion, the United States still sees China as its biggest challenge. And NATO's also invited leaders from four Asian Pacific nations to the summit - Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea. And Stoltenberg, you know, he was saying China's not an adversary, but he added this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STOLTENBERG: We will transform the NATO response force and increase the number of our high-readiness forces to well over 300,000. LANGFITT: And Biden - you know, President Biden's been trying to link these two countries and basically find a way to get both allies in Europe and Asia on board and seeing these as combined issues. MARTIN: NPR's Frank Langfitt. Thanks, Frank. We appreciate you. LANGFITT: Good to talk, Rachel. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Volunteers take part in a 2004 voter outreach event in Dearborn, Mich., organized by the Arab American Institute. While there is no federal requirement for Arabic-language ballots, the city of Dearborn recently started requiring election materials to be translated into Arabic.\n                \n                    \n                    Bill Pugliano/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Volunteers take part in a 2004 voter outreach event in Dearborn, Mich., organized by the Arab American Institute. While there is no federal requirement for Arabic-language ballots, the city of Dearborn recently started requiring election materials to be translated into Arabic. Among the language minority groups protected under the Voting Rights Act, you won't find voters like Shaima Mohammed. In 1975, Congress expanded that landmark civil rights law to try to get rid of barriers preventing \"citizens of language minorities\" from voting. And for close to half a century, Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act has required certain states and local governments to provide voting ballots, registration forms and other election materials in more than just English. But not all languages are covered by Section 203's protections. And that has often left Arabic-speaking U.S. citizens with limited proficiency in English, like Mohammed, on their own when trying to vote. In 2020, she wanted to cast a ballot in the presidential election and turned to a neighbor and a cousin for help. \"Some of the people, they don't have at home someone to translate,\" says Mohammed, who grew up in Yemen and has taken English classes at the Arab Community Center for Economic and Social Services in Dearborn, Mich. Exactly where the federal government requires multilingual election information is determined by the Census Bureau, which uses complicated formulas involving English proficiency and educational attainment rates to produce an updated list every five years. The latest list, released in December, shows that the federal mandate for American Indian language assistance has reached five additional states and coverage for Spanish was added to Ohio's Cuyahoga County. There's also growth in the areas required to help voters in Bengali, Chinese, Hmong, Tagalog and Vietnamese. With Arabic, Haitian Creole and other languages that are not protected by Section 203 becoming more common among U.S. households, some voting rights advocates have been calling for the federal government to expand its requirements for multilingual election information. \"Information is power, right?\" says Marvin Hernandez, regional manager of Virginia elections for CASA in Action, an advocacy group focused on mobilizing immigrants. \"We need to continue fighting for having more languages included in the electoral process as well. This is something that we need to see in order to see inclusiveness in all levels and with all demographics.\" According to Section 203, the protected language minority groups are limited to \"persons who are American Indian, Asian American, Alaskan Natives or of Spanish heritage.\" The Census Bureau relies on data about race and ethnicity as a \"proxy\" to identify the protected language groups, the agency confirmed to NPR in a statement. \"This means people who speak certain languages such as Arabic are classified by their race\" based on federal standards, the bureau said. And those standards officially categorize people with origins in the Middle East or North Africa as white. Some scholars classify Arabic as an \"Afro-Asiatic\" language group, but the bureau does not, categorizing it not among Asian languages, but \"All other languages.\" As for Haitian Creole \u2014 which was at the center of a voting rights lawsuit in Florida's Miami-Dade County after the 2000 election \u2014 the bureau considers it an Indo-European language, and its speakers do not fall within the protected language minority groups under Section 203. When Congress was preparing to add Section 203's language assistance requirements to the Voting Rights Act, some lawmakers did consider a wider scope of coverage. \"One of the arguments actually that was made is that every language should be eligible for coverage. And there were serious concerns about that because it would raise constitutional issues,\" says Jim Tucker, a voting rights attorney with the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law who wrote about Section 203's history in the book The Battle Over Bilingual Ballots: Language Minorities and Political Access Under the Voting Rights Act. Adopted during Reconstruction after the Civil War, the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments give Congress the power to pass laws that would ensure every person is treated equally by the law and that no citizen is denied the right to vote because of their race. Ultimately, lawmakers decided that Section 203 would only require language assistance in federal, state and local elections for groups for which there is a historical record of evidence showing they've faced voting and educational discrimination. The goal was to address, as the legislation puts it, \"the unequal educational opportunities afforded them resulting in high illiteracy and low voting participation.\" Angelo Ancheta, a civil rights attorney who has also written about Section 203, notes that any discussions about broadening the language minority groups protected under this unfunded federal mandate would have to contend with practical considerations. \"It's not cheap to produce ballots in other languages,\" Ancheta says. \"There are a lot of logistical issues. We can't ignore those.\" There have been opportunities over the years for Congress to expand the protected language groups when Section 203 \u2014 which is currently set to expire in 2032 \u2014 has come up for renewal. The failed Senate efforts to pass new voting rights bills earlier this year included proposals that could have helped ensure oral assistance in non-written American Indian and Alaska Native languages. (Neither bill would have expanded the federally protected language minority groups to include Arabic or Haitian Creole speakers.) But no new federal requirements have been passed \u2014 and Ancheta does not expect to see any in the near future. \"I suspect that this kind of issue is one where polarization in Congress is not going to be helpful to advancing any new legislation,\" Ancheta says. While there are federal requirements for language assistance, Tucker warns that voters have found a range of compliance among state and local governments around the country. \"There are many that do not even meet the requirements,\" says Tucker, who has served in the voting section of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and currently chairs a committee of outside advisers to the Census Bureau. \"There are jurisdictions in some cases that go above and beyond the requirements.\" According to local law in Florida's Miami-Dade County, precincts with significant shares of Haitian American voters are required to offer ballots in Haitian Creole, in addition to English and Spanish.\n                \n                    \n                    Jeff Greenberg/Education Images/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption In Florida's Miami-Dade County, home to the largest population of immigrants from Haiti in the U.S., precincts with significant shares of Haitian American voters are required to provide ballots in Creole, in addition to English and the federally required Spanish. \"It's a good thing that in Miami-Dade County, that's a fact. But that's not the case in many other jurisdictions,\" says Gepsie Metellus, co-founder and executive director of the Sant La Haitian Neighborhood Center in North Miami, Fla. Metellus says expanding federal language assistance requirements to include Haitian Creole would help more U.S. citizens feel at ease with the voting process. \"It's an invitation to vote. It's an embrace, a recognition that that population is part of the American fabric,\" adds Metellus, who ran unsuccessfully in 2020 for a seat on the Miami-Dade County Commission. Voting rights advocates in Michigan, where some of the country's biggest Arab American communities have lived for decades, have been organizing for more official recognition of the needs of Arabic-speaking citizens. \"When we explained to them that they can vote early, that they didn't need a driver's license to vote \u2014 they had no idea. And that is all due to language barriers,\" says Nada Al-Hanooti, executive director of Emgage's Michigan chapter, about her advocacy group's outreach efforts with citizens who are not proficient in English. For the upcoming primary election in August, ballots in Arabic will be available to voters in Dearborn, Mich., after a push by community groups and a city council member, Mustapha Hammoud, who introduced a resolution earlier this year that requires election materials in English and any language spoken by at least 10,000 or 5% of Dearborn's residents. In Hamtramck, Mich., another suburb of Detroit, city council members have also recently passed a resolution for Arabic election materials. For Mohammed \u2014 the Arabic-speaking voter in Dearborn who turned to friends and family for help to get access to an English-language ballot in 2020 \u2014 it will be a major change that makes it easier to exercise her right to vote. \"It's a good feeling,\" Mohammed says about casting a ballot. \"You feel like you're a part of this country. You're doing something good.\"",

DeSantis signed a law last week aimed in part at limiting the number of migrant children flown into the state.\n                \n                    \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February. DeSantis signed a law last week aimed in part at limiting the number of migrant children flown into the state. The number of migrant children crossing the southern border without their parents reached a record high last year \u2014 and the backlash is still growing. Republicans accuse the Biden administration of organizing secret flights, carrying migrants from the border to communities across the country, that critics have branded \"ghost flights.\" But that rhetoric is often at odds with the facts. \"It's not secret, and it's not new,\" said Jennifer Nagda, policy director with the Young Center for Immigrant Children's Rights, a non-profit that works closely with unaccompanied children. When children and teenagers from Central America cross the border alone, the federal government is required by law to care for them until they're reunited with a sponsor, often a parent or relative, or placed in a network of special shelters around the U.S. To do that, federal officials sometimes fly those children on charter planes from the border to other parts of the country. For years, this was widely seen as normal, even routine. Until it wasn't. With border arrests at the highest levels on record, Republicans see immigration as a potent line of attack in midterm elections this fall. And some are seeking to weaponize basic operations of the immigration system that had rarely attracted attention before \u2014 including flights carrying unaccompanied children around the country. GOP lawmakers across the country have sounded the alarm about \"ghost flights\" filled with migrant children \u2014 claims that have been amplified by Fox News and other right-wing outlets. \"There's no warning,\" said Florida Governor Ron DeSantis at a press conference last week. \"It's just in the middle of the night. And then you'll wake up and someone will say, 'they brought a bunch of unaccompanied minors.'\" But federal officials insist that these flights happened exactly the same way during previous administrations, including under former President Trump. \"This is completely consistent with the law and our responsibilities,\" said Jorge Silva, a deputy assistant secretary for public affairs at U.S. Health and Human Services, in a statement. \"Our legal responsibility is to care for unaccompanied children while they are on our watch, and that includes connecting them to vetted sponsors.\" Federal officials say that flights carrying migrant children happen at all hours, and that they don't release information about the children on board to protect their privacy. Even the contractor operating the charter flights hasn't changed since the Trump administration, they note. What has changed is that the number of unaccompanied children crossing the border reached an all-time high last year, topping 100,000 for the first time. And immigrant advocates say the amount of fear-mongering about them is rising too, in a way that's \"really just divorced from reality and from facts,\" Nagda said. The rules about the treatment of unaccompanied migrant children have been the same for years \u2014 spelled out most recently in the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, which passed with strong bipartisan support and was signed into law by George W. Bush in 2008. \"This is part of a process established under a bipartisan law intended to treat children just a little bit more like the children that they are,\" Nagda said. By the time former President Trump was elected, some Republicans argued that the law was creating unintended consequences \u2014 and that human smugglers and cartels have learned to exploit it in order to get more migrant children into the U.S.. \"It's being abused for sure,\" DeSantis said last week. \"So what that has done is that has facilitated and incentivized putting these minors on this journey\" from Central America. Under DeSantis, Florida issued an emergency order earlier this year to stop licensing shelters that care for migrant children. At least one shelter operator in the state, Bethany Christian Services, said it would stop caring for unaccompanied children in Florida as a result. On Friday, DeSantis signed a law that blocks the state from doing business with air or bus carriers that bring undocumented immigrants to Florida, including unaccompanied children. \"What this bill does is it penalizes any of these contractors that the federal government is hiring to dump illegal aliens in our state,\" he said at a press conference in Pensacola, flanked by law enforcement officials while standing behind a podium with a sign reading \"Biden's Border Crisis.\" When DeSantis was asked how many companies might be affected by the law, he didn't offer an answer \u2014 but conceded that it's \"difficult\" for the state to stop charter flights that are operated by federal contractors. Immigrant advocates suspect the real point of the law is to help DeSantis win reelection this fall, and run for president in 2024. \"It's really unconscionable to me that kids would be used as pawns in a political fight\" between Florida and the White House, said Nagda. There are no \"ghost flights,\" she says. But the pushback against them is real. And the harm to migrant children could be, too.",

RENO, Nevada \u2014 Democratic incumbent Gov. Steve Sisolak will face Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo in November, according to primary race calls by The Associated Press. Sisolak, a Democrat, shrugged off a challenge from former Clark County Commissioner Tom Collins \u2014 a longshot candidate who raised less than $10,000 in campaign funding, according to the most recent filings. Meanwhile, Lombardo, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, had to face members of his own party campaigning even further to the right in the state's top primaries. He beat Joey Gilbert, his closest competitor, whom he was leading in polling. In the primary, Republicans campaigned on the Democratic governor's response to the pandemic over the last couple of years. Sisolak issued executive orders to temporarily close businesses, then imposed occupancy caps and mask mandates as infection rates improved. Lombardo, who became nationally known after the mass shooting at an outdoor concert in Las Vegas in 2017, capitalized on the anxiety many Nevadans felt during the lockdowns. He blamed Sisolak for lost wages, while ignoring disproportionately high death rates in some rural, conservative counties that bucked public health guidance. Not to be outdone, Gilbert staked out an anti-COVID vaccine position. Lombardo has also cast doubt on the 2020 results without explicitly calling them fraudulent, a balancing act that likely helped him in a state where Trump's popularity eclipsed that of President Biden \u2014 even though he lost the state during the actual election. Gilbert, a far-right upstart candidate and prolific supporter of Trump's election lies, challenged the results of his own race. \"I will concede nothing,\" he wrote in a Facebook post. During a debate hosted by Las Vegas news station KLAS-TV in May, Lombardo's opponents challenged his conservative credentials. Gilbert and former U.S. Sen. Dean Heller accused him of enabling illegal immigration because his department ended its immigration detainer agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \"We refer to him among us as 'Sanctuary Joe' for a reason,\" Gilbert said. But Lombardo dismissed their attacks, saying his officers still collaborate with ICE in an unofficial capacity. Sisolak enters the general election with a 12-point lead over Lombardo, according to a poll by the University of Nevada, Reno. But the race will be an uphill battle as Democrats around the country struggle with high inflation and Biden's poor performance in recent polls. More Nevada primary coverage",

            "article_content": "In the 1970s, three of every four members in Congress served in the U.S. military. It's now about one in six. Republicans are looking to a group of veterans running in House districts to change that.  SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST: In the 1970s, 3 of every 4 members of Congress had served in the U.S. military. Now that number is down to about 1 in 6. So Republicans hope a diverse group of veterans running in House districts can change those numbers and change control of Congress. It's a strategy that has worked for Democrats in the past. NPR congressional correspondent Deirdre Walsh talked to some GOP military vets aiming to flip blue seats red. DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Jennifer-Ruth Green watched a polarized House chamber during the 2020 State of the Union address and thought her military background could help her make a difference. But she admitted... JENNIFER-RUTH GREEN: I honestly had zero idea about what running for Congress would look like. WALSH: Green, a Republican, was told she had no chance to win in an Indiana district that elected Democrats for more than 90 years. But she wants to prove a Black Air Force veteran has a place in her party. GREEN: Being an example is something that is a, maybe, secondary, tertiary effect that would cause other people to be interested and say, yes, I can be a conservative and an African American and serve in politics. WALSH: Green won the GOP primary to face Democrat Frank Mrvan this fall and now has money and endorsements from top leaders. She says voters are paying attention to the war in Ukraine, but says the top issues are clear. GREEN: Between the border and inflation and gas prices, people are pretty concerned about those three pretty evenly. WALSH: Jen Kiggans, a Republican state senator in Virginia, is 1 of 4 GOP candidates with military backgrounds competing in a district with service installations around Norfolk and Virginia Beach. She decided to run after seeing female Democratic veterans win House seats in 2018, including Elaine Luria, a former Navy commander who she's challenging. JEN KIGGANS: I thought, well, where are the Republican women? Because we differ in our opinions on many issues. And as a conservative, I felt like, well, where are the Republican veteran women? WALSH: Like Green, Kiggans says the economy is her top issue, but it's not the only one. KIGGANS: I feel like it's my responsibility as a veteran running and as a person who would represent a district with the highest veteran population in the commonwealth that we don't stop talking about the crisis in Afghanistan and that withdrawal. WALSH: Jeremy Hunt is a West Point graduate who served in Army intelligence. After five years in the military, including a deployment to Ukraine, he said the political environment made it a good time for a Republican to turn to politics. JEREMY HUNT: We felt - specifically for this seat, we knew that it's either now or never. If we're going to make a difference, we feel like we have to take back our country. We're going to do it. We're - it's a year like 2022, when a lot of people are just suffering under Biden's economy with inflation, gas prices, you name it. WALSH: He's a Black Republican challenging a Black Democrat, Georgia congressman Sanford Bishop. Hunt says he uses the same approach he did in the military, asking voters what they need from their representative. HUNT: I'm not showing up saying, here's what, you know, Washington can do for you and here is my, you know, 10-point plan about - what I'm doing is I'm showing up, and I'm listening and saying, look, you've been doing this much longer than I have. Tell me, what can we do to support you? WALSH: He cites rising energy prices and concerns about illegal immigration and drugs coming across the border. When it comes to former President Trump, who's still relitigating the 2020 election in Georgia, Hunt is clear in separating himself from that message. HUNT: We are trying to build a serious coalition to flip a key Democratic seat. We don't spend much time talking about, you know, national-level stuff. WALSH: Indiana's Green praised Trump's policies, but contrasted her own style. GREEN: I want to make sure that I lead with accountability and with integrity. And my style of leadership is vastly different from his. And I want to lead in a different way. WALSH: Kiggans pivoted from questions about the former president, noting he's not on the ballot this year. KIGGANS: I'm so focused on this midterm cycle. Nothing will matter if we don't flip the U.S. House, in my opinion. WALSH: Trump isn't getting involved in any of these swing district races so far. Hunt is looking beyond him. HUNT: I think the future is going to be in districts like mine, building a multiracial, working-class coalition of voters. WALSH: Republican and Democratic veterans in the House created a bipartisan For Country Caucus that often works on national security issues. Members say they often split on a lot of policies, but the shared bond of wearing the uniform brings them together. If more veterans do win in November, that may be one of the rare places to find common ground. Deirdre Walsh, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The rally was cut short as protesters chanted loudly beyond the walls of the outdoor venue. ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \u2014 Former television meteorologist Mark Ronchetti has come out ahead in a crowded field to claim victory in the New Mexico GOP primary for governor, according to a race call by The Associated Press. He was a favorite to win thanks to his name recognition as a longtime local TV personality and a former U.S. Senate candidate. Though he's never held political office, this is Ronchetti's second time earning a GOP nomination in the state. He lost in a race for an open U.S. Senate seat in 2020 to Democratic Sen. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n but fared well with nearly 46% of the vote. He'll take on Democratic incumbent Michelle Lujan Grisham in November. Though Ronchetti led the five-way Republican race in fundraising, according to campaign finance reports from the secretary of state's office, he raised less than half of what Gov. Lujan Grisham brought in for the primary contest, where she ran unopposed. Lujan Grisham was the state's secretary of health, then served three terms in the U.S. House before being elected governor. She led the state through the pandemic with some of the strictest public health mandates in the country. Most of the candidates in the crowded GOP primary field built campaigns criticizing Lujan Grisham for her pandemic response \u2014 expressing outrage about closures and citing negative impacts to the state's small businesses. One contender, GOP County Commissioner Jay Block, referred to the state's shutdown orders as \"unconstitutional\" on his campaign website, though the state Supreme Court upheld the administration's authority to institute them. Lujan Grisham is also campaigning on her handling of COVID \u2014 including the state's lengthy indoor mask mandate that was lifted in February, well after most other states. She's also holding up New Mexico's effective vaccine rollout that's led to more than 90% of adults in the state getting at least one shot. And as a counter to the economic messaging of the state's GOP, she's touting relief packages for individuals and businesses as having protected the health of the state economy. Ronchetti is running as a political outsider who puts people above party loyalties. He beat out three-term State Rep. Rebecca Dow for the nomination who serves as the chair of the state's House Republican caucus. As the country's Republican candidates are calculating their proximity to Trump, Dow described herself in a primary debate on local news station KOAT as \"a lifelong conservative who's never disrespected President Donald Trump.\" She worked to position Ronchetti as unsupportive of the former president. She blasted him in a campaign ad as a \"Never Trumper,\" and for a comment he made in 2019 that he \"used to be a Republican until the orange one,\" referring to Trump at a University of New Mexico climate change event. Ronchetti has defended the comment in a televised debate as a joke made to college students and his campaign says he remains a registered Republican. Dow also flashed her political experience, but during the campaign, Ronchetti pushed back on Dow for her voting record in the state legislature, especially at the height of the pandemic, highlighting her approval of state pandemic relief aid, which received bipartisan support. The legislation rolled in funds for those who didn't receive a federal stimulus check, including undocumented people. He said on his campaign website that the policy encourages illegal immigration, and he will do away with it if elected. All five GOP candidates for governor campaigned on increasing security on the U.S.-Mexico border. Ronchetti Tuesday also bested retired Army National Guard Brigadier General and former Guantanamo Bay commander Greg Zanetti, County Commissioner and Air Force veteran Jay Block, and abortion rights opponent and former Mayor Ethel Maharg. Ronchetti has said he'll form a \"Border Strike Force\" under the state's Department of Public Safety and redeploy the National Guard to the border if elected. In 2019, Gov. Lujan Grisham pulled most Guard troops back from the border, refuting the idea that the area was in crisis. They had been ordered there the year before by former Republican Gov. Susanna Martinez in response to a call from Trump. Amid record homicides in Albuquerque \u2014 the state's largest city \u2014 both gubernatorial candidates are pitching \"tough-on-crime\" initiatives. While Ronchetti is calling for expanding recruitment and pay for officers and tougher laws to keep people behind bars, so has Lujan Grisham. She's increased funding for police departments across New Mexico, and oversaw 16% raises for state police officers. She named crime as one of her priorities in the 2022 legislative session, though a bill she pushed for that would have altered the state's law to keep more people behind bars pending trial, failed.",

Henry Cuellar, left, and progressive candidate Jessica Cisneros. A closely watched Democratic primary in South Texas has finally been decided. Henry Cuellar, a longtime congressman, has narrowly defeated progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros, according to a race call by The Associated Press. Cuellar and Cisneros squared off in Texas' March primary. Neither got more than 50% of the vote, so they moved on to last month's runoff. In that runoff, the two candidates were separated by hundreds of votes, setting up a recount. Nearly a month later, on Tuesday, the AP called the race for Cuellar after the recount. The race in Texas' 28th Congressional District pitted one of the most conservative Democrats in the House against a challenger backed by progressive stalwarts, including Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Cuellar, who has held the seat since 2005, had the endorsements of top House Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Majority Whip Jim Clyburn. This wasn't the first time Cisneros, a 29-year-old immigration attorney, took on Cuellar, 66; she first did so in 2020, heavily outraising the longtime Laredo congressman before falling short. Cisneros ran on a distinctly progressive platform, with support for Medicare for All and pro-labor legislation. Cuellar, who holds more conservative views on abortion, immigration and gun control, painted Cisneros as a far-left candidate who wouldn't be effective in Congress. He touted his deep ties to the district and ability to get things done. The issue of abortion rights played a large role in the campaign, with increased momentum after a leaked draft opinion of a Supreme Court decision indicated the high court may overturn Roe v. Wade. Cisneros pushed to keep abortion rights front and center in the campaign, as Cuellar is the only self-identified \"pro-life\" Democrat in the House. \"There's so many key issues where she's always siding with Republicans, and he could become the Joe Manchin of the House,\" she told NBC's Meet The Press. \"We don't want Henry Cuellar to be the deciding vote on the future of our fundamental freedoms and rights in this country.\" Roughly two months before the March primary, the FBI raided Cuellar's campaign office and home in a probe, reportedly stemming from an investigation into U.S. businessmen and their ties to Azerbaijan. Cuellar's attorney told Fox News he was not a target of the investigation, but the raids provided Cisneros with attack ad fodder. On the Republican side, Cassy Garcia, a former staffer for Sen. Ted Cruz, won the May runoff. The GOP has its sights set on flipping the competitive district in the South Texas region that's been trending more Republicans' way.",

Trump has endorsed a slew of Georgia candidates \u2014 including lesser-known, down-ballot races like insurance commissioner \u2014 in the state where he faces a criminal probe after a January 2021 call in which he asked Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \"find\" some 12,000 votes to overturn his 2020 election defeat. Here are Tuesday's key races to watch: Ahead by a wide margin in polling and fundraising, incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp is poised to fend off Trump-backed former Sen. David Perdue, who ran at Trump's behest and centered his campaign around false claims about the 2020 election. In the aftermath of 2020, no Republican governor has faced more attacks from Trump than Kemp, who certified the state's presidential results and refused to overturn them. But Perdue's bid has failed to gain traction, as Kemp leaned into a conservative record that includes pay raises for state employees and teachers, easing of restrictions on firearms, stricter election rules and one of the toughest abortion laws in the country. In the closing days of the election, Kemp was joined on the campaign trail by former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts and former Vice President Mike Pence, who called Kemp \"one of the most successful conservative governors in America.\" If Kemp wins the primary, he will face Democrat Stacey Abrams in a rematch from 2018, where Kemp narrowly won by about 55,000 votes.

But the incumbent has been buoyed in recent weeks by reports of record early voting turnout in Georgia with a smooth election process, and potentially by nearly 40,000 voters who cast Democratic primary ballots in 2020 but Republican ones in 2022, many who have said they plan to vote against Georgia's Trump slate. On the Democratic side, state Rep. Bee Nguyen leads a crowded field of candidates for the party's nomination. Republican Sen. Richard Shelby is retiring, and the race to replace him is looking very likely to lead to a runoff on June 21. So far, three candidates are polling closely but none is expected to win the required more than 50% of the vote. Katie Britt, who used to work for Shelby and is a former head of the Business Council of Alabama, has a slight lead in surveys over Army veteran Mike Durant and U.S. Rep. Mo Brooks. Trump had endorsed Brooks but rescinded it, after the congressman said it was time to get past the 2020 election and look toward the future. Democratic Rep.

Henry Cuellar faces a primary challenge from progressive candidate Jessica Cisneros. There are one-on-one runoffs Tuesday for both Democrats and Republicans in Texas' 28th Congressional District. A highly contested race between longtime Democratic incumbent Rep. Henry Cuellar and progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros has drawn endorsements from national figures and sets up a stark divide in the party. Cisneros is backed by Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Cuellar, meanwhile, is one of the most conservative Democrats in the House, especially when it comes to issues of immigration and abortion. Cisneros first challenged Cuellar in 2020 and well outraised the incumbent in that contest. And after an FBI raid on Cuellar's home earlier this year, Cisneros saw another boost in funds in this year's race. For Republicans, Cassy Garcia, a former staffer for Sen. Ted Cruz whom he  endorsed, is up against Sandra Whitten, who has previously run against Cuellar in the general election. Many voters in the Hispanic-majority district remain socially conservative \u2014 giving Republicans an opportunity to flip the seat red in the South Texas region that's been trending more their way. In Georgia, Republican-drawn maps for Congress took away one seat in Atlanta's fast-growing suburbs and set up a fierce member-on-member Democratic primary between Rep. Lucy McBath and Rep. Carolyn Bourdeaux. Reps.

So now McBath is running in the 7th District, currently held by moderate Blue Dog Democrat Bourdeaux. Bourdeaux, the only Democrat to flip a House seat in 2020, is not seen as the frontrunner after her new district lines were reconfigured to include a more progressive electorate centered in fast-growing and diverse Gwinnett County, northeast of Atlanta. Incumbent Republican Gov. Kay Ivey faces primary challengers in a race that may also lead to a runoff. Tim James, a businessman and son of one of the state's former governors, and Lindy Blanchard, a former ambassador in the Trump administration, are not polling nearly as well as Ivey but could still prevent her from reaching the 50% threshold on Tuesday.

Trump endorsed Sanders early on, in January 2021 right after he left the White House. The next month, Arkansas Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin, who was also running for governor, dropped out to run for attorney general instead. Texas voters have a runoff on both sides in the race for state attorney general. On the GOP ballot, incumbent Ken Paxton faces George P. Bush, nephew of former President George W. Bush and the state's land commissioner. Paxton won a plurality of the vote in the primary but is facing a number of accusations, including for corruption, drawing criticism from other Republicans in the state. Trump has backed Paxton in what could be another blow to the Bush political dynasty. For Democrats, former ACLU lawyer Rochelle Garza, who won the larger share of the vote in the March primary, faces Joe Jaworski, a former Galveston mayor.

            "article_content": "The only self-identified \"pro-life\" Democrat in the House is facing a primary runoff challenge in south Texas. The race is one test of whether the party has room for people against abortion rights.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: There are very few Democratic lawmakers left who oppose abortion rights, and a key Texas primary on Tuesday could oust one more. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has this report. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: The May 24 runoff between Democratic Representative Henry Cuellar and immigration attorney Jessica Cisneros was always going to be a fight. In their initial matchup in March, he edged her out by just over two percentage points, or roughly a thousand votes. And then the Supreme Court leak happened. Now Cisneros is trying to make sure abortion is central to this race. Here she was recently on NBC's \"Meet The Press.\" (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MEET THE PRESS\") JESSICA CISNEROS: There's so many key issues where she's always siding with Republicans, and he could become the Joe Manchin of the House. We don't want Henry Cuellar to be the deciding vote on the future of our fundamental freedoms and rights in this country. We just can't risk that. KURTZLEBEN: Cisneros is endorsed by progressives like Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. But this district moved slightly toward Trump in 2020, and Cuellar is one of the most conservative House Democrats. Moreover, he was the only House Democrat last year who voted against a bill that would codify Roe v. Wade. Cuellar has said his faith leads him to oppose abortion but that it should be allowed in cases like incest, rape and protecting a pregnant person's life. Speaking to NPR before the week, he downplayed abortion's importance in the primary. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) HENRY CUELLAR: I don't run on, you know, I'm pro-life. You never heard me say that. When I talk to voters, you know, except for when I'm at church and I'll have some people - thank you for your vote on abortion. But I don't go running on abortion. KURTZLEBEN: Now, however, it's an unavoidable topic. But when Texas Public Radio asked Cuellar after the leak about Cisneros's attacks on his abortion stance, Cuellar changed the subject. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CUELLAR: There's a lot of issues out there, and she needs to spend some time on how she's going to defend the border. KURTZLEBEN: Lawmakers and voters of both parties have steadily fallen in line on abortion in recent decades. The group Democrats for Life of America, which opposes abortion rights, labeled 125 House Democrats pro-life as of the late 1970s. Today, Cuellar is the only one they consider pro-life. And that shift is reflected in the Democratic electorate. Today, only around 1 in 10 Democrats believe abortion should be illegal in all circumstances, down from 1 in 4 in the mid-'70s, according to Gallup. Meanwhile, around half believe it should be legal in any circumstance, up from 1 in 5. Former Illinois Democratic Congressman Dan Lipinski unintentionally illustrated the rarity of Dems opposed to abortion rights at the March for Life this year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DAN LIPINSKI: And we got Democrats for Life of America out here, wherever you're at in this big crowd. Must be muffled in the big crowd here. KURTZLEBEN: Over time, the two parties have sorted themselves apart on many, many issues, but abortion has played an outsized role in that sorting, says Ziad Munson, a professor of sociology at Lehigh University. ZIAD MUNSON: I think we got to this point because of very specific political strategies by political entrepreneurs starting in the late 1980s and going into the 1990s to move abortion to the center of the Republican Party. And I think that the political strategy that lay behind that was to fracture the Democratic coalition. KURTZLEBEN: Subsequently, Munson added, Democrats likewise more fully embraced abortion rights. Over time, anti-abortion rights Democrats have either been voted out of office or changed their views. Joe Biden in 1982 supported a law that would have allowed individual states to overturn Roe v. Wade, but by his 2020 presidential run, he had changed his mind. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: A woman does have a right to choose. I would, in fact - if they rule it to be unconstitutional, I will send to the United States Congress - and it will pass, I believe - a bill that - excuse me - legislates Roe v. Wade. KURTZLEBEN: Voters' abortion views are, of course, driven by real moral convictions. But layered in with those convictions, there are undeniable political forces nudging people around. And one major political force supporting abortion rights is Emily's List. Christina Reynolds is its vice president of communications. CHRISTINA REYNOLDS: Certainly we would like to think that we are a part of it. We would argue it is an important part - you know, it should be an important part of being a Democrat, and hopefully of being in elected office, that you support everyone's freedom to decide, to make these choices themselves and not have government make them for us. KURTZLEBEN: And groups like Emily's List are working to vote Cuellar out. That outside support worries Eddie Lucio, a retiring Texas Democratic state senator who sponsored SB 8, the restrictive law that bans abortion after about six weeks. He backs Cuellar. EDDIE LUCIO: I really respect him standing his ground on this. The young lady running against him - she's the recipient of obviously money from throughout the United States to try to knock off the last pro-life Democrat in the Congress. KURTZLEBEN: Cuellar, for his part, has held this seat since 2005, and he has the backing of the most powerful House Democrats, which he bragged about at a recent rally. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CUELLAR: Look; Pelosi has endorsed me. Steny has endorsed me. Clyburn has endorsed me. The head of the Black Caucus has endorsed me. The head of the Hispanic Caucus has endorsed me. And many other leaders have endorsed me. KRISTEN DAY: They recognize the importance of this race. KURTZLEBEN: Kristen Day, executive director of Democrats for Life of America, says that Cuellar's establishment support is simply about electability. DAY: And this is what has been happening and this is why we have fewer pro-life Democrats in Congress, is we have these radical progressive candidates come in. KURTZLEBEN: Again, nationally, Democrats have grown more in favor of abortion rights. But House elections are about local opinions, and Cuellar thinks his moderation helps him in a district Republicans are targeting. CUELLAR: If you look at the urban Democrats compared to the rural Democrats - very, very, very different. I mean, if you talk about the Second Amendment, you start talking about hunting - very different positions in south Texas than if you go to my San Antonio area. KURTZLEBEN: And while Democrats are the party of abortion rights, Lehigh University's Munson says parties prioritize winning over issues. MUNSON: The political system that we have, particularly the two-party system, is designed around finding, promoting and getting politicians elected who represent the party, right? Parties are a way - like, their primary purpose is to win elections. KURTZLEBEN: Democrats on May 24 will find out whether their South Texas voters still support someone who opposes abortion rights.

In Atlanta's distant suburbs, voters across the political spectrum report that local life is good in 2022 \u2014 but the direction of the country is not. That's one of three major insights we gained while interviewing voters in a key state. We visited two metro Atlanta counties \u2014 one blue and one red, both prosperous, populous and diverse. In this fall's elections, Georgia's U.S. Senate race could plausibly decide control of the entire Senate. The governor's race and legislative contests may decide who writes, signs or vetoes abortion legislation after an expected Supreme Court ruling that could overturn Roe v. Wade. The overall results may show the level of former President Donald Trump's influence in a state at the center of his efforts to overturn his election defeat in 2020. We interviewed 36 people in Democratic-leaning Gwinnett County and Republican-leaning Forsyth County, ranging from local officials and activists to people we found by knocking on doors. Meeting people face to face in their neighborhoods offers insights that public opinion polling may not. It's useful to see where people live \u2014 the geography, the economy and who lives next door. We asked people open-ended questions about what was on their minds rather than specifically prompting them as polls do. We came away with three insights that seem likely to apply to elections in many parts of the country. The blue and red counties are both growing: Metro Atlanta is a corporate, technology and cultural center. Both reflect the national economic recovery from the pandemic. Gwinnett's affordable housing market has fueled phenomenal growth for 30 years: The population has nearly tripled in that time, approaching 1 million. Forsyth's population has more than quintupled in the same period, from 44,000 to about 250,000. New housing developments fill valley after valley. Both counties have attracted migrants from across the nation and around the world; nearly everyone we met was originally from somewhere else. Prosperity is not universal. We visited immigrant neighborhoods where many people crowd into a single house. Inflation is climbing in Georgia, like everywhere. Yet residents told us they like where they live, and when asked to name concerns in their community, most in both counties found little to be concerned about. A farmer's market in downtown Norcross, Ga., is one of the places where an NPR team spoke with voters.\n                \n                    \n                    Steve Inskeep/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption A farmer's market in downtown Norcross, Ga., is one of the places where an NPR team spoke with voters. Forsyth resident Vicky Lou Kerner follows politics \u2014 she has decorated her restaurant with a sign reading, \"Warning: Does Not Play Well With Liberals\" \u2014 but when asked about local issues mentioned only traffic and construction, problems associated with growth. Joan Van Lake of Gwinnett didn't name any local concerns. \"My issues are more national,\" she said. Talking at a farmer's market in the prosperous town of Norcross, she expressed concern about \"the Big Lie and what just came out from the Supreme Court,\" referring to false claims of a stolen presidential election in 2020, and a leaked draft opinion suggesting the court is close to overturning a constitutional right to abortion. She supports abortion rights. Some parents worry about what's being taught in schools \u2014 but not necessarily their own. This reflects a national trend. Vicky Lou Kerner is the owner of Vicky Lou's Burgers in Forsyth County, Ga. The signs posted on her counter include one that reads, \"Warning: Does Not Play Well With Liberals.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Steve Inskeep/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Vicky Lou Kerner is the owner of Vicky Lou's Burgers in Forsyth County, Ga. The signs posted on her counter include one that reads, \"Warning: Does Not Play Well With Liberals.\" Some people don't plan to vote this year. \"I don't have the knowledge to vote correctly,\" said Bradley Coughlin of Gwinnett, who voted in 2020 to get Trump out of office, but says he doesn't know congressional, state or local candidates as well as presidential contenders. All this is consistent with the information environment. The number of local newspapers in many communities has declined in recent years, while national media are more polarized. People in both the blue county and the red county look out their windows at growing, livable, diverse American communities. Then they read stories of a nation in grave peril from the other party. Those who do vote are likely to act on national issues. Studies find Americans increasingly geographically divided by political party. This segregation is visible on county-by-county election maps, where big metropolitan areas tend to be colored deep blue, and rural areas deep red. Gwinnett and Forsyth are next to each other, affected by many of the same cultural and economic trends, yet in 2020 Gwinnett voted 58% for President Biden and Forsyth voted 65% for Trump. It's not clear from studies how often people move specifically for political reasons, but our random interviews found people who said they did. Esther Harding lived in Gwinnett years ago, when its populace was more Republican. After seeing the county change, she moved a year and a half ago to a new neighborhood in Forsyth. This recently built neighborhood in Forsyth County, Ga., is in a rapidly growing area that now has its own new state legislative district and is one of the areas where an NPR team went door to door talking with voters.\n                \n                    \n                    Steve Inskeep/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption This recently built neighborhood in Forsyth County, Ga., is in a rapidly growing area that now has its own new state legislative district and is one of the areas where an NPR team went door to door talking with voters. \"Forsyth is a great county to live in,\" she said. \"It's not as Democratic ruled as Gwinnett is. ... That's super important for us because, you know, we have values and in Gwinnett, you don't get those.\" Asked which values she meant, she listed opposition to illegal immigration, opposition to abortion and her concern about \"what the kids are being taught in school.\" Her main concern is the governor's race. \"[I'm] just praying that Stacey Abrams won't take over,\" she said, referring to the Democratic candidate. Harding is concerned enough about this to support incumbent Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, even though she's unhappy with Kemp for affirming Trump's 2020 defeat. Her next-door neighbor told us she moved from Los Angeles to Forsyth County partly because LA was \"so Democratic,\" allowing too much \"freedom\" and \"sexuality.\" Both the red and blue counties reflect America's demographic changes. Both have growing numbers of people of color and immigrants. Gwinnett is especially diverse: Its population is nearly one-quarter Latino, largely of Mexican descent but with many other nations represented. There are substantial Black and Asian populations. Up to now, diversity has been good for Democrats. As recently as 10 years ago, Gwinnett was a Republican county that voted for Mitt Romney for president. A changing electorate brought Democrats to the fore, not only voting for Biden but controlling the entire five-member county commission. Similar changes across the nation fuel some conservative conspiracy theories.

Fox News host Tucker Carlson is a leading advocate of \"replacement theory,\" an unfounded claim that Democrats are \"replacing\" current voters with new ones. It draws on racist ideas that foreign voters will be more \"obedient,\" to use Carlson's word. The national demographic change colors debates over immigration, policing, history, education and almost every other issue. Yet Republicans have been fighting for a share of the more diverse electorate. In Gwinnett County, Republican-led redistricting created a red-leaning state legislative district that includes a large Korean American community. The Republican candidate, running unopposed in the primary, is Soo Hong, a Korean immigrant and lawyer. Hong told us she is \"definitely\" part of an effort for her party to win over voters of color. \"I don't think diversity means Democrats,\" she said.

Republicans have opened community centers in Black and immigrant neighborhoods around metro Atlanta. Their likely U.S. Senate candidate is Herschel Walker, who's Black. The onetime football star is endorsed both by Trump and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. National political analysts took note in 2020 when Trump fared better than expected among some groups of Latinos in South Florida and South Texas. Republicans in 2022 hope to widen that opening. National Democrats differ on how seriously to take this threat. Some wrote off the 2020 results to local factors, while others worry about a serious erosion of their coalition. Our interviews with voters in Gwinnett and Forsyth counties suggest Democrats have some reason to worry. We found several immigrants, from Latin America and beyond, who were socially conservative; who oppose illegal immigration (saying they came legally); or who voted for Trump in 2020. We also met a Gwinnett County shop owner, Iris Magayon, who's an immigrant from Mexico and recently became a U.S. citizen.

Brenda Lopez Romero, Gwinnett County's Democratic chair and herself an immigrant from Mexico, told us Republicans have done better than Democrats for years in targeting messages to the Latino community. She said many Latinos worry about more than immigration issues, and Democrats must \"ensure that prosperity is available for everyone,\" especially working-class families. \"The election cycle is going to be won by the Latino vote,\" she said, \"and not enough has been done to ensure that we continue to reach out ... including here in my county, and that's the work that we still have to do.\" The audio for this story was produced by Nina Kravinsky and Chad Campbell, and edited by Kelley Dickens.

But his right-wing rival Marine Le Pen did better than last time, implying a divided France.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: French President Emmanuel Macron was elected to a second term at the end of April and sworn in over the weekend. And even though Macron won, the right wing's Marine Le Pen did increase her votes from when the two of them faced off five years ago. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports that Le Pen's support is strongest in the parts of France that feel left behind. (SOUNDBITE OF CHURCH BELLS RINGING) ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: The Normandy town of Elbeuf is far from the holiday and D-Day beaches that draw thousands of tourists. The city's main draw in the last century were textile factories that earned Elbeuf the title of sheep capital. But those days are long gone. (Speaking French). Residents Raymond and Stefane Blot both voted for Marine Le Pen. The 68-year-old retiree and his 29-year-old son, who receives disability benefits because he's illiterate, both live in subsidized public housing. They say it's harder to get a spot these days because of Ukrainian refugees. RAYMOND BLOT: (Through interpreter) Marine Le Pen thinks of the French first. Of course it's bad for these poor people in the war, but the French need to come first. Our president is more concerned for Europe than for France, and he has enriched the rich and left the poor like us on the side of the road. BEARDSLEY: The Blots describe taking part in the yellow vest protests a few years ago. The working-poor movement from the heartland dogged Macron for much of his term. Christophe Guilluy is author of \"Twilight Of The Elites.\" He says France today is divided by geography, and the Blots belong to what he calls peripheral France.

And for the last 20 years, job and wealth creation has been concentrated in the cities where most ordinary people don't live. And this creates a huge democratic and cultural malaise. BEARDSLEY: He says France is no longer split along traditional left-right politics. GUILLUY: (Through interpreter) The candidates who made it to the second round this time and in 2017 were instrumental in ending the left-right era. Neither Macron nor Le Pen believes in this divide, and they're the ones getting the most votes today. BEARDSLEY: Macron boasts creating high-tech jobs. He has brought France's unemployment rate down to 7%, the lowest in a decade. His problem - you don't feel that in this corner of Normandy. AUTOMATED VOICE: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: Neighboring Tourville la Riviere has had a communist mayor since 1945, but that didn't stop the town from voting for Le Pen. Resident David Mercier says people believed she would bring back solid factory jobs. DAVID MERCIER: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: \"The jobs created nowadays are precarious, minimum-wage positions for young people,\" he says. \"There's no future in such work. People are fed up.\" (CROSSTALK) BEARDSLEY: Thirty percent of Elbeuf's population lives below the poverty level. Kids play soccer in a public housing project that stands in jarring contrast to the town's older buildings and churches. There are also many immigrants, old and new. Djamilla Jeudevois' parents came to France from Algeria. The unemployed 47-year-old is raising her four kids in the same housing project where she grew up. DJAMILLA JEUDEVOIS: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: \"Le Pen is better,\" she says. \"We voted for her because she does what she says. Macron doesn't keep his promises.\" Jeudevois says Macron pushed job training to gain new skills. \"I don't want training,\" she says, \"I just want a job.\" (SOUNDBITE OF CASH REGISTER BEEPING) BEARDSLEY: Najate Saoues is shopping in a budget grocery store in Elbeuf. Saoues, who wears a hijab, voted for Macron but says she doesn't begrudge those who chose Le Pen, even though Le Pen has advocated banning the Muslim veil in public. NAJATE SAOUES: (Through interpreter) Not everyone who votes Le Pen is racist, not at all. I know many. People are just tired of trying to get by with less. Whether they're French, immigrants, veil-wearers, we're all affected. BEARDSLEY: Saoues says a vote for Le Pen is a vote of anger against Macron and in support of a candidate who represents the forgotten France. Eleanor Beardsley, NPR News, Elbeuf, Normandy.

Here, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., arrives for a news conference at the U.S. Capitol on March 18.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republicans are favored to take back the House in November's midterm elections, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. Here, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., arrives for a news conference at the U.S. Capitol on March 18. All signs are pointing to a difficult midterm election for President Biden and Democrats, and a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll has fresh evidence of that. Of the 1,162 registered voters surveyed, 47% said they are more likely to vote for the Republican in their district, as opposed to 44% who said Democrats. (The poll has a margin of error of 3.7 percentage points, which means results could be almost 4 points higher or lower.) It's the first time in eight years that Marist's survey has found Republicans with an advantage on the congressional ballot test. Back then, months before the 2014 midterm elections, Republicans had a 5-point edge in the poll and then won control of both the House and Senate. This past November, Democrats had a 5-point advantage on the question, and traditionally, Democrats need a lead of at least a few points to do well or break even. That's because their voters are largely compacted in urban areas and because congressional districts across the U.S. are drawn in a way that broadly favors Republicans. When Democrats won control of the House in 2018, they had a 6-point edge in the poll, for example. In this survey, independents \u2014 an important swing group, particularly in suburban areas \u2014 said they favor Republicans by 7 points, 45% to 38%. There is a significant gender gap overall and in suburbs, with a majority of women favoring Democrats and a majority of men wanting Republicans in charge. Republicans are also favored on a raft of issues, including double-digit advantages on inflation, crime and national security. Inflation, in particular, is critical, considering Americans say it is their top concern. Of note, about three times as many independents say they think Republicans would do a better job controlling inflation as they say Democrats. Democrats, on the other hand, have big leads on handling LGBTQ rights and climate change, and they have a 12-point edge on dealing with the coronavirus. Notably, on immigration, however, the country is split, with lots of U.S. adults undecided. How that moves will be important to watch in the coming months, as the Biden administration has indicated it will soon be lifting Title 42, a section of the law cited to keep immigrants out of the country due to the coronavirus pandemic. A surge of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border is expected if that lifts. People are growing more optimistic about the coronavirus's trajectory, with three-quarters saying they think the end of the pandemic is near. And a majority continues to approve of how Biden is handling it. Loading... Overall, Biden's approval rating stands at 41%. That's up 2 points from his low of 39% last month, once the boost he got from his State of the Union address wore off. Biden continues to have an intensity problem \u2014 37% of adults said they strongly disapprove of the job he's doing, while just 16% said they strongly approve. There's a clear generational divide on how Biden is viewed. Essentially, the older people are, the more likely they are to approve of the job he's doing and vice versa, and that holds for intensity as well. Black voters give Biden the highest approval of any group polled, aside from self-declared Democrats and Biden voters. Two-thirds of Black voters said they like the job Biden is doing, compared with just 40% of Latino voters who said so. In fact, a majority (55%) of Latinos disapprove of the job he's doing. A caveat here: The margin of error is almost 9 percentage points because of the sample size, but the finding may be a significant warning sign for Democrats. Democrats need Latinos to show up in key states in this midterm election. And many counties with significant Latino populations, in South Florida and South Texas, in particular, showed Biden faring worse than Hillary Clinton did in 2016 \u2014 despite Biden doing better than Clinton in most other places. All that said, just because Biden's approval is underwater doesn't mean that this equates to him losing a 2024 reelection bid. Biden's favorability rating, for example, is just 42% favorable to 54% unfavorable among voters. But that 42% is actually 3 points higher than how former President Donald Trump is viewed (39% to 56%). Biden continues to struggle with how the public perceives he's handling the economy \u2014 just 39% approve of the job he's doing with it. That's down 6 points from March. Biden has also seen a decline in his handling of the situation in Ukraine \u2014 just 44% approve, down from 52% on a similar question in March. The survey of 1,377 adults, including 1,162 registered voters, was conducted from April 19 through Tuesday. Live interviewers with Marist reached survey respondents via landline and cellphone, with interviews conducted in English and Spanish.",

After weeks of calls from Democrats in Congress for the White House to produce a more detailed plan for when it lifts Title 42 next month, the Department of Homeland Security released additional details Tuesday afternoon. For weeks, Democrats have been divided on whether Title 42 should end. Several Democrats have expressed how an expected surge of migrants might cause chaotic scenes at the border ahead of the midterm elections and argued for extending Title 42, which keeps out migrants from a country where a communicable disease was present. The public health order was first issued in early 2020 under the Trump administration as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold. It prevented migrants from crossing the Southern border, including anyone seeking asylum. But in the past month, immigration advocates have been sounding the alarm about the detrimental effects on the Democratic Party in the midterm elections if Title 42 is not lifted. They say if Democrats don't oppose removing the public health order, they risk losing base voters at a time when there is already low enthusiasm. \"Democrats don't really have anything to gain by supporting Title 42, And they're not going to get credit from Republicans for doing so,\" Bri Gillis, political director at the National Immigration Law Center, told NPR. \"Conceding these Republican talking points is not a political winner,\" she said. Vanessa Cardenas, deputy director at America's Voice, says Democrats are losing out on an opportunity to drive home their beliefs on immigration \u2014 the same ideas that got them elected in 2018 and 2020. \"In an election year where margins matter, Latino voters and other voters who care about this issue are going to be profoundly disappointed,\" she said, adding that Democrats are \"playing on the Republicans' field.\" Gillis also points to the \"void in messaging\" from the White House the past few weeks as a cause for concern. And Cardenas says the White House hasn't been proactive or aggressive enough in outlining its existing plan and communicating that to Democrats on Capitol Hill who are expressing reservations. On Monday, the White House continued to emphasize that lifting Title 42 on May 23 has not changed and the only way it could change is if Congress chooses to act. But when asked if Biden would sign or reject legislation that would delay Title 42, White House press secretary Jen Psaki did not give a direct answer. \"There's a lot of steps between now and then. So, at this point, that's very premature,\" Psaki said at Monday's press briefing. \"There are many members who strongly would like to see Title 42 extended. There are many who strongly have the other point of view. So, we are not anywhere near that point in time.\" CNN reported that the White House held a briefing call with Capitol Hill staffers on Tuesday to further outline the administration's plans, but it came nearly a month after the announcement that Title 42 would be lifted. Gillis says the lack of messaging from the White House has, in part, led to a point where Republican talking points are getting highlighted instead. \"We need to see Democrats filling that void, not with Republican talking points and embracing rhetoric on the right and operating from a place of fear, but we need Democrats to do exactly what voters elected them to do. And that is put forth solutions,\" Gillis said. Though the White House says Congress could change the course of Title 42, the order is now caught up in the courts, as well. A federal judge on Monday afternoon issued a temporary restraining order on any changes to Title 42, which is set to last two weeks, though it could be extended and potentially interfere with the May 23 deadline to lift it that the Biden administration has announced. Gillis argues that Democrats taking on a lukewarm or supportive stance toward keeping Title 42 will lose the party some of its base voters. And right now, she says what Democrats need is enthusiasm among their own base. \"The political cost of moving to the right ... is going to lose them some of those base voters,\" Gillis said. \"Democrats know that their recipe for success in winning these tough states is having an enthusiastic base, which we know poll after poll is showing where Democrats are losing voters.\" In a recent NBC News poll, Republicans have a 17-point advantage over Democrats in enthusiasm for the midterm elections. The poll showed 67% of Republicans indicating a high level of interest in the midterms, versus 50% of Democrats. Where Democrats could lose out on by opposing Title 42, though, is with independent voters. Only 31% support the Biden administration deciding to end Title 42. And right now, independents favor Republicans over Democrats by double digits, according to NBC News polling.",

In Arizona, Rep.

The economy and immigration are central issues in the campaign and progressive politics are far from top of mind.

            "article_content": "U.S. officials pledged more cash and more weapons. French President Macron beats his far-right rival to win reelection. Amazon labor unions are looking for another win in New York.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin have wrapped up a not-so-secret visit to Ukraine, where they met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. LEILA FADEL, HOST: It's the first official U.S. visit since the war began. The U.S. officials pledged more cash and more weapons. Speaking in Poland this morning, Secretary Blinken voiced confidence in Ukraine's military. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANTONY BLINKEN: Russia is failing. Ukraine is succeeding. Russia has sought, as its principal aim, to totally subjugate Ukraine, to take away its sovereignty, to take away its independence. That has failed. FADEL: He announced that U.S. diplomats could return to Kyiv in coming weeks. MARTIN: OK, so what more was promised? NPR's Brian Mann joins us this morning from Odesa in the south of Ukraine. Good morning, Brian. BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: What more can you tell us about what came out of this visit? MANN: Well, I think the first big message here was that the U.S. plans to stick by Ukraine. Along with all the money and firepower promised, this was really a symbolic gesture, this visit - two high-level U.S. officials in Ukraine's capital just weeks after the Russian army tried to capture Kyiv. Austin and Blinken did promise to boost military aid to Eastern Europe by another $700 million, including money to help countries in the region support Ukraine with guns and ammunition and the heavy weaponry that Ukrainian officials say they desperately need. Secretary Austin said those big guns from the U.S. are already arriving. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LLOYD AUSTIN: We are doing everything that we can to get them the types of support, the types of artillery and munitions that will be effective in this stage of the fight. MANN: And the Biden administration did also announce, after a long delay, they plan to finally nominate an ambassador to Ukraine, an experienced foreign service officer named Bridget Brink. She's now serving as ambassador to Slovakia. And the U.S. is going to also gradually reestablish its permanent diplomatic presence in Ukraine, eventually even reopening the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv. MARTIN: Although, we should say, that's a slower pace than several European allies, which have already sent their ambassadors back to Kyiv or have plans to do so. So, Brian, as we noted, you're in Odesa. This is the main port city in the south of the country. And it's been pretty quiet there for the duration of the war. There were, though, these missile strikes over the weekend that killed eight people. Can you tell us what happened? MANN: Yeah, this was really the latest wrenching moment in Russia's assault, Rachel. A missile struck an apartment building here. A young mother and a 3-month-old child were among the dead. Odesa had felt relatively safe, as you mentioned, and this was a shock coming on the Orthodox Easter weekend. Now some people are choosing to leave. I spoke last night with Ira Volkova, who was getting on an evacuation train to leave Odesa with her two young children. IRA VOLKOVA: (Speaking Ukrainian). MANN: \"We felt these explosions threaten us, and I'm afraid for the kids,\" she told me. And Volkova's situation gets at what so many Ukrainians are experiencing right now. VOLKOVA: (Speaking Ukrainian). MANN: She told me her husband is away fighting in the war. She doesn't know where he is. Her father was wounded fighting the Russians and is now in a hospital. And her brother is one of the defenders of the devastated city of Mariupol. \"We haven't heard anything about him for a month,\" Ira told me. \"We hope for the best.\" MARTIN: So this is happening in the south, where Odesa is. Russians are obviously pushing very hard in the east as well. Is there any evidence at this point, Brian, that they are tipping the balance? MANN: The Russian military says they're hitting hundreds of Ukrainian military targets, and this is shaping up to be a slow, bloody grind, but no big breakthroughs. The Ukrainian military actually claims to have retaken some territory and villages here in the south, where I am, around Kherson. NPR could not confirm that. Also, it does appear some of those Ukrainian soldiers dug in at the steel plant, Mariupol, are still alive. I will say, though, Rachel, the Ukrainians I talked to on the street here are really hopeful. They think their army has bought them time so that those bigger weapons can arrive and be deployed. MARTIN: NPR's Brian Mann reporting from Odesa, Ukraine. Thank you, Brian. MANN: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: OK, President Emmanuel Macron in France and his supporters celebrated his victory in the presidential election there under the Eiffel Tower last night. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Speaking French). (CHEERING) FADEL: Macron won a second term, but his lead was much smaller than his victory five years ago. With the excitement, for many, came a feeling of relief. Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally has never come so close to victory. MARTIN: So what does all this mean for France and Europe, for that matter? Joining us now from Paris, NPR's Eleanor Beardsley. Hey, Eleanor. ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: So a lot of the people who voted for Macron, I understand, did so just because they thought he was less bad, a lot less bad, than Marine Le Pen, right? BEARDSLEY: Yeah... MARTIN: So is that going to change how Macron governs? BEARDSLEY: Yeah, absolutely. So many people, especially voters on the left and working-class voters, feel betrayed by him. They say his platform is ultra-capitalist, and he's no centrist, and many people think he's very arrogant. But they could not accept, as you said, letting the far right get into power, so they held their nose and voted for five more years of Macron. Macron acknowledged them last night in his speech. Let's listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: He said, \"I know that many of you did not vote for me or my ideas but just to block the far right.\" So analysts say he's going to have to govern differently, with less hubris, more consultation. I spoke with political science professor Vincent Martigny, and he said Macron's legitimacy is not quite the same as in 2017. Let's listen to him. VINCENT MARTIGNY: His mandate is a lot weaker. So he'll have to make compromises. And the problem with Mr. Macron, he's not a very good compromiser. He's somebody who says, I listen, and at the end, I decide. MARTIN: So meanwhile, I mean, for Marine Le Pen, she lost the election, but, I mean, just coming this close is a kind of victory in itself, isn't it? BEARDSLEY: Oh, completely, Rachel. You know, she's campaigned as much more mainstream this time around. She didn't focus on immigration or have any kind of racist talk. A further-right candidate in the first round did that. She connected with voters on the economy, cost-of-living issues, and she gained a lot more voters. And her concession speech early on last night sounded more like a victory speech. Let's listen to her. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARINE LE PEN: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: So she says, \"with more than 43% of the vote, the results are a stunning victory. We're more determined than ever.\" She actually got around 41%, but she's right; it's a victory for her because the far right has never had such a huge score. She's now got her eye on the June legislative elections, which are very important. They're even known as the third round of the presidential election. She's going to try to deprive Macron of his majority, which he will need if he's going to implement his agenda. MARTIN: So place this in context for us, then, in a big-picture way, Eleanor. What does this election say about France right now? BEARDSLEY: So while it's complicated for Macron domestically, his win is a clear victory for Europe. And you could almost hear the collective sigh of relief across the continent at not having to deal with a President Le Pen, who could have been an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and would have chipped away at the union. It would have been a huge blow to the bloc at such a crucial time. And congratulations poured in from across Europe, and Macron also got a congratulatory tweet from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in French, who called him a real friend of Ukraine. MARTIN: NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reporting from Paris on the results of the French presidential election. Thank you so much, Eleanor. BEARDSLEY: Great to be with you guys. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: Amazon labor unions are looking for another win in New York. FADEL: Today, Amazon workers at a sorting facility in Staten Island will vote on whether or not to unionize. Roughly 1,500 warehouse workers are eligible to vote in the election, which goes on all week. MARTIN: NPR's Andrea Hsu is with us. And, Andrea, I mean, I'm probably not alone in remembering that this sort of just happened, didn't it? Wasn't there just a big union win at an Amazon facility in Staten Island? ANDREA HSU, BYLINE: Yeah, this is the second Amazon warehouse to vote on a union there. The first one was a much larger warehouse with more than 8,000 workers. It made history just several weeks ago when it became the first facility in the U.S. to unionize at Amazon. Now, that same scrappy union, the Amazon Labor Union that's run by former and current workers, they're trying to unionize the warehouse across the street. The workers there sort packages depending on where they're going, get them loaded onto trucks, and it's a physically demanding job that's very fast paced. Workers lift packages as heavy as 50 pounds. And what some of the workers say is that they want more breaks. They want better health and safety policies, along with more money, of course. MARTIN: So as recently as a month ago, I mean, a whole lot of people doubted whether any union could organize at Amazon. Now that it's happened once, is there momentum in the pro-labor direction? HSU: Well, certainly the Amazon Labor Union would say so. They're vowing that this is only beginning. Yesterday, they had this big rally outside the warehouse. Bernie Sanders was one of a number of notable guests, and here's what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BERNIE SANDERS: You have taken on one of the most powerful corporations in America. They spent millions of dollars trying to defeat you, and you beat them. (CHEERING) HSU: And Chris Smalls, the president of the union, says he's been contacted by workers at a hundred Amazon facilities across the U.S. who are interested in joining them. But Amazon is continuing to fight. They have spent millions of dollars on anti-union consultants, as the senator said, and they filed objections to the results of the first election, the one they lost. They say the National Labor Relations Board favored the union and helped them secure victory. And Amazon has also objected to some of the union's actions, charging that organizers harassed and threatened employees who weren't supporting the union and gave marijuana to workers in return for their support. In fact, the union organizers say they did give out weed, but not as a bribe. So a hearing is going to be held to consider these objections. MARTIN: OK, so that's what's happening in Staten Island in New York. What about elsewhere, though? HSU: Well, the other big warehouse that's voted is in Bessemer, Ala. - about 6,000 workers in that warehouse. There's no final result there because there are still hundreds of contested ballots, and now both sides, Amazon and the union, have filed objections. So that is dragging on. And then, Rachel, there was this brief hubbub last week when an election was announced at a small Amazon facility in New Jersey with 200 workers. Local 713 of the International Brotherhood of Trade Unions was the union behind this. It has no ties with the Amazon Labor Union. In the past decade, a couple of its leaders were indicted on corruption charges. I couldn't find a contact number for this union, so I reached out to a lawyer listed on some paperwork, and he informed me that the union had withdrawn its petition for an election. So a bit of a mystery there. And for now, the focus remains on Staten Island. MARTIN: OK. We'll keep following it. NPR's Andrea Hsu. Thank you so much. HSU: You're welcome.

Greg Stanton, D-Ariz., speaks during a news conference about infrastructure outside the U.S. Capitol on May 12, 2021. The path to keeping the Democrats' majority in the House of Representatives in November's midterms runs right through the Valley of the Sun in Arizona. Democratic Rep. Greg Stanton, a former mayor of Phoenix, won his district handily in 2020, but a redrawn map landed him on the GOP list of targeted lawmakers in 2022. The Republican field to take him on is diverse and determined to make the race about President Biden and the Democratic majority's record in Washington, while Stanton zeroes in on local issues. The 4th Congressional District's political breakdown could mirror that of the state's overall \u2014 roughly a third Democrats, a third Republicans and a third independents. Tanya Wheeless is one of the six GOP candidates vying for the nomination to challenge Stanton in November. The Republican primary is more than three months away but Wheeless stands out in the field, having secured the endorsements of top House GOP leaders like Elise Stefanik and the backing of the Congressional Leadership Fund, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's super PAC, to help her compete. After touring 21st Century Healthcare, a vitamin and supplement manufacturing company based in Tempe, Wheeless sat down with the company's leadership. \"What are the issues that you want me to go to Washington and fight for?\" she asked. Steve Snyder, the CEO, didn't hesitate. \"My first and foremost, it's immigration. Why are we playing games with these folks? If people want to come here and they want to work, we need workers,\" he said, before adding with a sigh: \"And get the politics out of it.\" Snyder said his company has not only had difficulty filling open positions, but also keeping workers that are in Arizona on green cards and are forced to leave because of government logjams with paperwork. Tanya Wheeless, who is vying for the Republican nomination for Arizona's 4th congressional district, spoke to leadership at 21st Century Healthcare about issues with hiring shortages and immigration.\n                \n                    \n                    Brent Barcena/21st Century Healthcare \n                    \n                \nhide caption Tanya Wheeless, who is vying for the Republican nomination for Arizona's 4th congressional district, spoke to leadership at 21st Century Healthcare about issues with hiring shortages and immigration. Wheeless told NPR she would support a targeted, not comprehensive, immigration bill in Congress. \"[Republicans are] really passionate about getting more boots on the ground for Border Patrol, [Democrats] really want something done on Dreamers, let's talk and see what we can do,\" she said. But when it comes to immigration, the debate right now is less about bringing in workers and more about border security. Stanton deliberately put distance between himself and the Biden administration when it comes to the border, especially its plan to lift Title 42 next month \u2014 a policy put in place under former President Donald Trump that barred migrants from entering the country during the pandemic. \"I've been critical of this administration for not doing more on getting a modernized immigration system that advances our economy, including immigration reform,\" Stanton told NPR in his Phoenix office. \"And I've been critical on the lack of preparedness for what's going to happen at the border if Title 42 goes away.\" He sidestepped a question about whether the president or other high ranking administration officials need to visit the border, repeating his critique: \"I need to see that this administration has a strong plan to prepare for what may happen, and I haven't seen it yet.\" Stanton won his reelection bid two years ago in what had been the 9th Congressional District by more than 20 points. The new map, which carves out Scottsdale and parts of Phoenix and adds redder areas of Mesa to the new 4th District, is less favorable to Democrats. But Stanton insists his strategy for the 2022 campaign won't change from his earlier bids for local office and for Congress. \"I'm going to talk a lot about my record because I am a mayor at heart,\" he said. \"I have a track record of success and a track record of successfully reaching across the aisle to get things done for the people that I represent. That's always been how I've operated. That's always how I'm going to operate.\" That record includes bipartisan efforts in Congress, including the $1 trillion infrastructure bill that passed the Senate last August. Stanton touts his seat on the panel that crafted the bill. The Arizona Democrat spent much of the two week spring recess pointing to his track record at steering federal money \u2013 earmarks in this year's spending bill \u2013 to his district. After the GOP banned them for years, arguing the practice was corrupt and added to overspending, Democrats brought them back. Members of both parties, especially those in competitive seats, are highlighting the federal infusion into local projects. Today I announced $300,000 in community project funding to @MayorGiles and @CITYOFMESA.This funding will help downtown small businesses pay for storefront improvements and give a fresh face to Mesa\u2019s thriving economy. pic.twitter.com/yVXrgLV3mG \"I work very closely with the cities that I'm lucky enough to represent in Congress, to go after their priorities, and the best way to do that is through the community project funding process,\" Stanton said. \"There were some really good ones: water projects for the city of Chandler, helping small business in the city of Mesa.\" But some of Stanton's constituents say, while those projects are fine, Democrats in Washington overpromised on what they could get done. \"It reminds me of a high school, like when there was someone running for class president,\" said Christina Sykes, an independent voter from Mesa. \"They're like, 'We're going to give you pizza every day for lunch and Kool Aid in the water fountains.' So I'm like, well, you know, show up! You guys not showing up.\" \"They don't have anything to show. You have the House, the Senate, the White House, what did you accomplish?\" asked Democrat Kelly Knepper. \"I'm still waiting for student loan debt to be canceled.\" Her partner Brian Knepper said Democrats made inroads in certain areas like pandemic aid and the confirmation of the first Black female Supreme Court justice, but aren't advertising their successes effectively. \"I think the things they didn't do are outshining the things they did do,\" he said. \"In 10 years, we're going to recognize the benefits of a lot of this legislation and the impact it's had on this country, but no one is talking that up now and so no credit is being given for the accomplishments.\" Knepper didn't mince words when it came to expectations for November: \"It feels like almost a foregone conclusion that they are going to lose the House and the Senate as soon as it is possible.\" When asked about demoralized Democrats and concerns over potential low turnout in the midterm election, Stanton repeatedly said his strategy is keeping the conversation local and reminding constituents about his ties here. \"I've successfully won all of [my] elections by doing exactly what I'm going to do in this election: let people know who I am and what I have done,\" he said. \"The voters know who has gone to work for them in advancing their interests and they also trust me.\" Mike Tomlinson, from Chandler, is a conservative voter. He points to inflation and border security as issues people in the area are feeling now, but says he's focused on education, and that the memory of kids being kept out of classrooms during the pandemic still stings. \"Kids lost out on, gosh, 18 months, two years of schooling,\" he said. \"I had a son that graduated in 2020, and, you know, there wasn't really a graduation.\" Diane Ortiz-Parsons, a Republican from Mesa, is engaged in local campaigns and a retired teacher. She said the impact of the pandemic is still a major issue. \"I'm concerned about the amount of depression that I see. I hear of people's kids that are needing to go to therapy,\" she said. \"Our churches are overwhelmed with people that need extra help right now.\" Republican challengers like Wheeless say the way the pandemic was handled is part of the reason people will vote to switch party control of Congress. \"What I'm hearing from people is they're very unhappy with some key kitchen table issues,\" Wheeless said. \"'My kids were locked out of school, the price of gas has gone up, it costs me more when I go to the grocery store. That ain't good and I want change.'\" Stanton said he plans to spend time back home talking about how Congress provided COVID-relief, like loans to businesses who were able to keep their doors open. \"We're going to talk about the work that we did during the worst pandemic in a hundred years to support families so that they could pay their bills and pay the rent.\" Hispanic voters in the district are expected to be targeted by both parties. Wheeless, whose grandparents immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico, says she's a candidate who can help Republicans extend the inroads they made with Hispanic voters in the last election. \"We've got a message that particularly resonates with the Hispanic community, which is about faith, freedom, entrepreneurship,\" she said. Stanton maintained he's been able to attract support from voters across the political spectrum. Ortiz-Parsons, who said Democrats have \"taken Hispanic voters for granted,\" added that she thinks Biden's low approval ratings will help swing independent voters to her party. \"Our greatest friend right now is President Biden. I expect real close to a complete sweep, because he's showing how poorly Democrats can run the country,\" she said. \"All those independents, I'm expecting them to come our way.\"",

The arrival of hundreds of Ukrainians at the border since the war began has added more pressure on the Biden administration to lift Title 42.\n                \n                    \n                    Gregory Bull/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ukrainian refugees wait in a bus stop near the Mexico border in early April. The arrival of hundreds of Ukrainians at the border since the war began has added more pressure on the Biden administration to lift Title 42. The public health order known as Title 42 \u2014 based on a decades-old and once obscure law \u2014 has captured attention recently as it's set to expire next month. That's a welcome move to some. Many immigration advocates and Democrats have been pressuring President Biden to lift it because it blocks migrants at the border from seeking asylum. But some in Congress, including a few close Biden allies, are saying it's too soon. With the midterm elections this year, some Democrats who face tight races are expressing concern that the White House doesn't have enough of a plan to tackle the likely influx of migrants at the border once Title 42 lifts. The order will be front and center when Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas testifies before the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday. Mayorkas is expected to field questions about lifting it, and he's likely to get pushback from both Republicans and Democrats. As it sees renewed interest, here are some Title 42 basics and a look at how the federal health order became the center of the current immigration debate. Title 42 comes from a federal law that dates back to 1944 meant to help prevent the spread of communicable disease. It's what essentially gave authority to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to take emergency action in March 2020, allowing immigration authorities to quickly expel migrants and denying entry to asylum seekers. The 1944 Public Health Service Act established an administrative structure for the country to deal with national and international health problems that could arise, both in war-time and in peace. Back then, tuberculosis was a major public health threat to the nation, and the Public Health Service Act helped provide grants for research and treatment of the disease. It also did things like establish the National Cancer Institute under the National Institutes of Health. Overall, it's pretty obscure \u2014 and definitely not a measure imagined to operate as central to the debate over immigration and asylum law. But in 2020, President Trump's administration invoked the order to restrict migrants' entry into the U.S., including for those seeking asylum at the southern border. That move was controversial, with many congressional Democrats decrying it as a harmful measure that dismantled the country's asylum system. Since it was invoked under Trump, Customs and Border Protection has counted more than 1.7 million expulsions of migrants at the border. Theresa Cardinal Brown from the Bipartisan Policy Center calls Title 42 the \"primary tool\" of managing migration at the border under both the Trump and Biden administrations. About half of those \"that were encountered at the border in the last year were expelled under Title 42,\" she told NPR in March. Title 42 has also made it hard to get an accurate number of migrants who are attempting to cross into the U.S. That's because many migrants have been trying to cross multiple times in the same month, then get counted more than once, according to Mayorkas. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced earlier this month that Title 42 would expire on May 23. But if Congress wanted to change course on Title 42 and delay it legislatively, they could. In fact, some Republican members of Congress attempted just that. A COVID-19 aid package was held up in early April when Republicans attempted to extend the order. Congress left for Easter recess before sorting it out, and the aid package did not pass. Lawmakers return this week and many are expected to resume their focus on trying to keep it in place. Plus, there's a bipartisan bill that was introduced earlier this month that would push back the expiration of Title 42. White House press secretary Jen Psaki has said that any delay on lifting Title 42 would require congressional action. In a word: influx. Government officials are bracing for a surge of migrants at the border once the order lifts. It \"will likely cause a significant increase in arrivals\" at the southwest border, according to a strategic plan released last month by the Department of Homeland Security. And some agency estimates say they'll see 18,000 border apprehensions per day, which is more than twice the average number of daily apprehensions last summer. \"Whenever Title 42 is lifted, there is likely, almost certainly, to be a surge,\" Doris Meissner, who leads the U.S. immigration policy program at the Migration Policy Institute, tells NPR. \"It will, no matter what, be perceived by intending migrants, and most importantly by smugglers, as the time to come.\" To prepare, the Department of Homeland Security released an extensive plan that puts more law enforcement officials on the southern border, increases their capacity to process new arrivals and implements more COVID-19 vaccination efforts. Immigration advocates have been critical of Biden for months and have long been pressuring him to lift Title 42. But, despite promising fairer immigration practices, the administration has actually held up the Trump-era policy and defended the use of Title 42 in court. Last month, the administration agreed to let unaccompanied migrant children cross the border but continues to block all other migrants, even families. While Democrats in Congress have been outspoken about ending Title 42 for months, the Biden administration repeatedly insisted \u2014 and continues to insist \u2014 that Title 42 is a public health order, and not immigration policy. In March, when Ukrainians started to try crossing the U.S.-Mexico border after fleeing the war, pressure on Biden mounted even more. Many more Democrats and Democratic congressional candidates have been expressing some apprehension about lifting Title 42 next month. Senators like Gary Peters of Michigan and Mark Kelly of Arizona say they want more of a plan from the White House on how to handle the surge of migrants at the border. Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware said recently he hoped lifting Title 42 would be \"reconsidered appropriately\" if there was a further rise in COVID-19 cases. Kelly and others have signed onto a bill with Republicans to delay lifting Title 42 by at least 60 more days. With midterm elections coming up, there's concern that Republicans will once again make immigration and the border a hot-button issue, and it worries vulnerable Democrats.",

            "article_content": "French voters cast their ballots Sunday. Polls show incumbent president Emmanuel Macron ahead of his rival, populist candidate Marine Le Pen.  DANIEL ESTRIN, HOST: French voters will cast their ballots Sunday for president. Polls show the incumbent president, Emmanuel Macron, beating his rival, populist candidate Marine Le Pen, but with a slimmer margin than five years ago. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley visited a town in a working-class region of France to look at why. (SOUNDBITE OF CHURCH BELL) ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: The northern French town of Arras was on the western front during World War I. It was also once part of the region's booming coal mining industry. That, too, is in the past. Last night, hundreds of people lined up to get into Marine Le Pen's final campaign rally before Sunday's vote. Nathalie and Frank Herblin both work in a factory nearby. They say Le Pen has the workers' best interests at heart. NATHALIE HERBLIN: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: \"We are sick of Macron and his globalization,\" they say. \"The rich are getting richer, but the working class is struggling. Marine will do everything to help the working class.\" Le Pen has moderated her party's image, drawing thousands of new supporters. Her mainstream makeover was enhanced by the presence of a candidate even further to the right. Eric Zemmour talked anti-immigration while Le Pen stuck to bread-and-butter economic issues. (SOUNDBITE OF CHURCH BELL) BEARDSLEY: In front of Arras' ornate town hall, I meet 67-year-old Evelyn. She says Le Pen may have changed, but she's still divisive. EVELYN: (Through interpreter) With everything that we've been through these last five years, the pandemic and this nightmare war between Russia and Ukraine, it's Macron who's calmly guided us through, listening to scientists and economists. He's young and didn't have much experience, but he's been amazing. I didn't vote for him last time, but I'm so proud to have such a president. BEARDSLEY: In Arras' cobbled medieval square, 24-year-old Marie Belmont is having a drink with her sister. She voted for far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon in the first round. She says she'll hold her nose and vote for Macron in the second. MARIE BELMONT: (Through interpreter) We're not voting for a president so much as voting against Marine Le Pen, to block her. BEARDSLEY: Belmont is continuing the French tradition known as Fair Barrage, or build a dam, against the far right. The dam was most notably erected in 2002, when millions of left-wing voters crossed over to support conservative Jacques Chirac to block Jean-Marie Le Pen, Marine's father. But analysts say the daughter today is nothing like her father, and the stigma of voting for Le Pen's party has diminished. ADRIEN D\u2019ANGLETERRE: The beginning of the battle was the 9 of April, 1917. BEARDSLEY: Adrien d\u2019Angleterre works in the tourist office, where he tells visitors about the World War I Battle of Arras. D\u2019Angleterre is into history, but says he's not very political. D\u2019ANGLETERRE: Yeah, obviously I'm going to vote, but I still don't know who I'm going to vote for. BEARDSLEY: Analysts say abstention could be high among young voters, which could help Le Pen, as could Macron's perceived arrogance that has created a deep well of resentment, especially among working class voters. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARINE LE PEN: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: At her rally, Le Pen called on the French to vote for her, reject Macron's vision of a globalized France, and preserve the soul of the country. Eleanor Beardsley, NPR News, Arras, France.

The two face off Sunday, in the second round of France's national election. French President Emmanuel Macron faces far-right challenger Marine Le Pen on Sunday, in a rematch of 2017's presidential election. The vote is a runoff election, since neither candidate won more than 50% of the votes in an earlier round of voting on April 10. But the final outcome is expected to be much closer than it was five years ago, when Macron defeated Le Pen with two-thirds of the vote. Currently, polls show Macron with a slight edge. Early results are expected to emerge after the last polling stations close at 8 p.m. local time Sunday, or 2 p.m. ET. The election's first round saw a participation rate of nearly 74% \u2014 a slight drop from the 2017 race. Here's why the election matters well beyond France's borders: At the heart of the election is a choice between a political centrist \u2014 Macron \u2014 and a right-wing populist, Le Pen. Right-wing sentiment has spread across Europe in recent years. Increased immigration, refugee crises, economic challenges and the coronavirus pandemic have all contributed to voters choosing right-wing candidates and policies \u2014 like Brexit, for instance, and Hungary's parliamentary elections this month, in which the party of autocratic leader Viktor Orban overcame a united effort by opposition parties to block his fourth term. Le Pen has called for dramatic reductions in immigration and a ban on Muslim headscarves. Her party, formerly known as the National Front, was founded by Le Pen's father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, and was once associated with Holocaust denialism and Islamophobia. The younger Le Pen has worked to soften the party's image. She has framed her policies as necessary to protect the interests of French women and LGBTQ people. Her competitiveness in this election is an indication that her efforts have worked, says Nonna Mayer, a French political scientist who studies the far right. \"She has given a new electoral dynamic to the party because she's a woman and she has managed to speak to and to rally female voters, which were repulsed by the father,\" Mayer says. Macron has spent much of his five years in office focused on Europe and strengthening the European Union. He has ambitiously worked to position himself as one of the continent's top diplomats, including in his past efforts to win over President Donald Trump and, more recently, his work to seek a peaceful solution to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. France has the second-largest economy in the European Union, and the defense  website Global Firepower says France has the EU's strongest military. But some French voters, dissatisfied with conditions at home, feel that Macron has prioritized the continent at the cost of conditions at home. \"Macron is annoying us with Europe. Every time he opens his mouth, he talks about Europe, Europe, Europe. When is he going to talk about France?\" says Raymond Blot, a resident of Elbeuf, in the northern Normandy region. Blot says he plans to vote for Le Pen. Le Pen has pitched herself as the candidate most focused on everyday French residents, especially working-class voters who've experienced economic hardship in recent years. But she has backed away from some of her most extreme positions, including her onetime campaign for France to leave the European Union. \"The electors care about the domestic situation first, and we elect the French president with the intention to have someone to defend French interests,\" says Martin Quencez, a Paris-based researcher at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. With Russia's war in Ukraine, Le Pen's long-criticized connections to Russia have been reanimated. The First Czech-Russian Bank loaned Le Pen's party 9 million euros in 2014. The loan has been under scrutiny ever since. Le Pen's personal ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, including a visit with the leader in Moscow in 2017, have also been fodder for criticism. Macron seized on these points during a presidential debate on Wednesday, accusing Le Pen of being in \"Russia's grip.\" \"You cannot correctly defend France's interests on this subject because your interests are linked to people close to Russian power,\" he said. \"You depend on Russian power, and you depend on Mr. Putin.\" Le Pen said French banks had refused to loan her party money, leaving her with no other choice. And on Wednesday, she said she supported the sanctions that France and other countries have placed on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine. But she also said the West's isolation of Russia could push Moscow toward China. \"This could be a huge risk for the West, for Europe and for France,\" she said.",

(from left) Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., and Ron Johnson, R-Wis., are all facing tough reelection contests this year.\n                \n                    \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images; Caroline Brehman/CQ-Roll Call, Inc/Getty Images; STR/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Incumbent Sens. (from left) Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., and Ron Johnson, R-Wis., are all facing tough reelection contests this year. The landscape has shifted. When President Biden took office, it was widely believed that Republicans had a strong chance of taking back the House but, thanks to a friendly map for Democrats, the Senate was more competitive. It was possible, if not likely, that Democrats \u2014 who control the Senate, which is split 50-50 \u2014 would retain the upper chamber and maybe even pick up a seat or two. That is not the thinking now. With Biden's struggling approval ratings in states across the country and high inflation a top concern for voters, Republicans have significantly improved their likelihood to take control of the Senate, based on conversations with operatives and strategists in both parties. Unlike in the House, when all 435 seats come up for election every two years, only a third of Senate seats do. (Senators serve six-year terms.) Of the 14 Democratic seats up this cycle, Biden won all of those states in the 2020 presidential election. In contrast, 21 Republican-held seats are up and Biden won in two of those states \u2013 Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But overall, several of the states up for grabs were very close in 2020, and the slightest push in the GOP's direction could tip the balance. As it is, Republicans have an advantage this year because traditionally midterm elections are lower-turnout affairs and the party out of power is able to more easily turn out its base, angry with the president. The Senate is less subjected to dramatic shifts, as compared to the House, but the party out of power in a president's first midterm has still won a net gain of two seats on average in the Senate since 1950. With that background in mind, here is the first NPR Top 10 Senate seats most likely to change hands in 2022. The analysis is based on reporting in the field, conversations with Democratic and Republican operatives and strategists, as well as publicly available data, such as ad spending and polling. We will update this periodically through Election Day. Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, center, and his Democratic Senate primary rival Rep. Conor Lamb wait as President Biden prepares to speak about the economy in Pittsburgh on Jan. 28.\n                \n                    \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The top of this top 10 is difficult, but an open seat in a state Biden won, where Republicans are facing a messy primary, is a place to start. This seat opened up when Republican Sen. Pat Toomey announced he would not run for reelection. Lt. Gov. John Fetterman has a big lead in the Democratic primary and is raising lots of money while Republicans have spent millions against each other. This is the Democrats' top target. With Wisconsin, they are two critical places for Democrats to try and hold the Senate. But they are facing stiff headwinds, however, as only about a third of Pennsylvania voters say they approve of the job Biden's doing. Former President Donald Trump stepped into the Republican primary fight over the weekend between David McCormick, a former hedge fund manager, and TV's Dr. Mehmet Oz, who faced controversy over his residency because he had been seen often at his home in New Jersey. Trump picked Oz, despite McCormick traveling to Mar-a-Lago recently in search of Trump's support and being married to a former top Trump aide. Privately, Republicans say they would be happy with either candidate, but that McCormick is viewed as the more mainstream conservative. Both candidates are very wealthy. They have already spent tens of millions of dollars, as have outside groups, and this is expected to be one of the most expensive races in the country. Georgia Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock speaks at a news conference on Jan. 4 in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock is running for his first full term after winning a special election last year. Georgia has seen lots of close and heated political fights in the last few years as the Sun Belt continues to change demographically. In a surprise, Biden won Georgia, but only by fewer than 12,000 votes out of almost 5 million. Notably, Warnock, the pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church, won his special election over former Sen. Kelly Loeffler by a wider margin. But Biden's approval has taken a nosedive in the state, with only about a third saying they approve of the job he's doing. The leading Republican in the race is former NFL running back Herschel Walker. Walker, a former Heisman-winning University of Georgia Bulldog who has Trump's endorsement, may have high name identification in the state, but he's untested as a candidate. Walker has written about his battle with dissociative identity disorder and is facing allegations of domestic abuse from past relationships and that he exaggerated his post-football business success. So far, Warnock has the money advantage, raising $30 million to Walker's $9 million, as of their last filings at the end of the year. Polls have had them neck and neck. Nevada Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto attends a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing on May 27, 2021.\n                \n                    \n                    Caroline Brehman/CQ-Roll Call Inc. via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption This race doesn't get as much attention as some of the others. Freshman incumbent Catherine Cortez Masto has largely maintained a low profile in Washington. But Republicans are more bullish about their chances here than in any other race. Nevada is one of those states that always seems to be close \u2014 Biden won it by just over 2 percentage points in 2020 and Cortez Masto won it by a similar margin in 2016 when she had the benefit of presidential-year turnout. It's also another state where Biden's approval rating is underwater, and if Democratic base groups aren't fired up \u2014 particularly Latino and Asian American voters in a state where they are key \u2014 that could make it difficult for Cortez Masto. Cortez Masto has the money advantage over likely Republican nominee Adam Laxalt, the state's former attorney general. And Democrats traditionally have a strong turnout operation in a state where most of the Democratic vote is concentrated in one place \u2014 Clark County (Las Vegas). With the passing of former Sen. Harry Reid, who is credited with building the ground game, there is an open question of how it will perform. Trump endorsed Laxalt, who has backed Trump's election lies, including in Nevada, which Trump lost by more than 33,000 votes. There are question marks about the strength of Laxalt as a candidate, considering he lost his bid for governor in 2018, though that was in a Democratic wave year and was by just 4 points. Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson speaks during a press conference outside the presidential office in Kiev, Ukraine, on Sept. 5, 2019.\n                \n                    \n                    STR/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Incumbent Republican Ron Johnson, a close Trump ally and antagonist of the left, is the most vulnerable GOP senator up for reelection this cycle. Johnson has survived in worse climates for Republicans, like in 2016. But his favorability ratings in the state are poor and Democrats are ready to spend tens of millions on trying to oust him. Biden won Wisconsin in 2020, but only by about 20,000 votes out of more than 3 million, and, reflecting the trend nationally, his approval rating in the state is upside down. Given the late primary (Aug. 9), it won't help Democrats that they will be fighting each other over the next four months. The leading Democrats are Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who starts out with a name ID and polling advantage, and Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry, 34, who worked in the Obama White House, is the son of Bucks owner Marc Lasry and appears willing to spend some of his own money on this race. Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly speaks during a press conference on Feb. 8.\n                \n                    \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic incumbent Mark Kelly cuts a good profile as a candidate \u2014 he's a former astronaut and has raised a substantial amount of money. Biden's approval has declined dramatically in Arizona, something Democrats think Kelly can weather because of his brand and he's seen more favorably. But in a difficult environment for Democrats and in a state that was decided by only about 10,000 votes in the 2020 presidential election, this one is shaping up to be close. Republicans, though, aren't off to a quick and easy start. They were unable to persuade Gov. Doug Ducey to run against Kelly and instead, they are engaged in a messy primary that won't be decided until August. Their top candidates are state Attorney General Mark Brnovich and two others who are far wealthier and whose campaigns have more money \u2014 Blake Masters, a former venture capital executive, and Jim Lamon, a former owner of a solar energy company. Trump is a factor in this race. After saying there was no evidence of election fraud in the state, Brnovich now says there are \"questions\" about the 2020 election. Lamon calls himself an \"America First conservative\" and Masters released a video with him saying right at the beginning \"I think Trump won in 2020.\" Look for immigration to become a big issue, as it always is in this border state. Republicans are looking to use the Biden administration's reversal of Title 42, which turned away migrants due to COVID concerns, against Kelly. And it's likely why Kelly has broken with the administration and criticizes it for not having a \"sufficient\" plan. New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan speaks during a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee meeting on Oct. 6, 2021.\n                \n                    \n                    Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Incumbent Democrat Maggie Hassan is seen as vulnerable because New Hampshire is often close. When she first won election in 2016, it was by about 1,000 votes. Hassan has some advantages, however \u2014 notably money and an uncertain Republican primary field, which won't be decided until a September primary. Republicans lost a key recruit when moderate Gov. Chris Sununu declined to run. Lots of candidates are in or eyeing the race, including Chuck Morse, the state Senate president; Bruce Fenton, a wealthy Bitcoin enthusiast with a libertarian streak; retired Army Gen. Don Bolduc, who finished second in the GOP Senate primary in 2020 and recently hired a high-profile GOP consultant; and Kevin Smith, former town manager of Londonderry. The filing deadline here isn't until June, so a lot can happen between now and then. The state has seemed to get less attention than at the outset of the cycle when Democrats were hopeful about potentially winning this open seat held by retiring Sen. Richard Burr. Part of that is a sleepy Democratic primary. Cheri Beasley, the first Black woman to serve as chief justice on the state Supreme Court, is expected to prevail in the May 17 primary, while Republicans are still undecided between Trump-backed Rep. Ted Budd, former Gov. Pat McCrory and to a lesser extent, ex-Rep. Mark Walker. If the environment were more positive for Democrats, they might be making a stronger push, but Senate Majority PAC, the outside group with the goal of electing Democratic senators, is not currently spending on ad buys in the state. Republicans see Beasley as a weak candidate and point out this is a state Biden lost in 2020 and his approval rating has nosedived here to below 40% and is underwater on his handling of issues, ranging from COVID and education to the economy and Ukraine. Democrats hope the Republican primary gets messier, no one gets above 30%, and it is forced to a runoff, which would mean two more months of GOP infighting. Trump certainly wants to avoid that and held a rally in the state Saturday, in part to try and boost Budd. This has been a state that has trended away considerably from Democrats in the last few presidential elections as the party has struggled with white, working-class voters. Rep. Tim Ryan, who has spoken to this problem and unsuccessfully challenged Nancy Pelosi for the House speakership, has the state party's endorsement. The Republican side, on the other hand, is crowded and bitter with candidates angling against each other \u2014 and for Trump's endorsement. Sen. Rob Portman's announced retirement has opened up quite a fight \u2014 almost literally \u2014 among Republicans here. Former state Treasurer Josh Mandel and investment banker Mike Gibbons got in each other's face and had to be separated at a debate last month over Gibbons' investment record and Mandel's inexperience in the private sector, which led to Mandel bringing up his military service in Iraq. Polls have shown Gibbons and Mandel locked in a dead heat, but not very far ahead of Hillbilly Elegy author J.D. Vance and former state GOP Chair Jane Timken. Mandel has had national ambitions for a while but he's a controversial figure who failed in a Senate bid in 2012 and dropped out during the 2018 primary. There are millions of dollars in ads coming from the candidates (Gibbons had spent almost $6 million already by the end of 2021), super PACs and dark money groups in this race, and with the polls as close as they are, it's not entirely clear where this primary is headed. The good news for Republicans is all that will be over with in about three weeks with the May 3 primary, and early voting is already underway. Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio speaks at the Heritage Foundation on March 29 in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democrats have lost Florida in presidential elections by increasingly wider margins since Barack Obama won it in 2008. And Biden's approval in the state, like elsewhere, is down. That makes this a longshot for Democrats to start with. Incumbent Sen. Marco Rubio starts out with the clear advantage, but Democrats are pleased with the fight that Rep. Val Demings is waging. She was on pace in fundraising with Rubio, as of the end of the year, in this very expensive state because of its multiple media markets. Rubio leads in the polls, but isn't above 50% in many, and Democrats see this as a defensive liability for Republicans, where they may have to spend some money to defend Rubio if the race gets closer. If the wave is big enough, this could be one that becomes competitive. Republicans believe it's winnable if there are swings like the ones seen in Virginia and New Jersey in 2021. Generally, they say Colorado is a difficult state for them largely because of the state's highly educated population, which has made Trump unpopular, even among many Republicans Democratic incumbent Michael Bennet is favored to win reelection, but even Democrats acknowledge Colorado \u2014 and Washington state \u2014 is a state they are not taking their eyes off. Republicans don't have an obvious candidate, but it is now down to two: Joe O'Dea, a construction company executive, and state Rep. Ron Hanks, who has endorsed Trump's election lie. Over the weekend, Hanks won his spot on the ballot for the late June primary by getting the most votes at the Colorado GOP state assembly. \"I fully expected Donald Trump to win in 2020 \u2014 and he did,\" Hanks, who was in Washington on Jan. 6 to attend Trump's rally ahead of the insurrection at the Capitol, said Saturday during his assembly speech. \"When we saw what we saw on election night in 2020, it changed everything. Just like the changes we felt after 9/11.\" O'Dea made the ballot by collecting enough signatures.",

            "article_content": "French voters go to the polls this weekend to decide whether to give president Emmanuel Macron a third term. He's in the lead, but far right leader Marine Le Pen is right behind and closing the gap.  SCOTT DETROW, HOST: French voters go to the polls this weekend to decide whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second term. Macron is in the lead, but far-right leader Marine Le Pen is right behind and has rapidly closed the gap. Ten other candidates trail them. Le Pen's supporters say their candidate is different this time around and has redefined herself. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley attended a Le Pen rally in the south of France and sends us this report. UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Chanting, inaudible). ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: A better prepared, poised and more moderate Marine Le Pen took the stage in front of thousands of supporters in Perpignan Thursday night. It's Le Pen's third attempt at the presidency. Last time, she lost handily to Macron. This time, she sounds different. Gone are her fearful messages on immigration and the European Union. Le Pen this time around is about unity and inclusion. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARINE LE PEN: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: \"French people of all origins and religions, from the continent to the islands, I salute you respectfully and call on you - your country needs you.\" Analysts say Le Pen has managed to detoxify the party started by her father 50 years ago. She even changed the name. The National Front became the National Rally. A look at this crowd is further proof. There are white-collar executives, young people, women. Forty-six-year-old Thierry Tsagalos runs a startup. He says he used to vote traditional right but considers candidate Valerie Pecresse too weak. He says Le Pen has gained credibility with mainstream conservative voters. THIERRY TSAGALOS: (Through interpreter) I support Le Pen. She's solid. She's not excessive or radical in her language. There is no point in dividing the French. The point is to make a good project, and she does not exclude people. BEARDSLEY: Tsagalos calls Le Pen a positive populist. Voters here bristle if they're referred to as far-right. Le Pen also looks more moderate this time around, thanks to candidate Eric Zemmour. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ERIC ZEMMOUR: (Non-English language spoken). BEARDSLEY: Zemmour, a former right-wing TV pundit, regularly rages about immigration and Islam. While he surged in December and January, Zemmour's message appears to have lost steam, especially after the war in Ukraine began. His previous support of President Vladimir Putin hurt him further. At the Perpignan rally, retiree Patrick Froment says Zemmour sounds a lot like Le Pen's more extreme father. Marine Le Pen has modernized for the 21st century, he says. PATRICK FROMENT: (Through interpreter) She's a very poised, calm woman now. She's really hit her stride. She doesn't get ruffled. She doesn't get angry anymore. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LE PEN: (Non-English language spoken). BEARDSLEY: Le Pen regularly evokes Macron in her rallies - his arrogance, his support of the rich and the elites, his supposed disrespect of the little guy. She contrasts that with what she says is her support of French workers - the teacher, the nurse, the farmer. That's what drew local winegrower Ludovic Servant to Le Pen. LUDOVIC SERVANT: (Non-English language spoken). BEARDSLEY: He waves a Le Pen flag as her fleet of campaign buses pulls away after the rally. Servant, originally from the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, says Macron lacked respect for the little people, and Le Pen wants to take care of them. SERVANT: I like Marine Le Pen because... (Through interpreter) ...Because she's the only one who's very attentive to those who live in rural areas, because she is sensitive. She thinks about what kinds of problems people in the countryside, in agriculture face. BEARDSLEY: Throughout this campaign, Le Pen has focused on economics and bread-and-butter issues. It seems to be paying off as her numbers are surging. She is only three points behind Emmanuel Macron in the latest polls. Eleanor Beardsley, NPR News, Perpignan.

            "article_content": "Buying a home has become a lot more expensive. Democrats are trying to balance multiple global crises ahead of fall's midterm elections. The drive to unionize Starbucks stores is gaining ground.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Buying a house has been hard for years, and for the moment, it's even harder. LEILA FADEL, HOST: Mortgage rates have been rising. They're now about 5%, and the price of homes was already soaring. INSKEEP: NPR's Chris Arnold covers the housing market and joins us now. Chris, good morning. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Hey, Steve. INSKEEP: I just want to note mortgage rates were as low as 3% or even below that last summer, and now they're a bit above 5%, which doesn't sound like a big deal, I guess, until you start doing some numbers. ARNOLD: Right. I mean, when you're borrowing enough money to buy a house, a couple of percentage points on the mortgage rate makes a huge difference. Here's a not-so-fun fact if you're ready for this. INSKEEP: OK. ARNOLD: To buy the median-priced home in the U.S., if you look at the monthly mortgage payment, that's gone up 55% since just the start of last year. INSKEEP: Whoa. ARNOLD: That's - yeah. I mean, it's just, like, eye-poppingly (ph) big. That's the combined effect of higher rates and higher prices. And that's upwards of $600 a month more to buy a house that's around $350,000. It would be a lot more to buy a pricier house. INSKEEP: And this is on top of a market that was already way overpriced for a lot of people. It's really common for me to get in a conversation with somebody who's truly enraged. They think they can never afford a house. ARNOLD: Right. I mean, people were having trouble affording homes before this. Some homebuyers are looking at smaller places and condos. But for many, it's just getting too expensive. I talked to Gabriela Raimander. She's a realtor in St. Petersburg, Fla. And she says most of her first-time homebuyer clients have just pretty much given up. She spoke to one of them just the other day. GABRIELA RAIMANDER: She told me, it's like, you know - with watery eyes - it's like, you know, I just - I can't compete in this market. My dream of owning a house will have to be postponed or shelved altogether. ARNOLD: And on a more positive note, this is not all bad for the housing market, though, because it's just been so overheated, and this should cool things off and kind of calm down the frenzied buying and the bidding wars that have been pushing prices up so much. Builders need time to catch up. We do not have enough supply. So cooling off is not entirely a bad thing, and prices are not expected to rise much this next year. INSKEEP: I feel obliged to say two things, Chris Arnold - first, to reassure someone like the woman with the watery eyes. I mean, there was a time when I was looking for my first house and also thought, I've been priced out of this market. It's hopeless. Eventually, something works out, so hopefully something does for them. But the other question is this - the high home prices you were talking about are a factor in the higher and higher inflation that we're facing. So what is the Federal Reserve doing about that? Since their job - or one of them anyway - is to keep a handle on inflation. ARNOLD: Right. And the Fed's moves that we follow are not directly tied to mortgage rates, but to simplify, rates anticipate a bunch of different things that the Federal Reserve's going to be doing over the next year, and they move dramatically and quickly in anticipation of that. So that's why we've seen a very big move up already, and we'll see where it goes from here. INSKEEP: This has also got to affect people who are already in a house but want to get to another house. ARNOLD: It does. You know, most people, though, who own a home, they're sitting on a pile of home equity. So when they sell, that will help them, though. I talked to one couple in the Seattle area. Alex Bacon and her husband. And they bought a tiny little house five years ago. It was all they could afford. And it's directly under the flight path of Seattle's airports. ALEX BACON: I'm just off the end of one of the runways, so the air just smells of jet fuel. I can't have people over for a barbecue because every time I try to have a conversation, you have to pause for 30 seconds in the middle of your thought. ARNOLD: Because there's, like, a 747, like, literally over your head just, like, roaring over. BACON: Yeah. ARNOLD: So even their house, though, Steve, has risen in value, they want to move to a smaller town that does not have an airport next to their house. And now they're scrambling to do that before interest rates go even higher. INSKEEP: Wow. Good luck to them. NPR's Chris Arnold, thanks so much. ARNOLD: Thank you, Steve. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: Democrats have a lot of reasons to worry about this fall's elections. FADEL: The president's party often doesn't do well. Many Americans do not feel positive about the direction of the country. Unemployment is very low, but inflation has been creeping up. The U.S. has pushed back against Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but gas prices have risen higher. And the pandemic is by no means over - a fact underlined when the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, tested positive. INSKEEP: NPR White House correspondent Asma Khalid has been asking what some voters make of all that. Good morning. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: Where did you go? KHALID: I went to Michigan's 7th Congressional District. It's about an hour west of Detroit. And because, you know, inflation has been the top concern in just about every poll, I went to some places where people would be feeling it - a Walmart, a gas station and this local grocery chain called Meijer. And, you know, Steve, just about every person I talked to had an earful to share. Krista Wilcox was putting groceries into the trunk of her car with her husband, Trevor. She told me that they are buying significantly less groceries lately. KRISTA WILCOX: And we're a dual-income family. KHALID: Do you feel like you understand why the prices are going up? Is there any sense... K WILCOX: No. KHALID: No. Do you blame anyone or do you blame anything for it? K WILCOX: Oh... TREVOR WILCOX: The Biden administration (laughter). K WILCOX: COVID. KHALID: You blame COVID. K WILCOX: Yeah. I'm a nurse. KHALID: And you blame Biden. T WILCOX: The administration. Yeah. There's a lot of things they could do. KHALID: You know, in reality, there's really not much that any president can do to curb inflation. But Trevor Wilcox thinks that Joe Biden could do more to lower gas prices, specifically by relying more on American energy. And, you know, even the local Democratic congresswoman here, Elissa Slotkin, says she has been pushing the White House to do more to fight inflation, to suspend the federal gas tax or open up the strategic oil reserves even further, which to me shows that she knows how potent this issue could be in her reelection. INSKEEP: Are Democrats vulnerable on other issues? KHALID: You know, they are. And, Steve, I will say, when I speak to young people in particular, they told me they felt let down over student loan forgiveness, over immigration. Brady McAdams, I met her. She was a 19-year-old nursing student at Michigan State University. She felt like the president had not fulfilled his promises. BRADY MCADAMS: I feel like we were promised so many things, I mean, the changes and we were going to, like, get back on track. I don't feel like we're getting on track. I feel like we're just not doing anything. INSKEEP: Are any of the accomplishments the president touts getting through? I think about the infrastructure bill that was passed on a bipartisan basis. I think about a Supreme Court justice just confirmed yesterday. I think about unemployment being super low. KHALID: You know, Steve, you are right, I will say, and there are certainly Democrats I met who feel that the president is getting unfairly blamed for things out of his control, like an uncooperative Congress, a pandemic and a war. But many of them also agree that if the president cannot get more support from the broader American public by November, the rest of his party could be in trouble. Lanae Erickson is with the centrist Democratic think tank Third Way. And she told me she worries that 2022 could be a rough hill to climb for Democrats. LANAE ERICKSON: You know, if the president's approval rating is 42%, it's going to be difficult for anyone to outperform him by nine or 10 points. That's just very difficult in modern politics. KHALID: And, Steve, frankly, the big test will be if Democrats in competitive races drop the president altogether and try to create their own distinct brand, which I will say, you know, so far, we have not really seen publicly yet. INSKEEP: NPR's Asma Khalid, always a pleasure talking with you. Thanks. KHALID: Happy to do it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: Store by store, the union drive at Starbucks is growing. FADEL: More than 200 Starbucks locations have filed for union elections. So far, 13 have unionized. And today, we'll find out if four more stores will join them. INSKEEP: NPR's Andrea Hsu is following this story. Good morning. ANDREA HSU, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: What happens today? HSU: Well, the National Labor Relations Board is going to count the votes in four different Starbucks elections. Three of the stores are in Ithaca, N.Y., and one is in Overland Park, Kan. That's a suburb of Kansas City. And the union has won 13 out of 14 elections so far, including three just yesterday. But some of those votes have been pretty close. And Starbucks is mounting a pretty serious anti-union campaign. INSKEEP: Oh, well, let's talk through that. What is Starbucks doing? HSU: Yeah. Well, I talked with workers from a Starbucks in Springfield, Va. They're going to be voting on a union next week. And in the last month or so, they say all kinds of weird things have been happening at their store. Five new people were suddenly hired, and the barista trainer at the store, who's also one of the union organizers, was not allowed to train them. They say their hours have been cut. And they said they've had all these one-on-one meetings with their store manager. And to their surprise, the district manager has also shown up for some of them. Tim Swicord, a barista at the store, described what that was like. TIM SWICORD: We went to the back of house in a very kind of intimidating feeling where it was me talking to two people. And to me, it did not really feel like a conversation. HSU: He says the managers told him that unionizing is a gamble, that they could lose their benefits and that he in particular could lose an opportunity to be promoted. And by the way, Steve, these are called captive audience meetings. And the general counsel at the National Labor Relations Board moved this week to ban such meetings as an unfair labor practice. INSKEEP: It does sound intimidating, even if the exact words that come out of the supervisor's mouth are maybe not technically so, just being in that back room with a couple of people. HSU: Yeah. INSKEEP: So how does Starbucks answer these accusations of borderline or totally unfair practices? HSU: Well, Starbucks denies that it's engaging in unfair labor practices, but the National Labor Relations Board is looking into some of the claims, including a few involving workers who are organizing who were fired. And, you know, it is an interesting time at Starbucks. Howard Schultz, who led the company for years, just came back as interim CEO. He spoke at a town hall-type thing on Monday and said companies throughout the country are being assaulted by the threat of unionization. That's how he sees what's going on. He doubled down on what he said about unions in the past. Basically, his stance is we don't need them at Starbucks. We've made this a great place to work without them. And he promised to re-imagine Starbucks as a company with employees at its center. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HOWARD SCHULTZ: A company that does not need someone in between us and our people. HSU: Now, the organizers at his store are saying, hey, we're not some outside group. We're your workers who are organizing this union campaign. INSKEEP: It's interesting to listen to Howard Schultz there. It seems he's effectively saying, I want to be your union boss. I'm the guy who's going to take care of you, which is a thing that... HSU: Yes, exactly. INSKEEP: Which is a thing that a lot of bosses have said. I want to provide good enough conditions that people don't want to be in a union. But what are workers asking for? HSU: Well, yeah. And, you know, what you say is true. And Starbucks actually provides generous benefits, great health care and education benefits, even stock options for full-time and part-time employees. Three of the workers I spoke to have gone to college for free, but they want more consistent schedules. They want Starbucks to change how it handles tipping. And they want raises, but they also want more of a voice in the company. They said their voices have not been heard in the pandemic. Their suggestions for how to stay safe were dismissed. So they want a seat at the table, and they think a union will give them that. INSKEEP: Well, Andrea, I'd love to talk about this further, but I have a sudden need to go get a cup of coffee, so I'll say goodbye for now. Thank you. HSU: Thanks so much. INSKEEP: NPR's Andrea Hsu. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: One other note before we leave you. Something happened in the U.S. Senate yesterday that has never happened before. Senators confirmed Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson as the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court. She'll soon be Justice Jackson. Vice President Kamala Harris can preside over the Senate on big occasions like this and came to oversee the vote. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: On this vote, the ayes are 53, the nays are 47, and this nomination is confirmed. (APPLAUSE) INSKEEP: The first Black vice president was smiling. You're hearing supporters in the gallery applauding along with senators who voted yes, who included all Democrats and three Republicans, including Mitt Romney, who remained at his desk applauding even as other lawmakers cleared the floor.

            "article_content": "The CDC says it will end the pandemic border restrictions known as Title 42 on May 23. But some lawmakers are concerned that lifting those restrictions could lead to a record influx of migrants.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: The Biden administration's going to end the sweeping border restrictions known as Title 42. For more than two years, those restrictions allowed immigration authorities to quickly expel migrants at the border without giving them a chance to seek asylum in the U.S. Policy was originally intended to stop the spread of COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has announced that the Trump-era policy will end on May 23, but there are concerns that lifting those restrictions could lead to a record influx of migrants at the southern border. NPR's Joel Rose covers immigration. Joel, thanks so much for being with us. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Hi, Scott. SIMON: First, what do CDC officials say about their decision? ROSE: Well, basically, that these restrictions are no longer necessary. CDC director Rochelle Walensky wrote that the threat of migrants spreading COVID-19 at the border has, quote, \"ceased to be a serious danger to the public health.\" That was the CDC's reason for authorizing these pandemic restrictions more than two years ago. The Biden administration has made some exceptions, notably for unaccompanied children arriving at the border, but it's largely kept Title 42 in place until now. SIMON: And what's the reaction been so far? ROSE: Immigrant advocates and many Democrats welcomed this decision. They have been arguing for a long time that Title 42 was really a tool to manage the flow of migrants at the border and limit access to asylum using public health and COVID essentially as an excuse. Melissa Crow is a lawyer at the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies at UC Hastings College of Law. MELISSA CROW: We commend the Biden administration for getting rid of this racist Trump-era relic. There's absolutely no legal or policy justification for turning back asylum-seekers at the border or for leaving them stranded in some of the most dangerous cities in the world. ROSE: Immigrant advocates also argue that Title 42 wasn't actually very effective at managing migration. We've seen record-breaking numbers of migrant apprehensions at the southern border last year, even with Title 42 in place. SIMON: So what happens now that the restrictions are lifted? ROSE: There is a lot of concern that this will lead to a significant increase in migration. Republicans are using words like chaos and travesty and Armageddon. Here's Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, speaking on the Senate floor this week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ROB PORTMAN: The Border Patrol tells me they are already overwhelmed. But they say it will be out of control. Now, some would argue it's already out of control, but it's going to get a whole lot worse. ROSE: And even some Democrats are nervous, I mean, particularly senators who are facing tight reelection contests this year. They say that the Biden administration should keep Title 42 in place at least until it has a better plan ready to deal with a possible influx. SIMON: How does the Biden administration react to that? ROSE: Homeland security officials say they will be ready when Title 42 ends in just over seven weeks. They say they have a plan. They're deploying extra personnel to the border. They're standing up temporary facilities to process migrants. They are at the same time preparing to roll out a new system for handling asylum claims that is supposed to take months instead of years. And homeland security officials also say they may place greater numbers of migrants into the so-called Remain in Mexico program. This is another Trump-era policy that forces asylum-seekers to wait outside of the U.S. for their hearings in immigration courts. You know, but in the short run, there's no question the Biden administration is in a tough spot here. Immigrant advocates and liberal Democrats note that the U.S. has a legal obligation to let migrants apply for asylum. And there is also no doubt that Republicans will try to blame Biden and Democrats for any increase in migration as we head toward midterm elections. SIMON: NPR's Joel Rose, thanks so much. ROSE: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "We look at how Republican-controlled state legislatures are shaping their strategy ahead of the midterm elections, and how their Democratic counterparts are crafting their messaging.  ADRIAN FLORIDO, HOST: As we just heard, there are several issues driving Florida lawmakers ahead of fall midterms. But it's not just Florida. Other states with Republican-controlled legislatures are also flooding the zone with bills to advance their party's agenda ahead of elections. In Arizona, for instance, nearly a hundred bills have been introduced to restrict voting rights. There's a similar landscape in Michigan, Wisconsin and other states. We're joined now by national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Good morning. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning. FLORIDO: Mara, looking at how GOP-controlled statehouses are preparing the election battlefield, what can we expect in the coming months? LIASSON: Well, in addition to redistricting, which would shrink the number of competitive districts and give Republicans an advantage, you're hearing, as you just heard, about all of these culture war issues. Republicans think these are great issues for them around transgender athletes, school curriculums, around what they're calling parental rights, curtailing discussions of race and gender and sexual orientation in schools. You're going to hear Republicans say that Democrats want to indoctrinate your kids. If your kid is white, they want to make him feel uncomfortable. So along with crime, immigration and inflation, which are top concerns for voters, Republicans feel they have a very strong hand, lots of issues to pick from. They're feeling pretty confident about the midterms. FLORIDO: And what about Democrats? Do they have a counter strategy or any strategy of their own? LIASSON: Well, Democrats have a much weaker hand. They're the party in power, so they're blamed for everything that's going wrong. And they've really struggled to get a clear message for the midterms. They're going to try to define Republicans as too extreme. They're going to talk about their accomplishments, about how the economy is much better, COVID is going away, also try to empathize with voters about inflation, which is a real problem. But Democrats are also trying to recalibrate their message on social issues. You heard Joe Biden make a pretty ringing call in the State of the Union not to defund the police. Of course, he's never been for defunding the police. But there was a little bit of good news for Democrats this week. The jobs numbers on Friday were excellent - 678,000 jobs created last month. Unemployment is down from 4% to 3.8. And there were some polls that showed Joe Biden's abysmal approval ratings inching up a bit. FLORIDO: Tell us a little more about that. Where is he getting that bounce? LIASSON: Well, he's getting that bounce mostly from Democrats coming home and independents taking a second look at him. NPR did a poll recently that showed he actually got a bounce from the State of the Union address. That's very rare. Most presidents don't see much of a bounce from their State of the Union address. The overall approval rating for Biden in our poll was 47%. That's up eight points from the NPR poll last month. His approval rating for handling the crisis in Ukraine is up 18 points to 52%. We don't know whether this is an outlier or whether it will continue, but it's something that Democrats were certainly happy about. FLORIDO: Mara, I'd like to ask you a question about Ukraine. President Zelenskyy made a direct appeal to American lawmakers yesterday in a virtual call asking for more help from the U.S., including more military aid and energy sanctions on Russia. Are those things that President Biden can realistically do without a major domestic blowback? LIASSON: Well, there are some things that he can do, and Congress is getting ready to pass a big package of aid for Ukraine. In terms of military aid, the White House told NPR over the weekend that it is working with Poland to get Soviet-era MiG planes to Ukraine. These are planes that Ukrainian pilots know how to fly. Vice President Harris is going to Poland this week to talk about this transfer and what the U.S. can do to support Poland in it. There's also a big bipartisan push in Congress to ban Russian oil and gas. The U.S. gets not a big amount - anywhere between 3 and 10% of its imported energy from Russia. And this would be a U.S. ban, not international sanctions on Russian energy. Sanctions would require the U.S. to block other countries from getting Russian oil and gas. And, of course, Europe is much more dependent on Russian energy than we are. But yes, he can do all these things, but there will be some blowback because prices of gas at the pump will go up, and Joe Biden is going to be blamed for that by Republicans. FLORIDO: That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Mara, thanks. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

But while that crisis continues to occupy center stage, the White House is hoping some of the spirit of unity it has instilled can also help revive his domestic agenda. That means restarting the engines on a convoy of major bills now stalled shy of passage in the Senate. And it means overcoming the sense that Congress cannot get much done \u2013 or at least cannot take big or politically risky steps \u2013 in an election year. It's easy to point to examples of past efforts that proved fruitless as members turned their attention all but exclusively to their reelection. The variables affecting what happens in an election year are more complicated than in non-election years. But there's no law against making laws in an election year. There are special challenges, to be sure, but the hurdles may loom larger in lore than in reality. Members in both chambers in both parties are distracted by primaries, fundraising and the demands of campaigning. Congress typically decamps for much of the fall prior to the general election in November. For now, in the latter half of the 117th Congress, the Democrats' main problem is overcoming their weakness in the Senate, where resistance from one or two of their 50 members has deprived them of a working majority. It's not just a Senate problem, however, because the House would have to approve any attempts to please those Senate holdouts by scaling back the agenda. That would apply to elements of Biden's Build Back Better package addressing climate change, child care, prescription drug prices and the minimum wage. All of these measures poll well among the middle-class and non-college voters Democrats are desperate to woo back. Democrats would also dearly love to use this election year, and the suddenly elevated level of voter interest, to complete action on their voting rights bills. These, too, fell short in the Senate due to a wall of Republican resistance and the defection of one Democrat. Consequential legislating usually requires a lot of compromise, which means some degree of good faith bargaining and willingness to accept some political risk. Asking lawmakers to do this gets harder as a primary approaches and members feel pressure to please their own party's voters. Primary voters tend to be more partisan than those who vote only in November. Finally, there is the often well-founded fear of change, especially change that generates clear winners and losers. Those who like any given change often get complacent when it happens, while those opposed to it get angry and energized. That was a major factor in Obama's reversal of fortunes after being elected in 2008. The Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank deregulation of Wall Street were finished in the midterm election year of 2010, and Obama's party got clobbered. The \"Tea Party\" midterm in 2010 cost Democrats more than 60 seats (and the majority) in the House. \"The conventional wisdom is that a chamber's majority party gears the election-year legislative agenda to the election,\" says longtime congressional scholar Steven S. Smith, a professor of political science at Washington University in St. Louis. \"The motivation is to give its members better chances in the election by avoiding difficult votes,\" Smith adds, \"thereby enhancing the party's odds of retaining majority control.\" Smith says that usually translates to \"avoiding controversial bills,\" but not always. And when a party chooses to go boldly, things can go well or things can go very, very badly \u2014 as 2010 proved. Still, these dynamics do not make the challenge insuperable. Smith says there can also be occasions where the election dynamic \"justifies passing popular legislation and improving a reputation for competence at governing.\" A salient example of the latter dynamic would be the election year of 1996. Bill Clinton was running for a second term as president. Both the House and the Senate were controlled by Republicans, and it was the first time the House had a GOP majority to protect since the mid-1950s. One might have expected a donnybrook, with little or nothing getting done. After all, the Republicans had won their majorities in Congress largely by opposing Clinton, who was running for another term largely by vilifying Republican ideas about budget cuts. But the warring parties still managed to get together and enact several major pieces of legislation. Perhaps the biggest was a long-debated overhaul of the welfare system that Clinton called From Welfare to Work. But there was also major interest in law allowing employees to maintain their health insurance when changing jobs. Extending the bipartisan consensus still further, Clinton and the Capitol Hill leadership passed the first update to telecommunications laws in 60 years, strengthened the Safe Drinking Water Act and raised the minimum wage. While each of these measures generated friction within and between the parties, the ensuing election was generally good to incumbents in both. Clinton dominated in the Electoral College and the Republicans held their majorities on the Hill. Lawmakers watch as President Ronald Reagan signs into law a landmark tax overhaul in October 1986.\n                \n                    \n                    Bob Daugherty/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Lawmakers watch as President Ronald Reagan signs into law a landmark tax overhaul in October 1986. There have been other examples, both before and since. In 2002, despite the rancor over the Florida vote count that nearly upended the 2000 presidential election, Congress and President George W. Bush put together the Help America Vote Act, largely modernizing the voting system nationwide. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan was facing his second midterm election cycle in office and trying to hold on to a narrow Republican majority in the Senate. But he did not shrink from big projects on the way. His support and a great deal of maneuvering in a divided Congress brought home an immigration bill that granted amnesty to millions of longtime residents who had entered the country without documents. A similar dynamic of cooperation between the branches and the parties carried home the Tax Reform Act, the most sweeping rewrite of the tax laws in generations. Those achievements have often been held up as examples of Congress at its best. But they did not do much to help Reagan's party that November. His GOP lost a net of eight seats in the Senate and fell into the minority for the next eight years. On the numbers, it must be said that it's hard to pass bills in an election year because it's always hard, whether the year has an odd or an even number. Most bills never make it through the committee process to floor consideration, let alone final enactment into law. Many that do (nearly a third of the total in 2019-20) are considered \"ceremonial,\" naming post offices and parks and commemorating this or that. Most bills are introduced in the first year of a biennial Congress. The process usually takes months. So most bills that do get enacted into law make it through in the second year, which is always an even-numbered year that brings elections for all the seats in the House and one-third of those in the Senate. Every four years, it also brings a presidential election. It is true that many landmark laws have been enacted in the year immediately following an election. That was true for Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal and Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. It was true for Reagan's tax cuts and reordering of budget priorities, and George W. Bush's big tax cut and No Child Left Behind legislation. Ruling out game-changer legislation of this order in election years would mean sidelining the Congress half the time. But could history-making of this magnitude ever get through in an election year? Smith notes that measuring such a thing reliably would require a firm and defensible definition of what is a \"major bill.\" Moreover, he adds, the scorecard can get confused because of \"lame duck\" sessions. These are held in the weeks after the election, when campaign season is over but the newly elected folks will not be sworn in until early January. Such sessions often belie their name. Clinton was impeached by one such session in December 1998, and there were dramatic confrontations over spending bills after the election of 2012 (the so-called \"fiscal cliff\" crisis) and after the midterm election on 2018 (which resulted in a five-week partial shutdown of the federal government). The last lame duck, in late 2020 and the first week of 2021, was the most productive in half a century, according to congressional data analyzed by the Pew Research Center. Of the 344 bills that became law in that Congress, 151 (44%) were passed in the final two months \u2014 after the election of 2020. It should be noted that any bill not passed when a Congress ends, dies with that Congress, so the lame duck represents productivity under pressure. To some degree, the expanding importance of these sessions reflects the human tendency to procrastinate and delay until absolute necessity takes over. But it also demonstrates that, even when enough consensus exists to make laws, it can be easier to do so when election tensions may have eased and the heat is off.",

Henry Cuellar faces a primary challenge from progressive candidate Jessica Cisneros. Two years ago, Cuellar narrowly defeated Cisneros to hold on to his seat. The primary battle between longtime Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar, a fixture of South Texas politics, and progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros will continue on. Neither candidate received more than 50% of the vote in Tuesday's primary, according to The Associated Press, meaning both will advance to a runoff in May. A third candidate, Tannya Benavides, got a small share of the vote and has been eliminated. The Republican primary is set for a runoff as well. Cuellar, 66, is a nine-term congressman who holds right-leaning stances on abortion rights and other issues and is considered one of the most conservative members of the House Democratic caucus. Two years ago, he won a narrow 4-point victory against Cisneros, a 28-year-old immigration lawyer who has the backing of progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. This year's primary was jolted in January, when the FBI raided Cuellar's campaign office and Laredo home in a probe for which the specifics remain murky. Cuellar has not been publicly accused of a crime by the law enforcement agency, but the raid \u2014 reportedly stemming from an investigation into U.S. businessmen and their ties to Azerbaijan, a detail NPR has not confirmed \u2014 provided campaign attacks for Cisneros, and quieted establishment support for Cuellar. Cuellar denied any wrongdoing and campaigned on the funding he's brought back to the district. He painted Cisneros as a far-left, anti-police candidate whose politics wouldn't be able to work across the aisle and get things done in Congress. Cisneros leaned heavily on the FBI raid and its implications that Cuellar is beholden to interests outside the district's working people. A recent 30-second campaign spot from Cisneros' campaign dedicated 20 seconds to the FBI raid on Cuellar's properties, countering Cisneros as a fresh-faced alternative, unburdened by corporate special interests. Republicans have their eye on the seat, especially after making gains in South Texas in the 2020 election.",

Greg Abbott faces primary challengers from the right in his reelection bid. A primary win would likely set up a high-profile match-up against Democrat Beto O'Rourke. The 2022 midterm elections kick off in earnest Tuesday as voting concludes in Texas for the state's primary. (Polls close at 7 p.m. local time. Follow key results here.) Top GOP statewide leaders face reelection challenges from fellow Republicans, while congressional and state legislative candidates navigate redrawn political maps. Texas, which gained two congressional districts in redistricting, will be a focal point for the two major parties as they jockey for control of the U.S. House. Democrats aim to preserve their narrow majority in what's expected to be a tough cycle for them. While many Texas suburbs trended more Democratic in the 2020 and 2018 elections, former President Donald Trump made significant gains in 2020 among voters at the heavily Latino southern border, a traditionally important location for Democrats. The Lone Star State's elections system is also not without contention. The Department of Justice is suing the state over its redistricting plan, and the primary is the first election since GOP state lawmakers enacted new voting restrictions. Thousands of voters have run into issues navigating new requirements, such as with mail-in ballots. Here are four Texas races to watch as results come in: The marquee match-up is on the Democratic side, where progressive immigration attorney Jessica Cisneros is challenging longtime Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar, as he simultaneously deals with an FBI probe. Cuellar \u2014 who's represented the district, which spans from the south ends of San Antonio through Laredo, for nine terms \u2014 narrowly beat Cisneros in 2020. Cisneros, who's 28, supports progressive ideas like Medicare for all, the Green New Deal and free public college, while Cuellar is one of the most conservative House Democrats, taking right-leaning stances on abortion rights and immigration issues. Endorsements from progressive leaders are pouring in for Cisneros, including from Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. It's a rematch in South Texas: Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar faces a primary challenge from progressive candidate Jessica Cisneros. Two years ago, Cuellar narrowly defeated Cisneros to hold on to his seat.\n                \n                    \n                    Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images; Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption It's a rematch in South Texas: Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar faces a primary challenge from progressive candidate Jessica Cisneros. Two years ago, Cuellar narrowly defeated Cisneros to hold on to his seat. January FBI raids of Cuellar's home and office have altered the race. Cuellar co-chairs the House Azerbaijan Caucus, and news outlets like ABC and CBS News report that the raids are part of a federal investigation into the country and U.S. businessmen who have ties to it. NPR has not confirmed that reporting. Cuellar says there's been no wrongdoing on his part. Cuellar, 66, has received an endorsement from House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md. However, despite supporting him in 2020, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has yet to make a public endorsement. Though Cisneros has given Cuellar a run for his money before, the overall ideological lean of the 28th district remains uncertain. If Cisneros were to defeat Cuellar in the primary, she'd be running on a significantly more progressive platform than he has in the past, which could push away more moderate Democratic voters. Regardless of who wins the primary, Republicans undoubtedly have their eye on the district. Cook Political Report currently labels the 28th as just leaning Democratic. The 15th, which spans east of San Antonio through McAllen, is both an open and competitive district. Following the state's latest round of redistricting, the district now skews slightly more Republican than before, prompting current Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez to run for the nearby 34th district instead, a safely blue seat. Monica De La Cruz has the backing of a wide range of Republicans in her bid to win the 15th district.\n                \n                    \n                    Eric Gay/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Monica De La Cruz has the backing of a wide range of Republicans in her bid to win the 15th district. From Trump to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Republicans across the country are backing Monica De La Cruz's candidacy to take the 15th district. De La Cruz, an insurance agent who lost to Gonzalez in 2020 by less than 3 percentage points, has got the biggest fundraising haul, and is seen as the front-runner in the race \u2014 notwithstanding a crowded field of lesser-known Republican candidates. Despite her national support, De La Cruz's candidacy has met controversy. Her estranged husband is accusing her of showing \"cruel and aggressive conduct\" toward his daughter \u2014 an allegation De La Cruz denies. As part of their ongoing legal battle, De La Cruz cannot return to the home she shared with her husband until April. On the Democratic side, both progressive and moderate candidates have thrown their hat in the ring, though no one rivals De La Cruz in fundraising or name recognition. Gonzalez has endorsed Army veteran Ruben Ramirez to fill the seat. Republican Gov. Gregg Abbott is seeking a third term, but first must get past primary challengers who are attacking him from the right. Polls have Abbott, who has been endorsed by Trump, in strong position, and he's sitting on a substantial war chest of around $65 million.

Though Abbott leads against O'Rourke in recent polling of the red state \u2014 and though Texas hasn't elected a Democratic governor in 32 years \u2014 O'Rourke has defied expectations before. He came close to ousting Sen. Ted Cruz in his 2018 bid for U.S. Senate. However, that was a particularly solid year for Democrats when they ran as the opposition to Trump. Embattled Republican incumbent Ken Paxton faces primary challenges from Rep. Louie Gohmert, former state Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman and Land Commissioner George P. Bush, the son of Jeb Bush and nephew of George W. Bush. Though the two-term attorney general is polling higher than his competitors, he's still in jeopardy of triggering a runoff election. A recent UT/Texas Tribune survey had him at 47%, with Bush in second at 21% \u2014 which would put Paxton under the 50% threshold needed to avoid a May runoff. Trump has endorsed Paxton, who supports the former president's false claims that the 2020 election was fraudulent and filed a legal challenge against election results in multiple states. He also appeared at the pro-Trump rally that preceded the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Gohmert \u2014 who entered the race after Trump had endorsed Paxton \u2014 is also a big ally of the former president.

On the Democratic primary side, former ACLU lawyer Rochelle Garza leads in recent polling. Trailing Garza is Joe Jaworski, a lawyer and former mayor of Galveston. Lower in the same poll is civil rights attorney Lee Merritt, who gained national attention representing several families of Black men who were shot and killed by police, including George Floyd.",

Henry Cuellar faces a primary challenge from progressive candidate Jessica Cisneros. Two years ago, Cuellar narrowly defeated Cisneros to hold on to his seat. In his hometown of Laredo, Texas, Rep. Henry Cuellar is deep-seated. He's been in office since 2005 and even has an elementary school named after him. But the nine-term Democratic congressman faces a stiff challenge in the state's March 1 primary from Jessica Cisneros, a 28-year-old progressive. The race was already on the political radar for Democrats and for Republicans, who see the South Texas congressional district as a potential pickup opportunity, when an FBI raid of Cuellar's home and office last month added another element to the contest. He has denied wrongdoing. Cisneros \u2014 an immigration attorney who is also a Laredo native and who narrowly lost to Cuellar two years ago \u2014 is running again with the backing of progressives Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Cisneros has distinguished herself from Cuellar with her support for Medicare for All, pro-labor legislation and access to abortion. Her election would mean a new brand of politics for South Texas. Meanwhile, Cuellar is backed by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and can count on a long list of local endorsements and supporters. \"I've been voting [Cuellar] for several years. I think Henry's done an incredible job,\" said Cristobal Rodriguez, a real estate sales agent and Laredoan. \"He's brought a lot of money to our community.\" Many in the 28th Congressional District have a sense of pride about Cuellar's powerful position on the House Appropriations Committee. He touts his ability to reach across the aisle and get things done. \"We cannot have leaders that are uncompromising and extreme,\" Cuellar says in a new ad, one of many recently flooding the airwaves. \"I will always vote in the best interest of our constituents.\" Still, some of those constituents have found it hard to make sense of his voting record. Cuellar is considered one of the most conservative Democrats in the House, as he's taken right-leaning stances on abortion rights, gun control and immigration. Joined by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Cuellar speaks on southern border security and illegal immigration on July 30, 2021. Cuellar touts his ability to reach across the aisle and get things done.\n                \n                    \n                    Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption At a Laredo rally for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Beto O'Rourke, Cesia Rodriguez and her husband looked at each other and laughed when asked about their vote in the congressional primary. Rodriguez has known Cuellar's family for years. She's a court administrator who appreciates the federal grants he brings to her community. But she's conflicted. \"I don't agree [with him], that he doesn't vote for gun control, that he voted against the woman's right to choose \u2014 I need to think of the bigger picture, and the bigger picture is my community,\" Rodriguez said. \"And that's hard to say.\" In January, Cuellar's Laredo home and campaign office in Texas were raided, which only added to the conflict for voters. Cuellar co-chairs the House Azerbaijan Caucus, and outlets including ABC and CBS News report that the raids are part of a federal investigation into the country and a group of U.S. businessmen who have ties to it. NPR has not confirmed that reporting. While many supporters are rushing to Cuellar's defense, others say it's time for a change. Crystal Valles, a teacher in Laredo, said the FBI investigation has only hardened her disapproval. \"I've already viewed him differently since before, but it just added to the doubt of him running for office,\" Valles said. Cuellar's office declined multiple requests for comment, but he released a video after the raids saying he is cooperating with the investigation. \"I'm committed to ensuring that justice and that law is upheld,\" he said. \"There is an ongoing investigation that will show that there was no wrongdoing on my part.\" Cisneros has used the FBI raids to make the point that Cuellar's ties \u2014 and votes \u2014 extend outside the district's interests. She points out that Cuellar has taken large campaign donations from the Koch Brothers, big oil companies and the private prison industry. \"Well, his vote \u2014 if you want to make sense of it, just follow the money,\" she said. Cisneros and a third candidate in the race, Tannya Benavides, are calling for accountability and transparency for their community. \"I'm not taking a dime of corporate PAC money because South Texas families deserve true representation,\" Cisneros says in an introductory video, adding: \"They said change was impossible here ... but we showed them that the dreams of immigrants, rancheros, truckers and teachers can be just as powerful as their corporate dollars.\" Cisneros has the backing of fellow progressives, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who came to stump for Cisneros and another political candidate last weekend in San Antonio.\n                \n                    \n                    Eric Gay/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Texas' 28th district stretches from Laredo along the border to the Rio Grande Valley and up to San Antonio, where Ocasio-Cortez came to stump for Cisneros last weekend. The New York congresswoman told reporters that a progressive taking the seat would signal the flipping of Texas and then the nation. \"Jessica Cisneros has really shown what is possible \u2014 not only here in San Antonio but all the way down South Texas,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"She's shown that we don't have to accept status quo politics before we actually fight for change.\" Henry Flores, a political scientist at St. Mary's University in San Antonio, said the contest highlights a wave of young progressives championing reform and trying to unseat established politicians. He said Cuellar is in the political battle of his career against Cisneros. \"I think it's one of the races that will tell us where the nation is going,\" Flores said. Democrats across the country are keeping a nervous eye on this race. Whoever wins the March 1 primary will then try to hold on to a district that Republicans are targeting as a seat they could flip.",

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Oregon Supreme Court has ruled that former New York Times columnist Nick Kristof cannot run for governor because he doesn't meet the residency requirements. Kristof quit his job at the Times last year to throw his hat in the ring for the state's top spot. Oregon Public Broadcasting's Lauren Dake has more. LAUREN DAKE, BYLINE: The Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist lived in New York for most of the past two decades, but he grew up in Oregon, owns a farm in the state and argues he has always considered himself an Oregonian. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NICHOLAS KRISTOF: I've been an Oregonian since I was a kid picking strawberries and raising sheep on the family farm. And I'll be an Oregonian until the day I draw my last breath and my ashes are scattered on that family farm I love. DAKE: But Oregon state election officials and the state Supreme Court disagree. Oregon's constitution requires a candidate to live in the state three years before the election. Kristof voted in New York in 2020 and also held a driver's license in that state as recently as 2020. Oregon Secretary of State Shemia Fagan says it's not her role to examine whether a candidate had an emotional connection to the state but instead rely on the facts. SHEMIA FAGAN: This matters. This matters because subjectivity in election law has an ugly history in Oregon and across the country of preventing people of color and women, immigrants and other historically marginalized people from full participation in our democracy. DAKE: The Oregon Supreme Court's decision today dramatically changes the dynamics of the race to replace outgoing Governor Kate Brown. Kristof has far outpaced the other Democratic contenders in fundraising, bringing in more than $2.5 million. Kristof says he accepts the court's decision. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KRISTOF: This ruling ends my campaign for governor of Oregon. But I want to be clear that I'm not going anywhere.

The group demonstrated for immigration reform and urged President Biden to authorize a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. President Biden took swift action on his first day in office and reversed several of his predecessor's harsh immigration policies. He signed an executive order to halt construction of the southern border wall, lifted a travel ban on several predominantly Muslim countries, and unveiled a plan to put millions of undocumented immigrants on a path to citizenship. But a year later, that legislation has gone nowhere and many of his other efforts have stalled, frustrating supporters and energizing opponents ahead of midterm elections. \"In the beginning, we really had him like at this pedestal, like he's going to do so much for us,\" said Yair Castellanos, a 20-year-old undocumented immigrant who works as a community organizer. From their home in North Carolina, Castellanos and his family watched Biden's inauguration with a sense of relief. He thought maybe he'd have a better chance to go to college with Biden in office. He hoped Biden would fight for a path to citizenship and also push for other protections, like work permits for him and his parents. \"And then just little things like, no, no reform coming out, nothing being pushed,\" Castellanos said. \"No little steps like the license or the permits. No...anything...really.\" Yair Castellanos had high hopes for the Biden presidency. The 20-year-old undocumented immigrant says he's disappointed by the lack of progress on immigration.\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of Yair Castellanos\n                    \n                \nhide caption Yair Castellanos had high hopes for the Biden presidency. The 20-year-old undocumented immigrant says he's disappointed by the lack of progress on immigration. Young people like Castellanos helped mobilize voters for Biden, even when they couldn't vote themselves. Many now feel let down by Biden and the Democrats, who they feel haven't pushed hard enough to deliver on the promises made. Greisa Mart\u00ednez Rosas, executive director of United We Dream, says Democrats can't treat young people as an ATM for votes \"without feeling that they have to work for it.\" Mart\u00ednez says Democrats need to fight harder for legislation to protect the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, and she points to key parts of former President Donald Trump's policies that Biden has kept in place, including a pandemic order allowing the U.S. to turn away most migrants, and another requiring asylum seekers to remain in Mexico until their court dates. \"It's easy to promise us something when we're in the midst of a difficult and historic moment like the Trump administration,\" she said. \"But what really defines someone's character is what they're able to do beyond their words and actually deliver.\" The Biden administration has cited the ongoing pandemic for keeping the health policy, known as Title 42, and argues the courts prevented the administration from ending the so-called Remain in Mexico policy. White House officials say they're continuing to work on measures that would protect and provide work permits for families like Castellanos'. White House spokesman Vedant Patel said Biden reversed many of the previous administration's harmful policies, including ending the travel ban on Muslim-majority countries and scrapping Trump's rule that made it harder for people receiving government benefits to obtain green cards. He also created a task force to help reunite families separated by the Trump administration. \"The President has made clear that restoring order, fairness, and humanity to our immigration system are priorities for this Administration,\" Patel told NPR in a statement. \"Our immigration system is outdated and in bad need of reform; But this Administration is committed to working day in and day out to provide relief to immigrants and bring our immigration system into the 21st century.\" President Biden holds his first White House news conference on March 25, 2021. He faced many questions about whether his policies were contributing to a surge in migration.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Biden holds his first White House news conference on March 25, 2021. He faced many questions about whether his policies were contributing to a surge in migration. The reality is that the Biden administration came in with very high expectations, says Ali Noorani of the National Immigration Forum. He said steps the administration has taken on the issue, like focusing immigration enforcement on public safety threats, will lead to more improvements in the future. But, with the midterms approaching, Noorani is also urging the administration to think beyond its base and reach out to more independent voters \u2014 and even some conservatives \u2014 who opposed Trump's harsh immigration policies but still have concerns about the southern border. \"President Biden needs to return to those voters and say, 'You know what? I'm going to advance constructive, pragmatic solutions in immigration,' \" Noorani said. \"And not address immigration as if it's only an issue of concern or importance to the left.\" And that's where Republicans also see an opportunity. Leading Republicans, like Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, have been traveling to the border and making the issue a signature part of their election or reelection campaigns. They blame the surge of migrants at the border on Biden's approach, including rolling back some of Trump's border policies. Biden's challenges are reflected in surveys. A recent Morning Consult/Politico poll found that 56% of registered voters disapprove of how Biden has handled immigration, while a CNBC/Change Research Poll found that 69% disapprove of his handling of the issue. Scott Jennings, a GOP strategist who's advised Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, says immigration is a chance for Republicans to draw a \"bright line.\" \"Biden campaigned as a competent moderate \u2014 'You can trust me, the adults are back in charge' \u2014 you know, that sort of vibe,\" Jennings said. \"And I don't think anybody looking at the border is saying, 'Yeah, the adults are back in charge.' \" As for Castellanos, he's just trying to make the best of the situation he has. He knows things could be worse if Trump were still in office \u2014 or if he runs again. \"If Trump comes back in, that's going to be that pressure that was on for those four years of, 'Oh no, what if one day my mom is driving and she gets pulled over, like I may never see her again?' \" Castellanos said. \"Whereas if maybe Biden is still in the presidency, I'm not as fearful of that happening.\"",

The Australian Open is still more than a week away, yet all eyes are already focused on Melbourne to see how the saga of Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic will play out. Djokovic \u2014 the top-ranked men's tennis player in the world and a noted vaccine skeptic \u2014 had appeared set to defend his title in this year's tournament after months of speculation about whether he would participate due to Australia's stringent vaccination requirements for travelers. But instead, immigration officials canceled his visa after a dramatic hours-long detention at the Melbourne Airport. Now, Djokovic remains in immigration detention ahead of a court date Monday, just a week before the tournament is set to begin. \"If that evidence is insufficient, then he won't be treated any different to anyone else and he'll be on the next plane home,\" said Australian prime minister Scott Morrison at a press conference Wednesday. \"There should be no special rules for Novak Djokovic at all. None whatsoever.\" The events have set the tennis world alight. Rafael Nadal, who currently shares the record of most Grand Slam men's singles titles with Djokovic at 20 titles apiece, said Thursday that he felt \"sorry\" for Djokovic \u2013 but added that Djokovic had known about the conditions of entry for months. \"If he wanted, he would be playing here in Australia without a problem,\" said Nadal, speaking Thursday at a press conference in Melbourne. \"He makes his own decisions. He's free to take his own positions, but then there are some consequences.\" Here's how it all unfolded: For months, tennis watchers have speculated about whether Djokovic would be allowed to participate in the Australian Open. Though no man has won more singles titles at the Open than Djokovic, who has won it nine times, the star has long declined to disclose his vaccination status and has repeatedly criticized vaccine mandates. In October, he told Serbian news outlet Blic Sport that he might not attend the Open because of his unwillingness to reveal whether he had been vaccinated. Throughout the pandemic, Australia has had some of the most stringent COVID-19 restrictions of any country. Though it is currently experiencing its largest-ever outbreak, Australia has mostly avoided the scale of outbreaks and deaths seen in the U.S. and Europe. Among the country's measures is a requirement that people arriving from overseas be fully vaccinated, with limited exemptions. Unvaccinated travelers without an exemption are allowed in the country, but must submit to a two-week quarantine upon landing. But federal government officials, Victoria state authorities and tournament organizers alike at times presented seemingly contradictory information about whether unvaccinated players would be allowed to participate in the tournament, whether they would be required to quarantine for two weeks or whether they would be allowed in the country at all. Even when Tennis Australia included Djokovic on a list of Open participants last month, speculation continued. The confusion seemed to come to an end early Tuesday when Djokovic announced on social media that he had received an \"exemption permission\" and posted a photograph of himself at an airport, apparently en route to Australia. Happy New Year! Wishing you all health, love & joy in every moment & may you feel love & respect towards all beings on this wonderful planet.I\u2019ve spent fantastic quality time with loved ones over break & today I\u2019m heading Down Under with an exemption permission. Let\u2019s go 2022! pic.twitter.com/e688iSO2d4 The exemption was confirmed by tournament organizers. Tennis Australia CEO Craig Tiley told the Australian news program Today that Djokovic's exemption had been granted based on \"personal medical information\" and that \"no special favor\" was involved. Twenty-six athletes applied for an exemption, of which \"a handful\" were granted, Tiley said in the same interview, which aired Wednesday before Djokovic arrived at the airport. The exemption requests, including Djokovic's, were reviewed by \"two separate independent panels of medical experts\" who applied the same guidelines used by the Australian federal government, Tennis Australia said in a statement Tuesday. One of the panels was appointed by the state of Victoria's Department of Health. Tiley said Wednesday that exemptions to the vaccination requirements could be granted for a variety of reasons, including a documented adverse response to vaccinations or having been infected with COVID-19 in the previous six months. Multiple news outlets have reported that Djokovic applied under the previous infection exemption. But federal border officials had warned tournament organizers in November that people with prior COVID-19 infections would not be considered \"fully vaccinated\" for the purposes of waiving the two-week quarantine, according to reporting by the Sydney Morning Herald. After Djokovic's announcement, some in Australia criticized the decision to allow an apparently unvaccinated player into a country where residents have endured repeated lockdowns and where almost 92% of people ages 16 and up are fully vaccinated. \"We have been taken for fools,\" wrote Kevin Bartlett, the Australian rules football star and broadcaster. Djokovic arrived at the Melbourne airport late Wednesday with his coach and other support staff at Melbourne Airport. There, he was detained for hours before being informed early Thursday that his visa had been canceled. In a statement, the Australian Border Force said the tennis star had \"failed to provide appropriate evidence\" to be allowed into the country. Government officials said that any visa approval is preliminary and that travelers must prove their vaccination status or the validity of their exemptions upon their arrival. \"Rules are rules, especially when it comes to our borders. No one is above these rules,\" wrote the prime minister on Twitter Thursday. Mr Djokovic\u2019s visa has been cancelled. Rules are rules, especially when it comes to our borders. No one is above these rules. Our strong border policies have been critical to Australia having one of the lowest death rates in the world from COVID, we are continuing to be vigilant. Djokovic is currently being detained at the Park Hotel in Carlton, an immigration facility that has more infamously been used to house asylum seekers. Serbia's president, Aleksandar Vucic, said the cancellation and detention amounted to \"harassment\" and asked that Djokovic be allowed to await the legal proceedings in private accommodations. The apparent disconnect between tournament organizers, state government authorities and federal border officials have prompted questions about whether politics played a role in the decision to revoke Djokovic's visa. A new round of federal elections are expected in the coming months. For politicians, appearing to allow an attempt by a non-citizen to dodge COVID restrictions could be viewed unfavorably, especially in Melbourne, a city that by some counts was locked down for longer than any other during the pandemic. \"You have this collective experience in Victoria of people being under these very draconian laws. Then, now, apparently it's okay for this tennis star to allegedly coming to Australia without having to meet all these requirements that all these other Australians have had to meet,\" said Andrew Gibbons, an Australian political scientist at the University of Texas Austin.

With the tournament scheduled to begin Jan. 17, Djokovic says he will challenge the visa cancellation. A hearing has been scheduled for 10 a.m. local time Monday in Melbourne. A court ordered Thursday that he cannot be deported before then. If his legal challenge is unsuccessful, Djokovic faces deportation and the possibility of a three-year ban from Australia. In addition, Australian Border Force is now investigating other people who have arrived for the tennis tournament under similar exemptions, Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews said Thursday. \"I can assure you that the Australian Border Force is investigating that now,\" Andrews said in an interview with radio broadcaster 2GB. \"ABF needs the opportunity to be able to conduct its investigation. But if the evidence is not there, then they will take the appropriate action.\"",

Just after news leaked in May that the Supreme Court planned to overturn Roe v. Wade, Liz Lebr\u00f3n and her colleagues noticed something unusual: a spike in false and misleading information on abortion being shared in Spanish on social media. \"Abortion was not really on our radar,\" says Lebr\u00f3n, who oversees research for the Latino Anti-Disinformation Lab. \"Then after the leak it started popping up, and it has not slowed down.\" The lab, a project from the national voter registration organization Voto Latino and the progressive group Media Matters for America, was launched in 2021 to combat COVID-19 disinformation and election falsehoods targeting Latinos. Lebr\u00f3n says the misinformation she's seeing runs the gamut \u2014 from posts that say abortion is no longer legal in a state where in fact it remains legal, to those that falsely say the procedure is not safe and can lead to harm or death. The falsehoods are being shared by accounts with tens of thousands of followers, she says. Abortion is safe and an essential component of comprehensive health care, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. With Roe struck down as of June 24, individual states determine abortion access \u2014 and abortion is currently legal in a majority of U.S. states. According to Lupe Rodr\u00edguez, executive director of the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice, community members commonly see messages on the social media platforms WhatsApp and Facebook, where policing for misinformation in Spanish frequently falls short. And this misinformation isn't just spreading on social media. In recent months, doctors and reproductive rights advocates say they've seen a surge in abortion-related misinformation repeated in conversations among the Latino communities they serve. Some worry that this onslaught of false messages may discourage pregnant Latinas from seeking medical care when they need it \u2014 even in places where abortion remains legal. \"We're hearing it from community activists on the ground. We're hearing it from allies who we work with in the field,\" says Rodr\u00edguez, who spearheads a network of community activists in Florida, Texas, Virginia and New York. Rodr\u00edguez says not all of the incorrect information is being spread with malicious intent: Laws are changing in many states, and some people are just sharing rumors that they think are true. \"People are confused about what the laws are in their own state or where they can go for information or health care,\" Rodr\u00edguez says. \"And that is making it much easier to spread misinformation.\" However, she and others say that abortion rights opponents are capitalizing on the confusion by deliberately putting out falsehoods. Lebr\u00f3n says some of the disinformation she has encountered seems deliberately designed to galvanize voters. She cites, for example, a social media post by a group called Floridanos con Marco (Floridians with Marco) that targets Rep. Val Demings, the Democratic candidate for Senate running against Republican Sen. Marco Rubio in Florida. The post falsely claims that Demings supports funding abortions with taxpayer money until the moment of birth. \"And it's like, oh, goodness,\" Lebr\u00f3n says. In fact, Demings supports the right to abortion up to the viability of the fetus, which doctors generally put at about 24 weeks of pregnancy. Polls show abortion has risen in importance among Latino voters in recent months. A majority of Latino voters support the right to a legal abortion, but others don't or are on the fence. Lebr\u00f3n says some of the disinformation aims to sway voters seen as up for grabs. Other deliberate falsehoods, Lebr\u00f3n says, \"are designed to dissuade people from seeking the [abortion] care that they need.\" Ena Suseth Valladares, director of programs at California Latinas for Reproductive Justice, says her group has traced some abortion disinformation to crisis pregnancy centers located in low-income immigrant Latino communities in the state. She says these centers sometimes help people sign up for food assistance or provide free diapers or formula, but their mission is to prevent abortions by persuading women to carry their pregnancies to term. Valladares says she's heard from Latino community members who visited crisis pregnancy centers and were told that if they got an abortion, it could raise their risk of future infertility, which is not true, according to the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists. Surveys have found that crisis pregnancy centers frequently make claims falsely linking abortion to adverse health effects. \"That's how the rumor starts,\" Valladares says. \"And then that community member takes it to other family members and friends.\" Dr. Melissa Simon, a Latina ob-gyn at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, says widespread disinformation is creating fear among the Spanish-speaking Latina patients who come to her seeking abortions. Even though Illinois is an abortion safe haven, she says patients have told her they fear that getting the procedure will result in legal jeopardy. \"I see patients that are fearing the repercussions of getting an abortion not to just themselves, but to their family and loved ones,\" she says. Simon says she recently saw a pregnant teenager who came to see her with her mother, who is an undocumented immigrant. The daughter was scared that if she got an abortion, it might somehow end up getting her mother detained or even deported. Simon is concerned that such fears will keep people from seeking medical care when they need it \u2014 for example, if they're having complications from a medication abortion or from an ectopic pregnancy that puts their life at risk. She's worried that could result in more pregnancy-related deaths for Latinas, which have risen in recent years. \"When you're trying to care for somebody, this rampant disinformation and preying on the most vulnerable populations that we have \u2014 people who already have low resources and fear \u2014 this is a real problem,\" Simon says. Advocates are combating the flood of disinformation. For example, the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice hosts livestreams with updates on abortion news and trains local organizers on how to counter word-of-mouth and digital misinformation in their communities. As for Simon, she's tackling the problem one patient at a time. \"It's really important that we arm our patients and their loved ones with accurate health information,\" she says, \"because that's how it spreads through the network.\"",

Ken Impellizeri of the San Diego Police leave the scene of a fatal fentanyl overdose by a 39-year-old woman in San Diego, Calif., on Nov. 10. When the history of America's long, devastating opioid crisis is finally written, 2022 may be remembered as both a low point and a turning point. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests the avalanche of overdose deaths \u2014 driven largely by the spread of illicit fentanyl --may have crested in March. Researchers found a staggering 110,236 people died in a single 12-month period, a stunning new record. But there are signs help may finally be on the way. The avalanche of drug deaths spurred a series of major reforms in 2022 to the way drug addiction is treated in the U.S., changes designed to reduce stigma and improve access to care. 2022 was also a year of corporate accountability. Major drug companies, distributors and pharmacy chains reached settlements of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governments totaling more than $50 billion. Experts say that money, paid out over the next two decades, will fund treatment programs and other services that are desperately needed, especially in poor rural towns and urban neighborhoods. Here are the major developments in 2022 that made it a pivotal year for the overdose epidemic. Let's start with the grim news. Street drugs in America got even more toxic in 2022 with the spread of the synthetic opioid fentanyl.  Many of those dying are young, under the age of 40. \"They're zombifying people,\" said Marche Osborne who lives on the streets in Tacoma, Wash. She's been addicted to opioids for 18 years and prefers heroin, but says fentanyl is now the only drug street dealers are offering. \"Anybody will do anything for a pill, it's ridiculous. They're dehumanizing people.  It's not a good thing. It's not going to go anywhere good if [the spread of fentanyl] continues,\" Osborne told NPR. Using data from 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced in late 2022 that life expectancy in the U.S. has dropped to its lowest point in two decades, in part because of street drugs. Marche Osborne, 31, says she uses fentanyl because it's the opioid most widely available in many street drug markets in the U.S. She says it's making addicts, including herself, far more vulnerable.\n                \n                    \n                    Brian Mann/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"Overdose deaths are increasing,\" said Kenneth Kochanek, a statistician with the CDC.  \"The majority of those deaths are to younger people, deaths to younger people affect the overall life-expectancy more than deaths to elderly.\" The Drug Enforcement Administration said in December it seized far greater quantities of illicit fentanyl than ever before in 2022. But drug policy experts say Mexican cartels are still able to smuggle the deadly synthetic opioid into the U.S. with relative impunity. Republicans made fentanyl a major part of their midterm election message, attempting to link drug smuggling to undocumented immigration. But NPR found the overwhelming majority of  opioids being smuggled across the border came through legal points of entry. What to look for in 2023:  Because drug death data is gathered slowly in the U.S., it won't be known for many months exactly how many people died from fatal overdoses in 2022, but the toll is expected to be grim. Look for fentanyl to continue to be a hot-button political issue.  Republicans have promised to focus attention on Southern border security and smuggling.  The question is whether the GOP can come up with policy solutions that will have a real impact on the Mexican cartels.

In 2021, 95 percent of the city's fatal opioid overdoses were fentanyl-related. For decades, recovery treatment has been shaped by drug war-era policies that tend to be punitive, bureaucratic and so confusing many doctors simply refuse to treat people with opioid use disorder. As a result, studies show roughly 90 percent of people with addiction get no healthcare at all. Driven in part by the carnage of fentanyl deaths, 2022 was the year that changed that. Congress and the Biden administration pushed through major reforms to the way people with addiction get healthcare. Dr. Rahul Gupta, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), in Bogota, Colombia, on Aug. 23.\n                \n                    \n                    Juancho Torres/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Biden administration announced new rules that will make it easier for many patients to access methadone and buprenorphine, medications proven to help patients avoid opioid relapses. Congress also eliminated a bureaucratic hurdle known as the \"x-waiver\" that prevented many physicians from prescribing buprenorphine. Lawmakers and federal officials also worked successfully to help at least one drug manufacturer prepare to sell the opioid-overdose reversal drug naloxone over the counter in pharmacies, without the need for a prescription. \"We begin to normalize and understand addiction as a disease,\" said Dr. Rahul Gupta, head of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy.  \"And we start to  treat people suffering from addiction as human beings and then prescribe them treatments.\" Drug policy experts say this mainstreaming of addiction care, including modern medical treatments for opioid use disorder, could save tens of thousands of lives. What to look for in 2023:  Will the mainstream healthcare industry buy in and begin treating more patients with addiction now that red tape is being eliminated?  Studies show deep stigma among care providers toward patients suffering from substance use disorder.  It's not clear how many doctors will begin prescribing opioid-treatment medications. \"It is actually the most painful part for me as a physician that this stigma exists in the healthcare community,\" Dr. Gupta said.  \"If it remains easier for people to get illicit drugs than to get treatment, we're not going to be able to bend the curve.\" Drug policy experts agree Big Pharma ignited this public health crisis by aggressively marketing and selling opioids. 2022 was the year some of America's biggest companies, including AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health, CVS, Johnson & Johnson and Walmart, came to the table to cut deals. While admitting no wrongdoing, corporate America agreed to pay more than $50 billion dollars in settlements. AmerisourceBergen was one of the companies that paid settlements in 2022.\n                \n                    \n                    Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"It is important \u2013 and long overdue \u2013 that we hold opioid companies accountable,\" said Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.). While experts believe these payouts represent a tiny fraction of the public cost of the opioid crisis, the settlement money could be a game-changer. Most of the opioid money is lock-boxed by court agreements in a way that ensures it will go to fund addiction treatment and healthcare over the next two decades. \"No amount of money will ever make up for the lives lost and families destroyed,\" Hassan told NPR. \"The funding supports opioid prevention, treatment, and recovery services.\" Along with big increases in state and federal funding for addiction care over the last year, corporate cash could make addiction treatment far more accessible and affordable \u2014 especially for people in poor rural areas and urban neighborhoods. What to look for in 2023:  While most corporations involved in the opioid business have reached settlements with state and local governments, they still face scrutiny from the U.S. Department of Justice. The DOJ has already sued two of America's top-10 biggest corporations over opioids, AmerisourceBergen and Walmart, and more civil complaints against other companies are expected to follow.  Here again, the corporations insist they did nothing wrong.  Billions of dollars in fines and penalties hang in the balance. In recent years, members of the Sackler family who own Purdue Pharma, have emerged as the public face of the opioid crisis. While they admit no personal wrongdoing, their company  has pleaded guilty twice to federal crimes related to opioid marketing, in 2007 and again in 2020. Their flagship product, Oxycontin, became one of the most widely abused pain pills. In March 2022, the Sacklers reached a $6 billion dollar settlement with state attorneys general, a deal that's still under review by the federal courts. Key members of the Sackler family were also confronted for the first time by victims of their company's wrongdoing during an emotional court proceeding that was held via videoconference. In a process agreed to as part of the settlement, survivors of addiction and those who lost family members to opioid overdoses spoke directly to the Sacklers, describing the agony caused after Oxycontin flooded communities. \"You created so much loss for so many people,\" said Kay Scarpone, whose son Joe Scarpone, a retired Marine, died of an opioid overdose. \"I'm not sure how you live every day. I hope you ask for God's forgiveness for your actions. May God have mercy on your souls.\" The Sacklers didn't speak during the proceeding and offered no apology.  (During a congressional hearing in 2020, David Sackler told lawmakers the \"family and the board acted legally and ethically.\") Members of the family faced another high-profile public reckoning in 2022 in the form of an award-winning documentary about the life of Nan Goldin. The celebrated photographer lost years of her life to Oxycontin addiction. The photographer Nan Goldin is profiled in a documentary All The Beauty and The Bloodshed about her campaign to convince art institutions to stop taking donations from members of the Sackler family.\n                \n                    \n                    Nan Goldin via NEON\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"All The Beauty And the Bloodshed,\" which won the Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival, follows Goldin as she campaigned to force museums and galleries around the world to break ties with the Sacklers. \"All the museums and institutions need to stop taking money from these corrupt evil bastards,\" Goldin says in the documentary, as she helps organize one of the opioid protests that rocked the art world. It worked.  Major arts, education and medical institutions around the world have removed the Sackler name from buildings and programs. What to look for in 2023:  The $6 billion Purdue Pharma settlement \u2014 which could grant members of the Sackler family immunity from future opioid lawsuits \u2014 is still being reviewed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in Manhattan.  A ruling is expected in 2023.  If the deal is finalized, the money would go to fund drug treatment programs across the country.",

            "article_content": "A migrant family is apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol agents and National Guard troops in Eagle Pass, Texas, near the border with Mexico on June 30, 2022.\n                \n                    \n                    CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A migrant family is apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol agents and National Guard troops in Eagle Pass, Texas, near the border with Mexico on June 30, 2022. More than half of Americans say there's an \"invasion\" at the southern border, according to a new NPR/Ipsos poll, part of a broader decline in support for immigrants overall. The poll also found that large numbers of Americans hold a variety of misconceptions about immigrants \u2014 greatly exaggerating their role in smuggling illegal drugs into the U.S., and how likely they are to use public benefits, for example \u2014 as false and misleading claims about immigration gain traction. Republicans are more likely to hold negative views of immigrants. But the poll found they're not alone in embracing increasingly extreme rhetoric around immigration. \"Invasion\" rhetoric is resonating with many Americans The poll found that a majority of Americans \u2014 including three-quarters of Republicans \u2014 say it's either somewhat or completely true that the United States is \"experiencing an invasion\" at the southern border. Loading... The U.S. Border Patrol has apprehended migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border more than 1.8 million times since October, setting an annual record for arrests with two months still to go before the fiscal year ends. Nearly half of those migrants were quickly expelled under the public health order known as Title 42 that's been in place since the beginning of the pandemic. But hundreds of thousands more were allowed to seek asylum and other protections in the United States. Republican leaders are increasingly framing the situation as an \"invasion.\" Immigrant advocates say the word has a long history in white nationalist circles, and warn that such extreme rhetoric could provoke more violence against immigrants. Still, the polling shows that the word \"invasion\" has been embraced by a wide range of Americans to describe what's happening at the border. \"We are not actually screening enough people to make it safe for the rest of the country,\" said poll respondent Michael Cisternino, a Republican from Nevada, in a follow-up interview. \"We, the people of the United States, really don't have control over who's coming in, and where they're going or what they're going to do when they get there \u2014 if they're criminals, if they're not criminals,\" Cisternino said. Studies have consistently shown that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes or be incarcerated than native-born Americans. In the NPR/Ipsos poll, a plurality of Republicans answered incorrectly that immigrants are more likely to commit crimes. Republicans were also more likely to endorse rhetoric that echoes the so-called \"replacement theory\" \u2014 the false conspiracy theory that Jews or elites are deliberately replacing white Americans with immigrants and people of color. More than a third of all poll respondents agree that \"native-born Americans are being systematically replaced by immigrants\" \u2014 including more than half of Republicans. Almost half of all Americans say that \"Democrats are working to open our borders to more immigrants,\" with more than 70% of Republicans in agreement. The issue of immigration is much more urgent for Republicans than for Democrats. About a quarter of GOP respondents say immigration is one of the \"most worrying\" problems facing the country, while only 4% of Democrats rank immigration as a top concern. \"A lot of immigrants are coming here for safety, and a lot of them are coming here for a chance\" at a better life, said poll respondent Neel-Gopal Sharma, a Democrat from North Carolina, in a follow-up interview. Sharma's parents emigrated from India to Canada, where he was born, and later moved to the United States. Sharma thinks it's becoming increasingly acceptable to blame immigrants and other people who look different for the country's problems. \"There is this xenophobic kind of talk that's being thrown around,\" he said. \"So I'm not surprised by that.\" Misleading claims about immigrants are gaining traction, particularly around fentanyl The poll found that a large number of Americans, including big majorities of Republicans, blame migrants for a rise in deaths from fentanyl \u2014 even though there's no evidence directly linking them to the problem. Loading... It's true that fentanyl overdose deaths are up in recent years, and that much of the U.S. fentanyl supply is smuggled through the border. But experts say the vast majority of fentanyl and other illegal drugs are smuggled through official ports of entry, hidden in large trucks and passenger vehicles, while a relatively small amount is smuggled by cartels across the border between those ports. Virtually none is smuggled by migrants themselves, says Victor Manjarrez, Jr., a former Border Patrol sector chief who's now a professor at the University of Texas at El Paso. \"The probability that they're going to carry some kind of illicit narcotic is probably close to zero,\" Manjarrez said. \"The vast majority of that fentanyl is going through a port of entry.\" Still, six out of 10 of Republicans in the poll said incorrectly that \"most\" of the fentanyl entering the United States is smuggled by migrants. Similarly, more than half of Republicans say immigrants are \"more likely\" to use public assistance benefits than the native-born population, even though many immigrants are barred from using most federal benefit programs. Less than a quarter of Republicans correctly identified that statement as false. \"These statements of false or misleading or incomplete information are definitely gaining more traction among Republicans,\" said Mallory Newall, a vice president at Ipsos, which conducted the poll. But partisanship isn't the only factor. \"What we're seeing here in our polling is that your willingness to believe these misleading or incomplete statements around immigration not only depends on your partisan affiliation, but also where you are getting your news from,\" Newall said. Republicans who get their news from Fox News and conservative media were more likely to believe false or misleading narratives, Newall says, and were also more likely to believe that these claims were \"completely true.\" That finding was especially strong when it comes to so-called \"ghost flights.\" Republicans accuse the Biden administration of organizing secret flights carrying migrants from the border to communities across the country. But immigrants advocates point out that such flights aren't secret or new, and accuse Republican critics of fear-mongering for political gain. The poll asked if the United States is \"secretly flying unaccompanied migrant children across the country at night.\" Among Republicans whose main news source is Fox or conservative media, about eight in 10 called that statement true, Newall said. However Republicans who get their news elsewhere weren't so sure; only four in 10 answered true. Falling support for immigration, and an uptick in approval for a border wall When NPR polled Americans on immigration in 2018, three out of four respondents agreed that \"immigrants are an important part of our American identity.\" Today that number has fallen sharply. Loading... That's not the only sign of eroding support for immigrants in the latest poll. When asked four years ago, nearly two-thirds of respondents favored a pathway to legal status for the so-called Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children. Now that support has fallen to a bare majority, driven largely by a steep drop among Republicans and independents. There's also been a modest but steady increase in support for a wall at the southern border, from 38% in favor four years ago up to 46% now. It's not clear why those numbers have shifted. Mallory Newall at Ipsos suspects the explanation is tied to broader concerns about inflation and the economy. \"One thing that we know is that during times of bad economic conditions, for example, the recession in 2009, support for immigration declines,\" she said. There's also a theory that support for immigrants tends to fall when there is a perception of chaos at the southern border. And the spread of false and misleading claims could be a factor, as well. The reach of false and misleading claims may be growing The poll suggests that the reach of some false and misleading claims may be growing. Four years ago, NPR asked if \"immigrants are more likely to commit crimes or be incarcerated than the U.S.-born population.\" Back then, more than 60% of respondents correctly identified that statement as false. But when asked again this year, only 49% got it right. That wasn't the only question where Americans' grasp of immigration seemingly declined during the past four years. In 2018, six out of 10 respondents correctly said that most undocumented immigrants in the United States have been in the country for more than a decade. This time, 43% answered correctly; almost as many said they didn't know. \"There has historically been a lot of framing issues regarding immigration that have sometimes distorted facts intentionally,\" said Sophia Jord\u00e1n Wallace, a professor of political science at the University of Washington who has studied false and misleading claims about immigration. Wallace says there's a long tradition in American politics of blaming immigrants for real problems the country is facing as a way to mobilize voters \u2014 regardless of whether there's any connection between those immigrants and the problems they're accused of causing. Those misleading or false claims don't always cross over to the mainstream. But sometimes, Wallace says, they do. \"Once it gets out there, it's hard to correct,\" she said. The NPR/Ipsos poll was conducted from July 28-29, 2022, with a sample of 1,116 adults online. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points for all respondents.",

Dick Durbin, chair of the Judiciary Committee, will preside over next week's Supreme Court confirmation hearings.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Dick Durbin, chair of the Judiciary Committee, will preside over next week's Supreme Court confirmation hearings. When Senate confirmation hearings open on the Supreme Court nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson next week, there will be a new face in the center chair. Presiding over the hearing will be Illinois Democrat Dick Durbin. Though he has served in the House and the Senate for a total of 39 years, his influence has largely been behind the scenes. Until now. He has been No. 2 in the Senate Democratic leadership since 2007, a job that involves knowing senators well enough to be able to count and corral votes, and knowing how to broker a deal. Durbin was raised in the working-class city of East St. Louis, Ill. On the Black side of town, people had come north in the Great Migration to work in factories. On the white side of town, the population was largely Catholic immigrants, like his mother, who came to the U.S. from Lithuania at age 2. Both his parents had only an eighth-grade education and both worked for the railroad, his mother in the office and his father as a night watchman, who worked his way up to a chief clerk's position. \"My church was kind of the center of my life. It was not only my school but it's where I went to play sports and, you know, dances and everything else,\" Durbin remembers. \"I kind of focused on the Catholic side of life in East St. Louis.\" That came to a grinding halt when his father died. \"He was in the hospital for 100 days before he passed away. And there I was, a 14-year-old kid standing by his bed, seeing this man gasping for air at age 53, two packs of Camels a day.\" His father's death led to what, decades later, Durbin calls his proudest accomplishment: his leadership in the fight against tobacco. In 1987, as a junior member of the House, he introduced a bill to ban smoking on airplane trips. Although the entire Democratic and Republican leadership was against the measure, amazingly it passed, on a bipartisan roll call vote. \"Why?\" Durbin asks rhetorically. \"Because the House of Representatives was the biggest frequent-flyer club in America.\" But in fact it was more than that, he says. \"It was a tipping point I didn't see coming.\" A tipping point in public opinion. The bill passed the Senate and was signed into law after the key Senate committee chairman, who was up for election that cycle, polled the question and found that banning smoking on planes and in other public places was very popular. So, how did a boy from East St. Louis, with no financial means, get to college, law school and the U.S. House of Representatives? To start with, Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., was lot cheaper in those days. \"I could work all summer in the slaughterhouse in East St. Louis, make $1,200 a summer,\" and with a part-time job during the school year, and a $1,000 loan each year, he made ends meet. One of the part-time jobs Durbin took was working for Sen. Paul Douglas, a famous liberal lion of his times, whose photo sits on the wall in Durbin's Capitol office. \"Douglas fought the battle for civil rights ... against all the Southern Democrats in the Senate. It went on and on for years,\" Durbin recalls, noting that his mentor was usually on the losing side, but \"he never gave up.\" Now Durbin holds the Senate seat that Douglas once did. Not only is he the assistant majority leader, he is the first whip to also be the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He persuaded the Democratic caucus to let him do these two full time jobs by giving up other significant committee assignments. He is intent on trying to break the committee's gridlock where he can. Everything has to be a compromise to succeed because the committee, and the Senate, is evenly split. Durbin is something of a master at getting along with the opposition whenever possible. He is friends with the Judiciary Committee's ranking Republican, Sen. Chuck Grassley, and is trying once again this year to win passage of the DREAM Act that he first proposed 20 years ago. It would allow undocumented immigrants brought here by their parents as children to win legal status. His ally in that, most of the time, has been Republican Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. \"That's the nature of the Senate,\" he observes. \"There are a lot of titanic egos on a very small boat, and the fellow you push overboard today may be the one that's going to save your life tomorrow.\" There are, of course, some Republicans on the committee whom he sees as implacable. For Democrats, Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Josh Hawley of Missouri and Tom Cotton of Arkansas are particularly problematic. Cotton in particular makes a practice of holding up U.S. attorney, U.S. Marshal and other law enforcement nominees, not because he objects to them in particular, but because of an unrelated policy grievance with the Justice Department. Now Durbin is about to preside over confirmation hearings for the first African American woman nominated for a seat on the U.S Supreme Court, and he is proud of this moment, \"I hope we get it done, fingers crossed. If she can make it, it's historic.\" But he is reflective enough \u2014 and candid enough \u2014 to look back and see that partisanship can lead to misjudgments. He seems to be of two minds about the Democrats' decision in 2013 to abolish the filibuster after Republican leader Mitch McConnell blocked all three nominees to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. \"McConnell just decided that he would do everything in his power to stop us from filling vacancies,\" he recalls. \"And that's when [then-Majority Leader] Harry Reid said, 'I can't let him do that. That's an important court and we've got to have a mechanism to appoint someone.' \" At the time, Reid explicitly preserved the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, but just over three years later, when Donald Trump was elected, McConnell abolished the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, allowing for the quick confirmation of three conservative Supreme Court Justices \u2014 Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Does Durbin regret taking the first step to blowing up the filibuster? The Democrats think McConnell would have abolished it for Supreme Court nominees anyway. But the lack of the filibuster \"has changed the Supreme Court a lot,\" Durbin says, and not for the better. \"When you needed 60 votes to make it on the Supreme Court, you had to have a nominee that could pick up some votes of the minority party, whatever it might be,\" he observes, \"and that, I think, moves you toward a more centrist person. And we no longer have that element in the equation.\" As to his own votes on Supreme Court nominations, does he have any regrets? Durbin was one of 22 Democratic votes against John Roberts' nomination to be chief justice. \"I've thought about that more than anyone,\" Durbin admits. \"I would say if it came to me again, I would reconsider. I respect him for so many things ... although a majority of his opinions I definitely would disagree with.\" If that remark seems measured, don't look for more like it next week when Judge Jackson's nomination hearings begin.",

Former President Donald Trump's administration alarmed career civil servants at the Census Bureau by not only ending the 2020 national head count early, but also pressuring them to alter plans for protecting people's privacy and producing accurate data, a newly released email shows. Trump's political appointees at the Commerce Department, which oversees the bureau, demonstrated an \"unusually\" high level of \"engagement in technical matters, which is unprecedented relative to the previous censuses,\" according to a September 2020 email that Ron Jarmin \u2014 the bureau's deputy director \u2014 sent to two other top civil servants. At the time, the administration was faced with the reality that if Trump lost the November election he could also lose a chance to change the census numbers used to redistribute political representation. The window of opportunity was closing for his administration to attempt to radically reshape the futures of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Electoral College. Despite the 14th Amendment's requirement to include the \"whole number of persons in each state,\" Trump wanted to exclude unauthorized immigrants from the census counts used to reallocate each state's share of congressional seats and electoral votes. While the former president's unprecedented push did not reach its ultimate goal, it wreaked havoc at the federal government's largest statistical agency, which was also contending with the coronavirus pandemic upending most of its plans for the once-a-decade tally. The delays stemming from COVID-19 forced the bureau to conclude that it could no longer meet the legal reporting deadline for the first set of results and needed more time. The administration's last-minute decision to cut the counting short sparked public outcries, including a federal lawsuit that reached the U.S. Supreme Court. But its interference in other areas related to the 2020 census largely flew under most radars. The newly released email \u2014 first reported by The New York Times and obtained by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School through an ongoing public records lawsuit \u2014 details the wide scope of its attempts to buck the bureau's experts and tamper with the count. According to the document, the agency's career civil servants saw when to end counting as a \"policy decision that political leadership should make.\" But the methodologies and procedures for filling in data gaps, reviewing the counts for errors and protecting the confidentiality of people's information should strictly stay in the lane of civil servants at \"an independent statistical agency,\" the email says. Trump officials \u2014 including Wilbur Ross, who served as commerce secretary \u2014 however, \"expressed interest\" in many technical areas, including exactly how the bureau could produce a state-by-state count of unauthorized immigrants and citizenship data that could have politically benefited Republicans when voting districts are redrawn. The email suggests that the bureau's civil servants were planning to discuss their concerns with Ross through the end of 2020. The bureau's public information office did not immediately respond to NPR's questions about whether those discussions took place. Other internal government documents the Brennan Center released Saturday show that bureau officials were wary of carrying out Trump's July 2020 presidential memorandum. Before President Biden reversed the directive last year, it called for information that would allow the president to leave out the numbers of immigrants living in the U.S. without authorization from the congressional apportionment count. According to an August 2020 email by Jarmin \u2014 the bureau's highest-ranking civil servant \u2014 the agency had received, months before the memorandum, \"asks\" for information related to a federal lawsuit focused on the same topic. Like Trump, the challengers in the lawsuit \u2014 the state of Alabama and Republican Rep. Mo Brooks \u2014 wanted undocumented immigrants excluded from the numbers used to reallocate House seats and electoral votes. The bureau, however, was \"consistently pessimistic\" on the feasibility of \"removing undocs from the apportionment count,\" Jarmin warned in the email to two Trump appointees \u2014 then-Director Steven Dillingham, who ultimately resigned following whistleblower complaints, and Nathaniel Cogley, who served in the newly created, controversial role of deputy director for policy. Still, civil servants attempted to be transparent about how they tried to create the data ordered by the former administration. \"We recommend that we do a federal register notice on the methodology because transparency requires that the American public understand how we derived the counts of unauthorized immigrants and have the opportunity to comment on that methodology,\" said a slide titled \"Communication Strategy Decision\" for an August 2020 briefing. No such notice appeared in the federal government's official journal of record. In response to the newly disclosed documents, Arturo Vargas \u2014 a longtime census advocate and CEO of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund \u2014 said in a statement that the efforts of the bureau's career professionals to resist Trump officials' pressure and \"protect the integrity of census operations were nothing short of heroic.\" On Tuesday, the Biden administration's Scientific Integrity Task Force, which includes Jarmin, issued a report warning that the bureau and other federal statistical agencies \"must protect against interference in their efforts to create and release data that provide a set of common facts to inform policymakers, researchers, and the public.\" The report presented the Trump administration's decision to end 2020 census counting early as a case study, noting that the bureau's internal watchdog, the Commerce Department inspector general's office, concluded that the rushed schedule put the quality of the results at risk. \"To date,\" the report added, \"no individuals have been held accountable for these allegations.\"",

            "article_content": "In Colorado, Republicans are hoping their centrist candidate for the U.S. Senate will beat incumbent Democrat Michael Bennet  A MARTINEZ, HOST: Democrats may be feeling more optimistic about the midterm elections lately, but Republicans are looking to the Rocky Mountains to pull an upset in their campaign to flip control of the Senate. Colorado Democrat Michael Bennet is running for his third term. His opponent is the one Republican in a tight Senate race not endorsed by Donald Trump. NPR congressional correspondent Deirdre Walsh reports from Denver. DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Republicans hope the GOP nominee, construction company CEO Joe O'Dea, can flip this blue seat red. He's a rare Republican who affirms President Biden won the 2020 election and thinks someone other than Trump should lead the party in 2024. JOE O'DEA: I'm going to campaign for somebody else, and we're going to move the country forward. And that's where I've been. WALSH: The first-time candidate sticks to a centrist message. O'DEA: On the whole, we got to get rid of this partisanship that's just keeping us from putting good policies in place that move America forward, and that's why I'm running. I'm independent-minded. I'm a conservative, but at the same time, we've got to do what's right for Colorado, what's right for America. WALSH: A big part of O'Dea's strategy is outreach to Latino voters who could be the second-largest voting bloc in the state. At a Hispanic cultural event in Denver, he drank a Mexican lager and bought his wife earrings from a local vendor. UNIDENTIFIED VENDOR: Hello. O'DEA: (Speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED VENDOR: (Speaking Spanish). O'DEA: (Speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED VENDOR: (Speaking Spanish). WALSH: In another break with the bulk of his party, O'Dea backs protections for DREAMers and wants a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented workers. But he stressed Hispanic voters tell him they are focused on the same things as all Coloradans. O'DEA: They're worried about the price of gas and this record crime that's taken over the city. That's spot on their mind right now. WALSH: Over tea at a local coffee shop in Denver, incumbent Michael Bennet pushes back at the notion that O'Dea is a moderate who can compete here. MICHAEL BENNET: That is the national media's interpretation of what's going on in this race. WALSH: Bennet spent much of August traveling the state, touting legislation Democrats passed to lower prescription drug prices and invest in climate programs. He agrees with his opponent that voters are very focused on inflation. BENNET: What people are having to pay for food and for gasoline is a challenge. But I think that my sense is that people are actually seeing Washington begin to work again. And after the chaos of four years of Donald Trump, that's really welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WALSH: At the final week of the Green Valley Ranch Summer Farmers Market, north of downtown Denver, shoppers are milling around as a band plays live music. Most of the people we talked to don't know who's running in November's Senate race, but they had strong feelings about what matters for their vote this fall. LEON SMITH: Housing and jobs. WALSH: That's kettle corn vendor Leon Smith. SMITH: Kettle? Ten minutes. WALSH: Smith voted for former President Trump but said he doesn't feel compelled to vote for either party this fall. SMITH: Right now, each party is just still doing tit for tat. They're not handling no business. WALSH: For Linda Wilson, who leans Democrat, one issue is top of mind. LINDA WILSON: The abortion issue is a big one. And even though when I was younger, I had the choice - because I was pregnant before I got married - it was a choice. It wasn't an option that I would have chosen for myself, but I had that option. WALSH: Abortion may be O'Dea's biggest challenge. He backs some abortion rights, but he's running in a state with a long history of protecting abortion access. The state codified its protections this year, a law O'Dea opposed. He also voted for a ballot measure in 2020 that banned abortions after 22 weeks, with no exceptions. That was soundly defeated. O'Dea sidestepped whether those positions put him out of step with a majority of Colorado voters. Instead, he emphasized when he thinks abortion should be legal. O'DEA: I believe the first five months, the mother has the choice. After that, there should be some exceptions - rape, incest, life of the mother. WALSH: But O'Dea said he supports Trump's Supreme Court appointees, who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade. Abortion-rights advocates argue that position is inconsistent. O'DEA: I believe in good conservative judges. I like that, but I don't believe in the decision that they made. WALSH: O'Dea said he would represent his constituents if a nationwide abortion ban came up in the Senate. But Bennet argues O'Dea's position on abortion, along with his stances on other issues, will turn off Colorado voters. BENNET: He's the nominee of the Republican Party here in Colorado, and he says that Trump bears no responsibility for what happened on January 6. That should be disqualifying, to say nothing of his position on Roe v. Wade, to say nothing of, you know, his position on the trickle-down economics that have made Colorado and so many places in this country unaffordable for working people. WALSH: As O'Dea deliberately pivots away from Trump, Bennet insists the former president is a factor. BENNET: It's a reality that Trump hangs over everything. WALSH: Trump is someone who came up with most of the voters we talked to Philip Cardenas, who sells freeze-dried candy at the Green Valley Ranch Farmers Market, plans to back Bennet. He admits he doesn't know anything about O'Dea, but says he's concerned about extremism from the GOP. PHILIP CARDENAS: I think a majority of Americans are purple. I mean, if the climate was different, I would definitely - and I thought a Republican president would do better, I would vote. But they're too far right, right now, with the MAGA crowd. WALSH: O'Dea has called January 6 a black eye on the country. He vows he wouldn't vote in lockstep with GOP leaders. O'DEA: If they want my vote, then they're going to have to earn it. And they're going to have to move things around to make sure that I can honor my word. WALSH: Complaints about partisanship blocking real action are common here. Lynette Vigil, a mom of seven, says housing costs are out of control. But she doesn't have much faith Congress will do much about it. LYNETTE VIGIL: It's a circus. Like, there's no other word for it. It's a circus. I feel like people are living in an alternate reality. WALSH: Bennet gets the frustration but points to a string of recent bills as evidence the Senate is working. BENNET: I mean, it'd be hard to imagine somebody more disenchanted with Washington, D.C., than I am. But I will say that for the last 12 months or so, it's really been amazing to see what's been accomplished, mostly in a bipartisan way - Republicans and Democrats working together. And I don't think that should be discounted. WALSH: O'Dea's pitch to attract independents and Democrats is that he's someone who's willing to compromise. But Bennet says this election is a choice between a party that has made some headway to bring down high prices or a party dominated by a leader still fighting about the last election.

            "article_content": "Syrian refugees found refuge in southern Turkey, even building businesses that help the local economy. But now the political winds are shifting, and many feel they're no longer welcome.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Now let's turn overseas for a look at southern Turkey and the shaky status of Syrian refugees in what had been a welcoming haven. Turkey hosts millions of people fleeing Syria's civil war, and many made new lives there, even helping to power local economies with businesses they've built. Now an economic crisis and rising resentment have turned that reality upside down for many. NPR's Fatma Tanis went to the southern city of Gaziantep. That's the center of Turkey's biggest concentration of Syrians. (SOUNDBITE OF MOTOR RUMBLING) FATMA TANIS, BYLINE: Two years ago, this Syrian business owner and his family were offered relocation to Canada by the United Nations. But life in Turkey was so good, they declined and chose to stay. YUSUF: (Speaking Arabic). TANIS: He now recalls the decision with disbelief and regret. He runs a phone store with his father on a busy street with many other Syrian businesses and wanted to only use his first name, Yusuf, fearing that speaking publicly could hurt his legal status in Turkey. YUSUF: (Through interpreter) Many of the working-class Syrians have left. There's no one to buy our stuff anymore. TANIS: In 2018, Turkey's economy took a downturn and has only worsened since. The crisis has been especially tough on Syrian refugees, many of whom are laborers and living below the poverty line. But Yusuf says there's actually a bigger problem. YUSUF: (Through interpreter) Racism, racism, racism. The Turkish people blame us for everything. TANIS: Opposition politicians in Turkey have mostly blamed the country's economic woes on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's once very welcoming immigration policies and scapegoated Syrians. In response, Erdogan announced a plan to, quote, \"resettle\" 1 million refugees in areas of northern Syria that are controlled by Turkey. And this year, rights groups say, Turkey started arbitrarily deporting hundreds of Syrian men. YUSUF: (Speaking Arabic). TANIS: Yusuf appreciates Erdogan's record toward Syrians, but he's tired of getting harassed in the streets and deeply critical of the deportations. YUSUF: (Through interpreter) The deportations have emboldened the racists. The smallest altercation with an angry Turkish citizen who might call the police, and you can find yourself at a deportation camp. TANIS: You hear a Turkish view a couple of shops down from Yusuf. Murat Baykal owns a small grocery store. He says he feels like a second-class citizen in his own country. MURAT BAYKAL: (Through interpreter) The Syrians are just everywhere. They own more than half of this street, get all kinds of help from the government. And they brought more crime to the city. TANIS: But Baykal himself relies on Syrians for work, like his apprentice, a 10-year-old Syrian boy who was munching on snacks next to him. BAYKAL: (Speaking Turkish). TANIS: \"Of course, there are amazing people, too,\" he says, \"like this one,\" reaching to ruffle the boy's hair. A lot of Syrians are working with Turks. Omar Kadkoy, an analyst for Ankara-based think tank TEPAV, who is Syrian himself, studies the integration of Syrian refugees in Turkey and says the pressure Syrians feel hold them back from doing things that could help Turkey more. OMAR KADKOY: They live in fear because any minor mistake might put them at the opposite side of the border. And while this is going to happen, they will not fully unleash their potential or contribution because they feel that at any given point, this might come to an end in an arbitrary manner. (SOUNDBITE OF HAMMER PLINKING) TANIS: In the old town of Gaziantep, coppersmiths hammer away. Narrow cobblestoned streets are lined with shops selling spices and silk. The city was once an example of successful integration, taking in half a million refugees. Syrian Mohammed Salem has a shop selling scarves and jewelry from his homeland. It's the last of his stock from Aleppo. There's nothing left there anymore, he says. And things are getting tougher here. MOHAMMAD SALEM: Here the people are all refugees. They have stress, and the government - they don't understand that. Some people - they have stress from the house, stress from the war, stress from the streets, stress from everything. TANIS: He and other Syrians worry that if they're sent back to Syria, they'll face the same persecution they fled years ago. And they don't actually believe it'll happen. SALEM: Nobody wants to go back to Syria - nobody. And the government knows that. They're talking as the politics. This is a political game. TANIS: Still, he says the rhetoric is harmful, and he hopes to move his family to Europe or Canada because he just can't see a future for his children here. But if he and other Syrians leave, their Turkish neighbors will feel it. The director of the city's migration management department, Onder Yalcin, told NPR in a statement that Syrian businesses help increase exports and employment. But the message hasn't gotten out, says analyst Omar Kadkoy. KADKOY: Unfortunately, there isn't enough media coverage when it comes to the success stories of Syrians in a way to combat the overall negative perceptions that are prevailing in the country nowadays. (SOUNDBITE OF METAL CLANGING) LOBNA HELLI: (Speaking Turkish). TANIS: One of those success stories is Lobna Helli, who was an HR manager in Syria and fled in 2015 after her husband was arrested and tortured by the Syrian regime. Here, she got a grant from the city and opened a popular restaurant called Lazord - Arabic for the deep blue gemstone lapis - where she, along with her mother and sister, cook and serve Aleppan home dishes. The restaurant is frequented by Syrians as well as Turks. HELLI: (Speaking Arabic). TANIS: She smiles, watching her Turkish customers enjoy Syrian food, which is similar to Gaziantep's cuisine but with different spices and flavors. HELLI: (Through interpreter) My upstairs neighbors are Turkish, and they always send me plates of Turkish food when they know I work late, even though I have a restaurant. TANIS: Helli says her life is in Turkey now and doesn't plan to go anywhere else. HELLI: (Through interpreter) My two daughters speak Turkish fluently. I'm even thinking about expanding to another location. TANIS: But the future for her and others could be decided next year. (SOUNDBITE OF CAR HORN HONKING) TANIS: Back at his telecom shop, Yusuf says their fate will depend on presidential elections expected in Turkey by the summer. If Erdogan wins, he'll stay in Turkey. Otherwise, he'll move his family to rebel-held Idlib in Syria, where millions live under the threat of Syrian and Russian airstrikes. YUSUF: (Speaking Arabic). TANIS: If given the choice between death in his homeland and suffering daily harassment here, he says he'd rather go back home and die with dignity. Fatma Tanis, NPR News, Gaziantep, Southern Turkey.

            "article_content": "This first appeared in NPR's New Normal newsletter. Sign up here to get early access to more stories about how we're adjusting to a changing world. I got a surprise when I opened Twitter the other morning \u2014 and no, it wasn't because of the latest tweet from new owner Elon Musk. At the top of my feed was a colorful graphic announcing, \"It takes time to count all of the votes.\" It gave a few more details about why (projected winners in some contests might not be announced right away) and a warning: \"This means you could encounter unconfirmed claims that a candidate has won their race.\" Below were two buttons to \"find out more\" and \"learn how voting by mail is safe and secure.\" I immediately recognized what I was seeing: a \"prebunk\". Twitter is just one of several companies, government agencies and civic groups experimenting with this strategy, which rests on a simple idea: show people a little bit about misleading information, so they're better equipped to recognize and resist it if they encounter it in the future. Think of it like a vaccine against false claims \u2014 in fact, it stems from a field of social psychology research called inoculation theory. The research on just how prebunks work and how long they last is still in the early innings \u2014 and everyone I spoke with about the strategy emphasized it's only one part of the bigger fight to protect elections, and democracy at large, from the corrosive impact of deliberate falsehoods. But companies including Twitter and Google have seen encouraging results, and are putting resources into prebunks \u2014 in Twitter's case for this fall's elections in the U.S. and Brazil, and in Google's case around Europe's refugee crisis. For now, anyway. Because the other thing I immediately thought when I saw that message on Twitter was, how long will this last? Which brings me back to Elon Musk. The world's richest person now owns Twitter, and things are already changing. The site saw a surge in hate speech right after news broke that he'd taken control. Twitter and outside researchers said a coordinated campaign originating on far-right platforms was in part to blame. Trolls egged each other on to post racist slurs and antisemitic memes on Twitter, in an apparent effort to make it seem like Musk had followed through on his promises to loosen the platform's rules against things like abuse, harassment and misleading claims in the name of free speech. Musk says no rules have changed yet and that he won't make any major overhauls \u2014 including reinstating banned users such as former President Donald Trump \u2014 until he sets up a \"content moderation council.\" But as the trolling campaign shows, his ownership is already having an impact. And Musk himself is engaging in his characteristic chaos: one moment pledging to advertisers that Twitter won't become a \"free-for-all hellscape,\" the next tweeting to his 112 million followers a lurid, baseless conspiracy theory about the violent attack on Paul Pelosi. (Musk eventually deleted the tweet, but not before it was retweeted and liked tens of thousands of times.) That's left many people \u2014 including people inside Twitter working on trust and safety \u2014 increasingly agitated about the company's willingness and capacity to deal with misleading information about voting and candidates, threats to election workers, and the possibility of premature or false claims of victory. This week, Twitter froze some employee access to content moderation tools, Bloomberg reported. Musk also laid off swaths of employees on Friday, including members of the curation team who tackle misinformation and contextualize news on the platform, according to employees. \"We're still enforcing our rules at scale,\" Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of safety and integrity, tweeted in response to the Bloomberg story. But what happens when the person potentially breaking them is Twitter's owner, CEO and sole director? That's just one of the questions my colleagues and I on NPR's disinformation and democracy team will be examining as we head into the midterms, the 2024 U.S. presidential campaign, and key elections around the world.",

Officials in Ann Arbor, Mich., Union County, N.C., and Contra Costa County, Calif., are posting infographics on social media urging people to \"think critically\" about what they see and share about voting and to seek out reliable election information. Earlier this month, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency put out a public service announcement saying cyberattacks are not likely to disrupt voting. Twitter will soon roll out prompts in users' timelines reminding them final results may not come on Election Day. They're all examples of a strategy known as \"prebunking\" that's become an important pillar of how tech companies, nonprofits and government agencies respond to misleading and false claims about elections, public health and other hot-button issues. The idea: show people the tactics and tropes of misleading information before they encounter it in the wild \u2014 so they're better equipped to recognize and resist it. The strategy stems from a field of social psychology research called inoculation theory. \"The idea [is] that you can build mental armor or mental defenses against something that's coming in the future and trying to manipulate you, if you learn a little bit about it,\" said Beth Goldberg, head of research and development at Jigsaw, a division within Google that develops technology to counter online threats. \"So it's a little bit like getting physically inoculated against a disease.\" To test inoculation theory, researchers have created games like Bad News, where players post conspiracy theories and false claims, with the goal of gaining followers and credibility. They learn to use techniques including impersonation, appeals to emotions like fear and anger, and amplification of partisan grievances. Researchers at the University of Cambridge found that after people played Bad News, they were less likely to think tweets using those same techniques were reliable. In the past few years, those lessons are starting to be applied more broadly in campaigns encouraging critical thinking, pointing out manipulative tactics, and pre-emptively countering false narratives with accurate information. Ahead of this year's midterm elections, the National Association of State Election Directors launched a toolkit for local officials with videos, infographics and tip sheets in English and Spanish. The overall message? Election officials are the most reliable source of election information. \"Every day, people are hearing new rumors, new misconceptions or misunderstandings of the way elections are administered in their state,\" said Amy Cohen, NASED executive director. \"And certainly local election officials are really on the front lines of this because they're right there in the community where voters are.\" \"Elections are safe and secure. We know because we run them,\" one graphic reads. \"Elections are coming...so is inaccurate information. Questions? We have answers,\" says another. A tip sheet local agencies can download and distribute offers ways to \"protect yourself from false information about elections\": check multiple news sources, understand the difference between fact-based reporting and opinion or commentary, consider the \"purpose and agenda\" behind messages, and \"take a moment to pause and reflect before reacting.\" Another focuses specifically on images and videos, noting they can be manipulated, altered, or taken out of context. The goal is \"addressing these patterns of disinformation rather than each individual story,\" said Michelle Ciulla Lipkin, executive director of the National Association for Media Literacy Education, which worked with NASED to develop the toolkit.

Other prebunking efforts attempt to anticipate false claims and provide accurate information to counter them. Twitter has made prebunks a core element of its efforts to address misleading or false narratives about elections in the U.S. and Brazil, the U.N. climate summit in Glasgow last year and the war in Ukraine. Many of these take the form of curated collections of tweets from journalists, fact checkers, government officials and other authoritative sources. As part of its election prep work, the company identified themes and topics that could be \"potential vectors for misinformation, disinformation or other harmful activity,\" said Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of safety and integrity. Election prebunks have \"provided critical context on issues such as electronic voting, mail-in balloting and the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election,\" said Leo Stamillo, Twitter's global director of curation. \"It gives users the opportunity to take more informed decisions when they encounter misinformation on the platform or even outside the platform,\" Stamillo said Twitter has produced more than a dozen prebunks about voting in states including Arizona, Georgia, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. It's also published 58 prebunks ahead of the midterms as well as the general election in Brazil, and has another 10 ready to go. That's a reflection of how misleading narratives cross borders, Stamillo said. \"Some of the narratives that we see in the U.S., we've also seen in Brazil,\" he said. Overall, 4.86 million users have read at least one of Twitter's election-related prebunks this year, the company said. There is still a lot unknown about prebunking, including how long the effects last, what the most successful formats are, and whether it's more effective to focus on helping people spot tactics used to spread misleading content or to tackle false narratives directly. Prebunks focused on techniques or broader narratives rather than specific claims can avoid triggering partisan or emotional reactions, Google's Goldberg said. \"People don't have preexisting biases, necessarily, about those things. And in fact, they can be a lot more universally appealing for people to reject.\" But there's enough evidence supporting the use of prebunks that Twitter and Google are embracing the strategy. Twitter surveyed users who saw prebunks during the 2020 election \u2014 specifically, messages in their timelines warning of misleading information about mail-in ballots and explaining why final results could be delayed. It found 39% reported they were more confident there would be no election fraud, 50% paused and questioned what they were seeing, and 40% sought out more information. \"This data shows us that there's a lot of promise and a lot of potential, not just in mitigating misinformation after it spreads, but in getting ahead of it to try to educate, share context, prompt critical thinking, and overall help people be savvier consumers of the information that they're seeing online,\" Roth said. Over at Google, Goldberg and her team worked with academic psychologists on experiments using 90-second videos to explain common misinformation tactics including emotionally manipulative language and scapegoating. They found showing people the videos made them better at spotting the techniques \u2014 and less likely to say they would share posts that use them. Now, Google is applying those findings in a social media campaign in Europe that aims to derail false narratives about refugees. \"It's now reached tens of millions of people, and its goal is to help preempt and help people become more resilient to this anti-migrant rhetoric and misleading information,\" Goldberg said. \"I'm really eager to see how promising this is at scale.\"",

            "article_content": "Many people in Turkey are growing increasingly weary of hosting the millions of Syrian refugees that have been there for years \u2014 but the Syrians have no place to go.  JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: For more than a decade, Syrians have been finding refuge from their country's civil war in neighboring Turkey. The U.N. says more than 3.6 million refugees are sheltering there. But NPR's Peter Kenyon visited the Aegean port city of Izmir, which for years has had a sizable Syrian population. He found Turkish residents increasingly wish they would go home, leaving refugees to wonder and worry about their future. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Izmir is an ancient port city long used to seeing travelers. But judging by recent comments, many residents no longer welcome refugees from Syria. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Non-English language spoken). KENYON: In a teahouse near Izmir's Kemeralti Market area, 58-year-old Ebru, like many of the people who agreed to speak with a reporter, asked that her family name not be used. She's concerned about repercussions for speaking candidly about a sensitive subject. She says partly the problems are economic. Her friends' adult children are mostly unemployed, and she thinks it's because the Syrians will work for less money. Beyond that, she says, the Syrians have completely overrun certain neighborhoods. She was shocked to see the changes when she visited one recently. EBRU: (Through interpreter) They have moved into many sectors. I went there. I couldn't believe my eyes. That place is no longer Izmir. It's Syria now, with loads of their shops. In addition, another thing I oppose is allowing them to own places here. KENYON: Ebru repeats a stereotype common among the Turkish Izmir residents I met, that the Syrians have too many children, which she says is, quote, \"not good for our country.\" Government figures estimate there are nearly 150,000 Syrians in Izmir, and the 2.7 million people who live here think that's more than enough. Fifty-two-year-old Nihat sits at the entrance to a small shop. He started it for his 24-year-old son and minds it on weekends. He says his son couldn't get the job he really wanted because of competition from Syrians. NIHAT: (Through interpreter) We have a lot of unemployed young people. Their jobs have been taken by the people coming here. That's my observation, people from other countries finding jobs here. Why shouldn't our own citizens be earning their bread here? KENYON: Turkish politicians have seized on the issue. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, seen by some as a hero for opening Turkey's doors when most of Europe and the U.S. were closing theirs, is now promising to send 1 million Syrians back to their homeland. Leaders of the main secular opposition party are also promising to send, quote, \"our Syrian brothers\" back to their country. One of the most outspoken politicians is Umit Ozdag, who was twice expelled from Turkey's far-right MHP party. He founded the Zafer or Victory Party and uses the platform to rail against foreigners. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) UMIT OZDAG: (Non-English language spoken). KENYON: The party released this animated video which shows two of Ozdag's aides asking how he plans to get rid of the foreigners. Their eyes widen in amazement as they see the giant catapult standing behind him as Ozdag says, he will get rid of all of them. It's a depressing shift, says Gizem Metindag, who works for a group providing assistance to Syrians. She says politicians are finding it easy to attract attention and supporters by attacking refugees. GIZEM METINDAG: (Through interpreter) Umit Ozdag is the ugliest example. But I observe this in all of the opposition parties. They cannot offer anything new. They pretend this is the main issue, as if they can solve it with their rhetoric. KENYON: Syrians here say they can definitely feel the rising discontent with their continued presence. Outside a barber shop in Izmir, Mohammad Hamza says after nine years in Turkey, he doesn't see how he can go back to his home in Aleppo, which suffered heavy damage when government forces recaptured it. He says his daughters are excelling in Turkish schools. They love their teachers and don't even speak Arabic. Hamza says he has dozens of relatives already in Europe and doesn't think there's anything left for him in Syria. MOHAMMAD HAMZA: (Through interpreter) My house is gone. I had a workshop. That's also gone. What will I do in Syria - translate for my daughters? We want to go to Europe. I wish that Europe can take us. KENYON: But Europe, which gave billions to Turkey to keep the refugees from traveling further north, has shown no sign of opening its doors. In Turkey, people are proud of the role their country played. But after a decade, they feel they're competing with Syrians for jobs and benefits. And political leaders are stoking that tension as they prepare for elections next year. Peter Kenyon, NPR News, Izmir, Turkey. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

There was a moment when cattle rancher Jennifer Ellis decided she couldn't stand on the sidelines anymore. It was when Ammon Bundy, who led an armed takeover of a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon and was later acquitted, moved to Idaho and began mounting his campaign for governor. \"When you see him rising in the national consciousness as some kind of a cowboy rancher, that gets a little touchy,\" Ellis said one windy afternoon on her ranch near Blackfoot, Idaho. To Ellis, Bundy gave ranchers \u2014 actual, working, public lands ranchers who follow the law and pay their fees \u2014 a bad name. Self-described moderate Republicans like her viewed the scofflaw rebellion as a precursor to today's right-wing politics of conspiracies and trolling becoming mainstreamed. Ellis is also alarmed by the meanness and threats directed at anyone with opposing viewpoints. \"It's dividing communities,\" she says. \"They love the politics of fear.\" Ruby red Idaho is one of the most intense battlegrounds between moderates and extremists in the Republican Party. Its primary is next month. Political analysts see it as a national test for how far to the right the GOP can be pulled. Ammon Bundy recently switched his affiliation from Republican to independent. But the state's lieutenant governor, Janice McGeachin, who has cozied up to white nationalists and anti-government militias, is vying for the GOP nomination. There are also militia-backed candidates running for the state legislature, including two men also involved with the recent armed standoffs with federal agents in the West. In eastern Idaho, Jennifer Ellis regrets not speaking out sooner. She's a past president of the Idaho Cattle Association and proudly says she's a fourth generation Idahoan. \"People like me kind of got tired of listening to the conspiracy stuff,\" she says. \"We just went home and went back to work, and so then the extremists were able to take control.\" So last fall, Ellis joined with a group of former Republican elected leaders here \u2014 including a retired state House speaker and state Supreme Court justice \u2014 to form the political action committee Take Back Idaho. The group has raised close to $100,000, and it's initially trying to unseat 16 far-right legislators. That will be a tough job in Idaho, where the far right often even attacks fellow conservatives as being RINOs, Republicans in name only. Jennifer Ellis, a rancher and lifelong Republican, helped form Take Back Idaho to push back against extremism in her home state.\n                \n                    \n                    Kirk Siegler/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jennifer Ellis, a rancher and lifelong Republican, helped form Take Back Idaho to push back against extremism in her home state. \"There's nothing that Republican officeholders hate worse than being called a RINO, or not Christian enough, and now we've got both of those operations going in this state,\" Ellis says. The state has long been associated with political extremism, but only lately has it been aligned to elements within a political party. Around her family's ranch on the windy high prairie, new subdivisions have sprung up lately with homes bought by newcomers, some calling themselves \"refugees\" from nearby blue states. Trump 2024 flags started popping up here right around President Biden's nomination. Letters to the editor champion the former president as a \"blue collar billionaire.\" In most states, Idaho's Republican Gov. Brad Little, who's running for reelection, would be considered a hard-line conservative. He just signed a Texas-style abortion bill. But around here, some dyed in the wool party activists consider Little too liberal. \"We are a very conservative state with nothing but blue policies,\" says Doyle Beck, a former Bonneville County GOP chairman. Beck runs a construction company in Idaho Falls and is also a state GOP delegate. He says conservatives have worked hard in recent years to steer the party toward an agenda based on liberty: eliminating most government, he says, as well as taxes on business. Beck sees the upcoming primary, and the national midterms, as a tipping point. \"The status quo is special interest groups and cronies governing the state of Idaho,\" Beck says. \"Take Back Idaho's feeling like they're losing.\" At the University of Montana, political scientist Rob Saldin is tracking moderate groups like Take Back Idaho, which so far are rare. \"Where are the current high-profile Republicans who are endorsing and supporting this effort?\" Saldin asks. \"I don't see many. And the ones you do, it's like, Liz Cheney, who's in big trouble.\" Saldin says the populist rhetoric stoked by the former president and his followers continues to appeal to the party base, and particularly people who have never voted or been politically active before. He figures that may be why some current GOP lawmakers are reluctant to speak out. The former governor of Saldin's state, Marc Racicot, has been writing editorials in mainstream outlets like The Washington Post lately similar in tone to Take Back Idaho. Racicot, who also chaired the Republican National Committee during the George W. Bush administration, says the party's far-right leaders are a threat to democracy. \"There is a huge, great middle of America that is concerned about us as a republic falling apart,\" Racicot told NPR. Former Montana Gov. Marc Racicot says the far-right leaders of his party are a threat to democracy.\n                \n                    \n                    Kirk Siegler/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former Montana Gov. Marc Racicot says the far-right leaders of his party are a threat to democracy. Racicot was a popular two-term governor in the 1990s. Now some of the party's base attacks him, too, as a RINO. He calls that angry, cheap rhetoric. \"Anytime you get fat and happy about what it is you're doing that's not focused upon the best interest of your country first \u2014 not your party, your country first \u2014 you end up placing your form of government at risk,\" Racicot says. He added that Republicans today in his view are using hate and division as a tool to distract rather than dealing head on with tough issues facing the country. This was rancher Jennifer Ellis' take as the Idaho legislature recently wrapped up its session. Lawmakers made national headlines for going after librarians for exposing kids to \"harmful\" books. One sponsor of a self-described election integrity bill even pushed a false notion that Canadians were crossing over the border to vote in elections here. \"I just have to wonder where the grown-ups in the room are on some of these things,\" Ellis says. \"We have got infrastructure that is really in peril. We have got schools that have not been funded like they should.\" On a recent afternoon, Ellis was trying to raise money for the PAC and fight extremism in the middle of calving season, one of the busiest times of the year on a ranch. \"Actually I'm surprised that they haven't done a little bit of bellarin',\" she said, laughing, as she steered her pickup into a pasture where some newborn calves, still wet, lay with their mothers. This time of year, when the wind kicks up dirt and mud on them, she's often in the fields checking on things around the clock. She says true Idaho conservatives are out here on the land working. \"We're not conspiracy theorists in Idaho; that's never been how we've ran this state,\" Ellis says. \"It's a meat and potatoes state. We do important things; we don't do juvenile things.\" For Ellis and other moderates trying to pull the pendulum back toward the middle, the May 17 primary could be a big first test of that.",

            "article_content": "Russian forces are moving toward another Ukrainian nuclear power plant. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has generated a refugee crisis. Ex-Attorney General Barr defends his record in a new book.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Another round of Russia-Ukraine talks is expected to take place in Belarus today. Meanwhile, there's growing concern about keeping Ukraine's power plants, nuclear power plants, out of the fighting. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It was just Friday that Russia seized control of Europe's largest nuclear power plant. That was in a port city where intense shelling and a fire on the grounds raised fears of a nuclear catastrophe in the middle of a Russian siege. MARTIN: Our co-host Leila Fadel has been watching the latest developments from the city of Lviv in the western part of Ukraine, and she joins us now. Hi, Leila. LEILA FADEL, HOST: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: So how much of Ukraine's nuclear power infrastructure does Russia control now? FADEL: Right. Of Ukraine's four nuclear power plants, they control half. That power plant has six nuclear reactors in it, the one you mentioned. And that's the biggest - the biggest concern at that facility in Zaporizhzhia is the staff. Over the weekend, the International Atomic Energy Agency said they were having trouble reaching the staff there, that Russian forces had switched off some mobile networks, the internet. So it seems the staff and scientists, at least at this facility - which, as you mentioned, is Europe's largest nuclear power plant - are operating under some level of duress. MARTIN: Right. And we should just say, the staff there - they're still Ukrainians. Russia didn't come in and supplant them. FADEL: Same staff, exactly. MARTIN: Right. FADEL: Right. MARTIN: So how does taking over these power plants - how does this fit into Russia's strategy? FADEL: Well, the first and probably key goal has to do with energy. I spoke with Mariana Budjeryn. She's a nuclear expert at Harvard's Belfer Center. MARIANA BUDJERYN: Ukraine relies very heavily on nuclear energy. About 50% of its energy mix, overall energy mix, comes from nuclear power plants. So if you seize those, you pretty much control what people get full electricity, what industry gets full electricity. And it's one of the ways to control and subdue a country. MARTIN: But this is also a safety concern - isn't it? - when nuclear power plants become pawns in a war. FADEL: Absolutely. I mean, nobody benefits from a nuclear event, a nuclear disaster - far-reaching consequences there. But Budjeryn is also worried about a different kind of nuclear disaster separate from the takeover of these plants. She says she's worried Vladimir Putin could play a terrifying card if he's seen as losing to Ukraine. As you know, Ukraine has put up a fierce resistance to Russian forces, and she says she's worried Putin won't accept being seen as a loser. BUDJERYN: I wonder if he might resort to use of a tactical, of a small nuclear weapon to shock Ukraine - on Ukrainian territory somewhere and then to shock Ukraine into surrender. FADEL: She says the range of impact could equal or exceed the scope of the atomic bombs that was dropped by the U.S. on Japan near the end of World War II. He could also use a nuclear weapon above a city, exploding it to cause an electromagnetic pulse that would incapacitate a big urban area. MARTIN: Right, some kind of so-called targeted nuclear strike. So we've got the specter of that looming and then, you know, ongoing concerns about potential nuclear disasters from these plants. I mean, this is a really exceptional moment, isn't it? FADEL: Yeah, yeah. I mean, we haven't seen anything quite like this. Most, if not all, of the safeguards put in place to account for accidents from the past weren't designed with a full-scale war in mind, and that's what makes nuclear experts like Budjeryn so nervous. If something does go wrong, the safeguards in place aren't built to withstand a direct impact from a weapon. So this is new territory. BUDJERYN: A nuclear accident anywhere is really a nuclear accident everywhere. You cannot control the weather. The winds can carry this radioactivity far and wide. We're talking about a time scale of decades... FADEL: A disaster. BUDJERYN: ...That these consequences could continue to play out. FADEL: A lot at risk here, Rachel. MARTIN: Indeed. NPR's Leila Fadel talking to us from Lviv, Ukraine. Thank you, Leila, for all your reporting. FADEL: Thank you, Rachel. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: Russia's war in Ukraine has created the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II. INSKEEP: That's according to the United Nations. In just over 10 days, more than 1 1/2 million people have fled their homes. Most of them crossed into Poland. Over the weekend, negotiators agreed on humanitarian corridors for civilians to leave some war-torn cities, but Ukraine says Russian invaders opened fire on the corridors. MARTIN: There are now some two dozen refugee so-called reception centers on the Polish border. These are pop-up centers where aid groups and an ad hoc army of volunteers from across Europe have come to try to help. NPR's Eric Westervelt visited several of these, and he joins us now from the border. Hi, Eric. ERIC WESTERVELT, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. Good morning. MARTIN: Looks like we've got just a delay on the line. Eric, can you describe for us what you've seen? WESTERVELT: Yeah, so these sites along the border are bustling, occasionally chaotic places. I went to one set up in an out-of-business supermarket, in its parking lot. You know, the NGOs and the United Nations are there, but so are scores of ordinary folks who've come to help. People from different countries have set up food kitchens. They're directing refugees to buses they've organized. I met a French attorney who said he shut down his firm abruptly, felt compelled to help, told his clients if that doesn't work for you, find another lawyer. You know, people were holding cardboard signs directing refugees to transport across Europe. And one of the people I spoke with was Krstaps Naymanes. He's a deliveryman in Liepaja, Latvia. You know, he took leave from his job and, with friends, helped organize half a dozen cars, some RVs and a large bus to take refugees to Latvia. KRSTAPS NAYMANES: We have our flat, houses and... UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Food. NAYMANES: ...Everything. Don't charge, like, money for this. Peoples want help and can't help. This time - need to do. That's it. MARTIN: Wow. WESTERVELT: Another volunteer, Daniel Wuhler, is a chef. He has a catering - (inaudible) - in northern Germany. He drove down here to the border with his mobile kitchen. He was serving up some fresh German stews, breads and coffee - all for free, of course. And he told me, look; this was just the right thing to do. DANIEL WUHLER: The war is not over at the moment, so everyone have to stay as long as possible, and everyone should help. MARTIN: And there are a lot of people who need help. Eric, what were your conversations with Ukrainian refugees like? WESTERVELT: All were very thankful for the warm support and help on this side of the border. But of course, they were also tired, worried and frightened. I talked with a teenager, Anatoli Saracmon, and his 10-year-old brother. They just arrived from Lviv in western Ukraine with their mother. ANATOLI SARACMON: I think I and my brother will go to Estonia to my uncle, and my mother will come to Ukraine. WESTERVELT: He means his mother is going to go back to Ukraine. She looked near tears, exhausted. She said, you know, her husband and her job are there, and she just has to go back. MARTIN: So as of this point, Eric, Europe is welcoming refugees, open arms. But how long can they do that? Is it - is the system going to crack at some point? WESTERVELT: Well, that's the big concern, Rachel. I mean, is there a number at which Poland and this support system get overwhelmed? I mean, remember; Ukraine has 44 million people. We're at 1 1/2 million refugees, but we're only, you know, 12 days into the war, and as fighting intensifies, the numbers could certainly soar. So the challenge will be to maintain, really, that support, that solidarity and both money and this volunteer army far beyond these first few days of war. MARTIN: NPR's Eric Westervelt reporting from along the Polish border with Ukraine. Thank you, Eric. WESTERVELT: Good to talk to you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: Former U.S. Attorney General William Barr is defending his record. INSKEEP: Yeah, you'll recall that Barr oversaw the Justice Department in the second half of Donald Trump's presidency. He made high-profile decisions in favor of Trump or his allies but now has published a memoir called \"One Damn Thing After Another,\" in which he says people have the wrong idea. WILLIAM BARR: The media chose to weave a narrative that I was a toady to the president, and that was false from the beginning because I felt I could be independent, and I was. MARTIN: So, Steve, you sat down with William Barr, had an interview about this memoir at his home a few days ago. And he says, you know, people got it wrong, that he wasn't a toady for the president. Isn't that a hard case for Barr to make? I mean, Barr personally intervened in cases involving Trump allies. INSKEEP: He did intervene, and he doesn't back down from his actions in this book. He famously dropped charges against Trump's former national security adviser, who admitted lying to the FBI. Two thousand former Justice Department officials called on Barr to resign for that, but Barr insists he was just being fair, that the FBI had no reason to investigate Michael Flynn in the first place. He gave Congress his own interpretation of the Mueller report into Russian election interference but insists that's because he didn't think it was well presented. And he generally opposes what he calls the criminalization of politics, turning every disagreement into an investigation. MARTIN: OK, but what's the evidence that Barr says he was independent-minded? INSKEEP: Well, his biggest example here is the 2020 election. Barr said in public at the time to a reporter back in November 2020 that there was no evidence of widespread fraud, undermining Donald Trump's false claims at the time. He says Trump was enraged, yelled at him in the Oval Office, but Barr told him to his face that the election theories that Trump followed were BS. Let's hear an extended part of the interview here. BARR: He didn't seem to listen to anybody except a group of sycophants who were telling him what was - what he wanted to hear. INSKEEP: We're talking about Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell... BARR: People like that. INSKEEP: ...The pillow guy. BARR: Yeah, a lot of people on the outside and some people on the inside. INSKEEP: Trump said publicly, the attorney general isn't looking into this; he doesn't want to find the facts. You make it clear in the book you went looking. You looked at the allegations. BARR: Right. You know, most of the allegations were not really alleging fraud. All the stuff - it was like playing whack-a-mole. All the theories of the day that came out, when we looked into them they just evaporated. They were just completely without foundation. I mean, take - you know, you - recently you interviewed the president. And, you know, he's had a year to think about it, and the evidence he came forward that the election was stolen was this statement that more people voted in Philadelphia than there were voters. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) DONALD TRUMP: Look at Philadelphia. Is it true that there were far more votes than there were voters? INSKEEP: It is not true that there were far... TRUMP: Gee, that's a pretty tough thing to... INSKEEP: It is not true. TRUMP: That's a pretty tough problem. BARR: That's completely false. I mean, it's demonstrably false. And yet you continue to hear this thing repeated. MARTIN: Repeated - so former Attorney General William Barr, with his interview with Steve, Barr's critics are saying this is just about restoring his reputation or trying to. Is that right? INSKEEP: Well, it is in the sense that he's defending his record. But this memoir makes it pretty clear, Rachel, that Barr's a conservative Republican. He's certainly not trying to win over liberal critics. He writes a lot about the culture wars. He still thinks a lot of criticism of Trump is overblown. But in a way, his politics make his testimony about Joe Biden's election win more powerful. MARTIN: Thanks, Steve. Barr's book comes out tomorrow.

            "article_content": "Michael Waldman, president of the Brennan Center for Justice, says lawmakers in 27 states are considering hundreds of bills designed to limit voting or undermine the integrity of the election process.  DAVE DAVIES, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in today for Terry Gross. As former President Donald Trump and his allies continue to press unfounded claims that the 2020 election was stolen, voting rights activists have been sounding alarms about bills proposed in state legislatures which would restrict voting in future elections. A new report from the Brennan Center for Justice finds that as of mid-January, legislatures in 27 states are considering more than 250 bills with restrictive provisions, compared to 75 such bills a year ago - a tripling of proposals to restrict the vote. The report also finds that there are at least 41 bills that would undermine the electoral process by, among other things, giving partisan actors more influence and permitting citizens to initiate or conduct post-election audits. At the same time, the survey noted, 32 states are considering bills which would expand access to voting. To get a sense of how election rules might change and their impact, we've invited Michael Waldman to join us. He's president of the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU law school, a nonpartisan law and policy institute focused on improving systems of democracy and justice. He was the director of speechwriting for President Bill Clinton from 1995 to 1999. He's written several books, including \"The Fight To Vote,\" about the history of American battles over voting rights. An updated edition released last month includes new material on Trump's efforts to reverse the results of the 2020 election and the new wave of restrictive voting bills. Well, Michael Waldman, welcome to FRESH AIR. This report says there is a dramatic increase in bills in state legislatures restricting voting rights or threatening the vote-counting process. You know, we should note here that, you know, in state legislatures, any lawmaker can introduce a bill, and they do it for lots of reasons - to get attention, to, you know, get the support of a certain actor or constituency. It doesn't mean they're all going to pass. What can you tell us about the real impact or threat of these proposals? MICHAEL WALDMAN: Well, you're certainly right that there are many bills introduced this year and many bills carried over from last year in the new legislative sessions. And not all of them are serious, and not all of them will pass. But what we also know from looking at last year is very often these bad bills become bad laws. In 2021, inspired by the big lie of a stolen election, we saw 19 states pass 34 new laws that in one way or another made it harder for people to vote. And not all of them are as bad as others. Some are worse than others. Uncannily, though, they tend to target Black voters, Latino voters, Asian and Native voters. They seem very mischievous and even targeted in that way. And we see this trend continuing, and there is far less protection for voters from the federal government or the federal courts than we would want at a moment like this. DAVIES: Right. And I guess we should just note, I mean, these proposals and the battles over them fall strictly on partisan lines, don't they? WALDMAN: That's very true. There've been times in American history where there's been bipartisan agreement on voting. Very often throughout the whole country's history, it has divided along party lines. And right now, these bills are being pushed through on a party-line vote very unambiguously in states across the country by Republicans. DAVIES: Republicans proposing, Democrats opposing. All right, so let's talk about some of these proposals and some of the areas that they would affect. A lot of this, of course, has to do with mail-in voting, which dramatically expanded during the pandemic. Some of these involve requirements to apply for a mail-in ballot, right? WALDMAN: Well, that's right. When it comes to voting, there have always been things that have been controversial. Just think of something like voter ID. Absentee balloting or mail-in voting was not one of them until 2020, when Donald Trump started claiming that it was all a big fraud. The 2020 election was really something of a civic miracle. Despite the pandemic, you had the highest voter turnout since 1900. And one of the reasons for that was expanded use of mail voting. And the election was, by all accounts of Donald Trump's own Department of Homeland Security and others, very secure. Too many of these proposals would cut back on vote-by-mail. They would limit who has access to it. In Texas, for example, a law passed that would provide criminal penalties for an election official who sent out application forms for absentee ballots unless the person specifically requested one - that's an example of both how the election system is being targeted, as well as the way vote-by-mail is being pushed back. And in recent days, a federal court actually blocked that law. DAVIES: Yeah, this is an interesting thing. You know, typically, there are state election codes with myriads of - with lots and lots of provisions, but I've never heard of a state election official being criminally prosecuted for misapplying one. Have you? WALDMAN: We saw in 2021 laws or proposed laws to cut back on vote-by-mail, to cut back on early voting, to cut back on voter registration. I wouldn't call them good, old-fashioned voter suppression laws, but some of them were like that. But on top of it now, we see laws to subvert the elections, to make the counting of the ballots more partisan or to make the job of election officials harder. You see in places like Texas actual criminal penalties aimed at election officials. You see in a place like Georgia a law passed to change who counts the results and to take the secretary of state out of the line of really having the significant role in deciding the winner of elections. DAVIES: Let's just focus a bit on these proposed restrictions and, in some cases, already enacted restrictions on mail voting. You know, there was an enormous amount of mail voting in the 2020 election. Take one of these laws, either enacted or proposed, and tell us how mail voting would be different if they were enshrined in law. WALDMAN: Well, in Texas, for example, they passed a law that's on the books that said you had to put your voter ID number or your Social Security number - last four digits - on your application for a mail-in ballot. That doesn't sound so bad, right? But many people don't remember which one they used when they registered to vote. And if you don't get it exactly and precisely right, they reject your ballot request. In one county in Texas, as the primary is coming up in Texas, half the requests for absentee ballots were rejected in the last few weeks. This is a series of obstacles designed to trip up voters, and those obstacles are succeeding. You see things like that in these laws all over the place. Many of the laws originally were even worse as they were proposed. In Georgia, for example, they basically ended vote-by-mail for anyone under 65. There was such an outcry that they didn't pass that, but the kinds of restrictions that you see with giving officials the ability to reject ballots if the wrong identification number is used or something else has the same consequence of making it harder for many people to vote. And we ought to be trying to make it easier, safer and more secure. DAVIES: Now, I think we should note that the Brennan Center does not oppose, you know, security measures for mail voting. I mean, over the years, there have been some cases where absentee ballots have been abused, most notably in 2018 in North Carolina at a congressional race. You're not opposed to, for example, ID requirements in some cases, right? WALDMAN: Right. It's really important that elections be secure. It's really important that the integrity of elections be protected. A lot of the worries that people had, that we had about vote-by-mail have been very much improved by new developments, by bar codes being put on the envelopes and things like that - basic security things familiar to all of us from when we send a package somewhere - that really have made it much, much more secure than it used to be. I'm not against voter ID, for example, which is a, you know, often a controversial topic. I think it makes sense for people to be who they say they are and to be able to prove it. What the problem is is requirements for voter ID that lots of people don't have. And to give just one maybe surprising example, about 11% of eligible voters in the United States don't have a driver's license. I can't imagine getting around without a driver's license, but my kids resisted getting driver's licenses for a long time. Eleven percent don't have a driver's license. And when you pick the kind of voter ID, it can be very mischievous and malicious. You may remember there was a law back in Texas that said that you could not use your University of Texas ID as a government ID to vote, but you could use your concealed carry gun permit. That's the kind of example of picking and choosing the rules in a way that has a pretty clear implication of who it helps. DAVIES: The new report that the Brennan Center has issued says that there are a number of states that are considering laws to expand voting rights and voting access. You want to describe some of them and their chances of passage? WALDMAN: Yes. One of the interesting stories is that in recent years, until the 2020 election and its aftermath, the big story has been, on a bipartisan basis, moves to expand access to voting and modernize the election system - everything from automatic voter registration, which is now the law in 19 states, that increases people's ability to participate, laws that expand early voting so that working people have more time to vote than they have in the past, laws dealing with the system of felony disenfranchisement - that is the set of rules that limit who can vote if they've had a criminal conviction in the past. Some states have very strict rules, Florida being the main one, dating back to the Jim Crow era, that say that if you've had a criminal conviction of any kind, that you are banned from voting for a lifetime. Well, what happened in 2018 is voters overturned that by 64%. Now, the legislature stepped in and tried, in effect, to undo that and actually made it very hard for people, still, to exercise their rights. But the trend in many states is for strengthened voting rules, for expanded voting rules. It has not just been Democrats. It's been both parties. But what we've seen since the 2020 election and Donald Trump's claims - false claims of a stolen election is that restricting the vote or taking on the election system or undermining the confidence in elections has become a cause among many of Trump's followers. And we see it animating politics in places like Arizona and Texas and many other states. DAVIES: We need to take a break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Michael Waldman. He is president of the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU Law School. It has a new report on proposed changes in voting rules in state legislatures. Waldman's book \"The Fight To Vote,\" by the way, is out in an updated edition. We will continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're talking about proposals in state legislatures to restrict voting and, in some cases, undermine the integrity of election processes. We are speaking with Michael Waldman. He is president of the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU Law School, which has just released a new report on those proposals. Apart from efforts to restrict voting and restrict access to voting, the report says that there are these proposals, some inactive, which undermine the integrity of the electoral process. Can you give us examples? WALDMAN: Well, look at a state like Georgia. Brad Raffensperger is the conservative Republican who's secretary of state, and he's fought with voting rights groups over the years. He's no pushover. And we all know that Donald Trump, in his effort to overturn the election, called Raffensperger and demanded that he, quote, \"find 11,000 votes,\" which was what Trump needed to take back the state. And Raffensperger showed some real courage. He stood up to it. He released the tape of the phone call. The response was the Republican state legislature removed the secretary of state as the chair of the state board of elections - took him out of the power of actually deciding the results of elections. That's a pretty pointed example of the political payback that's involved here. We see bills in places like New Hampshire and Virginia that would potentially allow the removal of professional election officials and replacing them with partisans. We see proposals in a place like Virginia, which might not pass given the political makeup of the state, to remove election officials if they think that they are, quote, \"demonstrating less-than-satisfactory performance\" decided by the legislature. Election administration is something that has been at its best when it's nonpartisan, when it's professional. And election officials of both parties right now feel tremendously threatened. They're threatened by these laws. They're threatened often by partisans in the state government. But unfortunately, also, they're now being threatened by people riled up about this stuff. We did a survey of election officials, along with the Bipartisan Policy Center, and 1 out of 3 election officials feels threatened, and many of them have had actual threats of violence. And, you know, these are not the most glamorous jobs. (Laughter) These are not - they're not in this for the big bucks. A lot of them are looking potentially to leave their jobs. And if we wind up in a situation where not just partisans, but people who believe false things about elections being stolen wind up running the elections, that's going to be something that would give us a lot of reason to worry in years to come. DAVIES: Right. So if these provisions were - some of these provisions were - had been in effect in 2020, how might things have gone differently? WALDMAN: We now know more and more every day that Trump really did try to steal the election, and people stood in his way - governors of his own party who certified the results, secretaries of state of his own party, local election officials in places like counties in Michigan who certified the results. And we know Trump tried to overturn the election, and it was chaotic and clown-like. But there's no reason to think it will be chaotic and clown-like next time, either by him or by someone else. You see not efforts led by, you know, Rudy Giuliani with hair dye dripping down his face at a press conference, but party operatives systematically removing obstacles to partisan decisions about who wins the next election. DAVIES: I want to just mention one thing about Donald Trump's call to the Georgia secretary of state, Raffensperger. I've listened to that entire tape. What Trump actually says in the tape is, I need to find 11,700 votes or whatever the number was. He didn't tell Raffensperger you have to find them, but that's clearly the import of the call. He listed a half-dozen things that he should do. WALDMAN: He also threatened to criminally prosecute him, and since he's the head of the federal government, that had a little bit of oomph at the time. DAVIES: Oh, yeah. Everything about the call was improper, including Raffensperger getting on the phone with a disgruntled candidate, I think. I mean, you don't - you shouldn't have secretaries of state doing that. You know, there's a process for contesting an election. But, you know, it occurs to me that if you have a situation in which partisan actors under these new laws are in control and can, you know, reverse results, it would still require them to make a factual showing. I mean, there's still going to be a tabulation by systems that are in the main pretty reliable, and there will be a result. And those individual actors will have to, you know, make a raw power play and kind of say, well, you know, black is white. You know, what you see isn't true. I wonder if there's some hope that just being put on the spot and having to say, having to make a factual case that you can't make might be a break on this, which is not to say that the laws are not harmful. WALDMAN: And that is, of course, what happened in 2020. It was the facts of the election results were underlying why people stood up and, regardless of whatever their party affiliation was, why they did the right thing. The election in 2020 and now, in fact, is quite secure. The ability to have paper ballots, which is now widespread, gives people the ability to count and to recount if necessary. The system actually has gotten quite effective and precise in avoiding some of the confusion about election results that we saw in the past, in our country's history and in the recent past. Think about the Florida recount in 2000. We saw a 60 or so lawsuits brought against the results in the 2020 election, and they were all thrown out of court and not just on technical grounds. They were deemed to be very flimsy. And over and over again, every time there's been a recount, an audit or anything else, people have said, you know what? The system got it right. The results were counted accurately. And interestingly, the expanded electorate, the record turnout, people voting by mail didn't really help one political party or another. As you know, the Republicans actually did very well in the congressional race. They did much better in the House than expected. They did better in the Senate than expected. Only Trump lost, and he actually even did better than expected. So it's not as though having this safe and effective election in the middle of a pandemic, it's not as if it benefited one party or another. I guess I would say it just benefited voters, which makes the false claims about it all the more maddening because they're really so at variance with what actually happened. DAVIES: If Democrats could rig votes any way they want, surely they would have taken control of the Senate. WALDMAN: You know, the claim that the machines were rigged to only throw votes to Biden, but at the same time, the Republican congressional candidates won - doesn't make a ton of sense. DAVIES: We need to take a break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Michael Waldman. He's president of the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU Law School, which has just released a new report on proposed changes in voting rules in state legislatures. Waldman's book, \"The Fight To Vote,\" is out in an updated edition with new material on former President Donald Trump's efforts to reverse the results of the 2020 election and the new wave of restrictive voting bills. We'll be back to talk more after this short break. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross. Our guest is Michael Waldman, president of the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU Law School, which has just released a new report on the growth in proposals among state legislatures to restrict voting access, to give partisan actors more influence in the electoral process, and in some cases, to expand access to voting. An updated edition of Waldman's book \"The Fight To Vote\" has just been published with new material on former President Donald Trump's efforts to reverse the results of the 2020 election and the new wave of restrictive voting bills. You know, in your book, you go back to the early days of the republic and note that, you know, voting has never been easy. There have been fights over it for all of the history of the United States. You know, we - way back in the late 18th century, it wasn't even just only white men who got the vote, but in most places, only white men with property. And that's changed over the years. And then, you know, eventually slavery ended, and eventually the Civil Rights Act was passed, and women were permitted to vote. There is one debate among the founders that has relevance today that you mention. And it specifically is about the role of state legislatures in deciding - well, the role of the states in deciding the rules for voting in the republic. You want to outline what was at issue in that debate as they were drafting the Constitution? WALDMAN: Well, there's a provision in the Constitution called the elections clause. That's been pretty important, though it's not terribly widely known. What it says is that legislators set the times, places and manner of elections, but Congress has the power to alter those rules at any time. And James Madison insisted that the elections clause be in the Constitution not because he loved state legislatures, but precisely because he thought state legislatures were corrupt and would be taken over by what they called factions - but of course, we call political parties - and that they would do things like gerrymander and voter suppression. Of course (laughter) they didn't use those words in those days. Among other things, Elbridge Gerry - it's actually how it's pronounced - was standing right there, but that is actually what they were talking about. They were talking about rules drafted by states to favor the political interests of the people drafting the rules. There was a big debate over it in the Constitutional Convention. Madison insisted that it stay in, and he prevailed. The intent of the Constitution is quite clear. The goal is to make sure that partisan mischief does not upend our elections. You're right that they didn't have a guarantee of the right to vote in the original Constitution though five amendments ever since then have talked about the right to vote. But they were very focused on representation, and they knew very acutely the risks of corruption and self-dealing, and they tried to put in those protections, which makes it all the more ironic that that very provision is now being used or argued for as a basis for giving more power to people who would twist the rules, in my view. DAVIES: Right. I mean, the clause itself mentions the states, gives them a function, but says that Congress can exercise its will. But now we have this notion that states are supreme and independent in matters of election. Where does this come from? WALDMAN: Well, what you're hearing people say is that because it uses the word legislature, which was basically meant states - but because it uses the word legislature, then supposedly, the only people who have any power over these elections are state legislatures, you know, the guys in ill-fitting suits under the dome (laughter) basically. And that would cut out the state constitutions. That would cut out the state courts, who rely on those state constitutions. It would cut out governors. And certainly, it would cut out election officials from having any ability to do anything. This has never been found by a court. This is not some big doctrine that exists in the Constitution, but it is also the case that at least four of the very conservative, current members of the U.S. Supreme Court think this is a good idea. And it's very likely that there'll be some major constitutional showdowns over this in years to come, maybe even very soon. DAVIES: Right. It's the state legislatures that are enacting these new voting provisions. And I think in some proposals, the state legislature itself would be the deciding entity in the case of, say, a presidential election and where the electors go. WALDMAN: That is what some people want. It hasn't happened yet, and those laws have not passed yet. It's important to remember that when it comes to presidential elections, things are a little murkier because of the Electoral College. But what the Supreme Court said, again, most recently in - and at least, an aside in a case in 2020 is under the Constitution, state legislatures can pick any way to pick a president. But all of them have chosen to give the voters the say. And once voters are given that say, then the state legislatures cannot just step in and say, you know what? We don't actually like who people voted for. We're going to vote for the different person. So I think that if, in fact, state legislatures claim the role of undoing what the voters had done, that would be just an outrageous, of course, affront to democracy. And I think it would be incredibly divisive and would not stand. DAVIES: There have been efforts in Congress to exercise some controls and establish rules, which would - you know, which would reverse some of the decisions that have been made in states that restrict ballot access or alter the election process. Give us a sense of where all that stands. WALDMAN: Well, it's been one of the great political clashes of the past year and of current times just as it has been throughout the country's history. In this period, states have been rushing forward to pass these restrictive voting laws, and Congress has the power, legally and constitutionally, to stop it, to set national standards. The question has been, does it have the political will? And so far, the answer is, you know, not yet. Over the course of the past year, two key pieces of legislation were moving through Congress. I was very supportive of them. The Freedom to Vote Act set national standards on voting and banned partisan gerrymandering among other things. And the John Lewis Voting Rights Act restored the strength or would restore the strength of the Voting Rights Act, which was the great landmark and highly effective civil rights law enacted in 1965, which has been basically gutted by the United States Supreme Court. These bills were eventually combined into one bill. It passed the House of Representatives. It had the strong support of the president. It has the support of a majority of the Senate. But it has been filibustered. And as you know, two of the Democratic senators, Senator Manchin and Senator Sinema, although they support the bills, would not make the rules changes to actually enable them to pass. So it was a very big disappointment for those of us who think this legislation is pretty important, pretty necessary. You know, there are just times in the country's history where federal action is the only real, strong answer when states are abusing the rights of their people, and I think that's where we are now. And it gives me great concern because if it is the case that Congress can't pass voting rights legislation because of the filibuster and the courts will not protect voting rights because they've been turning away from it, then that gives a green light to states to do their worst. And there's just no reason to think that whatever we're seeing right now is as bad as it can get. DAVIES: We need to take another break here. Let me reintroduce you. We're speaking with Michael Waldman. He's president of the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU law school, which has just released a new report on proposed changes in voting rules in state legislatures. We'll be back after this quick break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF THE INTERNET SONG, \"STAY THE NIGHT\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Michael Waldman. He's president of the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU law school, which has released a report on proposed changes in voting in state legislatures. Waldman's book \"The Fight To Vote\" is out in an updated edition with new material on former President Trump's efforts to reverse the results of the 2020 election and that new wave of restrictive voting bills. You know, Michael Waldman, this is such an extraordinary time, and we're seeing democracy under assault and fights over voting procedures, access and counting in so many places. Is this unique in American history? WALDMAN: You know, in a lot of ways, there are new things, but in a lot of ways, this is one of the great stories of American history from the very beginning. At the time we started as a country, we were anything but what any of us would consider a democracy. As you said, only white men who owned property could vote. But the ideals of the American Revolution and the Declaration of Independence and the idea that government is legitimate, as it said, only if it rests on the consent of the governed, that started to shake things up from the beginning. That year, in 1776, each of the newly independent states had to write their own constitution. And in Pennsylvania, Benjamin Franklin was in charge of writing the constitution, and they eliminated that property requirement so that men could vote - working-class and poor men as well. And Franklin explained why they did it. He said, there's a man who owns a jackass. It's worth $50, so the man can vote. Then the jackass dies. So the man is older, the man is wiser, but the jackass is dead, so the man can't vote. So who, Ben Franklin asked, really has the right to vote - the man or the jackass? Good question. One more reason we love Ben Franklin. Well, up in Massachusetts, John Adams was writing their constitution. And people there said, hey, you ought to do what they did down in Pennsylvania, eliminate the property requirement. And Adams was aghast at this idea. He said, if we do that, women will demand the right to vote, lads of 18 will demand the right to vote, men who have not a farthing to their name will think themselves worthy of an equal voice in government, and they will demand the right to vote. John Adams said, there will be no end of it. And that's really the story of the country. There has been no end of it. From the beginning, people have demanded access to democracy, have demanded a seat at the table, demanded to be able to vote or have their votes counted, and other people have fought back against that to try to stop it. And that fight has continued all throughout history. And in many ways, that's what we're seeing again today. As the country's changing, it's demographically changing, there's a backlash against that, and we're seeing it play out in these fights over voting. DAVIES: I guess what I wonder about in some of these cases is, yeah, it's convenient in some cases to have people believe this notion that elections can be stolen, but eventually, if elections lack credibility, that's not really good for anybody, is it? WALDMAN: No, it's very worrisome. Many of the basic elements of a democracy, which we have taken for granted in our country, is that when someone loses, they're not happy about it, but they congratulate the winner and accept the results and that people effectively accept the legitimacy of the process of counting votes or of the voting system. And the more polarized we are as a country, the more partisan the fights get, the harder it is to maintain that. You know, we see this kind of thing not just in the United States, unfortunately, but in many other places in the world at the same time. There's a real pushback against democracy. There was a big wave of democratization after the Cold War, especially, and now, whether in Hungary, whether in Turkey, whether in the Philippines or Brazil or here in the United States, we see people really calling into question, as Trump has, the legitimacy of our democracy. And it's a scary thing. It's something that we, I guess, feel we need to fight against it. We need to stand up. People from all political persuasions need to say, no, our democracy is not rigged, no, our democracy is legitimate, and we need to try to make it work. DAVIES: The courts have often been a place that people turn to when bad ideas are enacted by state lawmakers. To what extents have - are the federal courts a remedy for what's going on in the current epoch? WALDMAN: It's one of the interesting and surprising things I learned in researching the book, which is that very rarely has the fight for voting rights been successfully waged in the courts. It's really come much more in legislatures or at the ballot box or on the streets. And that is certainly true in this current era. This Supreme Court under John Roberts has actually been very aggressive in cutting back on protections for voting rights and campaign finance. The court has not struck down a single restrictive state voting law in the past decade. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was the most effective single civil rights law probably that the country had, and it was gutted. Its most important provision was gutted in 2013 by the Supreme Court in a case called Shelby County. And then the parts of the law that were still standing were gravely weakened last year in a case that didn't get so much attention called Brnovich. And now the Supreme Court seems poised to kind of finish it off altogether. The court undid a century of campaign finance law in the Citizens United case in 2010. And when it comes to gerrymandering - that's the drawing of the district lines either to benefit a political party or to make it harder for racial minorities to be represented - the Supreme Court looked at the issue of extreme partisan gerrymandering and washed its hands and said, we're not going to get involved. In fact, federal courts aren't even allowed to hear the cases. So I don't think that we can realistically look to the courts and certainly not this Supreme Court to be the ones defending and saving American democracy. DAVIES: We need to take a break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Michael Waldman. He is president of the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU Law School. It has a new report on proposed changes in voting rules in state legislatures. Waldman's book \"The Fight To Vote,\" by the way, is out in an updated edition. We will continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF ANTHONY BRAXTON'S \"MAPLE LEAF RAG\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're talking about proposals in state legislatures to restrict voting and, in some cases, undermine the integrity of election processes. We are speaking with Michael Waldman. He is president of the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU Law School, which has just released a new report on those proposals. The Brnovich case - you mentioned this - in Arizona was a case in which the question was, would some changes in voting rules which had a disparate impact on Native Americans and people of color, are they illegal under the Voting Rights Act? And an appeals court said, yeah, these rules, regardless of their intent, had a disparate impact, and they violate the Voting Rights Act. What did the Supreme Court do? What's the implication of it? WALDMAN: Well, what the Supreme Court said - and as with so many of these cases, it's - what matters is less the specific facts of the laws they were looking at than the legal standards they set out. What the Supreme Court said was that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, that's the part that was still standing that said that after the fact, you can bring a lawsuit against discriminatory voting practices, and that was what had been used in recent years to block a lot of the worst voter suppression laws. Well, the Supreme Court said that you have to prove intent to discriminate, not just the impact to discriminate. And that makes it very easy for state legislators to just basically cover their tracks. They gave them something of a how-to manual on how to pass these laws without making it look like your intention is to discriminate - just, oh, what do you know? It turns out that's the result. This is ominous because this part of the Voting Rights Act has been very useful in recent years in blocking some of the worst voting laws, and now it is much, much more gravely weakened. And the legislation that is being considered by Congress would restore the strength of the Voting Rights Act and make it clear that if there's a really, really clear disparate impact that a voting law is something that affects Black people or Latinos or other minorities much more so than white voters, then we can say that that needs to be protected against. DAVIES: If the federal courts aren't likely to reverse any of these changes that we're seeing, there, of course, are state laws, and there are state constitutions, and some of these state laws can be challenged by those who argue that they violate provisions of their state constitutions. Is that a meaningful avenue to pursue? WALDMAN: It is likely that this is going to be an important avenue going forward, as the federal government doesn't do its job to protect voting rights nationwide. Every state constitution but one has an explicit protection for the right to vote that is stronger than what's in the U.S. Constitution. And people are now starting to bring lawsuits in state courts to validate those rights, and we're going to see whether they are able to make some success. And there's some evidence that there will be success. My organization, the Brennan Center, for example, brought a lawsuit in Ohio on behalf of Black and Muslim voters challenging the redistricting, challenging the new legislative maps, which we said and they said did not reflect the actual population of Ohio. And the state Supreme Court, now twice, under Ohio's law and the Ohio constitution, has thrown out those maps in the kind of cases the federal courts wouldn't go near right now. So - we saw something similar in North Carolina. One of the interesting twists here is a lot of these state Supreme Court justices are elected. And I've never been a big fan of electing judges. But you can also see the argument that, well, it may be that those courts are a little more responsive to the wide variety of people in a state. DAVIES: One of the other things you write about is the importance of protecting election officials, people who are, you know, civil servants or in some cases elected officials but who are doing their best and have been - have received, you know, physical threats as a result of doing their jobs. How do citizens help reassure these elected officials and stand by them? WALDMAN: It's a crazy moment. These folks are really under assault in all different kinds of ways. We need to make sure that there aren't laws that put them at risk of criminal prosecution for just doing their job. We need to stand up against the disinformation, which is often what they're flooded with when, you know, some video goes viral and they wind up getting deluged with hate and hateful messages, again, just for doing their jobs. I think we all can insist that law enforcement, both local law enforcement and federal law enforcement, step up and recognize that this is a real problem of these threats to these public servants. And in effect, just letting these election officials know that we all have their back, I think, is pretty important. DAVIES: You know, regardless of what happens in votes in legislatures or court cases, we do have this problem of tens of millions of people who believe that elections in this country can be stolen, that tens of millions of ballots in a presidential election can be fraudulent. And it seems that something needs to be done to engage those people and get them to look at things differently. Any thoughts on that? WALDMAN: You know, it's a big challenge for our democracy and one we haven't faced before. I point out that the southern states didn't like that Lincoln got elected. In fact, they seceded because of it. But nevertheless, they admitted that he got elected - to give just one historical example. We've not previously faced a situation where not just tens of millions of people believe the false idea that the elections were stolen, but their leaders keep telling them it was the case. And as far as they know, the former president of the United States keeps saying it. And the idea of the big lie is that if you say something outlandish often enough, people think, well, he can't be making all that stuff up. I really think that part of what has to happen is that other Republicans need to stand up with much more courage than they've showed so far to say, you know, I don't like Biden, I don't like the Democrats, I'm a Republican, but this idea that the election was stolen is nonsense. And we hear people say that sometimes in a whisper, and then they kind of back off. I do think part of what has to happen is a little bit of courage on the part of other Republicans. It is a big, interesting, strategic question always because this idea of voter fraud is not entirely new. Elections in the United States are actually very secure. Voter fraud is vanishingly rare. As a statistical matter, you're more likely to be struck by lightning than to commit, for example, in-person voter impersonation. That's been confirmed over and over and over again. And people say, well, you know, facts are not going to persuade people. You can't just pound people with facts on this kind of thing. But at least at the Brennan Center, partly because of how we do our research, we do really think it's important that people understand that this isn't just a claim. This isn't just a question. It's a lie. The elections are tremendously secure. But I think people have to have an understanding, too, of the basic, deep patriotic values that undergird our elections. It's very hard to be an American. It's hard to live up to the ideals that maybe they haven't been the reality, but they're certainly what we've all aspired to if we're going to just kind of cast aside our democracy. I think it's that deep an issue right now. DAVIES: Well, Michael Waldman, thank you so much for speaking with us. WALDMAN: Thank you. DAVIES: Michael Waldman is president of the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU Law School, which has just released a new report on proposed changes in voting rules in state legislatures. An updated edition of Waldman's book, \"The Fight To Vote,\" has just been published with new material on former President Donald Trump's efforts to reverse the results of the 2020 election and the new wave of restrictive voting bills.

I knew that Monday, February 14 would be a landmark day for Mohammed al Refai. It would also be a major turning point in a story that I had started following more than six years ago. I had met the then 22-year-old Syrian refugee during my first reporting trip as a host of All Things Considered. He had recently arrived in Toledo, Ohio, where he was living with four white American roommates who called him \"Moh\". Mohammed spoke almost no English when I first met him in October of 2015. He could say hello, count to 10, and rattle off the words he needed to work behind the butcher counter in the Middle Eastern grocery store where he'd landed a job: \"Chicken legs, chicken breast, goat, steak, lamb, beef, turkey.\" For me, the visit to Toledo was a way to more deeply explore an issue I had covered as an international correspondent based in London. The Syrian refugee crisis was at its height in 2015, and I had reported stories on the mass migration in Turkey, Serbia, and other countries. When I relocated to Washington, DC, for my new job, I was eager to see what the exodus looked like in the United States. With All Things Considered producer Matt Ozug and NPR photographer David Gilkey (who was killed on assignment in Afghanistan the following year), we flew to Detroit and drove to Toledo, where we reported a number of stories about the Syrian community \u2014 including one about Mohammed. His experience was different from most Syrian refugees. As I explained in that first piece, the U.S. State Department typically keeps families together. But for reasons that were never clear, Mohammed was given a visa to come to the U.S. while his brothers, sisters and parents in Jordan were not. The local organization charged with resettling Syrians in Toledo, Us Together, decided it would be too jarring for this young man to be set up in an apartment by himself. They found a group house with four recent college graduates who were eager to introduce a foreigner to life on the Great Lakes. Mohammed al Refai's roommates, Johnny Zellers (left), Andrew Trumbull and Doug Walton in their shared house in 2017.\n                \n                    \n                    Matt Ozug/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mohammed al Refai's roommates, Johnny Zellers (left), Andrew Trumbull and Doug Walton in their shared house in 2017. When I showed up, the place was shockingly clean for a house where five guys in their early 20s lived. There was art on the walls, and it looked like it had been recently vacuumed. They all seemed to be getting along well, given the circumstances. There was music and arm wrestling. One of the roommates, Doug Walton, made a Middle Eastern dish of chicken and rice, called kabsa. When I asked him why he and his buddies decided to take in Mohammed, he told me: \"My immediate answer just sounds so cliche, but I think the motive is love. I was told he's coming and that I have an opportunity to help him out. And I was like, yeah, why wouldn't I do that?\" Mohammed hoped that he would be able to see his family one day soon. But when I returned to Toledo a little more than a year later, the situation had changed, making that reunion seem more distant than ever. As Matt and I knocked on the door of the group house again in January of 2017, the memory of the 2016 presidential election was still fresh in the roommates' minds. \"We were all kind of together, just, like, hugging him and watching it all go down,\" Andrew Trumbull told me. \"We didn't really know how to respond,\" Johnny Zellers said. \"What do you tell him? He definitely kind of got sad a little bit just thinking of, like, OK, maybe his family might not be able to ever come here.\" Donald Trump had run for president on a platform of stopping Muslims from coming to the US. His election win seemed to slam the door on Mohammed's hopes of seeing his parents again. \"I need to be safe and close to my family, but I can't do anything,\" he told me. \"I feel bad for they are not with me, but I can't do anything to help them.\" On my first visit to Toledo, I'd spoken with Mohammed through an interpreter. This time, he was able to express himself in English without help. Two months after Trump's inauguration, in March of 2017, Mohammed's green card arrived. I called the guys from a studio in Washington, and Johnny told me he was the one who opened the mail. \"I started reading it, it was like, oh, you are now a resident of the United States.\" It hit him: \"Oh hey, this is the green card. You've got a green card!\" The roommates threw him a party with green cake, and Mohammed called his family with the good news. \"My Mom, she said - you can come right now, visit us! And I said no.\" Mohammed said with a sad laugh, \"I can't.\" This was just as the Trump administration was banning travel from several majority-Muslim countries. Mohammed was afraid that if he left the US, he might never be allowed back in. He told his family it would be just three years until he would be allowed to apply for a passport, and then he would visit them in Jordan once he was a U.S. citizen. He counted down the days, and three years later, he sent in his application. It was February, 2020. As the coronavirus shut nearly everything down, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services followed suit. USCIS closed to the public and stopped handling new citizenship applications on March 18. I got a voice memo from Andrew in June of last year, months after citizenship tests had resumed. \"We just got off another frustrating, unproductive phone call with the USCIS,\" he said. Mohammed had been hitting a brick wall, unable to get an appointment, and he was getting worried. Syrian refugees who had come to the U.S. long after he arrived had already taken their exams and become U.S. citizens. Mohammed wondered if something was wrong that he didn't know about - something he might never know about. After all, he still didn't have an answer as to why he was given a refugee visa while the rest of his family was not. Maybe another glitch in the system would prevent him from becoming a citizen. Finally, he was given a date and time for his exam: Monday, February 14, 1 PM. He and Andrew spent weeks studying. Mohammed couldn't sleep on Sunday night. He woke up early Monday morning, put on a gray suit and black shirt, and drove with Andrew two hours to Cleveland. Mohammed al Refai on Monday at the center where he took the citizenship test.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Trumbull\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mohammed al Refai on Monday at the center where he took the citizenship test. They drilled hundreds of questions and answers on the drive east. \"What is the Constitution? What are some rights from the Declaration of Independence?\" Andrew ran through the 100 sample questions from the citizenship exam and any others he could think of. \"Where are you from? What's your job?\" Andrew dropped off his roommate of seven years at the Anthony J. Celebrezze Federal Building in downtown Cleveland. Mohammed walked across the icy plaza and stepped inside the door. Andrew waited in a parking lot for the news. 40 minutes passed. And then Mohammed walked outside with a beaming smile on his face. \"I am now an American citizen!\" Andrew ran out and gave him a hug. The new American citizen spent the entire two hour drive home making phone calls to friends and family in the U.S. and Jordan. And then he called me. \"I am so excited to go see my family,\" Mohammed said. \"This is my day. I'm so glad I'm an American!\" He kept repeating that sentence: \"I'm an American!\" There was a party in Toledo Monday night, with a confetti cannon. His family threw one in Jordan, too. Mohammed plans to fly there as soon as his passport arrives in the mail, perhaps a few months from now. Andrew says he'll go with Mohammed and witness the reunion. After all they've been through together, Andrew says, they've become like family.",

            "article_content": "The Jan. 6 House committee released its final report. A bipartisan bill in Congress to grant legal status to Afghan refugees is blocked. COVID threatens to overwhelm China's health care system.  LEILA FADEL, HOST: The House Select January 6 Committee has released its final report. It comes after an 18-month investigation into the events which culminated in the insurrection at the Capitol in 2021. In more than 800 pages, the report details what led the panel to vote to issue four criminal referrals against former President Donald Trump, among other recommendations. And it lays out a path forward for the panel's findings. Here's Chairman Bennie Thompson. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BENNIE THOMPSON: We have every confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a roadmap to justice and that the agencies and institutions responsible for ensuring justice under the law will use the information we've provided to aid in their work. FADEL: To walk us through all of this is NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales. Hi, Claudia. CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Good morning, Leila. FADEL: Good morning. So what are some of the report's major findings? GRISALES: It focuses largely on former President Trump's premeditated role in the January 6 attack and goes further into his criminal referrals from the committee. The report is eight chapters long, covering false claims of a stolen election, the fake electors scheme, and, quote, \"187 minutes of dereliction,\" referencing Trump's inaction during the siege. One chapter is titled after a federal judge's description of Trump's post-2020 election efforts, calling it a, quote, \"coup in search of a legal theory,\" and captures desperate attempts to overturn the presidential result, such as trying to force then-Vice President Mike Pence to illegally reverse President Biden's win in a ceremonial counting of the vote. Finally, it details ties between extremist groups and Trump allies. FADEL: So how does the report delve into law enforcement and intelligence failures? GRISALES: It reiterates other findings, that there were significant failures here. For example, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Mark Milley, said before January 6, the probability for violence was clear, and he expected, quote, \"street fights when the sun went down.\" FADEL: What role does the American public play when it comes to these findings? GRISALES: The panel says while the danger to the Capitol by an armed and angry crowd was foreseeable, the fact that a president would be the catalyst was unprecedented. The report says, quote, \"If we lacked the imagination that a president would incite an attack on his own government,\" it goes on to say, \"we lack that insight no more.\" And it says the best defense against that danger in the future will not come from law enforcement, but rather an informed and active citizenry. FADEL: OK, so what recommendations does the report lay out? GRISALES: The first is reforms to the Electoral Count Act. This would solidify a vice president's role as ceremonial, and this is part of a major spending bill that could head to President Biden's desk today. It also says it's now up to the Justice Department and courts to take the lead on criminal referrals and that respective legal bar associations should evaluate the conduct of attorneys named in the report who should not, quote, \"undermine the constitutional and statutory process for peacefully transferring power in our government.\" This includes attorney John Eastman, who was tied to the plot to overturn the result, Kenneth Chesebro, a central figure in the fake elector scheme, and other Trump-aligned attorneys such as Rudy Giuliani. FADEL: OK, so, Claudia, now that this investigation is done, the report is out, what are the next steps? GRISALES: There are still more records to come and plenty. For example, a few dozen witness transcripts have been shared so far by the panel, but hundreds more are expected in the coming days, as the panel will sunset December 31. FADEL: NPR's Claudia Grisales, thank you so much. GRISALES: Thank you much. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: American forces brought tens of thousands of Afghans to the U.S. after the Taliban takeover in 2021. But the majority still don't have legal status here. A bipartisan bill in Congress to fix that was blocked by immigration hard-liners this week. We're joined now by NPR's Quil Lawrence, who has been following this story. Good morning, Quil. QUIL LAWRENCE, BYLINE: Hey, good morning, Leila. FADEL: So I understand you spoke with one prominent Afghanistan war veteran about this, Jack McCain, son of the late Senator John McCain. LAWRENCE: Right, yeah. And McCain is a - he's a fairly private person, but he's been out in the public on this issue. He's a Navy pilot. He went to Afghanistan in 2018 on a mission to train Afghan pilots to fly American-made Black Hawk helicopters. And while he was there, he kept a very low profile for his own safety and the safety of everyone around him as a well-known figure. So in August of that year, though, he went home for five days for his father, John - Senator John McCain's funeral. And then the secret was out. And McCain - Jack McCain, the younger McCain - says that the danger was very clear. JACK MCCAIN: If one of them had wanted to make a high-profile target out of me, they could have. It would have been extremely easy. I believe that they protected me or at least kept the secret. I can't overstate how important that is to me. LAWRENCE: You know, so he got very close to these Afghan Black Hawk pilots; on the next eight months left on his deployment, trained up dozens of them to fly the chopper. And he said he saw those pilots rescue Afghan and American troops under fire in ways that were worthy of the highest combat medals. FADEL: Worthy of the highest combat medals. So what's happened to these pilots just three years later when the Taliban took over Afghanistan? LAWRENCE: Well, they kept flying missions, some of them even after Kabul fell, trying to help the resistance. But it was seen as very important to bring them in. They and their helicopters then were very high-value targets to the Taliban. And so McCain and others were part of this massive digital Dunkirk trying to get everybody out. About 120,000 people were airlifted out of Kabul during those two weeks in August of 2021. FADEL: Yeah. And many of them were flown to bases in the U.S. But almost a year and a half later, their status isn't clear. Right? LAWRENCE: Right. I mean, many - most of them are here on an emergency immigration status that will probably run out sometime next year. FADEL: OK. LAWRENCE: There was a bill in Congress this week called the Afghan Adjustment Act to help them normalize their immigration status. But it had bipartisan support. It had a growing list of former generals and ambassadors supporting it and a yearlong campaign by Afghanistan veterans. But it was blocked by Republican Senator Chuck Grassley because of concerns about security vetting of these Afghans. And so now they're in limbo. I spoke with one of the pilots that Jack McCain says helped keep him safe in Afghanistan. The pilot's name is Colonel Salim Faqiri. He put it this way. SALIM FAQIRI: All the people, they come during the evacuations, and they don't know what will happen to them. The U.S. government - will they turn them back to the - for the Taliban? But everybody's waiting for the Congress to pass the Afghan Adjustment. LAWRENCE: Faqiri himself is in Phoenix right now. He's with his wife and three daughters. He has another reason to want the act to pass because it would actually help him get a green card so that he and all these other pilots can fly helicopters again, which is what the U.S. trained them to do. FADEL: So he said everybody's waiting for Congress. Does the bill have a chance in the next Congress? LAWRENCE: It probably will have a harder time getting through the Republican-controlled House, but it's not a strictly party-line vote. And many Republicans, especially Republicans who served at war, did support this bill. FADEL: NPR's Quil Lawrence, thanks so much. LAWRENCE: Thanks, Leila. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: For nearly three years, China used extremely strict testing and lockdown policies to keep COVID out. Then it abruptly lifted nearly all those controls as a COVID surge spread across the country. Public health experts are warning the country's health care system could now be overwhelmed. NPR's Emily Feng joins us to talk about the outbreak. Good morning, Emily. EMILY FENG, BYLINE: Good morning. FADEL: So, Emily, what are things like right now in China? Has the health care system been able to keep up with this surge? FENG: So far it appears, yes, but barely. And that's because the surge in China is forecast to get way worse this month and into January. Anecdotally, everyone I know in Beijing has basically come down with COVID already in the last month, and it's spreading to other cities. A Shanghai hospital warned this week that half of the city's population - that's about 12.5 million people - could be infected by just the end of next week. There are long lines already outside of funeral homes and crematoria that we visited in Beijing. Crematoria are telling us that their waiting list is now more than one week, which is unusual. Pharmacies in the countryside have been emptied of fever and pain medication. But the good news is that outside fever clinics and hospitals in Beijing that we visited this week is pretty busy, but it's actually pretty orderly. Unfortunately, we've seen in other pandemics that there's usually a lag of about a month after initial outbreak before we really start to see an increase in deaths and severe cases. And in China, that's supposed to happen in January. FADEL: So what are public health experts saying about how bad it could get? FENG: Their predictions vary widely, but they're all pretty devastating. There was one model last week from the University of Hong Kong that estimates up to nearly 1 million people will die if China doesn't mount a new vaccine booster campaign. And then this month, the U.S.'s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation predicts up to half a million deaths just by April if China doesn't have new travel and mask mandates. And the reason why they vary so widely is a model is only as good as the data that you put into it, and right now, there's no accurate data from China on infections. In fact, the WHO said this week that China has not released hospital data since early this month on who is coming in with COVID. For this, I talked to Ray Yip. He's an epidemiologist who founded the U.S. CDC office in China in 2003 and more recently the China office for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. RAY YIP: They're going to do the same thing what they did in Wuhan. In Wuhan, unless you have a confirmed PCR test, they're not going to call you a case of COVID in the beginning. So that's why the number of deaths in Wuhan was only 4,000. I'm sure it's at least four or five times that much. And what's happening in China right now - the death rate is probably, you know, in the thousands and every day. But they are only willing to report, you know, a small handful. FENG: He's referring here to the extremely strict standards that China uses to determine who dies of COVID - so strict, in fact, that officially only two people have died in this latest surge, which just does not match up with what people are going through on the ground. FADEL: So where does China go from here? FENG: Well, it can only get worse because the real concern now is holiday travel. China has its Lunar New Year in late January, but people are already traveling home now for the holiday, and they're bringing the virus with them from cities to villages where the health care system is even patchier. But in China, the trend is still towards rapid, full-scale opening up. In fact, some cities, like Chengdu, for example, are already reducing their quarantine requirements for inbound travelers coming from other countries. This was just simply unthinkable about a month ago when China was in the full throttle of zero-COVID. FADEL: That's NPR's Emily Feng. Thank you, Emily. FENG: Thank you so much, Leila.

The killings of four Muslim men in Albuquerque had already shaken the city's small Muslim community, prompting businesses to close and residents to temporarily move away amid fears of a deadly spate of Islamophobic hate crimes. Then came Tuesday's news: The suspect, police say, is a 51-year-old man named Muhammad Syed, who is Muslim himself and whose motive may have been related to \"interpersonal conflict.\" \"You would expect that learning that a suspect is found and has been detained, it would feel like a breath of relief,\" said Leena Aggad, the 23-year-old vice president of the University of New Mexico's Muslim Student Association. Instead, she said, news of the arrest felt \"like another chain was placed on my heart.\" Syed is well-known to the Muslim community in Albuquerque, multiple people told NPR. He regularly came to the same mosque that the victims had attended. \"For months, this guy was praying next to other members of the community as if everything was normal,\" Aggad said. \"It shocks you.\" Syed has been charged in two of the four deaths, and police say he is the primary suspect in the other two killings. He was arrested during a traffic stop more than 100 miles from Albuquerque, authorities said Tuesday. In a conversation with officers, Syed denied connection to the shootings. According to the criminal complaint, a gun recovered from his home matched bullet casings found at the crime scenes. Some reports have suggested the possibility that Syed, a Sunni Muslim, had targeted his victims over anger that his daughter had married a Shia Muslim. Authorities said Tuesday they are still working to determine the motive. (\"Detectives discovered evidence that shows the offender knew the victims to some extent and an interpersonal conflict may have led to the shootings,\" a police statement said.) The suspect had lived in New Mexico for several years after immigrating from Afghanistan. The crimes date to last November, when Mohammad Zaher Ahmadi, the 62-year-old Afghan-born owner of a halal market, was found shot to death near his store. Then, over the past several weeks, three more men were killed: Naeem Hussain, a 25-year-old truck driver and refugee services worker who had recently acquired his U.S. citizenship; Muhammad Afzaal Hussain, a 27-year-old planning director for the nearby city of Espa\u00f1ola; and Aftab Hussein, a 41-year-old caf\u00e9 employee \u2014 \"all really wonderful young men that enjoyed a very good reputation within their inner circles,\" said Ahmad Assed, president of the Islamic Center of New Mexico, in an interview with NPR. All three were South Asian, and all three attended the same mosque. Their community was so small that Naeem Hussain, the most recent victim, had attended the funerals of the other two. Muhammad Imtiaz Hussain, whose brother Muhammad Afzaal was killed on Aug. 1, told NPR he did not believe the reports that the suspect had targeted the victims over anger about his daughter marrying a Shia. \"My brother is single,\" he said, and the siblings had been raised as Sunnis. They were born in Pakistan and had immigrated individually to New Mexico, where his brother came to study at the University of New Mexico, he said. At school, his younger brother was elected president of the university's Graduate and Professional Student Association, and he proudly told his older brother about the election: \" 'I'm an immigrant. I'm Muslim. I'm dark-skinned. English isn't my first language. And yet, look, people are appreciative. There's no discrimination,' \" Hussain recalled. The three recent killings at such a rapid pace, with the latest death last Friday, had rattled the community of several thousand Muslims who live in the Albuquerque area. Before the news of the arrest, Assed said, the fear had disrupted daily life. People stayed home from work and prayer services out of fear of becoming a target. Some had temporarily moved out of the state altogether, he added. \"It's a very scary situation, because their tranquility and peace has been taken away. You're always looking around, behind your shoulder, to see if somebody is following you,\" said Abdur'Rauf Campos-Marquetti, a local imam. Aggad, who wears a hijab, said she was \"very scared\" to leave her house. \"For me, walking outside with a scarf, I am a walking symbol of Islam. It's very obvious that I'm a Muslim,\" she said. Now, residents say, the fear has dissipated, but tension remains. At a community vigil held Tuesday night, some residents expressed worry about the perceptions of Muslims in America \u2014 that when one Muslim commits a crime, non-Muslims may view the entire faith as violent or extreme. \"It took me back to September 11th, a time where I just wanted to hide under a rock,\" said Samia Assed, who helped to organize the Tuesday night event. \"It was just so unexpected.\" Additional reporting by NPR's Leila Fadel, KUNM's Alice Fordham and KUNM's Megan Kamerick.",

GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip \u2014 A cease-fire between Israel and Palestinian militants took effect late Sunday in a bid to end nearly three days of violence that killed dozens of Palestinians and disrupted the lives of hundreds of thousands of Israelis. The flare-up was the worst fighting between Israel and Gaza militant groups since Israel and Hamas fought an 11-day war last year, and adds to the destruction and misery that have plagued blockaded Gaza for years. The Egyptian-brokered cease-fire took effect at 11:30 p.m. (2030 GMT; 4:30 p.m. EDT). Israeli strikes and militant rockets continued in the minutes leading up to the beginning of the truce, and Israel said it would \"respond strongly\" if the cease-fire was violated. Israeli aircraft have pummeled targets in Gaza since Friday, while the Iran-backed Palestinian Jihad militant group has fired hundreds of rockets at Israel in response. The risk of the cross-border fighting turning into a full-fledged war remained as long as no truce was reached. Israel says some of the dead were killed by misfired rockets. Gaza's ruling Hamas group remained on the sidelines, possibly because it fears Israeli reprisals and undoing economic understandings with Israel, including Israeli work permits for thousands of Gaza residents, that bolster its control.

Israel launched its operation with a strike Friday on a leader of the Islamic Jihad, and followed up on Saturday with another targeted strike on a second prominent leader. The second Islamic Jihad commander, Khaled Mansour, was killed in an airstrike on an apartment building in the Rafah refugee camp in southern Gaza late Saturday, which also killed two other militants and five civilians. Mansour, the Islamic Jihad commander for southern Gaza, was in the apartment of a member of the group when the missile struck, flattening the three-story building and badly damaging nearby houses.

Ahmed al-Qaissi, another neighbor, said his wife and son were among the wounded, suffering shrapnel injuries. To make way for rescue workers, al-Qaissi agreed to have part of his house demolished. As a funeral for Mansour began in the Gaza Strip on Sunday, the Israeli military said it was striking suspected \"Islamic Jihad rocket launch posts.\" Smoke could be seen from the strikes as thumps from their explosions rattled Gaza. Israeli airstrikes and rocket fire followed for hours as sirens wailed in central Israel. As the sunset call to prayer sounded in Gaza, sirens wailed as far north as Tel Aviv. Israel says some of the deaths during this round were caused by errant rocket fire, including one incident in the Jebaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza in which six Palestinians were killed Saturday. On Sunday, a projectile hit a home in the same area of Jebaliya, killing two men. Palestinians held Israel responsible, while Israel said it was investigating whether the area was struck by an errant rocket.

Israel's Defense Ministry said mortars fired from Gaza hit the Erez border crossing into Israel, used by thousands of Gazans daily. The mortars damaged the roof and shrapnel hit the hall's entrance, the ministry said. The crossing has been closed amid the fighting. The Rafah strike was the deadliest so far in the current round of fighting, which was initiated by Israel on Friday with the targeted killing of Islamic Jihad's commander for northern Gaza. Israel said it took action against the militant group because of concrete threats of an imminent attack, but has not provided details. Caretaker Prime Minister Yair Lapid, who is an experienced diplomat but untested in overseeing a war, unleashed the offensive less than three months before a general election in which he is campaigning to keep the job. In a statement Sunday, Lapid said the military would continue to strike targets in Gaza \"in a pinpoint and responsible way in order to reduce to a minimum the harm to noncombatants.\" Lapid said the strike that killed Mansour was \"an extraordinary achievement.\" \"The operation will continue as long as necessary,\" Lapid said. U.S. President Joe Biden said he welcomed the ceasefire between Israel and Gaza-based militants. \"Over these last 72-hours, the United States has worked with officials from Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, Qatar, Jordan, and others throughout the region to encourage a swift resolution to the conflict,\" he said in a statement.

Two other militants and five civilians were also killed in the attack. The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting for Monday on the violence. China, which holds the council presidency this month, scheduled the session in response to a request from the United Arab Emirates, which represents Arab nations on the council, as well as China, France, Ireland and Norway. \"We underscore our commitment to do all we can towards ending the ongoing escalation, ensuring the safety and security of the civilian population, and following-up on the Palestinian prisoners file,\" said U.N. Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Tor Wennesland, in a statement. Israel estimates its airstrikes killed about 15 militants. Islamic Jihad has fewer fighters and supporters than Hamas, and little is known about its arsenal. Both groups call for Israel's destruction, but have different priorities, with Hamas constrained by the demands of governing. The Israeli army said militants in Gaza fired about 580 rockets toward Israel. The army said its air defenses had intercepted many of them, with two of those shot down being fired toward Jerusalem. Islamic Jihad has fewer fighters and supporters than Hamas. Air raid sirens sounded in the Jerusalem area for the first time Sunday since last year's Israel-Hamas war. Jerusalem is typically a flashpoint during periods of cross-border fighting between Israel and Gaza. On Sunday, hundreds of Jews, including firebrand ultra-nationalist lawmaker Itamar Ben Gvir, visited a sensitive holy site in Jerusalem, known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary. The visit, under heavy police protection, ended without incident, police said. Such demonstrative visits by Israeli hard-liners seeking to underscore Israeli claims of sovereignty over contested Jerusalem have sparked violence in the past. The holy site sits on the fault line of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and is central to rival narratives of Palestinians and Israeli Jews. In Palestinian cities and towns in the West Bank, Israeli security forces said they detained 19 people on suspicion of belonging to the Islamic Jihad during overnight raids. By Sunday, Hamas still appeared to stay out of the battle. The group has a strong incentive to avoid another war. Last year's Israel-Hamas war, one of four major conflicts and several smaller battles over the last 15 years, exacted a staggering toll on the impoverished territory's 2.3 million Palestinian residents. Since the last war, Israel and Hamas have reached tacit understandings based on trading calm for work permits and a slight easing of the border blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt when Hamas overran the territory 15 years ago. Israel has issued 12,000 work permits to Gaza laborers, and has held out the prospect of granting another 2,000 permits. The lone power plant in Gaza ground to a halt at noon Saturday due to lack of fuel. Israel has kept its crossing points into Gaza closed since Tuesday. With the new disruption, Gazans can use only four hours of electricity a day, increasing their reliance on private generators and deepening the territory's chronic power crisis amid peak summer heat.",

Joe Biden is seen with former President Jimmy Carter watching the proceedings at the Democratic National Convention in Denver in 2008 where Biden would be the party's vice presidential nominee. President Biden, like any second-year occupant in the Oval Office, does not much like the phrase \"one-term president.\" As a Democrat, he presumably does not enjoy the comparison some are making between him and Jimmy Carter, the only Democratic president since the 1800s that the voters sent packing after just four years. But that comparison is, as they say, out there. And as the White House ponders staff moves in the months ahead, it knows it needs to address the dread \"Carter model.\" To be fair, Carter's ill-fated presidency occurred during extraordinarily difficult times, beset by numerous global crises and dogged by economic conditions he largely inherited from his predecessor. Biden's defenders might say the same. We should also note that Carter, at 97, is the longest living president ever and has long since rewritten his legacy with decades of humanitarian work at home and abroad. Overwhelming majorities of Americans approve of his performance since leaving office and polls show the public's assessment of his years in office has risen as well. Presidential scholars generally rate him in the middle ranks of U.S. presidents. Yet Carter remains a punchline in American politics, scarcely acknowledged at his party's national political conventions and rarely listened to in policy debates. That is because when he left office four decades ago, Carter was down to 34% approval in the Gallup Poll and lost to Ronald Reagan in 1980 by a landslide in the Electoral College. Not just another election, 1980 signaled a sea change in American politics. A half century of the New Deal and Democratic domination gave way to an era in which Republicans more than held their own, winning the Electoral College in six of the next 11 cycles and controlling at least one chamber of Congress two-thirds of the time. Carter also left a legacy of frustration and fecklessness that has been difficult for Democrats to shake. He is remembered for the Iran hostage crisis that consumed the last year of his presidency. He is remembered for his hapless struggles against inflation, high gas prices and the threat of oncoming recession \u2014 not to mention an aggressive Russian war machine invading a neighboring country in defiance of the world community. It is hard to miss the parallels between Carter's predicaments four decades ago and Biden's today, or the similarities in their performances. Gas prices are at historic highs again. Inflation is back up to high single digits (8.8% for the 12 months ending in May) and threatening to go higher. Recession threats are in the air as well. As Carter had to deal with Russia in Afghanistan, Biden has to confront its invasion of Ukraine. Carter's embargo on Russian grain and boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics contributed to his popularity's decline. Both Carter and Biden also came to office when social change was upsetting many American communities. Movements for civil rights and women's rights had met rising levels of pushback from opponents, galvanized in some cases by the rulings of federal courts and the Supreme Court in particular. Carter was personally opposed to abortion but supported the Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling. The resistance to Roe was gathering steam at the time among conservatives and not a few Democrats. Nearly half a century later, the shoe is on the other foot and the overturning of Roe by the current court's majority in Dobbs v. Jackson is yet another wedge dividing the national community. There were other sources of unease in the body politic in Carter's era that have their analogs today. For not a few families and community leaders who remember the 1970s, the current threats of crime, drugs, racial unrest and distrust of authority are all too familiar. And the similarities in circumstances carry over to comparisons of leadership. Carter was remembered for his \"malaise\" speech, which did not contain the word \"malaise\" and which was widely misinterpreted as blaming American citizens for the ills that had caused, or been caused by, their own sour mood. Biden has been faulted for speeches that do not seem to meet the moment and lack the urgency that might compel others to follow. His soothing approach to issues that prompt anger has often failed to soothe. The coin of the realm in assessing presidents has long been the running tally of public approval kept by the Gallup Organization. Both Carter and Biden saw their approval fall to around 40% after 18 months in office. Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter's national security adviser, wrote in 1983 that Carter \"did not fire enthusiasm in the public or inspire fear in his adversaries. He was trusted, but that trust was \u2014 very unfairly \u2014 in him as a person but not in him as a leader. He had ambitious goals for the nation...and yet he did not succeed in being seen as a visionary or in captivating the nation's imagination.\" Something similar might be said of Biden today.

Joe Biden, as they wait to speak at fundraising reception at Padua Academy in Wilmington, Del., in February 1978. Carter and Biden's paths to the White House could scarcely have been more different. Carter did not seem a likely candidate for the nomination when he began his lonely quest for it in 1973 after serving a single term as governor of Georgia. But he worked the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire farmers and eventually put together a string of primary victories that gave him the nomination. Carter appealed to an electorate weary of Vietnam and the scandal era known as Watergate. Although Richard Nixon was already out of office, Carter won largely by contrasting himself with the last elected president (much as Biden would do in 2020). Carter's electoral superpower was that as a Georgia peanut farmer and a Baptist Sunday School teacher he was able to carry the South. But that magic did not help him in office. Historian Douglas Brinkley has observed that \"the soft-drawling, broad-grinning Carter took pride in his ignorance of Washington's ways.\" He tried to pass major bills without clearing them with the Democratic speaker of the House, Thomas P. \"Tip\" O'Neill, and enraged Western senators with a \"hit list\" of water projects he thought were unnecessary. Liberals who fell in line for Carter in 1976 fell out of love quickly, prompting a challenge from the left to Carter's re-nomination. But Biden, too, despite his far greater familiarity, had trouble bending Congress to his will in his first year. Democrats had only a slim margin of majority in the House and a 50-50 tie in the Senate broken by Vice President Kamala Harris. It was enough for some COVID relief bills and stimulus spending and a modest gun control bill. But it has not been enough for the bulk of Biden's program, or to ban assault weapons or to restore abortion rights or voting rights recently curtailed by Supreme Court decisions. Quite apart from their struggles with Congress, both Carter and Biden found themselves preoccupied by issues over which they had scant control. Carter took office with the country still reeling from the 1973 Arab oil embargo that had blown up the price of energy and spurred overall inflation. At the same time, Carter took the oath when the country was recovering from a lingering recession from the mid-1970s. Those conditions had prompted the Federal Reserve to lower rates, which had also fueled inflation. When the Fed raised rates again, the recovery economy faltered. Growth, confidence and job creation declined. Carter responded with a public works bill that seemed popular, but then OPEC decided to double the price of its crude oil exports again, driving inflation well into double-digits for the next several years \u2014 and quite possibly dooming his reelection. Biden has been whipsawed by a similar dynamic involving oil prices and the Fed, with the added complication of COVID's effects on the economy and on government spending. Just when Biden's policymakers had hoped post-COVID recovery inflation would start to ease, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and retaliatory measures caused the worldwide price of oil to leap well above $100/barrel, juicing inflation worldwide, forcing a reversal of Fed policy and threatening the U.S. with recession. Carter and Biden might also have compared their plights on the issue of refugee admissions. Carter was presented with thousands of overnight refugees from Cuba when the Castro regime there put them on the sea in the \"Mariel boatlift.\" Many were sent to Army bases around the country, disrupting those communities while the refugees were processed for resettlement. Similar reactions are now familiar to Americans as far larger numbers of refugees from Central and South America have been dammed up along the U.S. Mexican border for months awaiting entry. The Supreme Court has agreed with the Biden administration that these would-be immigrants must be processed and, at least to some extent, admitted into the U.S. It must be noted that an incumbent's standing in the midst of a first term is far from a perfect predictor of reelection or rejection. Barack Obama looked dead in the water after his party lost 62 seats in the House in 2010. Bill Clinton was also a wounded incumbent, losing his Democratic majorities in both chambers of Congress in his first midterm in 1994. Even Reagan had a rocky first midterm in 1982 and sank in the polls, prompting speculation that he might not run for a second term. He did, though, and carried 49 states. But we do know the standing of a president matters to midterm elections, which are now less than four months away \u2014 with voting beginning sooner in some states. Biden will be judged on Democrats' performance in those elections and thereafter by how he plays the cards he is dealt by those outcomes. This winter, candidates will begin declaring their candidacies against him in the Republican Party \u2013 and possibly in the Democratic Party, as well. The atmosphere over the Biden presidency remains cloudy. But parts of the economic picture are brighter than they have been in several years, notably job growth and historically low unemployment. The Fed has a chance to dampen inflation without a full-scale recession. Gas prices could moderate somewhat. Moreover, some of the hostility to former President Trump that lifted Biden into office may still be available as the Jan. 6 investigation continues to highlight the former president's efforts to say in office after he lost. So while Biden's polls are down and his energy level seems low, there is time. He has time to turn it around. He has time to make things worse. Carter did some of both. He had his triumph with the 1978 Camp David Accords, bringing peace between Israel and Egypt. He also had his worst crisis when 52 Americans were taken hostage in the U.S. Embassy in Iran, a protest against Carter for admitting the former ruler of Iran to the U.S. for medical treatment. Robert Strong, a professor of politics at Washington and Lee University in Virginia has written that that \"there was always, it seemed, something unlucky about him: massive public disaffection with government, the fires of crisis breaking out at home and abroad, the hostile post-Watergate press, and by the end of his term, a challenge by a smooth, consummately telegenic challenger with an engaging new conservative message.\" The parallels here to Biden are, once again, are hard to miss. Except that in Biden's case, the smooth and telegenic challenger was there before he took office and has never left the public eye. Strong was writing about the emergence of Reagan in 1980, but he might as well have been describing the hangover of Trump in 2022. There is no one in the Democratic Party today to play the role played in 1980 by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, the liberal champion who split the party by seeking its nomination against its incumbent. But Biden, who was already in the Senate when Carter was president, will be 80 later this year. He insists he plans to run again in 2024, but he may not. In that event, the one-term fate that was Carter's would be fait accompli.",

This will be Biden's first trip to Israel as president, but he has been there many times during his political career. President Biden travels to Israel and Saudi Arabia next week \u2014 his first trip to the Middle East since entering the White House. And while the president has been eager to criticize a range of his predecessor's policies, he is fully embracing one key pillar of Donald Trump's Middle East policy  \u2014 the Abraham Accords.  Those deals were brokered by the Trump White House in 2020 to normalize relations between Israel and a number of Arab countries, including Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and Morocco. It was a huge rupture from recent history in which Arab nations had made it clear they would not negotiate with Israel until Palestinians received an independent state of their own. In other words, the Arab-Israeli conflict was tied to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and one could not be resolved without the other. But the Abraham Accords disconnected the two issues, and that framework has been embraced by the Biden White House.

Biden has focused his foreign policy on countering China and Russia, and rebuilding alliances in Europe. When it comes to the Middle East, experts say Biden's goals are pragmatic. He has not articulated grand schemes to broker an Israeli-Palestinian deal, but instead wants to see a stable, secure Middle East that does not erupt into violence. His team sees the Abraham Accords as a tool that can promote stability. In that vein, the Biden White House is not only embracing the accords, but also trying to build on them. The president and his team often speak about \"integrating\" Israel into the Middle East \u2014 a region that has long viewed Israel as an unfriendly interloper in the neighborhood. \"Part of the purpose \u2014 the trip to the Middle East \u2014 is to deepen Israel's integration into the region, which I think we're going to be able to do - which is good for peace, and good for Israeli security,\" Biden said recently in response to a question about his upcoming trip. \"And that's why Israel leaders have come out so strongly for my going to Saudi.\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with counterparts from Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates about the Abraham Accords in March.\n                \n                    \n                    Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with counterparts from Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates about the Abraham Accords in March. Biden plans to travel directly from Israel to Saudi Arabia: significant because the countries currently do not allow direct flights between one another. And Biden's trip could lead to some incremental movement in Saudi Arabia's relationship with Israel, such as allowing Israeli commercial planes to fly over Saudi Arabia. But given the current domestic politics in both Israel and Saudi Arabia, foreign policy experts are not predicting the two countries will normalize relations in the near future. \"Why I have very modest expectations for Israeli-Saudi rapprochement [is] cause the Israelis are not in a position to give anything on Palestinians or anything else to the Saudis to make it more palatable,\" said Jon Alterman, a former State Department official, now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, during a preview of the trip for reporters. Still, experts say these baby steps could eventually lead to a possible roadmap for normalization some day in the future. A senior Israeli official told reporters last week that getting Saudi Arabia to inch toward normalization would be a \"game changer in the region.\" \"Getting Saudi Arabia to advance, if incrementally, towards normalization with Israel is important in the context of pushing back against the radical forces in the Middle East, pushing back against Iran,\" the official said.

The accords were the first deal any Arab country had signed with Israel in 26 years. Until that day, the countries did not have any official economic or personal relationship with Israel. At the time, then-candidate Joe Biden was taking every opportunity he could to point out how he would govern differently than Trump. But in this case, he was quick to praise the accords. In a statement that day, Biden said he welcomed the news and would \"build on these steps\" if he won the election.

Once in the White House, Biden's White House did not initially focus on the accords. But in late March, at a summit in Israel, Secretary of State Antony Blinken made it clear where the administration stood. \"We are fully committed to expanding cooperation through the Abraham Accords, and building on the remarkable progress that Israel, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates as well as Morocco have made in such a short period of time,\" Blinken said. \"Simply put, normalization is becoming the new normal in this region,\" he said. But Blinken also underscored how Biden's approach would be different from the way Trump handled diplomatic relations in the region. \"We have to be clear that these regional peace agreements are not a substitute for progress between Palestinians and Israelis,\" Blinken said. That distinction showed the Biden administration recognizes that \"normalization between Arab states and Israel can't come at the expense of the Palestinians,\" said Khaled Elgindy, a former adviser to Palestinian leadership and now at the Middle East Institute. Elgindy said Trump and then-Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had used the accords to \"marginalize the Palestinians, to weaken them, to take away leverage, to sort of force them to the negotiating table.\" Former President Donald Trump and former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a signing ceremony for the Abraham Accords on Sept. 15, 2020.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Brandon/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former President Donald Trump and former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a signing ceremony for the Abraham Accords on Sept. 15, 2020. Elgindy said he is still skeptical that the Arab-Israeli conflict can be kept separate from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Others disagree. Since the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, Arab countries, led by Saudi Arabia, had issued an ultimatum: they would normalize relations with Israel only in return for an independent Palestinian state, Israeli withdrawal from territory captured in 1967, and a resolution for Palestinian refugees. But with the Abraham Accords, that consensus collapsed. Arab countries showed they were willing to bypass the Palestinian issue, which was a fundamental shift in the region. \"We changed the paradigm and we said: 'Alright: let's do business with Israel, and hopefully once we have more Arab voices, more influence, more seats on the table, we can have more of an influence on Israel as we talk about the two-state solution,'\" said Yousef al-Otaiba, the UAE ambassador to the United States, who was intimately involved in negotiating his country's deal. But in Washington, there is broad agreement that the accords are worth pursuing. In the first 48 hours after the UAE-Israel deal was announced, al-Otaiba said he spoke with 24 members of Congress - about half Republican, half Democrat. \"The question I got from every single one of the 24 is, 'What country's next?'\" he said.

For example, Trump announced on Twitter during his waning days in the White House that the United States would side with Morocco over a long-disputed territory in north Africa. It was a decision related to Morocco signing on to the accords. \"I doubt whether any Democratic administration would have given away sovereignty over the Western Sahara in exchange for an upgrade in relationship between Israel and Morocco,\" said Miller,  now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"That's Trump's transactional style.\" In this 2017 file photo from the Saudi Press Agency, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sissi, Saudi King Salman, and former President Donald Trump open a center to combat extremism in Riyadh.\n                \n                    \n                    Pool/Saudi Press Agency/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption In this 2017 file photo from the Saudi Press Agency, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sissi, Saudi King Salman, and former President Donald Trump open a center to combat extremism in Riyadh.",

Al-Kurd is one of many Gazans who struggle to get permission to leave Gaza for medical treatment. GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip \u2014 What does it take for a 70-year-old man to get heart bypass surgery in Gaza, when he is cordoned off from the rest of the world in a territory with just two heart surgeons left? It takes jostling through crowds of patients facing their own heath crises. It takes a dire enough medical condition, or political connections, to convince Palestinian officials to spare limited funds to pay for his surgery abroad. And it takes pleading with Israeli border officials for security clearance just to be allowed to drive an hour or two out of Gaza to a hospital that can perform his surgery easily. No place on Earth has been spared a health crisis, as the last few years have shown. Yet Gaza's protracted emergency is driven not only by a pandemic but by people \u2014 enemies locked in a 15-year standoff with no end in sight. The victims of Gaza's deadly military conflicts capture headlines, but a frequent contributing factor to illness and death in Gaza are the barriers to health care. Sometimes hospital patients are rushed past the Gaza border quickly, but other times they spend months begging for permission to leave, nursing ailments at home. Most patients with serious cases eventually do get to cross into Israel, according to World Health Organization statistics. But thousands each year face unpredictable Israeli delays and denials that a 2021 WHO study has shown to be deadly. It wasn't always like this. Seaside Gaza used to be a portal to the outside world. Some believe the word \"gauze\" comes from Gaza, where it was made and exported centuries ago. Gaza even had an airport briefly in the late 1990s. But 15 years ago last month, the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas seized control of Gaza following an election victory, and neighboring Israel and Egypt locked down Gaza's borders, choking off trade and travel. Israel says the blockade is still necessary to contain Hamas, which has waged attacks on Israel and is considered a terrorist group by the U.S. and European Union. Palestinians call the Gaza blockade collective punishment. Gaza is sinking in poverty, hunger, electricity cuts and contaminated water, the United Nations says. Basic health services are constrained even in the quiet times when there's no active fighting. In a crowded Gaza hospital waiting room in late 2021, NPR journalists approached one man at random, then shadowed him and his family for months, as they begged for permission to leave Gaza for surgery widely available in hospitals a short drive away. This is his story \u2014 and the story of many others. Yousef Al-Kurd kept the soundtrack of daily life humming in Gaza. He studied engineering in Germany before returning home to a 30-year career in Gaza fixing loudspeakers for mosques, schools and pushcart vendors. \"A legend,\" his son Raji says.

Al-Kurd, a 70-year-old smoker with diabetes, survived, but he needed open heart surgery. Al-Kurd put it off, scared of the procedure and worried about COVID, his children say. A year later, his health had worsened, and Al-Kurd's sons rushed him back to the hospital. They went looking for their physician, the head of cardiac surgery at Shifa Hospital, Gaza's main medical center. \"We discovered he had gone abroad,\" Al-Kurd's son Ibrahim said. A document shows the medical condition of cardiac patient Yousef Al-Kurd.\n                \n                    \n                    Fatima Shbair for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Gaza's top cardiac surgeon had emigrated to Spain. He and his family did not return requests for comment, but his colleagues said he joined a recent exodus of doctors. They have escaped through Egypt, which relaxed its border restrictions four years ago, seeking better lives in Europe and the United Arab Emirates. After the chief cardiac surgeon left Gaza, 40-year-old Dr. Saher Abu Ghali was promoted to the head of cardiac surgery at Shifa Hospital in June 2021. But a few months later, a doctor in the department died of cardiac arrest. Then another died of COVID. \"From four, we became three and now we became two,\" Abu Ghali said from his small office in the hospital. Dr. Saher Abu Ghali is the head of cardiac surgery at Shifa Hospital. He is one of only two heart surgeons for the two million residents of Gaza. \"This is not the only problem,\" he said. \"You don't have all the instrumentation. You don't have all the resources.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Fatima Shbair for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Dr. Saher Abu Ghali is the head of cardiac surgery at Shifa Hospital. He is one of only two heart surgeons for the two million residents of Gaza. \"This is not the only problem,\" he said. \"You don't have all the instrumentation.

In the U.S. and Europe, the accepted ratio to serve that population size is about 55 surgeons. \"This is not the only problem,\" Abu Ghali said. \"You don't have all the instrumentation. You don't have all the resources.\" Israel restricts the import of medical devices, like some X-ray equipment it says Hamas could convert for military uses. The Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, in charge of health services but rivals for power with Hamas, doesn't give Gaza enough medical supplies, WHO says. Take, for instance, the thin tubes used for heart bypass surgery called cannulas. In hospitals around the world, they are used once and discarded. \"Here, every cannula is re-sterilized more than 100 times,\" Abu Ghali said.

This is Gaza,\" he said with a laugh. \"If you want to use it once and throw it out, you will not operate. You will never operate.\" Israel doesn't let Palestinian doctors out of Gaza very often to update their skills with training abroad. To compensate for the gaps in care, Israel does allow delegations of surgeons, Palestinian citizens of Israel, to enter Gaza to conduct surgeries a few days a month. Other foreign surgeons visit, too. But it's not enough to meet the demands. Yousef Al-Kurd needed coronary artery bypass surgery, a fairly straightforward surgery for well-equipped hospitals around the world. But Dr. Abu Ghali, who trained in Italy, said he couldn't do it with Gaza's limited surgeons and supplies. \"It's difficult to be done safely in Gaza. We need heart surgeons. We need vascular surgeons. We need the instrumentations,\" Ghali said. The doctor recommended that Al-Kurd go to a better-equipped Palestinian hospital in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, a Palestinian territory not controlled by Hamas and not under blockade. It's less than two hours away by car, but getting there can be agonizing. To leave Gaza for medical treatment, a resident first needs approval from Palestinian health officials and then an Israeli travel permit. Neither is easy to obtain. The Palestinian Authority offers universal care under its public health-care system and pays for treatments when they are not available in Gaza. But the money, which comes from U.S. and international donors, is tight. And Israel only allows out the direst cases. Most people seeking medical care outside Gaza are cancer patients; there's very little chemotherapy in Gaza and no radiation therapy. The second most common patients requesting treatment abroad are heart patients like Al-Kurd. The triage is strict, even with very critical patients. Take this case: on day in early December, at the Palestinian health ministry's headquarters in the West Bank, a health official rushed into the office of Dr. Haitham Al-Hidri, who at the time oversaw financial coverage for Palestinian medical referrals. A doctor in Gaza had just called: a 25-year-old patient was on the operating table in Gaza with a life-threatening vascular problem in his jaw. The Gaza surgeon couldn't handle it and wanted Dr. Al-Hidri's approval to send him to an Israeli hospital right away. Dr. Al-Hidri called the young man's doctor in Gaza to find out: is it truly urgent? \"If he's bleeding, I'll let him out. If he's not bleeding, I won't let him out. You're the doctor in charge of him. You must give the last word,\" Al-Hidri told him on the phone. They spoke for a few more moments, and Al-Hidri hung up the phone. \"He is not in active bleeding. Some oozing,\" the doctor explained. \"So it's not top emergency. We can wait,\" he said. But in the end, Al-Hidri decided not to take chances. He approved the coverage and coordinated the patient's quick transfer to an Israeli hospital. He said Israel does grant permits for most of the especially urgent cases. For years, it was an open secret that patients who wanted to get treatment outside of Gaza could bribe clerks in the Palestinian health ministry to advance the referral. With the right connections, patients in public hospitals in the West Bank could get preferred treatment in private Palestinian and Israeli hospitals \u2013 paid for by the Palestinian Authority. Dr. Al-Hidri said he cleaned house when he entered the job in 2019: he fired clerks who took bribes and blocked unnecessary medical referrals, saving the cash-strapped Palestinian Authority tens of millions of dollars.

Suddenly, early this year, Al-Hidri was removed from his post and reassigned. The health minister, Mai Al-Kaila, called it a \"normal rotation\" of leadership for a \"sensitive\" role that oversees large expenditures. But a health official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the delicate issue, claimed the reason for the reshuffle was that Al-Hidri was preparing files alleging corruption in the health ministry, namely that several thousand patients, many of whom with important political clout, were transferred to private hospitals and granted unnecessary private medical treatment, costing tens of millions of dollars of international donor money. Recent medical documents leaked to NPR by two health officials appear to support allegations of patronage. According to the documents, at least three patients with high-level ties to Palestinian Authority president's Fatah party received subsidized, costly private medical care in Israel or the West Bank to treat ailments like a stroke or kidney cyst, which officials say Palestinian public hospitals have the ability to treat. \"To be transferred,\" is the handwritten note in Arabic on each document, signed by Health Minister Mai Al-Kaila herself. The health minister acknowledged she has approved private medical care for Palestinians, but denied the approvals were political favors. She said public hospitals are overburdened and her approach is \"humanitarian,\" referring the \"the poorest of the poor\" to private hospitals when \"prominent people in the country\" lobbied on their behalf. \"In our system, the minister has the power (to grant) an exception,\" Al-Kaila told NPR. \"I am working health and pure health, without discrimination for anyone.\" Heart patient Yousef Al-Kurd did not have political connections. But he did have a legitimate medical need to leave Gaza for bypass surgery. His surgery was scheduled at Al Mezan, a Palestinian hospital in the West Bank city of Hebron. To get there, he needed to cross through Israel, which meant applying for an Israeli travel permit. Israel is wary of letting in anyone from Hamas-controlled Gaza. \"It is not self-obvious that Israel will provide its enemy the treatment they need,\" said Harel Chorev, an Israeli researcher at Tel Aviv University. \"They can go to Egypt, for example.\" About 1 in 5 Gaza patients does go to hospitals in Egypt, according to the World Health Organization, but those hospitals are much farther away, and Palestinian health authorities prefer to keep patients inside their own system so public money is invested in the Palestinian territories instead of abroad. There have been isolated cases where Israel has accused patients of smuggling explosives or spying for Hamas. Some patients have been given Israeli permission to leave for medical treatment and then never returned, going on the lam in the West Bank for better economic conditions or to escape family vendettas and personal troubles in Gaza. \"The whole thing is about trust. But once you break that trust \u2014 once you break it and you send someone with cancer with TNT (explosives), and he's been caught, you know, obviously, it does a lot of damage,\" Chorev said. Israeli officials say they allow in only humanitarian and exceptional cases \u2014 more than 10,000 permits last year. Who is approved and who is denied on security grounds is often a mystery. \"It's really a black hole for us to understand the criterias,\" said Ron Goldstein of Physicians for Human Rights Israel, an advocacy group helping Gaza patients get permits. \"Many, many ... cases are not really security issues because, when we intervene, suddenly the person receives the permit.\" Israel does eventually grant most permits, but about a third of applications was delayed or denied in 2021, the World Health Organization said. WHO estimates thousands of people have had to reschedule surgery or chemotherapy as they await Israeli security clearance to travel. In the meantime, WHO said, these patients often grow more ill. That's what happened with Yousef Al-Kurd. He applied for a permit from Israel on September 12, according to the Palestinian office that submits permit requests. But Israel didn't grant him an expedited permit in time for his surgery appointment on September 15. His son Ibrahim rebooked the surgery for October 12 but still received no final word on a permit. He made a third appointment for November 1 and did not get a permit in time for that one, too. The whole time, Israel said it was reviewing his request. Al-Kurd just needed an Israeli permit for travel; Israel would not be involved in providing the treatment. \"The Israelis always postpone,\" Al-Kurd's son Ibrahim said. \"This is just slaughtering us.\" Al-Kurd's doctor said he shouldn't wait for surgery for more than a month. When six weeks passed with no answer, Al-Kurd's son turned to the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights in Gaza, whose lawyer Mohammed Al-Alami sent Israeli border authorities an urgent letter requesting travel approval. Mohammed Al-Alami, a lawyer at the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights in Gaza, sent Israeli border authorities an urgent letter requesting travel approval to the West Bank for heart patient Yousef Al-Kurd.\n                \n                    \n                    Anas Baba for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mohammed Al-Alami, a lawyer at the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights in Gaza, sent Israeli border authorities an urgent letter requesting travel approval to the West Bank for heart patient Yousef Al-Kurd. Two more weeks went by with no permit. So the lawyer called his Israeli contact by phone, and asked her: Why the delay? What's the security risk with a 70-year-old man? Al-Alami said the Israeli officer told him Al-Kurd had six phone numbers registered under his name. The lawyer thinks Israel reviews patients' phone calls, and that multiple phone numbers raise questions. The Al-Kurd family said there's a logical explanation: Each family member uses a different number, akin to   a family phone plan. The lawyer sent that information to his Israeli contact. \"Every day, like this. Every day,\" Al-Alami said. Pleading is part of the job in trying to get Israeli permits. One Palestinian official, who asked not to be named fearing repercussions to his job, told NPR he takes pictures of patients with their bulging neck tumor or their sick baby, which he said tends to win Israeli officers' sympathy. For years, the World Health Organization has documented barriers to accessing health care for Palestinians. Advocate groups say it is easier to win exceptions to the rule than to change the rule, a principle that applies to the entire dynamic of Israel's supervision over Palestinian lives. COGAT, the Israeli agency in charge of processing travel permits for Gaza patients, later told NPR that Al-Kurd's request was missing paperwork \u2013 which it said was a common reason for permit delays. But the family and their lawyer said nothing was missing and that COGAT never told them anything was. As Al-Kurd awaited a permit, his blood pressure suddenly dropped. He lost the ability to urinate. A couple more days went by. Then the family got a text message on a Saturday afternoon with some good news: The permit had been approved for the following day. Finally, Al-Kurd could get to the hospital for the crucial surgery. This glimmer of hope came after more than two months of pleading and waiting. But Al-Kurd's health was getting worse. The next morning at 5:30 a.m., Yousef Al-Kurd and his wife, Fayeza, said goodbye to their children and left home. They waited hours at the Hamas checkpoint as thousands of Palestinian laborers with Israeli work permits crossed first. Then they reached Israel's sole civilian border crossing with Gaza: the Erez crossing, one of the world's most heavily fortified border crossings. Yousef Al-Kurd and his wife, Fayeza, on their way to a West Bank hospital.\n                \n                    \n                    Daniel Estrin/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Yousef Al-Kurd and his wife, Fayeza, on their way to a West Bank hospital. Hamas, committed to armed conflict with Israel, is contained on the other side. So are 2 million Palestinian civilians. Israel's stated policy since Hamas' takeover is \"separation\": sealing Gaza off from the West Bank and limiting passage between the two main Palestinian territories. Inside the crossing, Al-Kurd was asked to raise his arms in a full-body scanner. He crumpled to the floor. Israeli attendants rushed him a wheelchair. No one told his family that they had the option to arrange a series of ambulances to ease his transport to the hospital. But there was a driver on the other side of the border crossing: Arnon Avni, 69, an Israeli graphic designer and political cartoonist who volunteers with Road to Recovery, a group of Israelis who drive Palestinian patients to their medical appointments. The group was waiting at the checkpoint for patients coming through, and NPR pointed out Al-Kurd's arrival. Al-Kurd and his wife took up the offer for a ride. \"Let's get them in,\" Avni said, throwing his grandchildren's booster seat into the trunk and coaxing the seatbelt over Al-Kurd, who was moaning in pain. The driver put the destination in his navigation app: an Israeli security checkpoint in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, a bit more than an hour away. Arnon Avni, 69, an Israeli graphic designer and political cartoonist, volunteers with Road to Recovery, a group of Israelis who drive Palestinian patients to their medical appointments.

Avni gave a ride to Yousef Al-Kurd, the Gaza resident seeking heart bypass surgery at a hospital in the West Bank. Al-Kurd and Avni didn't share a language but did have some things in common. They were about the same age, and Avni's father died of a heart attack. \"The pain is severe,\" Al-Kurd said as the car made its way along Israeli roads. His wife, Fayeza, 58, was in Israel for the very first time. \"It's another world,\" she said. It's clean, it's wide, it's open, not like the cramped quarters of the Jabalia refugee camp where she lives in Gaza, she said. \"What's that bridge?\" she asked Avni. It's just an overpass, he said. She chuckled; she'd never seen one before. \"I see the eyes of all of my passengers on my travels,\" Avni said from the driver's seat. \"All of them feel the same...the roads, the cars, the new cars. It's something else. It's like for me to travel to New York, or something like that.\" Avni lives right next to Gaza, in Kibbutz Nirim. Mortar shells landed outside his home last year, and five decades ago, a Palestinian from Gaza planted explosives in their kibbutz which killed his brother. \"Some people call me a traitor,\" he said. \"I believe that we do the right thing for Israel.\" At the Tarkumiya checkpoint near Hebron, an Israeli road sign warns Israelis not to enter the Palestinian territory, so Avni couldn't take Al-Kurd and his wife all the way to the hospital. He dropped them off on the other side of the checkpoint. They said goodbye to each other, and a Palestinian van whisked the Al-Kurds to the hospital. Al-Kurd didn't end up getting the surgery he'd been waiting for. Hours after he arrived in the hospital, he had multiple-system failure. Two days later, his son Ibrahim, in Gaza, got a phone call from the hospital, which he recorded. \"Ibrahim, how are you?\" the doctor said. \"Oh, God,\" Ibrahim replied. \"I'm with your mother now,\" the doctor said, then pauses. \"Your father, may he rest in peace.\" Yousef Al-Kurd waits to be seen for his heart disease at Shifa Hospital in Gaza.\n                \n                    \n                    Fatima Shbair for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Yousef Al-Kurd waits to be seen for his heart disease at Shifa Hospital in Gaza. Health experts say it's hard to know whether Al-Kurd could have been saved if he'd received his Israeli travel permit more quickly. There were a lot of factors. Al-Kurd himself was a high-risk patient with his diabetes and smoking habit. What's more, he went a year without getting the surgery in Gaza that his doctor had initially ordered, afraid of open-heart surgery and afraid of COVID. In Gaza, the medical system is poor, and there was very little patient follow-up when his condition got worse. Al-Kurd's son Ibrahim blames the Palestinian doctor for not marking the case as urgent, compelling Israel to let his father cross immediately. But health experts say that may not have helped; even some urgent cases get delayed and denied by Israel. The World Health Organization studied Gaza cancer patients from 2015 to 2017 and found they were nearly one and a half times more likely to die within months and years if their Israeli permits were delayed or denied. \"This is the only study that's been done at the population level to look at the impacts on survival or on health outcomes of these patients that face delays and denials of permits,\" said Benjamin Bouquet, a WHO doctor who co-authored the study. There are new efforts by the international community to help Palestinians shore up their own health care. The International Monetary Fund said one of the biggest sources of a current Palestinian financial crisis is the exorbitant costs involved in sending patients elsewhere. In May, the European Investment Bank inked a partnership with the WHO to help reduce Palestinian dependence on Israel and other countries for health care like oncology treatment. \"The whole referral system is an enormous burden on the Palestinian health sector,\" said Rik Peeperkorn, who directs the WHO office in the Palestinian territories. Since Al-Kurd died, more Gaza medical patients, including young children with such conditions as cancer or a congenital heart defect, have died while waiting for permissions to get treatment outside Gaza. Gathered with his family in their living room a few weeks after his father's death, Raji Al-Kurd, 24, posed a question. \"Put yourself in my shoes,\" he said. \"Would you like to face those circumstances? Would you like to see one of your beloved facing those circumstances?\" Sami Sockol in Jerusalem and Nuha Musleh in Ramallah contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The Jan. 6 hearing will outline pressure on the DOJ to help overturn the election. The death toll continues to climb after the earthquake in Afghanistan. President Biden will attend the G7 summit.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Each day of hearings on January 6 explores a different way that a former president tried to undermine this republic. LEILA FADEL, HOST: On Tuesday, Republican state officials testified that Donald Trump asked them to violate their oaths of office. Today, the hearings focus on the Department of Justice. Trump's own appointees to run the department have said he wanted them to promote election lies. INSKEEP: NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson is covering the hearings. Carrie, good morning. CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: Why do the former president's own appointees say that he went too far at DOJ? JOHNSON: Well, the Justice Department is not supposed to do the personal political bidding of the president, but that's exactly what we're likely to hear today from the committee, that the former president misused this department to try to cling to power, doing things like trying to get Justice to appoint a special counsel to probe nonexistent fraud. We know former Attorney General Bill Barr told Trump all these claims about election fraud were nonsense. Barr resigned in December 2020. But right after that, former President Trump started putting the squeeze on other top officials at Justice. There were something like nine calls or meetings demanding DOJ officials investigate fraud claims over the course of just a few weeks. Here's how the acting deputy attorney general, Rich Donoghue, put it in a deposition. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICH DONOGHUE: And I said something to the effect of, sir, we've done dozens of investigations, hundreds of interviews. The major allegations are not supported by the evidence developed. JOHNSON: Donoghue says he told the former president he was dead wrong when he made claims about fraud in Georgia, for example. INSKEEP: Yeah. We've already seen the video of that deposition. Now he testifies in person before the committee today. Is he the only person who is saying this? JOHNSON: No. We expect to see former acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and Steve Engel, who led the Office of Legal Counsel at Justice. It's unusual for lawyers at this level to testify in public about interactions with the White House, but the current president, Joe Biden, decided that executive privilege should not apply to shield these conversations about an effort to overthrow the 2020 election. One person we're not going to be hearing from today is former DOJ official Jeffrey Clark. He's described as being sympathetic to Trump's baseless claims of fraud and also drafting a letter to officials in Georgia to try to help Trump's cause. Clark did appear for a deposition, but he invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination there. INSKEEP: Now, why would Clark need to invoke the Fifth Amendment? JOHNSON: Well, an investigation by the Senate Judiciary Committee found Clark was going around his boss at the Justice Department, taking private meetings with the White House and at least one Republican member of Congress, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania. Trump had seriously considered whether to fire Jeff Rosen and install Jeff Clark as the acting attorney general. Steve, this all came to a head only three days before January 6... INSKEEP: Yeah. JOHNSON: ...In a bizarre meeting at the White House some people have likened to Trump's old reality TV show \"The Apprentice.\" Virtually the entire DOJ leadership team threatened to resign if Trump gave Jeff Clark the job. Here's again what Rich Donoghue told the committee. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONOGHUE: The president said, suppose I do this. Suppose I replace Jeff Rosen with him, Jeff Clark. What do you do? And I said, sir, I would resign immediately. There is no way I'm serving one minute under this guy, Jeff Clark. JOHNSON: The prospect of Justice Department officials resigning in protest, of course, has a historical precedent, Steve. It happened 49 years ago during Watergate. We call it the Saturday Night Massacre. That was avoided here narrowly by some of the men we're going to hear from testify today. INSKEEP: OK. We'll be listening. Carrie, thanks so much. JOHNSON: Thank you. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Carrie Johnson. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: Today we have descriptions of the remote regions struck by an earthquake in Afghanistan. FADEL: Afghan officials believe this week's earthquake killed at least a thousand people. The damage is in rural areas that would be hard to reach even under normal conditions. INSKEEP: NPR's Diaa Hadid is just across the border in Islamabad, Pakistan. Hi there, Diaa. DIAA HADID, BYLINE: Hi there, Steve. INSKEEP: What are you hearing? HADID: Well, we're really hearing how devastating this earthquake has been. We're now seeing videos that are showing whole villages that have collapsed under the rubble. There's men digging neat lines of mass graves. Injured people have been helicoptered to hospitals. And we spoke to one Taliban official who visited the area yesterday. His name is Khaled Zadran. He's the Kabul police spokesperson. And he told NPR's producer in Kabul, Fazelminallah Qazizai, that survivors were shellshocked. But have a listen to how he describes that. KHALED ZADRAN: (Through interpreter) I saw lots of children, and they were just sitting in front of their demolished, collapsed houses. But they were sitting there quietly, silently. They were not crying. But when we asked them, they would reply that 15 of my family member were killed, 12 of my family were killed. INSKEEP: That is one of the most powerful images that I've heard yet, seen in my mind's eye yet, of what it's like to be there. So who's able to help? HADID: Well, right now aid groups have rushed in, but there's so much destruction and so many big challenges in their way to get a sense of what they're facing. I spoke to Mohammad Ismail Hamid. He's the deputy country director for the Danish Refugee Council in Afghanistan. And he said they've deployed teams to assess the two hardest-hit areas. One of them is called the Barmal district. And have a listen to what he says. MOHAMMAD ISMAIL HAMID: So it's a really disastrous situation. Nearly all - almost all houses have been destroyed as a result of this earthquake in Barmal district. HADID: Nearly all the homes have been destroyed in that one district. So he says in coordination with other groups, they're distributing tents, clean water, food, blankets, cash - all this to survivors. But, Steve, survivors here is the key word. There's so many people still buried under the rubble, and it might take days to get them out because this area is so remote. It's rugged mountains that straddle the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan. It's mostly dirt roads to get there, and they've turned to mud because if this earthquake wasn't bad enough, there's been heavy rains that have been pounding the area. And they need to ship in heavy technical equipment and the people who are experts in using it, these search and rescue teams. So he tells me the international community really has to step up to help Afghans rebuild, and that could take years. INSKEEP: Of course, the primary responsibility for that region goes to the government, which is to say the Taliban, which took over the country just under one year ago on its own terms. In a military takeover, they seized power. How have they been, how effective have they been at responding? HADID: Absolutely. So the Taliban has rushed in. Their disaster management authority's leading the effort. Other senior ministries are lending a hand. High-level ministers have gone to the area to assuage residents that they won't be forgotten. They're uploading images and videos of what they're doing on social media. And one Afghanistan expert I spoke to says this is all the Taliban signaling to Afghans that they care and that they can govern competently. As you said, they seized power in a military sweep. They've stripped away women's rights. And so no country in the world has recognized them. And so what they're trying to tell Afghans is the international community has abandoned you, but we haven't. INSKEEP: NPR's Diaa Hadid. Thanks so much. HADID: Thank you, Steve. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: Two overlapping summits in the coming days bring together the U.S. and some of its closest allies. FADEL: One summit is the G-7, the Group of Seven leading industrial democracies. A NATO summit includes several of the same nations. They want to increase pressure on Russia. But President Biden also wants to steer the conversation back to China. At a summit a year ago, Biden said he wanted to compete against China's investments around the world. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: The point is that what's happening is that China has this Belt and Road initiative, and we think that there's a much more equitable way to provide for the needs of countries around the world. INSKEEP: One year later, NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith will be traveling with the president and joins us now. Tam, good morning. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: What was Biden's plan one year ago to counter Chinese investments and influence? KEITH: They called it Build Back Better World, which was a play on Biden's domestic plan for overhauling the U.S. economy. And the idea was to give low- and middle-income countries an alternative to signing up with China to fund big infrastructure projects. And that funding from China as part of its Belt and Road initiative often comes with huge coercive debt. Now, there hasn't been much news about this G-7 initiative since it was announced, though work has been happening behind the scenes. And of course, you know, here at home, the Build Back Better plan didn't make it through Congress. It kind of foundered. But this - an international program, the G-7 program, is getting a formal launch at the G-7 with some new branding going on. In addition to announcing a new name, Biden and other leaders are set to unveil the first projects, and these are meant to demonstrate how the program will work. INSKEEP: Does that mean that this project could actually have some traction? KEITH: China has put up a lot of money around the world, and so these leading democracies are behind - they're at the starting gate in many respects. And experts I've spoken to told me that there is a lot of skepticism out there from low- and middle-income countries. Here's Ian Bremmer, the president of Eurasia Group, which is a consultancy. IAN BREMMER: Whenever they talk to American officials, they say, well, if you don't want us investing in China, give us an alternative, right? If you don't want us tying up with Beijing and all this money they're offering, well, where else are we supposed to go? You don't have anything else. So this is meant to be that. And there's only one problem (laughter), which is that we don't actually have the money to fund it. KEITH: Now, the idea of this partnership is that it won't rely too heavy on government funding because they will seed it, use it to seed money from private equity and hedge funds and pension funds, insurance funds, global public-private partnership. But this is all happening at a precarious time in the global economy, and it's not clear that Congress or other Western governments will be able to put all that money in. INSKEEP: Tamara, thanks so much. KEITH: You're welcome. INSKEEP: NPR's Tamara Keith. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

BEIRUT \u2014 Lebanese voted for a new parliament Sunday against the backdrop of an economic meltdown that is transforming the country and low expectations that the voting would significantly alter the political landscape. A new crop of candidates from the 2019 protest movement are running against the country's entrenched ruling class that is blamed for the collapse, hoping to unseat them. But they are divided and lack the money, experience and other advantages held by traditional political rulers. People began casting their ballots shortly after the polls opened under the watchful eye of security forces that have fanned out across the country. Sunday's vote is the first since Lebanon's implosion started in October 2019, triggering widespread anti-government protests. It is also the first election since the massive August 2020 explosion at Beirut's port that killed more than 200 people, injured thousands and destroyed parts of Lebanon's capital. The blast, widely blamed on negligence, was set off by hundreds of tons of poorly stored ammonium nitrate that ignited in a port warehouse after a fire broke out at the facility. The voting is seen as a last chance to reverse course and punish the current crop of politicians, most of whom derive their power from Lebanon's sectarian political system and spoils taken at the end of its 15-year civil war in 1990. But expectations for real change were low amid skepticism and widespread resignation that the vote was sure to bring back the same political parties. \"I did what I can do and I know the situation will not change 180 degrees,\" said Rabah Abbas, 74, after casting his ballot in Beirut. He fears Sunday's election is only symbolic and that Lebanon will be stuck again in post-election political bickering over the formation of a new government and electing a new president in October. \"We will hit a wall again. Lebanon is a hopeless case,\" he said. The extent of Lebanon's collapse was on display Sunday. In the northern city of Tripoli, Lebanon's most impoverished city, several polling stations were without electricity and voters had to climb several flights of stairs to cast their ballots. Voters were seen using the light from his mobile phone to check his list before putting it in the box. Mainstream political parties and politicians remained strong going into the vote, while opposition figures and civil society activists hoping to unseat them are fractured. Lebanese parties have long relied on a system that encourages voters to cast ballots in return for favors and individual benefits. Money flowed, with political parties offering cash bribes, sandwiches, transportation and other favors to voters. Since the meltdown began, tens of thousands of people have lost their jobs, the Lebanese pound has shed most more than 90% of its value and many have left the country seeking opportunities abroad. Three quarters of the country's six million people, including 1 million Syrian refugees, now live in poverty. The World Bank has described Lebanon's collapse as one of the world's worst in the past 150 years. Some 718 candidates on 103 lists are running for seats in the 128-member parliament. The vote is held once every four years. In 2018, voters gave the powerful Hezbollah and its allies the majority with 71 seats. Lebanon has more than 3.5 million eligible voters, many of whom will cast their ballots in its 15 electoral districts. Earlier this month, Lebanese living abroad cast their ballots in countries where they live. Western-backed mainstream parties are hoping to strip the parliamentary majority from Hezbollah, while many independents are hoping to break through traditional party lists and candidates. The vote this year comes as a powerful Sunni leader, former Prime Minister Saad Hariri, suspended his work in politics. Some have warned this may help Hezbollah's Sunni allies to win more seats. After the election results are out, the government of Prime Minister Najib Mikati will become a caretaker Cabinet until the president calls for consultations with the new parliament members, who choose the next premier. The new parliament will also elect a new head of state after President Michel Aoun's six-year term expires at the end of October. Lebanon's parliament and Cabinet seats are equally divided between Muslims and Christians under the constitution that was drafted shortly before the civil war ended. As of Saturday afternoon, the Lebanese army began deploying in areas where tensions could be expected, mainly in areas around Beirut and the nearby Mount Lebanon.",

His remarks also indicated goals of accessing neighboring Moldova through a disputed, separatist region and blocking Ukraine from access to the sea. Another possible mass grave with as many as 9,000 bodies was found near Mariupol. Satellite imagery revealed the site, which may be 20 times larger than the mass grave in Bucha, according to a Telegram post by the Mariupol City Council. Maxar Technologies, a provider of satellite imagery, said in a statement that the size of the grave has gradually expanded over the past month, as Russian forces continue to transport Ukrainian bodies out of Mariupol. The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has confirmed more than 5,000 civilian casualties \u2014 2,345 killed and 2,919 injured. \"Our work to date has detailed a horror story of violations perpetrated against civilians,\" said U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet. This includes the \"unlawful killing, including by summary execution, of some 50 civilians\" in Bucha, outside Kyiv. \"We know the actual numbers are going to be much higher as the horrors inflicted in areas of intense fighting, such as Mariupol, come to light,\" Bachelet said. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres plans to visit Moscow next Tuesday, April 26. In a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, European Council President Charles Michel \"strongly urged\" Russia to grant \"humanitarian access and safe passage from Mariupol and other besieged cities\" ahead of Orthodox Easter this weekend. Zelenskyy said Thursday night that Russia had rejected a proposal for an Easter truce. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Friday that overall peace talks between his country and Ukraine have \"stalled.\" Russian authorities lodged criminal charges against prominent opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza for spreading \"deliberately false information\" about Russian troops operating in Ukraine. Kara-Murza is serving a 15-day prison sentence for allegedly evading police outside his home in Moscow. At the time, Kara-Murza had been giving interviews to U.S. media, criticizing Russia's invasion. The British Embassy will reopen next week in Kyiv, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced. Spain, Italy and France have also declared intentions to reopen their embassies in Kyiv in the coming days. The U.S. has not yet decided if or when to reopen its Kyiv embassy. Despite U.S. sanctions, oil traders help Russian oil reach global markets. Russia could default on its foreign debt for the first time in a century. A cruise ship in Tallinn, Estonia, is housing Ukrainian refugees. The Russia-Ukraine war drives countries to consider NATO membership.

Imran Khan was ousted from his position as prime minister of Pakistan after 174 legislators voted against him in a no-confidence motion early on Sunday morning. The vote came after the speaker of the house resigned, saying he could not oversee the ouster of his close ally of 30 years, and after Khan's own lawmakers delayed the vote all Saturday, only allowing voting close to midnight. Before discussion of the vote began, all of Khan's allies walked out of the chamber. The Supreme Court had ordered the vote to take place no later than Saturday, after it dismissed as unconstitutional an earlier attempt by Khan to dissolve the parliament in an effort to forestall the vote. In an impassioned speech Friday, Khan doubled down on his accusations that his opponents colluded with the United States to unseat him over his foreign policy choices, which often seemed to favor China and Russia and defied the U.S. Khan said Washington opposed his Feb. 24 meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin hours after tanks rolled into Ukraine, launching a devastating war in the heart of Europe. The U.S. State Department has denied any involvement in Pakistan's internal politics. Deputy State Department spokeswoman Jalina Porter told reporters on Friday there was \"absolutely no truth to these allegations.\" Still, Khan urged his supporters to take to the streets, particularly the youth who have been the backbone of his support since the former cricket star turned conservative Islamist politician came to power in 2018. He said they needed to protect Pakistan's sovereignty and oppose U.S. dictations. \"You have to come out to protect your own future. It is you who have to protect your democracy, your sovereignty and your independence. ... This is your duty,\" he said. \"I will not accept an imposed government.\" Khan's options are limited and should he see a big turnout in support, he may try to keep the momentum of street protests as a way to pressure Parliament to dissolve and go to early elections. The no-confidence vote loss for Khan may bring to power some unlikely partners. Among them is a radically religious party that runs scores of religious schools. The Jamiat-e-Ulema-Islam, or Assembly of Clerics, teaches a deeply conservative brand of Islam in its schools. Many of Afghanistan's Taliban and Pakistan's own homegrown violent Taliban graduated from JUI schools. The largest among the opposition parties \u2014 the Pakistan People's Party, led by the son of slain former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, and the Pakistan Muslim League \u2014 have been tainted by allegations of widespread corruption. Pakistan Muslim League leader and former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was convicted of corruption after being named in the so-called Panama Papers. That's a collection of leaked secret financial documents showing how some of the world's richest hide their money and involving a global law firm based in Panama. Sharif was disqualified by Pakistan's Supreme Court from holding office. If the opposition wins the no-confidence vote, it is up to Parliament to choose a new head of government, which could be Sharif's brother, Shahbaz Sharif. If the lawmakers are unsuccessful, early elections would be called.",

            "article_content": "Texts reveal how conservative activist Ginni Thomas tried to influence the 2020 presidential election. Ukrainian troops push back Russian forces near Kyiv. After NATO's meeting, Biden heads to Poland.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: People urging Donald Trump to overturn a Democratic election apparently included Ginni Thomas. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Ginni Thomas is a well-known figure in Washington, D.C. She's a conservative activist and the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. In the weeks after it became obvious Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, Thomas sent numerous text messages to Trump's chief of staff. She urged Mark Meadows to keep fighting. One message said, quote, \"the left is attempting the greatest heist of our history.\" Meadows later turned the messages over to a House investigating committee. The Washington Post and CBS News both reviewed those messages, as did CNN. INSKEEP: And CNN's Zachary Cohen is with us now. Welcome to the program. ZACHARY COHEN: I appreciate you having me. INSKEEP: Do you have any doubt about the authenticity of these messages? COHEN: Well, Steve, we've - as you guys said, we've reviewed the messages and we've also talked to multiple sources who have, in fact, confirmed that the House Select Committee has more than two dozen texts, 29 in total, between Mark Meadows and Ginni Thomas. So we're obviously confident in our reporting. INSKEEP: What is the key period when she's texting Mark Meadows? This is after the election and even after Biden had been declared the winner, right? COHEN: This is. These text messages date back to mid-November 2020 and span through mid-January of 2021. Now, most of the texts that the committee has that are in this group of 29 happened in the month of November. And there's only one text that occurred after January 6. We don't know if there's more texts than what has been handed over to the committee so far, but we do know that these do exist. INSKEEP: How often did Mark Meadows reply to Ginni Thomas? COHEN: It was about eight times, and so there were about 20 text messages from Ginni Thomas. And Mark Meadows would reply to some and would not reply to others. But, really, I got to tell you that these texts do show a very remarkable relationship between the wife of a sitting Supreme Court justice and Trump's then-chief of staff at a time when the former president was insisting that they were going to take their legal challenges of the election all the way to the Supreme Court. Now, there is no reference directly to Justice Clarence Thomas, and there's really not a lot of clarity around what he knew or did not know about the conversations his wife was having with Mark Meadows. But still, it's clear from these text messages that Ginni Thomas really sought to steer the Trump team's legal challenge especially and really sought to help push that narrative to overturn the election. INSKEEP: You mentioned that it's not clear how much Clarence Thomas himself knew about this, but what are the potential conflicts here? And how has Clarence Thomas addressed those possible conflicts in the past? Because she's been a noted activist for years. COHEN: That's right. And Clarence Thomas and Ginni Thomas have both insisted that they're - in the past, that there's no overlap between her activism and his seat on the court. Now, we have not received a response for comment from Ginni Thomas regarding the text messages. But, you know, this could raise some questions going forward, but we'll have to wait and see how that plays out and if the committee issues a subpoena for Ginni Thomas as well. INSKEEP: Zachary, thanks so much for your reporting, really appreciate it. COHEN: Thank you for having me. INSKEEP: That's CNN's Zachary Cohen. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: The capital of Ukraine is a bit more secure than it was at the start of the week. MARTIN: Russian troops who threaten the capital have in some cases had to retreat in recent days. They are still able, though, to fire artillery and missiles into Kyiv. And this morning, we have a glimpse of life in the capital city. INSKEEP: Which comes from our co-host, Leila Fadel, who's on the line. Hey there, Leila. LEILA FADEL, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: What is it like in Kyiv these days? FADEL: You know, there's a certain dread that runs through the city every night. When the sun disappears, people here draw their curtains, dim the lights. In our hotel, actually, the lights are off during dinner. It's almost as if this entire place is trying to hide from the next Russian airstrike. No one knows where it will land. And so that's life more than a month into Russia's invasion of this country. But by day, when we're out and we drive through the center of Kyiv, it's clear that as the war grinds on, people are adapting in their ways. I saw a man walking his dog, another riding his bike just outside a building damaged by a missile strike. Because, you know, life has to happen despite the war. INSKEEP: That must be true in different ways in all parts of Ukraine that you've visited. FADEL: Yeah, I mean, definitely there's a higher amount of vigilance here. The war is much closer to Lviv, where we've been doing a lot of reporting in the west. Here, the one thing that really struck me as different is we're not really seeing children. Every playground we pass in the capital is empty. Since the start of Russia's war in Ukraine, more than half of this country's kids, they're displaced. And you can feel it in Kyiv. It's like a sound is missing, the sound of children playing. But when we visited Ukraine's largest children's hospital, one car after another rolled in, tagged with the word children, a plea to Russian forces not to shoot. And inside the hospital, we met radiologist Anastasia Rusyn (ph), who said before the war just over a month ago, kids would come in with injuries you get from being a kid. ANASTASIA RUSYN: Some bicycles, you know, riding. As children, they has some, yes, accidents, sports, football and so on. And now we have blast trauma. It's children with shrapnels. We have childrens with hard injuries. FADEL: So upstairs from that emergency room, there was a 4-year-old boy with deep wounds on his back from shrapnel, a 7-year-old girl with shrapnel wounds to her legs. And then we met a 13-year-old, Voloydymyr Karivansky (ph). He goes by Vova. He's had multiple surgeries over the past few weeks. His jaw was wired shut. A scar ran up the right side of his face. And he was trying to escape his neighborhood outside of Kyiv in the early days of the war when Russian forces opened fire on his family's car. His father was killed, 6-year-old cousin Maxim (ph). A bullet grazed his hand, two pierced his back, another his foot; I mean, really devastating. INSKEEP: Wow. Of course, a lot of residents of Kyiv are gone. We're going to be going next to Poland, where millions of Ukrainians are now staying. FADEL: Yeah. INSKEEP: But what do you hear from those who choose to stay? FADEL: You know, choosing to stay for a lot of people is an act of defiance, a signal that they will live and they will keep their city. But it's a changed place, a place where so many people told us they don't know if they'll make it to the next morning. So they're adapting. Like I said earlier, they're finding moments of joy. I met a young law student who'd put on a smart blue blazer for a walk on a sunny day with a friend to grab a coffee. And down the road, I stumbled on a hair salon. And, Steve, it was open. Exsinya Kojushko (ph) was getting her hair cut. EXSINYA KOJUSHKO: Yeah. I feel guilty for having my hair done right now. And I actually done my nails just a few days ago, and I hated myself for that. But I'll feel better and I'll be able to work better, to do my - like, be better at everything I do. So I'm trying to give this justification of me being here, chilling, having a coffee. I know it's surreal to me because I'm sitting here like nothing happens. But somewhere on the outskirts of Kyiv right now, like, people cleaning their houses from broken glass, broken walls. FADEL: So she said it was her little island of normality while everything around her burned in flames. INSKEEP: Our colleague, Leila Fadel, thank you so much. FADEL: Thank you, Steve. INSKEEP: And we will note that Russian forces may be stalled outside of Kyiv, but they're not stalled everywhere in Ukraine. They have taken some territory. And Ukrainian officials today say the city of Chernihiv is now surrounded by Russian troops. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: OK. President Biden lands near Ukraine today, stopping 40 miles from the border in Poland. MARTIN: More than 2 million Ukrainians have fled to Poland since the Russian invasion started a month ago. Arms shipments from the West are largely sent into Ukraine through Poland. And after long warning the West about Russian ambitions, Poland is now in a position to play a really pivotal role in the response to Russian President Vladimir Putin. INSKEEP: NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith is traveling with the president. She's in Warsaw. Hey there, Tam. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hello. INSKEEP: What should the president see today? KEITH: He's going to get a firsthand look at how this country is dealing with Europe's most significant refugee crisis since World War II. He'll be landing in Rzeszow. This is a small city that's a first stop for many of the people leaving Ukraine. Yesterday, Biden said seeing the disruption caused by this war will drive home to him why the U.S. needs to take in thousands of refugees. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: It will reinforce my commitment to have the United States make sure we are a major piece of dealing with the relocation of all those folks, as well as humanitarian assistance needed both inside Ukraine and outside Ukraine. For example, this is not something that Poland or Romania or Germany should carry on their own. KEITH: The U.S. has also committed at least $1 billion in new humanitarian aid. INSKEEP: Tamara, this visit is reminding me that Secretary of State Tony Blinken was in Poland recently and deliberately took a few steps across the Ukrainian border as a symbolic show of support. I guess the president is at least not scheduled to do anything quite like that, but he's pretty close to Ukraine. KEITH: Yeah, about 40 miles to the west, and there is significance to this stop. He's going into the heart of the humanitarian crisis. And that city is not all that far from where a missile strike hit last week. Yesterday at NATO, Biden reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to Article 5. That is the idea that if one NATO member is attacked, the entire alliance treats it as if they were all attacked. And while there in Rzeszow, Biden will also visit with U.S. troops with the 82nd Airborne Division. INSKEEP: And we should mention, of course, the 82nd Airborne Division isn't going into combat here. The U.S... KEITH: No. INSKEEP: ...Response to Russia's invasion has been sanctions. NATO's response has been sanctions. Are they working? KEITH: Well, Biden was pressed on that yesterday. And, you know, many in the administration had earlier said the threat of massive sanctions might serve as a deterrent for Putin. But Biden insisted sanctions require time to get results. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: The maintenance of sanctions, the increasing the pain and the demonstration, why I asked for this NATO meeting today is to be sure that after a month we will sustain what we're doing, not just next month, the following month, but for the remainder of this entire year. That's what will stop him. KEITH: Of course, there is a big carveout in the sanctions thus far, and that's energy. Europeans and other partners still need Russian oil and gas, and that means Russia is getting money from that to help offset some of the other hits to its economy. Today, Biden is announcing a new task force on moving more liquefied natural gas to Europe. The goal is to help diversify Europe from Russian supplies of energy. The announcement says the U.S. and partners will, quote, \"strive to ensure additional LNG volumes.\" The amount they're talking about is relatively modest, and strive to ensure is language with a lot of wiggle room, just highlighting that this is something that is easier said than done. And the government doesn't necessarily have a lot of control here. INSKEEP: Tamara Keith, NPR's White House correspondent, safe travels to you. KEITH: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum on Monday, accused Myanmar's military of carrying out a genocide and crimes against humanity in 2016 and 2017. Blinken said it was only the eighth time in history that the U.S. had determined a genocide had occurred, and he hoped the announcement would help the Rohingya on their path out of the conflict. \"Today's determination is one step on that path \u2013 as it tells Rohingya, and victims in particular, that the United States government recognizes the gravity of the atrocities committed against them,\" Blinken said. \"And it reaffirms Rohingyas' human rights and dignity \u2013 something the Burmese military has tried to destroy.\" Blinken said he arrived at his decision based on a State Department factual assessment and legal analysis, which included a report on two periods of violence in Rakhine State in 2016 and 2017.

The report, based on a survey of more than one thousand Rohingya refugees who had fled to Bangladesh, found that the military killed, raped and tortured people and razed villages. Blinken said the results showed that the abuses weren't isolated but rather part of a widespread and systemic pattern of violence against Rohingya. \"The evidence also points to a clear intent behind these mass atrocities \u2013 the intent to destroy Rohingya, in whole or in part,\" he added. More than 9,000 Rohingya were killed in the 2017 attacks, the report concluded. In 2017, more than 700,000 Rohingya fled across the border into Bangladesh as the result of a counterinsurgency campaign launched by the Myanmar military, known as the Tatmadaw. The military said it was responding to coordinated attacks on Myanmar security forces by Rohingya extremists. Last week, the United Nations released a report that said the 2021 military coup by the Tatmadaw, which has claimed at least 1,600 lives, may be \"crimes against humanity.\" Myanmar's armed forces overthrew the civilian government, which was led by Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, in early February of last year. The military detained Suu Kyi along with other leaders of the then-existing National League for Democracy following accusations of fraud in the 2020 national elections. The army said at the time that power would be transferred to Commander in Chief Min Aung Hlaing in a statement broadcast on military-owned television that also declared a one-year state of emergency, Reuters reported. The military, called the Tatmadaw in Myanmar, named its new regime the State Administration Council. Since the coup, the Tatmadaw has targeted anti-coup protesters and allegedly used sexual violence, shootings, electrocutions, starvation, forced drug injections and more against the public, according to the U.N. report, which was pieced together from interviews with about 155 witnesses to the violations. \"Since 1 February 2021, acts that may amount to crimes against humanity may have been committed, in particular: murder, forcible transfer, imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law...\" the report said. More than 12,500 people have been detained, at least 440,000 have been displaced and about 14 million people are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance, the report says. \"Crimes against humanity under customary international law may be perpetrated when certain acts are committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population,\" the U.N. said. Anti-military groups have emerged in Myanmar and come together as the National Unity Government, a successor of the National League for Democracy. About 543 people who supported the military have died, with anti-coup groups claiming responsibility for 95 of the deaths, according to the report. The State Administration Council and the National Unity Government are both wanting international recognition as Myanmar's official government. International organizations have been unable to achieve lasting peace, with actions such as council resolutions remaining \"limited in scope and impact on the ground,\" according to the report. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet recommended in the report that Myanmar's military immediately stop all attacks and release all detainees, and that \"all parties\" in Myanmar cooperate with the UN's Special Envoy of the Secretary-General and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. To outside nations, Bachelet advises placing sanctions on Myanmar that will cut off the military's arms supply, cutting relationships with businesses tied to the Tatmadaw and providing long-term assistance to those fleeing the country. \"The human rights situation in Myanmar has deteriorated significantly as the far-reaching impacts of the military coup continue to devastate lives and hopes across the country,\" she said in November 2021. \"Conflict, poverty and the effects of the pandemic are sharply increasing, and the country faces a vortex of repression, violence and economic collapse.\"",

The Christian imagery and rhetoric on view during the Capitol insurrection are sparking renewed debate about the societal effects of melding Christian faith with an exclusionary breed of nationalism. The Sunday service at the Patriot Church in Lenoir City, Tennessee starts out like a lot of evangelical worship: hands aloft, Bibles in laps, full-throated singing about Jesus. When Rev. Ken Peters picks up his wireless mic, the service takes a sharp rightward turn. \"Don't let the mainstream media or the left tell you that we were not a Christian nation,\" he intones, prowling the altar in an anti-abortion T-shirt. \"You know why there's churches everywhere and not mosques? Because we're a Christian nation!\" \"Amen,\" responds the congregation, with gusto. The sermon, titled \"How Satan Destroys the World,\" zigzags between familiar grievances of conservative Christians, such as abortion and transgender people's rights. But what makes this church different, and others like it across the nation, is its embrace of the secular agenda of the far right. They believe that masks and vaccinations violate religious freedom, that the participants in the Jan. 6 capitol riot were proud patriots, and the Biden administration is evil and illegitimate. \"You know he's not the most popular president in America,\" Peters preaches, still obsessing on election results 14 months later. \"How many Biden parades did you see? Yet he beat Trump with 70 million? Give me a break. We know something's up.\" If anyone thought that Christian nationalism would decline with President Donald Trump out of power, they were mistaken. Christian nationalists believe, in general, that America is Christian, that the government should keep it that way,  and that Trump was \u2014and is\u2014 their best hope to accomplish that. This movement of ultra-conservative, politicized churches is apparently on the march, though there are no firm numbers because the congregations are mostly nondenominational. The belief system provides a godly underpinning for right-wing activism in venues like school-board elections, anti-vaccine protests, and the Jan. 6 attack on the capitol. \"This is a spiritual battle. It's good versus evil,\" says congregant Jim Willis, after the service. He's a 72-year-old retired army colonel and software salesman, who wears on his lapel an American flag inside of a Christian cross. \"And, unfortunately, evil has taken charge.\" Jim Willis, a retired army colonel and software salesman, outside the Sunday service at the Patriot Church.\n                \n                    \n                    John Burnett/NPR \n                    \n                \nhide caption Jim Willis, a retired army colonel and software salesman, outside the Sunday service at the Patriot Church. Willis says he and his wife fled California because of heavy-handed pandemic restrictions and headed to Tennessee. He says the Holy Spirit led them to the Patriot Church, which is not afraid to jump into the fray. \"We know what (the enemy's) agenda is,\" he continues, with a steely gaze. \"Their agenda is to close down churches, to get rid of religion permanently in this country.\" When it's pointed out that Joe Biden is a lifelong Catholic who attends weekly mass, Willis responds, simply, \"No he isn't.\" In this partisan fissure in which America is living,  imperviousness to facts is a sign of the times. Outside on the walkway, Murray Clemetson stands with an armful of hand-made signs he brought to church, such as, \"Set the DC Patriots Free\" and \"We Are Americans, Not Terrorists.\" The law-school student and father of three \u2014all home-schooled\u2014 was at the \"Stop The Steal\" rally in Washington, D.C., last year. \"The only insurrection that happened on Jan. 6 was by the agent provocateurs, paid actors, and corrupt police and FBI,\" he says, disputing all the evidence made public in the more than 700 criminal cases that the rioters were Trump fanatics. Clemetson would be among the 84% of white evangelical Protestants who voted for Trump in 2020, according to the Pew Research Center. He is asked if the Patriot Church is a Donald Trump church. \"I think it is a Donald Trump church,\" he answers. \"Donald Trump represented what we stand for as a nation. You go to flyover country and people have good moral values. They love the Lord and they want the best for the country. And that's what Donald Trump tapped into. That's what he represented.\" The next morning, Ken Peters is waiting inside his church with a cup of coffee for a sit-down interview. He's a 49-year-old, fifth-generation minister who grew up in the Pacific Northwest, and one of the few MAGA church leaders who welcomes journalists. The barn-like Patriot Church, with the giant American flag painted on the roof, has prospered. There are currently about 350 church members in the four campuses, in Tennessee, Virginia and Washington State, with two more locations underway. Rev. Ken Peters, a fifth-generation minister, leads the Sunday service at the Patriot Church in Lenoir City, Tennessee.\n                \n                    \n                    John Burnett/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rev. Ken Peters, a fifth-generation minister, leads the Sunday service at the Patriot Church in Lenoir City, Tennessee. Peters believes so fervently that his candidate won the presidency that he exhorted his flock to go to the U.S. capitol on Jan. 6. He says 15 to 20  parishioners attended the now infamous rally, though none entered the capitol building. Peters himself addressed protestors on Jan. 5. Continuing a theme from his Sunday sermon, he says, \"We consider the left in our nation today to be a giant bully ... And when there is a bully on the schoolyard and somebody rises up and punches back, 'Hallelujah!' So we are thankful for Trump.\" \"But you know what? If Trump passes away tomorrow, God forbid, does that stop us? Does that slow us down? Not one bit. We'll be looking for the next guy to lead the way.\" The rise of Christian nationalism is both a symptom and an accelerant of the polarization that afflicts America. And there is more and more pushback. Beginning last year, more than 24,000 national church leaders, clergy and lay people have signed a statement that condemns Christian nationalism as a distortion of the faith and idolatrous of the former president. That letter, and the proximity of the Patriot Church, motivated one congregation just up the highway to take a stand. Church of the Savior \u2014a liberal, inclusive congregation that's part of the United Church of Christ\u2014 is perched on a bluff overlooking Interstate 40 in Knoxville. A sign out front reads, \"Immigrants & Refugees Welcome.\" Senior pastor John Gill stands at the pulpit on a recent Sunday and starts his sermon this way: \"I think many of us believed and hoped that the fever of misinformation about the election and the pandemic and all the related efforts to undermine democracy in our nation would somehow abate. But that's not happening.\" Indeed, he says, things have gotten worse. \"It's difficult for me to understand how they can claim to be patriots,\" he continues, \"when they reject ... the first amendment that prohibits the establishment of state religion.\" The youth minister at the church is 58-year-old Rev. Tonya Barnette. She says, in an interview, that Christian Trumpism has also broken out in the Pentecostal churches where she grew up in Appalachia. \"My family would go to the Patriot Church if there were one around Big Stone Gap, Va.,\" she says. \"The churches they go to teach the same things.\" Barnette is lesbian, and she says her sexuality and her progressive religion are still rejected by some of her family members in the coal town of Big Stone Gap. She says she understands why people in the Patriot Church are scared. \"I think it's some kind of fear of difference,\" she says, \"fear of me as being different, fear of the nation changing so that it's not white, cis, straight, male Christians in charge only. And it's moving more toward people who are different.\" Barnette says, in her view, Christian patriots are completely missing the true message of the gospel. \"Wanting to gain power as Christian nationalists is in direct opposition to what Jesus taught. The goal is compassion, kindness, and care for the other. That's what Jesus did.\" The Patriot Church embraces fundamentalist Christianity, as well as the secular agenda of the far right.\n                \n                    \n                    John Burnett/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Patriot Church embraces fundamentalist Christianity, as well as the secular agenda of the far right. A 55-year-old librarian and Church of the Savior parishioner named Ed Sullivan says, \"I mean, there's nothing new about Christian nationalism. It's been part of this country's history for a long time. Decades.\" As Sullivan observes, the Bible has been thrust into conservative politics long before the Patriot Church. In the 1980s, Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority helped to get Christians involved in politics. In the 1950s and 60s, Billy James Hargis promoted his Christian Crusade on more than 750 radio and TV stations. \"But the Patriot Church movement is certainly the most extreme manifestation of that that we have today,\" Sullivan says. Is there any way, he is asked, to narrow the chasm that separates these two churches in Eastern Tennessee that both profess to follow the same Jesus? Sullivan answers, \"If they (Patriot Church) view anyone who dissents with their point of view as evil, or the enemy, or of the devil, I really don't see how there's any kind of common ground.\" When the same question is put to Rev. Peters, he says the last thing they want is a civil war. \"We don't want bloodshed. We want to live in peace and stay united ... That's going to be very difficult.\"",

BOSTON \u2014 A refugee who survived the Khmer Rouge's brutal rule has become the first Cambodian American mayor in the United States. Sokhary Chau, a city councilor in Lowell, Massachusetts, was unanimously picked by his council peers to assume the legislative body's top post on Monday. He also became the city's first Asian American mayor.\"God bless America, right? I was a refugee, now I'm mayor of a major city in Massachusetts,\" the 49-year-old, who works for the U.S. Social Security Administration, said after being officially sworn in. \"I don't know if that could happen anywhere else in the world. I'm still trying to absorb it.\" Chau, in his inaugural remarks, reflected on his family's perilous escape from Cambodia and the former industrial city of Lowell's deep immigrant roots.Located on the Merrimack River near the New Hampshire state line, Lowell was an early center of America's textile industry, drawing waves of European and Latin American immigrants over generations. Today, the city of more than 115,000 residents is nearly 25% Asian and home to the nation's second-largest Cambodian community.\"As a proud Cambodian American, I am standing on the shoulders of many immigrants who came before me to build this city,\" Chau said Monday before a crowd that included his wife and two teenage sons. Chau recounted how his father, a captain in the Cambodian army, was executed by the communist Khmer Rouge in 1975 during the country's civil war.He said his mother, who died last year, managed to keep her seven children alive for four years, surviving \"landmines, jungles, hunger, sickness and uncertainty\" to deliver them safely to the U.S.Chau said America may not have \"streets paved with gold\" as his family imagined while living in refugee camps, but it's a land where democracy is possible because of \"systems of checks and balances\" and principles like fairness, equality and transparency. In an interview later, Chau said he was around 9 years old when his family initially settled in Pittsburgh, Pa., with the help of the Catholic Church \u2014 an experience that prompted the family to convert to Christianity. They made their way to Lowell's growing Cambodian community in the mid-1980s, where some of his older siblings immediately set to work in local factories.Chau, however, continued his studies and eventually earned a scholarship to Phillips Academy, a exclusive boarding school in nearby Andover. He went on to Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, where he studied economics and political science, also on a scholarship. Before running for office, Chau said he worked mostly in financial services, including running a mortgage lending company in Lowell with his wife before the housing market crashed in the early 2000s. Chau's election follows the ascendance of new Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan. She was sworn in last November as Boston's first woman and first person of color elected to the post. Chau is also among the growing list of Cambodian American officeholders in Massachusetts: at least two other city councilors, a school committee member and two state lawmakers, all from Lowell, according to Vannak Theng, president of the Cambodian Mutual Assistance Association of Greater Lowell. But while Cambodian Americans served on local boards and state legislatures nationwide, none were elected mayor, according to the Asian Pacific American Institute for Congressional Studies, a Washington nonprofit that helps Asian Pacific Americans pursue public office and maintains a listing of current officeholders.In fact, Long Beach, California, home to the nation's largest Cambodian community, only elected its first Cambodian American city councilor in 2020, the organization noted. Chau's election also comes on the heels of a federal court lawsuit that argued Lowell's election process violated the voting rights of minority residents, who comprise nearly 50% of its population.A recent settlement in the case prompted the city to change its election process, starting with the 2021 elections. The result was the city's most diverse class of officeholders, said Oren Sellstrom, litigation director at Lawyers for Civil Rights, a Boston group that brought the 2017 suit. \"Just four years ago, the city's elected officials were all white and largely unresponsive to the needs of the city's communities of color,\" Sellstrom said. \"This historic change in the city's power structure would never have been possible under the old electoral system.\"To be sure, the mayoral office in Lowell is largely ceremonial.The city, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Boston, is run by a city manager picked by the council. The mayor is effectively the council president, leading its meetings and also serving as chair of the city's school committee.Still, Chau acknowledged his election's significance to the wider Cambodian diaspora, calling on others to step up in their communities.\"We can no longer be just victims,\" he said as he closed his inaugural remarks. \"It is our time now to be leaders and to succeed.\"",

LONDON \u2014 Following the resignation of Liz Truss as Britain's fourth prime minister in a little over six years, her Conservative Party \u2014 in power since 2010 \u2014 is racing to select a replacement. Candidates have until Monday to put their name forward, but party officials have announced that in order to be considered they will have to show they have the backing of 100 Conservative legislators, about a third of the party's lawmakers in the House of Commons. At most, this means there can only be three contenders for the first round of voting to decide the new party leader \u2014 who will also become prime minister. That is designed to avoid a repeat of the earlier, drawn-out selection process this summer to replace former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, which ended with Truss as the victor. This week, after the second resignation of a Conservative prime minister in just four months, leaders of Britain's major opposition parties are demanding a general election instead, and calling the new selection process a Conservative \"coronation.\" (There isn't another election due until January 2025 unless the government calls an earlier one.) Here is a list of some possible replacements for Truss in No. 10 Downing Street. Boris Johnson delivers his final speech as prime minister outside No. 10 Downing Street on Sept. 6.\n                \n                    \n                    Daniel Leal/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Boris Johnson delivers his final speech as prime minister outside No. 10 Downing Street on Sept. 6. He announced his resignation in a swirl of scandals just this past July and faces a parliamentary investigation into his behavior involving his public statements about social gatherings in Downing Street amid COVID-19 lockdown when he was prime minister. But Johnson retains supporters inside the parliamentary party and among ordinary grassroots members. He stepped down under a tidal wave of pressure when dozens of members of his own government quit. They were angry with months of scandal involving breaches of lockdown among his staff \u2014 and Johnson himself was also penalized by police \u2014 and for questions about his honesty and judgment after placing a man accused of sexual assault into a senior government role. Johnson won a significant majority for his party during the 2019 general election, and his supporters contend that he is therefore the only real figure inside the Conservative Party who can claim to have a mandate from the British people. Some critics have said they will leave the party if he returns. And although Johnson was unwilling to leave Downing Street earlier this year, there has been little public indication that he wants to take up once more what many will consider a poisoned chalice, given the country's obvious economic and political challenges. Penny Mordaunt, leader of the House of Commons, on Oct. 11.

Mordaunt insisted earlier this week to the amusement of many that Truss was not \"under a desk.\" Mordaunt became the first Conservative lawmaker on Friday to formally launch her candidacy to replace Truss as prime minister. This summer she was a well-supported third-place contender to replace Johnson, but eventually endorsed Truss. Earlier this week, she appeared in the prime minister's place in Parliament to answer pointed questions from opposition politicians. To the amusement of many, she insisted that Truss was not hiding \"under a desk.\" Under Truss, she served in a Cabinet position as leader of the House of Commons, essentially responsible for overseeing government business in Parliament's lower chamber, and with another largely honorary role, lord president of the Privy Council, she also oversaw a ceremony that approved King Charles' legal accession to the throne following his mother's death. Mordaunt had served as a naval reservist and in 2019 became the first woman to serve as the country's defense secretary. Her candidacy has already received several public endorsements from other legislators.

Sunak is considered more of a centrist and pragmatic politician than Truss. Sunak was Johnson's high-profile and largely popular finance minister during the pandemic, but lost out to Truss in the race to replace him. He secured far more votes from Conservative legislators but did not command the same level of support from the grassroots party members, who ultimately decided the contest in her favor. Considered more of a centrist and pragmatic politician than Truss, he repeatedly warned that her policy proposals around tax cuts and spending would leave a hole in the country's finances. His statements to that effect were largely vindicated when financial markets reacted so negatively to Truss' tax cuts announcements last month. Having only been elected as a member of Parliament in 2015, after a career in banking and hedge funds, his political rise to become finance minister by 2020 was meteoric. In that role he took unprecedented action to support Britain's economy during the pandemic, with months-long programs to replace workers' wages and incentivize consumer spending. Like Johnson, he received a financial penalty from police for breaching COVID-19 social-distancing rules, and he faced criticism after details of his very wealthy wife's international tax affairs were published in the British media.

That left her responsible for police, the criminal justice system and immigration, and had already earned a hard-line reputation as a hawk on immigration. She publicly promised to reduce migration to the U.K. in recent weeks and advocated vociferously for a controversial policy that would send asylum-seekers arriving in Britain to the African nation of Rwanda for their claims to be processed there. She resigned earlier this week, ostensibly for having sent a sensitive, but not secret document from a personal email account. But in her public resignation letter, she seemed to sharply criticize Truss for not engaging in \"serious politics\" and for failing to take responsibility for her government's mistakes, including the tax and spending proposals that had roiled financial markets in recent weeks. She served as a lawyer before entering Parliament and was among the staunchest supporters of Brexit. She ran as a candidate to replace Johnson earlier this year, but was voted out in an early round by her fellow party lawmakers.",

            "article_content": "One of the most consequential Supreme Court terms in recent memory still has two major cases left on the docket \u2014 cases that could alter the political landscape on immigration and the environment.  A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: It's been a blockbuster term for the Supreme Court. And today, the newest justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson, will be sworn in, replacing retiring Justice Stephen Breyer. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: The court will also issue opinions in its two remaining cases, which we have been watching closely. One involves the Remain in Mexico policy, and the other centers on the EPA's power to regulate greenhouse gases. MART\u00cdNEZ: Joining us to discuss the cases is NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg. All right, Nina, so what are these cases about? NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: Well, Remain in Mexico is a Trump-era policy that required asylum-seekers, mainly from Central and South America, to either be detained in the U.S. or sent to Mexico, where they've lived in squalid camps while they wait for months and some of them years before they have their asylum claims reviewed. Last June, a year ago, the Biden administration tried to end the policy and substitute its own. But a Trump-appointed federal district court judge ordered the administration to restart the Trump program, and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed. Today, the Supreme Court decides whether those lower court judges overstepped their authority, whether, as the Biden administration claims, the president has broad authority to make and revoke immigration policy under federal immigration law and under the Constitution's authority to conduct foreign policy, or, in the alternative, whether the Biden administration overstepped its authority. MART\u00cdNEZ: All right. Now, a second one is a huge environmental case, as I understand it. TOTENBERG: Yep, because the decision could hamstring the EPA's efforts to regulate carbon emissions that cause climate change. Specifically at issue in the case are rules adopted by the Trump administration and the Obama administration to deal with carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants. Those are the single biggest cause of carbon emissions in this country. The Obama plan was broad, the Trump one narrow. The Obama plan was temporarily blocked by the Supreme Court and then revoked by the Trump administration. But amazingly, most utilities continued to abandon coal because it was just too expensive. And even without the regulation in place, the Obama reduction targets for carbon emissions were met 11 years ahead of schedule. Now, what's so interesting about this case is that neither the Obama nor Trump plan is in effect, and the Biden administration doesn't have a plan on the table yet. But the Supreme Court still reached out to hear this case, and all indications are that to one degree or another, it's going to make it much harder to regulate carbon emissions and potentially many other things as well, using this case as a vehicle, which has, of course, totally spooked environmentalists. MART\u00cdNEZ: Now, the court is also set to issue an orders list. What do we expect there? TOTENBERG: The court will announce some cases that it plans to take up or not take up next term. One big case that we're watching involves elections. It's from North Carolina, and it involves what's called the independent state legislature doctrine. Get used to that. Basically, the theory could reshape how the United States conducts federal elections. It would give state legislatures independent power that's not subject to review by the state courts. It would also allow them to set election rules that are at odds with their own state constitutions, giving them unfettered power to draw gerrymandered congressional maps, among other things. If the court does take that case, it will add to what's shaping up as another blockbuster term, with cases testing affirmative action in college admissions, gay rights in terms of equal access to commercial services and now potentially the election case, sometimes referred to in legal circles as the 800-pound gorilla. MART\u00cdNEZ: All right, NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg, thanks a lot. TOTENBERG: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "The future of the pandemic order Title 42 that gave the government power to quickly expel migrants remains in limbo in the courts. DHS Secretary Mayorkas is testifying on Capitol Hill this week.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: The Biden administration is spending the week explaining the plan to lift pandemic restrictions at the border. These are the restrictions known as Title 42. They were first put in place back during the Trump administration. Opponents say that ending Title 42 is a bad idea, and they are challenging the plan to do so in court and in Congress. Meanwhile, Homeland Security Chief Alejandro Mayorkas is defending it to lawmakers on Capitol Hill this week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: With the Title 42 public health order set to be lifted, we expect migration levels to increase as smugglers seek to take advantage of and profit from vulnerable migrants. We will continue to enforce our immigration laws. KELLY: So among the questions in play, what may happen to people seeking asylum at the southern border - also, how the politics will play out here, especially with midterm elections looming. Well, let's bring in two of our correspondents who have been watching this closely - NPR political reporter Deepa Shivaram and NPR's Joel Rose, who covers immigration. Hey, you two. DEEPA SHIVARAM, BYLINE: Hey there. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Hi. KELLY: Joel, you first - lay out the basics. How does Title 42 currently work, and what is the gist of the plan to end it? ROSE: Sure. So this is a Trump-era border policy that started more than two years ago. It allows immigration authorities to bypass normal immigration procedures in the name of protecting public health, you know, and rapidly expel migrants without giving them a chance to seek asylum under U.S. law. Immigrant advocates say that has forced migrants back to danger in Mexico or in their home countries. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that Title 42 is no longer necessary, and the Biden administration has been preparing to lift the restrictions on May 23 and insists, you know, as you say, it does have a plan to deal with a likely influx of migrants. This is actually the second time DHS has released a plan. This one has more details, more emphasis on enforcement of immigration laws that were on the books before the pandemic. And it seems, you know, intended to counteract the message we've heard a lot from Republicans and also from some Democrats that the administration has no plan. KELLY: Yeah. Deepa, jump in here because Democrats have been asking for this plan. There are a lot of Democrats who are also nervous about the current plan. What does that look like? - explain. SHIVARAM: Right. So since DHS has released these new details, we haven't heard much of a response from Democrats. And the White House actually held a briefing call with Capitol Hill yesterday after this updated plan was released. But the same Democrats who were expressing these concerns haven't really responded yet. And meanwhile, Republicans are filling that void with their own rhetoric about how this is, quote, \"Biden's border crisis.\" This is what Republican Senator James Lankford said earlier today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JAMES LANKFORD: It is policy insanity what they're doing. The plan that we were given yesterday, this plan statement that came in from Alejandro Mayorkas, this plan that was supposed to define out for us is not a plan at all. It's basically how they're going to move people into the country faster. SHIVARAM: And Republicans keep pointing to the part in the plan where Mayorkas acknowledges that the rise in migrant encounters at the border is a strain to the current immigration system. KELLY: Joel, right now, Title 42 is in place, and we're seeing enormous numbers of migrants being apprehended at the southern border. Who are they? ROSE: Yeah, the majority are from Mexico and Central America, but, increasingly, they are coming from even farther away places like Cuba, Venezuela, even Ukraine. They are often fleeing violence, corruption and poverty in their home countries; things, by the way, that the Biden administration says have very little to do with U.S. immigration policy. But many Republicans disagree with that. They argue that these are, overwhelmingly, economic migrants who are really here to work and who are filing flimsy asylum claims in order to, you know, sort of game the U.S. immigration system. SHIVARAM: Right. And what immigration advocates are also saying here is that Democrats are losing out on an opportunity to define where they stand on immigration and supporting asylum-seekers, which is something that won them elections in 2018 and 2020. So while Democrats have a chance to stand their ground on removing Title 42, they haven't been a united front on that at all. And what these immigration advocates are saying right now is that that might have a detrimental impact on Democrats turning out their base voters in the midterm elections this November, especially at a time when voter enthusiasm is pretty low for the party. KELLY: Well, we mentioned legal challenges. I know several states have challenged this plan to lift Title 42. Where does that stand? ROSE: Yeah. So far, those challenges are going well for the states. More than 20 states have joined a challenge filed by Arizona and Missouri and Louisiana. The federal judge in Louisiana who is hearing that case has granted a temporary restraining order to stop the Biden administration from beginning to phase out Title 42. The judge also says the states are likely to prevail on the bigger question of whether or not the CDC went through the proper process to end Title 42. And, you know, this is not the only example of the Biden administration trying to end a Trump-era border policy and having a difficult time in court. Yesterday, the Supreme Court heard arguments about the Biden administration's attempt to terminate the policy known as Remain in Mexico, which forced migrants to wait south of the border for their immigration court hearings. The Biden administration tried to end that policy, too, but was blocked by a federal judge. And, you know, immigrant advocates say this is like the dead hand of the Trump administration and its allies continuing to tie the hands of the Biden administration when it comes to the border and asylum. KELLY: And meanwhile, Deepa, speaking of places where this could be challenged, the White House has said if Congress wants to weigh in and get in on the act here, they can. Are they likely to? SHIVARAM: Right. So we've seen Republicans already hold up a COVID relief bill, trying to add in a vote on Title 42. That happened before Easter. And it's possible that we see it again with Congress voting to provide more aid to Ukraine soon. So that is a possibility. But even though the White House has said that Congress could act legislatively on Title 42, we heard press secretary Jen Psaki say earlier this week that, you know, one way or another, Biden isn't really ready to dismiss or sign potential legislation on Title 42. So it's kind of adding to this sort of confusing element of the White House's messaging on Title 42 as well. But the thing to keep an eye out for this week, especially tomorrow, is this House Judiciary Committee hearing where DHS Secretary Mayorkas is going to be speaking, and there will be some partisan politics playing out there as well. KELLY: And just real quick, Joel, the timing here - I mean, if the plan does end, how quickly could that happen? ROSE: Well, the - Title 42 is supposed to end on May 23, but a lot of time for things to happen in court or on the Hill between now and then. KELLY: Indeed, so much in play. NPR's Joel Rose and Deepa Shivaram, thank you, you two. ROSE: You're welcome. SHIVARAM: Thanks. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Political divisions over lifting Title 42 are playing out on on Capitol Hill, where DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is testifying before the House Judiciary Committee, known for its heated partisan confrontations. The public health order has been blocking many migrants at the border since the start of the COVID pandemic. And while the Department of Homeland Security has released a detailed plan on how to handle the likely influx of migrants expected at the border once Title 42 lifts on May 23, Republicans and some Democrats have been vocal that the plan isn't enough. At the hearing, Mayorkas addressed the administration's plan. \"Under this administration, our department has been executing a comprehensive strategy to secure our borders and rebuild our immigration system,\" Mayorkas said in his opening remarks. \"With the Title 42 public health order set to be lifted, we expect migration levels to increase as smugglers seek to take advantage of and profit from vulnerable migrants.\" Mayorkas said the administration will continue to enforce immigration laws, but said, \"We inherited a broken and dismantled system that is already under strain.\" He said the department has \"effectively\" managed the border but immigration reform can only come from Congress. Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the ranking member on the committee, accused Mayorkas of being \"out of touch\" with the American people and other Republican members expressed similar outrage at the administration's handling of the border. Democrats on the committee have so far defended the department's plan once Title 42 lifts and have been critical of Republican members' lines of questioning, which has left little time for Mayorkas to fully answer. \"Just in case there's any mystery about why you're not being allowed to answer questions or why they're not interested in your reference to data ... they're not actually interested in that,\" Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island said. \"There's a whole plan about what this hearing is about and it's about creating Fox News spots that they can use for politics,\" he said. On Wednesday, Mayorkas testified in front of the House Homeland Security Committee and was also met with aggressive questioning from Republicans who repeatedly used the word failure to describe the administration's handling of the border. Some Republicans called on the secretary to resign. It's also possible that Mayorkas will face pressure from Democrats who support lifting Title 42 and have been critical of any attempts to delay to ending the order. Progressive Democrats, including Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Veronica Escobar of Texas, are planning to hold a news conference after Mayorkas testifies Thursday afternoon.",

Ayesha Rascoe is off for Christmas. I'm Daniel Estrin in Jerusalem. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE BIDEN: Yes, even after 2,000 years, Christmas still has the power to lift us up, to bring us together, to change lives, to change the world. The Christmas story is at the heart of the Christmas - Christian faith. But the messages of hope, love, peace and joy, they're also universal. ESTRIN: That is President Biden from his Christmas address, one in which he stressed unity and universality, and that is where we will start with NPR White House correspondent Asma Khalid. Good morning, Asma. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Good morning. ESTRIN: Politico called it Biden's Merry Christmas yesterday, and he did cap the holiday with some last-minute accomplishments. Walk us through some of those like the spending bill that passed just under the wire. KHALID: Yeah. Well, that big spending bill was $1.7 trillion and Congress did indeed pass it just ahead of Christmas Eve to keep the government funded. You know, it includes some of the president's priorities such as about $45 billion to continue aiding Ukraine. I will say, though, Daniel, you know, there is no doubt that these last two years included some major laws that were passed purely along party lines only because Democrats wanted to do them - things like the big investments in climate and health care known as the Inflation Reduction Act. But there are other key pieces of legislation, like investments in infrastructure and semiconductor manufacturing, that passed because Republicans and Democrats decided to work together, and, you know, this is something that the White House has been touting. It is something that they say is central to why Joe Biden ran for president, this vision of bipartisanship. I will say, though, of course, the reality is Republicans are going to take control of the House in January, and it will likely be very difficult to pass any new legislation. ESTRIN: Well, to that point, even though the president keeps stressing unity, even as recently as his Christmas speech this past Thursday, what happens when there is divided government? KHALID: Well, Republicans in the House have already been telegraphing their plans to investigate this White House on, frankly, everything from the origins of COVID-19 to the withdrawal from Afghanistan. Some in the GOP have also been eager to investigate the president's son, Hunter Biden, for his business dealings. You know, I think that this is something that Republicans in the House are sort of eager to do at this point in time, given the way that they felt that they were put under scrutiny by Democrats these past two years. That being said, some of the experts that I've spoken with warn that there's a risk in this strategy. There's a danger in perhaps overinterpreting the results of the midterms to see this, you know, potentially backfire in two years during a general election. ESTRIN: Now, it's not just a Republican House that looms for Biden. We are expecting some movement on Biden's student loan forgiveness and Title 42, the Trump-era policy that allows the U.S. to reject asylum-seekers on public health grounds. KHALID: Yeah. So first, on student loans, that is all in limbo. It will go to the Supreme Court, who's going to hear arguments on the issue in late February. Then on Title 42, which - you know, I think we should explain to listeners is this policy that has allowed border agents to essentially more quickly turn migrants away. It was supposed to expire this past week, but a group of Republican governors wanted to keep it in place. Long story short, at the 11th hour, the Supreme Court intervened and temporarily kept the rule in place. At this point in time, it is unclear to me how long this kind of legal limbo will remain. But the expectation, even from some Democratic politicians, is that there could be a surge at the border and that the government just frankly is not equipped to deal with that. And really, they need, you know, complete immigration reform at this point. ESTRIN: We started with Joe Biden's Christmas. Let's end on it. He says he's got some deciding to do this Christmas, right? KHALID: That's right. He has said that he intends to run for president again, but he added that this is ultimately a family decision. He intends to discuss this with his family, likely over the holidays, and so I expect we will hear some news on that front in the new year. ESTRIN: Keeping us on our toes. That's Asma Khalid, NPR White House correspondent and co-host of the NPR Politics Podcast. Thanks, Asma. KHALID: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "New Yorker journalist Andrew Marantz says Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n's administration has rewritten Hungary's constitution to consolidate his power. U.S. conservatives are taking note.  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. \"Does Hungary Offer A Glimpse Of Our Authoritarian Future?\" That's the title of a New Yorker article by my guest, Andrew Marantz. He writes, quote, \"American conservatives recently hosted their flagship conference, CPAC, in Hungary, a country that experts call an autocracy. Its leader, Viktor Orban, provides a potential model of what a Trump after Trump might look like,\" unquote. Orban's administration has rewritten parts of the constitution, appointed judges who will do his bidding, created voting rules that favor Orban's party and make it hard for them to lose and has control over most media outlets. What many liberals fear is a leader who, like Trump, would be able to fire up voters through fear, racial dog whistles, Islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia and disinformation but, unlike Trump, would not only know how to weaken civic institutions and shatter norms, but would also have a strategic political plan to maintain power and pass legislation instead of spending so much time watching TV and worrying about his media profile. The next domestic conference organized by CPAC, the Conservative Political Action Conference, will be held next month in Dallas. One of the guest speakers will be Viktor Orban. Andrew Marantz previously joined us in 2019 to talk about his book, \"Antisocial: Online Extremists, Techno-Utopians, And The Hijacking Of The American Conversation.\" It was based on several years of reporting on the far-right's use of social media. We recorded the interview we're about to hear yesterday. Let's start with a clip from Tucker Carlson's Fox News show. He's expressed his admiration of Viktor Orban and Hungary. Last August, Carlson hosted his show from Budapest, Hungary, for one week while he also filmed a documentary about Hungary. Here's how Carlson opened his episode from Hungary. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT\") TUCKER CARLSON: Good evening, and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" Of the nearly 200 different countries on the face of the earth, precisely one of them has an elected leader who publicly identifies as a Western-style conservative. His name is Viktor Orban. He's the prime minister of Hungary. Hungary is a small country in the middle of Central Europe. It has no navy. It has no nuclear weapons. Its GDP is smaller than New York states'. So you wouldn't think leaders in Washington would pay a lot of attention to Hungary. But they do, obsessively. By rejecting the tenets of neoliberalism, Viktor Orban has personally offended them and enraged them. What does Viktor Orban believe? Just a few years ago, his views would have seemed moderate and conventional. He thinks families are more important than banks. He believes countries need borders. For saying these things out loud, Orban has been vilified. Left-wing NGOs have denounced him as a fascist, a destroyer of democracy. Last fall, Joe Biden suggested he's a totalitarian dictator. Official Washington despises Viktor Orban so thoroughly that many, including neocons in and around the State Department, are backing the open antisemites who are running against him in next April's elections in Hungary. We've watched all of this from the United States. And we've wondered if what we've heard could be true. So this week, we came to Hungary to see for ourselves. We sat down with Orban for a couple of long conversations, including one this morning. In a moment, we'll show you some of that. And you can make up your own mind about it. GROSS: OK. That was Tucker Carlson broadcasting his Fox News show from Budapest, Hungary. Andrew Marantz, welcome back to FRESH AIR. ANDREW MARANTZ: Thank you. Thanks for having me. GROSS: Tucker Carlson says Orban has been vilified as a fascist and a destroyer of democracy. And Carlson says he's been, you know, wrongly vilified. What is Orban's relationship to democracy? He was elected. There's still a parliament. There's still a constitution. MARANTZ: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it's kind of amazing listening to that Carlson clip. Obviously, I think he's being disingenuous there when he says that Orban is vilified for saying things like countries need borders and families are important. That's not what Orban's critics are worried about. They're worried about the things he's done in power to rig the game to keep himself in power. So he doesn't just say countries need borders. He has violated the Geneva Conventions and turned away asylum-seekers in his country. And he's then used that as a political cudgel to drum up votes. He has also done a lot more subtle things to maintain power, like tweaking election laws. As you say, he hasn't done any of this in a way that is, per se, illegal or unconstitutional. But what his critics say is that he hasn't had to do anything illegal or unconstitutional because he has simply changed the laws and changed the constitution to give him permission to do what he wants before he does it. GROSS: What's an example of how he's changed the constitution and changed the law? MARANTZ: It's really interesting and subtle. And I think this is part of why, as you said earlier, a lot of American conservatives look to him as a potential model for a Trump after Trump, because what Orban has been able to do is to kind of move slowly and technically enough and use the fine print to kind of fly under the radar of international censure, at least for a long time. So the kinds of things he would do - you know, he didn't come into office and overnight, you know, pass sweeping edicts saying, there's no more judiciary. But what he did do was he had a supermajority in parliament. His party, Fidesz, had a supermajority in parliament, which enabled them to amend the constitution. And so in their first year in power in 2010 - this is actually after Viktor Orban returned to power. He had been there once before, which we can talk about. But that was kind of before his turn toward autocracy. But when he returned to power in 2010, they started amending the constitution - some sweeping amendments, some smaller amendments. Then when that didn't give them enough latitude, they just, basically, rewrote the whole constitution. And the kinds of things they would do is, as you said, they would keep the institutions in place, but they would kind of hollow them out from the inside. So they might restructure the courts in a way that's a little bit technical, frankly, a little bit boring, so it doesn't make for good news copy. But, you know, he could do sort of court shopping, where he could push cases toward judges that were more likely to be friendly to him. And I think it maybe goes without saying that we're seeing something similar happening here where we still have a judiciary, but it's just more and more and more partisan over time. And it's less and less of a mystery which way things will come out based on the parties involved. And so it would be that kind of thing where unlike a kind of strongman or tyrant, who would just step into office and say, there is no more court, he would just kind of tweak it. Orban is a lawyer. He's very diligent. He's very patient. And so he was able to, over the last 12 years he's been in power, just sort of subtly reorganize things. I mean, another example in terms of the administration of elections would be - he still holds elections, but he has extremely gerrymandered the districts. That, again, should sound familiar to Americans. He's also done things like allowing ethnic Hungarians, people who have Hungarian ancestry but don't live within the current borders of Hungary - they might live in Romania or Bulgaria or another neighboring country. He's allowed those people to get dual citizenship so that they can vote in Hungarian elections. And those people are likely to be fans of his. They're likely to be part of his base. So he allows them to vote. And he makes it easy for them to vote. They can vote by mail. And he makes it convenient. People who are Hungarian expats, who are less likely to be sympathetic to him - you know, maybe urban intellectuals who have left Hungary under his reign - he makes it harder for them to vote. So they have to vote in person. They have to go to an embassy or a consulate. So it's - there are hundreds of rule changes like this where, again, you can't point to them and say, Hungary doesn't have elections. They do. But he's sort of changed it so it's not a level playing field. GROSS: This kind of like the definition of illiberal democracy. It looks like a democracy from the outside. There's voting. There's courts. There's a parliament. But if you look at the details, one party runs it, one man runs the party, and it's pretty authoritarian. MARANTZ: Exactly. And it doesn't have that immediate, clear, sort of slam-dunk, strongman feel to it, right? It's not like looking at Putin's Russia or, you know, even looking at Saudi Arabia or China, and, you know, you can just sort of glance at it and say, yes, this is not a democracy. The way he's done it is more subtle, and that gives him a certain amount of maneuvering room and plausible deniability such that people who want to be apologists for his regime can just deny to your face that there's anything undemocratic about it. They can say, well, what do you mean? He has elections. He's popular. He has a democratic mandate. And you just don't like the results of it. And I think you have to ignore a lot to get to that conclusion, but it's at least, on its face, somewhat plausible. GROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Andrew Marantz. He's a staff writer for The New Yorker, and his latest article is titled \"Does Hungary Offer A Glimpse Of Our Authoritarian Future?\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF VAMPIRE WEEKEND SONG, \"M79\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Andrew Marantz, a staff writer for The New Yorker. His latest article is titled \"Does Hungary Offer A Glimpse Of Our Authoritarian Future?\" So there seems to be a growing number of American conservatives, activists on the far right, Republicans who admire Orban, who will admire what he's done in Hungary, and would like to use that as a model. One of those people is Tucker Carlson, who we just heard a clip from. And Tucker Carlson said, as we heard, that Orban thinks families are more important than banks. Does that mean - when he says families are important, does that mean that Orban has passed anti-LGBTQ laws? MARANTZ: Definitely, yeah. It's a very particular kind of family that he means to protect. And when he says borders are important, I think a lot of people reasonably hear that as a dog whistle to say that he's preserving an ethnically homogenous nation. So people in Hungary will sort of come out and say these things. They will come out and say, we only believe that, you know, parents should be a man and a woman. And if you are a same-sex couple, we won't allow you to get married or adopt children. In the United States, that ship has kind of sailed - at least, I hope unless we (laughter) really start, you know, turning back the clock. But, you know, Americans can kind of gesture toward a country where these kinds of things are still - these kind of traditional - I think reactionary (laughter), in my view - values are still upheld. And they can just point to that and say, see, it's possible. You know, don't despair if you're a traditionalist, you know? We, too, can have our version of that. GROSS: In your article, you mentioned that Hungary passed a law banning sex education involving LGBTQ topics in schools. Nine months later, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed the Don't Say Gay bill banning discussion of LGBTQ issues of any sort in K-3 public schools. Coincidence? MARANTZ: I don't think it's a coincidence. And in fact, if you listen to reporting about the press secretary for Ron DeSantis, apparently - I mean, she didn't say this to me, but reportedly, she has said that when they were writing that Florida law, they were modeling it on the Hungarian law. And you could argue that the Hungarian law was modeled on the Russian law. So there are these ways in which these ideas kind of cross borders. And I think especially between Hungary and places like Florida that are really becoming laboratories for illiberalism in America, the connections are quite clear. And, you know, people will express their admiration pretty openly. I mean, J.D. Vance, who is a Senate candidate from Ohio, has openly expressed admiration for Orban's family policies. Tucker Carlson, who is obviously a leader of American conservative thought, for better or worse, has expressed admiration. So, yeah, these are open connections. And I spoke with a lot of the people who are kind of forming the connective tissue between these places. Sometimes, it's at a distance, but sometimes, it's, you know, face-to-face. I mean, arms of Orban's government have hosted Mike Pence, Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general, several former... MARANTZ: Steve Bannon. MARANTZ: Steve Bannon, yes, Milo Yiannopoulos, who I wrote about in my book. So it's a small world when you start getting down to it. And, you know, there are differences in policy. Hungary's abortion policy is very different from ours. You know, they're - not everything is a 1-to-1 comparison. But when they find something that really works, by their lights - you know, like this LGBT education stuff, by their lights, has really worked because it lights people up. It excites the base. It increases turnout. It increases division and fear and polarization. When they find something like that that works, that sort of gets replicated. That's why, you know, the sort of laboratory metaphor, I think, is useful. And in fact, when Orban spoke at CPAC Hungary, that was a metaphor he also used. He said, we have perfected the recipe here, and we want to give it out to the rest of the world's conservative parties for free. GROSS: Does Hungary have a word for wokeness? Is there a Hungarian word for wokeness... (LAUGHTER) MARANTZ: They'll say it just in English. GROSS: ...That they can use as a buzzword in the same way that Republicans are using it? MARANTZ: They will often just say woke in English. And in fact, when I was at CPAC Orlando, which happened before CPAC Budapest, there was a delegation from Budapest. And the head of the delegation gave a speech from the main stage in Orlando, and he used the word wokeness many, many times. Woke totalitarianism was another phrase he used. And so they've set up this existential battle. You know, one thing that Orban and sort of illiberal populists in that mold really, like, feel that they have to do is set up an existential battle to the death between, you know, themselves and some big enemy. And so they have to be constantly the one vanquishing the enemy. And traditionally, for Orban, it was globalism or multiculturalism as personified by someone like George Soros. These days, that's still there, but the emphasis is really on this totalitarian wokeness that is creeping through the world. And that is such a useful concept for them because it can be tied to anything you want. It can be tied to public school teachers. It can be tied to drag queen story time. It can be tied to Disney, you know, woke capitalism. You know, it's so amorphous that it can be kind of anything that you want to turn into your political foil, and that's routinely what they do. GROSS: So I want to get back again to what Tucker Carlson said. He said Orban believes that countries should have borders. So let's talk about Orban's border policies. What has Orban said about how Muslim immigrants might outnumber Christians and how Hungary would lose its Judeo-Christian identity if they continue to allow in Muslims? MARANTZ: Yes. So he came to this as his political strategy when he returned to office. So he was first in office 1998 to 2002. And back then, he really fashioned himself as a sort of centrist liberal democrat. He visited Bill Clinton in the White House, and he was part of the sort of opening up of the region, the post-Soviet bloc. And when he returned to power, he changed his tune, and he realized that he had to play the role of the kind of embattled vanquishing hero. And his strategy for doing that was to say, I alone can save Hungarians from the onslaught of immigration. And especially in 2015, when there were waves of immigration, mostly from Syria and from other parts of the Middle East, other European heads of state said, we have to let in the refugees. And Orban said, no, I'm not letting in any asylum-seekers. And even though that was against international law, he did it anyway. And so he really became known for a kind of militarized border. And that's another thing that American conservatives point to and say, see, you know, we have this sort of bleeding-heart immigration policy, but you could just do what Orban did and just close off the border. And if he can do it, why can't we? GROSS: And when you were in Hungary, trying and kind of failing to get into the CPAC conference there - they wouldn't let you in - Orban gave a speech describing Hungary as the last Christian conservative bastion of the world. And he said if other Western countries continue to implement policies like lax border control, the result would be, quote, \"the great European population replacement program, which seeks to replace the missing European children with migrants, with adults arriving from other civilizations.\" That's replacement theory. That's, like, basically, you know, a white nationalist replacement theory that also resonates in Europe. I mean, it's kind of, like, Nazi talk. MARANTZ: Yeah. Yeah, that is raw, uncut replacement theory. And that's the kind of thing that, when I was reporting my book, would have been considered a shockingly fringe viewpoint. And now, as we've watched these things become normalized, it remains shocking, but it's no longer surprising, because heads of state are saying it in Hungary, and Tucker Carlson is saying it, and members of Congress are saying it. So, yeah, that is really, really extreme stuff. It's just unfortunately become normalized. GROSS: So Viktor Orban, the increasingly authoritarian prime minister of Hungary, talks about Hungary's Judeo-Christian heritage and why it's important to, like, keep out people who don't fit with that heritage so that true Hungarians aren't replaced by people of other civilizations. When he says Judeo-Christian heritage, most of the Jews in Hungary fled or were exterminated during the Holocaust. I mean, what's really left of the Jewish population and Jewish identity in Hungary? MARANTZ: Yeah, it's kind of hard to say because of the way that assimilation and forced assimilation happened. So no one really knows, actually. But there are not as many Jews left as there clearly were before the war. And yeah, I think when Orban talks about Judeo-Christian heritage, it's pretty clear that he's mainly talking about Christian heritage, and often he will just drop the Judeo. I mean, you see this in the American context, too, where people will say Judeo-Christian values, but when push comes to shove, it's pretty clear which half of that hyphen they're emphasizing. And so he has, in other contexts, just talked about Christian democracy or Christian values. And this is another thing that, you know, one of his top advisors told me flat-out. This is a guy named Balazs Orban, who's not related to Viktor, but they have the same last name. And Balazs Orban just told me - you know, I asked him, what are American conservatives coming here hoping to find or hoping to emulate? And he said, well, look, I don't know, but I think that a big part of what they like is that here in Hungary, we can just say things like, we want to preserve our ethnically homogeneous heritage. We want to preserve Christian and white European heritage. And, you know, they can't come out and say that in an American context, but if they want to point to us saying it and have us, you know, be their voice, we're happy to do that. So, I mean, that was his view on what Americans are seeing when Orban talks about Judeo-Christian values or just Christian values. They see it as really just a code word for white European heritage. GROSS: Let's take another break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Andrew Marantz. He's a staff writer for The New Yorker, and his latest article is titled \"Does Hungary Offer A Glimpse Of Our Authoritarian Future?\" We'll be right back after a short break. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF TERENCE BLANCHARD'S \"FOOTPRINTS\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I am Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday with New Yorker staff writer Andrew Marantz about his latest article titled \"Does Hungary Offer A Glimpse Of Our Authoritarian Future?\" He writes, American conservatives recently hosted their flagship conference, CPAC, in Hungary, a country that experts call an autocracy. Its leader, Viktor Orban, provides a potential model of what a Trump after Trump might look like. Orban has used George Soros as a major target, and Soros is a Hungarian-born, Jewish financier and philanthropist. Soros is also a target of the right in the U.S. How did Soros become one of Orban's chief targets? I should mention, Soros does fund a lot of, like, liberal causes and humanitarian causes as a philanthropist. MARANTZ: Yeah. Yeah. So it is true that George Soros is a rich, international elite who funds a lot of left-leaning causes. That part of it is definitely true. The part that has been sort of spun up and exaggerated over the years is that Soros is somehow this international puppet master who controls all things, who sends surges of migrants across borders and, you know, sends protesters to, you know, protest the murder of George Floyd. I mean, the myth of George Soros has become really multichanneled over the years. But what Hungarians told me is that this was really sharpened and, in some sense, pioneered by Viktor Orban and one of his political consultants, actually an American guy, a Jewish guy from Brooklyn named Arthur Finkelstein, who had a career as an American political consultant and, you know, worked with Roger Stone and a whole bunch of names that people would know here, helped elect Ronald Reagan, helped elect Strom Thurmond, helped elect George Pataki - many, many people - and then, later in his career, went over to Israel and worked with Benjamin Netanyahu. And then, Netanyahu apparently introduced his friend Viktor Orban to this guy, Arthur Finkelstein. And according to the lore, it was Finkelstein who came up with the idea that, you know, instead of running against these big ideas, like globalism or multiculturalism or migration, Viktor Orban should run against a person, a face. And he decided to make the face of all that be George Soros. And... GROSS: Yeah, Finkelstein said, you don't attack the Nazis. You attack Adolf Hitler. MARANTZ: Exactly. Exactly. That's how you get it done. So - and in the Hungarian context, it really wasn't clear who the hate figure was going to be, right? It wasn't obvious. And it took a little bit of brainstorming. But eventually, they hit on George Soros. You know, he's perfect. He's this shadowy, rich guy who, you know, is hated on the left, hated on the right. He's Jewish, which allows you to say a lot of dog whistle-y things about him as an international puppet master without quite coming out and saying them. So yeah, they really hit that hard and, they put billboards of his kind of nefariously smiling face all over. And, you know, they had a referendum called the Stop Soros referendum. So they really, really used that as a political cudgel for many years. And it extended as far as - you know, Soros had done things. You know, he hadn't lived in Hungary for a long time, but he was still interested in propping up civic institutions there 'cause it's where he's from. And so he built this university called Central European University, which was kind of the most prestigious university in the country. And Orban basically kicked that university out. There's still a sort of vestigial presence there, but it really exists now in Vienna because the Orban regime wanted to get rid of it partly because it was a liberal arts university and partly because it was associated with George Soros. So this foil relationship really has continued to this day. GROSS: If Trump does not run for office or if he does not win a Republican primary, where we stand now is that the likely Republican candidate for president in 2024 would be Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, who is pretty far to the right. Is there any connection that you can see between DeSantis and Orban? MARANTZ: Oh, definitely, yeah. I mean, as we've discussed, the DeSantis administration in Florida has said that they patterned some of their legal strategies, some of their lawmaking, on Hungarian laws. And more broadly than that, you know, there is a way in which - yes, he is far to the right, but there's a way in which that almost doesn't capture what he's up to. Because right and left traditionally, that spectrum doesn't capture whether you just are really devoted to the rules of the game as they stand, you know? So in theory, one could be very far to the right in many ways - you know, want as little restriction on free market enterprise as possible, you know, want this or that policy outcome - but still be devoted to the rules of the road, you know, not warping constitutional norms beyond their breaking points. And I think what someone like DeSantis shows is he seems to be taking inspiration from Orban not only in terms of the policy outcomes they want, but in terms of how you get there. So, you know, not allowing for your enemies to have power if there's anything you can do within the law to restrict that power - you know, something like lashing out at Disney as a corporation, I think, would not be considered a traditionally conservative thing to do at all. That's usually - the conservatives are the ones who want to let - leave companies alone and be laissez faire. And I think it's a bit of a illiberal populist move to, you know, reach in and restrict what businesses can do. And I think you can make arguments for or against that as a general matter. But it's clearly a departure from what the Republican Party has done in the past. GROSS: Let's go back a bit. How did Hungary first become something of a model for the right in America? MARANTZ: So there is this concept of liberal democracy, which, I think, you know, is worth defining a little bit. And, you know, you mentioned the title of the piece is \"Does Hungary Offer A Glimpse Of Our Authoritarian Future?\" In print, there's a shorter title, which is \"The Illiberal Order.\" And I think this word liberalism, it gets thrown around a lot, and it can sometimes just mean liberal as opposed to conservative, you know, in our common parlance. But in political science terms, it really means something broader and deeper. It means kind of the whole post-Enlightenment tradition of freedom of speech, freedom of contract, you know, all of these sort of individual liberties. And there are philosophical and political science arguments for and against this liberal tradition. But what Hungary and Orban have done is show a way to enact illiberalism. And Orban is very clear about this being his idea of what he himself is doing, where you sort of enact it from the top down. So you don't make the argument to the voters and say we should change our basic system of government. You kind of just start doing it. So instead of saying, well, liberal norms would dictate that, you know, you put up a judicial nominee. And then you have the Senate vote on it. And then you see if they win or lose. And then you seat the nominee or don't. That would be the kind of traditional, constitutional way of doing it. The more illiberal way, or the more kind of bending-the-rules kind of way to do it, would be to say, well, if we have the power in the Senate, we will put up our judicial nominees, but we won't let the opposition party do it. And tough if you don't like it. We have the votes, and you don't. And obviously that's... GROSS: That sounds very familiar, doesn't it? MARANTZ: (Laughter) Yeah. I was wondering if that would ring a bell. So this is the kind of thing where, often, we talk in terms of future, hypothetical speculation. And that's obviously mostly the mode in which I've written and in which we are talking. But some of this stuff has already happened. And simply by virtue of the fact that it has happened, it can kind of become normalized. And it can become the water we're swimming in. But, you know, I think, to sort of mix metaphors, if the water we're swimming in is getting hotter and hotter and hotter, then, eventually, the proverbial frog gets boiled. And you don't really notice it until it's too late, sometimes. GROSS: What's in it for Orban, his party in Hungary, to have Americans like Tucker Carlson advocating for them and dittoing their views and trying to follow their playbook? MARANTZ: Oh, I think for someone like Orban, it's all upside, right? I think, one thing you hear from his chroniclers and biographers and stuff is that he has these really outsized ambitions. And he feels that he was born in too small a country. He wants to be a big player on the world stage. And he says, oh, if only I weren't born in this small country, I could be an even bigger deal. And so I think when you have people coming over and praising him, like Tucker Carlson, like Donald Trump, it just adds to his stature and his cachet. So you know, he wants to be a big deal. And, you know, American media, at least for now, remains the biggest show in town. So why would he not want to be in the spotlight? I mean, if you're an illiberal populist and you want to reinvent the liberal order, there's only so much you can do yourself. You kind of need international alliances because your project is so big. You're not just trying to hold on to power. You're trying to change the rules of how power works. And so people like Orban are always looking for allies in other places who can get their back. And he obviously wants Americans who can do that. GROSS: Well, let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Andrew Marantz. He's a staff writer for The New Yorker. And his latest article is titled \"Does Hungary Offer A Glimpse Of Our Authoritarian Future?\" That's the title online. It has a different title in the actual print hard copy. We'll be right back after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Andrew Marantz. He's a staff writer for The New Yorker. His latest article is titled \"Does Hungary Offer A Glimpse Of Our Authoritarian Future?\" I want to get back to Tucker Carlson because he has such a popular program. And he's so influential in America. And he's such an advocate of Hungary and the Orban administration. So I want to play another clip from Carlson's Fox News show as an example of how he really thinks Hungary is going in a much better direction than the United States is. And it's more of a model of what a country should be. So here's Tucker Carlson. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT\") CARLSON: Even if you understand that the American news media lie, it is always bewildering to see the extent of their dishonesty. Nothing prepares you for it. We've read many times how repressive Hungary is. Freedom House, an NGO in Washington that's funded almost exclusively by the U.S. government, describes Hungary as much less free than South Africa, with fewer civil liberties. That's not just wrong, it's insane. In fact, if you live in the United States, it is bitter to see the contrast between, say, Budapest and New York City. Let's say you lived in a big American city and you decided to loudly and publicly attack Joe Biden's policies, his policies on immigration or COVID or transgender athletes. If you kept talking like that, you would likely be silenced by Joe Biden's allies in Silicon Valley. If you kept it up, you might very well have to hire armed bodyguards. That's common in the U.S. Ask around. But it's unknown in Hungary. Opposition figures here don't worry that they will be hurt for their opinions, neither, by the way, is the Prime Minister. Orban regularly drives himself with no security. So who's freer? In what country are you more likely to lose your job for disagreeing with the ruling class' orthodoxy? The answer is pretty obvious. Though, if you're an American, it is painful to admit it, as we have discovered. GROSS: OK. That was Tucker Carlson on his Fox News show. Andrew Marantz, what's your interpretation, reading between the lines and just reading the lines, of what we just heard Tucker Carlson say? MARANTZ: Well, I'm surprised that we heard him say it at all because, you know, he said that critics of Biden's policies are routinely silenced. And yet, he is on TV every night criticizing Biden's policies, so it doesn't seem to hold up. But, yeah, I think, look; there's two things I would say. One is, it's just - you know, you can kind of feel yourself getting sucked into this very disingenuous framing, this kind of, you know, sophist, high school debate club trick where, you know, someone makes these outrageous claims that are obviously untrue. And then you sort of feel that you have to debunk them. But by the time you're doing that, you're already accepting their framing. So this was something that's very familiar to me from covering trolls and online extremists back in the day. They'll say something obviously facially untrue, like Hungary is more free than the United States because I know a guy who got criticized one time. And that - you know that's not true. But yet, you're tempted to just almost kind of move past it because you don't want to get sucked into that framing. And yet, it is important to rebuke it, so it kind of sets this impossible trap. Now, I think part of what people like Tucker Carlson are trying to do is shift the potential - what it's possible to say and think in public. So it's so absurd to think that Hungary is, in any meaningful sense, a freer country than the United States. But yet, if you use a really loud megaphone to say it over and over again, you can kind of make it a plausible thing to say just by sheer force. And that's something that we've seen Trump do and Bannon do, you know? You just kind of say something again and again. And then it becomes part of the discourse. And people can agree or disagree with it. Now, I mean, getting down to the finer points of it, it is true - I will concede Tucker's point that you can sit in a cafe in Budapest and criticize the government. And I think that's something that surprises people when they think of a classic sort of strongman dictatorship. They think of \"1984,\" where if you, you know, say anything critical, the secret police will haul you away. That is not my experience of Hungary. And it's not the experience of the people I spoke to. So it is true that he's not - Orban is not playing out of the classic autocrat playbook of the 20th century. He's reinventing the playbook. He's doing a 21st century autocracy playbook. And in many ways, that's comforting because he doesn't constantly, you know, jail or kill his dissidents. In many ways, it's disquieting because he's reinventing the format to make it more effective and more long lasting. GROSS: Yeah, just one thing I want to say about what Carlson said. He said, like, if you live in a big American city and loudly and publicly attack Biden policies on COVID, immigration, transgender athletes, you'd be attacked by Biden's Silicon Valley allies. And you'd have to hire bodyguards. In my experience, talking to a lot of people on our show and reading the newspapers and watching other media, a lot of the people who have to hire bodyguards have to do so because they've spoken out in ways that the right doesn't like, that Trump, when he was president, would speak about these individuals. And basically, Trump - you know, a lot of extremist Trump supporters would go after those individuals who disagreed with Trump. And they would have their lives threatened. They'd have their families' lives threatened. They'd sometimes have to move. So it's really, like, distorting the reality of who has to have bodyguards in the U.S. MARANTZ: Yeah. And not to mention the threats to free speech that are, you know, classic First Amendment threats, where it's actually the government imposing speech restrictions. You're much more likely to find that in states like Florida, where teachers aren't allowed to teach about racism or sex education. And that's imposed as a speech restriction by the government. So yes, I agree with you. And yet, again, you can sort of feel how being sucked into that framing, you're almost - you know, my worry, often, with this stuff is that you feel like you're getting sucked into a pre-existing food fight, you know, where, you know, one side says you're repressive. And the other side says, no, you're more repressive. And it turns into this tit for tat thing when actually, you know, I feel uncomfortable as a reporter, you know, going into a piece like this and saying, what's really bad is the Republican Party, because it feels partisan. It feels like I'm, you know, by implication, you know, sticking up for the Democratic Party, which is not something I want to do. And yet, when these overreaches are so egregious and when there are people who are saying things like, everything Orban does is perfect and the only problem people have with it is that he's standing up for families, you know, then you feel like you have to enter into the food fight a little bit because they're just being so egregiously distortive that you feel like you have to enter into that dispute even though it's uncomfortable. GROSS: And then, of course, Tucker Carlson is very influential when he praises Orban. I'm sure a lot of his listeners - viewers, I guess I should say, think, well, Orban must be great. MARANTZ: Oh, yeah. I think Tucker Carlson is the most influential person on the right these days, I think, bar none. And I think, you know, as you were saying, where things stand now, it looks like DeSantis might be a successor to Trump. I think Tucker Carlson is waiting in the wings as a possible successor as well. And... GROSS: Do you really think he might run? MARANTZ: Oh, yeah. I think he - I mean, he denies it, of course. But I think he's a more plausible candidate, in many ways, than DeSantis. I just think he has more media chops. I think he's a more talented rhetorician. And I think he's, in many ways, more fluid at coming up with new ideological combinations. And a lot of what you see when you look at - you know, that's why we called the piece \"The Illiberal Order\" in print. I actually wanted to call it The Illiberal Imagination. But the - that - I think part of what you're going to see and you're already seeing is people who are willing to experiment with radically new ideological formations, people who are willing to depart with years of precedent, both within their own political coalition and within the constitutional order itself. And I think someone like Tucker Carlson has proven himself more than willing to experiment with that. GROSS: Let's take another break here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Andrew Marantz, a staff writer for The New Yorker. His latest article is titled \"Does Hungary Offer A Glimpse Of Our Authoritarian Future?\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF RANKY TANKY SONG, \"FREEDOM\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday with Andrew Marantz, a staff writer for The New Yorker. His latest article is titled \"Does Hungary Offer A Glimpse Of Our Authoritarian Future?\" You write at the end of your piece in The New Yorker that what you're most worried about isn't Trump himself but a party that increasingly resembles Viktor Orban's party. Can you elaborate on that? MARANTZ: You know, it's very easy to get distracted by a personage like Trump. I mean, that's almost his job - right? - to be a big, flashy object that distracts us with the insane or vulgar or, you know, outrageous thing he's just said. And, you know, I think those are obviously worth paying attention to if - given his power. But I think the structures around him, the party apparatus, the media apparatus, the business relationships - you know, what he does is more important than what he says. And that's true of whoever the Trump after Trump might be. That's true of Viktor Orban. And that was really the feeling I kept having being in Hungary, is, yes, Viktor Orban is a very gifted politician, but he's not a flashy reality star in the same way. And so it's much easier to look at someone like him and say, OK, what are the structures propping him up? And what it really is, is the ability to chip away at and hollow out institutions to perpetuate your own power. And that's really what you see - I mean, I hate to say it this nakedly - but that really is what you see from the Republican Party. It's uncomfortable for me to say it, but it's true. You see, you know, just total violation of basic precedent and fairness in terms of, you know, the independence of the judiciary, you know, the way that congressional districts are drawn, the way elections are administered. You just see sort of naked power grab after naked power grab. And yes, you know, Donald Trump has his own (laughter) way of doing things, but the party that has enabled him and has, in many ways, outpaced him now is really, to me, the more worrisome thing. GROSS: Could you talk a little bit about the challenges you think you face as a journalist who always tries to stay out of the political game and not take sides but, at the same time, is seeing signs that America is moving toward authoritarianism in a manner similar to how Hungary did it and that is alarming to you? So I know this is a problem a lot of journalists are facing, seeing things that they think are very disturbing and trying to figure out how to write about it while maintaining the kind of impartiality that they want to maintain as a journalist. MARANTZ: Yeah, it's really tricky. And, look; I've never been so devoted to the norms of impartiality that I've felt that I don't have any personal views. I mean, it's - you know, obviously I'm a person, and I see the world around me. And yet there is something uncomfortable, as you say, about writing a piece where, you know, you say one party is the bad guy, and therefore, you know, I guess implicitly the other party would be the good guy. That feels - that doesn't feel like journalism. That can feel like puffery or like cheerleading. And that is an uncomfortable place to be. And yet, you know, it's just - it's hard because, you know, it's like - I've been thinking recently, like, if you're a sports journalist and you are covering a basketball game and, you know, one side's winning, one side's losing and then, you know, one team goes to the refs and says, we don't believe that three-point shots are a thing anymore, and we've never believed in the legitimacy of three-pointers, and we want you to change the score to reflect that, and if you don't, we're going to, you know, turn the table over and, you know, (laughter) show up with weapons or something - I mean, you know, at that point, you kind of have to say, there's a team that's really kind of going off the rails here. And, you know, then it raises all sorts of questions about - were we ever really a democracy? And, you know, was - were the roots of this kind of illiberal or reactionary politics kind of there to be seen all along? And I think those are really interesting academic questions, but I think the first step is just to see what is before our eyes and to say that even though these things seem so on the nose, so glaring, so kind of impossible, they are often just what is happening. And I think we have to start there, even if it feels uncomfortable, even if it feels like cheerleading, even if it feels kind of corny or, you know, makes you feel like you're in some cheesy Hollywood movie to talk about the end of American democracy. I think we just have to try to say what's in front of our faces and then take the analysis from there. GROSS: Andrew Marantz, thank you so much for talking with us and for writing the article. It's really fascinating. MARANTZ: Thank you. This was great. GROSS: Andrew Marantz is a staff writer for The New Yorker. His latest article is titled \"Does Hungary Offer A Glimpse Of Our Authoritarian Future?\" Tomorrow on FRESH AIR, Chrysta Bilton will talk about growing up the daughter of a lesbian mother who asked a man she'd just met to be her sperm donor and promise to never be a donor for anyone else. This was in the early '80s when sperm banks were relatively new. But after fathering Bilton, he made a living for years as a donor. Bilton has met many of her half-siblings. She's written a new memoir called \"Normal Family.\" I hope you'll join us.

            "article_content": "The House panel probing the Jan. 6 attack held a final hearing. Pandemic border restrictions are extended by the Supreme Court. Harvey Weinstein is found guilty of rape in a trial in Los Angeles.  A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: The U.S. has dropped many pandemic restrictions. But thanks to the Supreme Court, a pandemic rule that slows down border traffic remains in place. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: For almost three years, the United States has invoked Title 42, a public health rule that makes it easier to turn away migrants at the border. The Biden administration expected that order to expire this week. But many state governments resisted. And Chief Justice John Roberts granted their request to stop the change until he can hear the government's response. In an NPR interview, Vice President Kamala Harris said the United States is preparing for the order to end whenever it does. VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: That means, again, putting more agents on the border as appropriate so that we can manage what might be an influx. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR's Joel Rose is in El Paso, Texas, where many migrants have already arrived. Joel, the city where you're in has seen a significant rise in the number of migrants crossing the border in the last week, all in anticipation of the end of Title 42. What are the city's plans now? JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Yeah. So the city says it's moving ahead as if Title 42 is ending. At a press conference Monday afternoon, El Paso Mayor Oscar Leeser said the city is still treating this as an emergency and that it's continuing to prepare for large numbers of migrants to arrive. The mayor said he's been in touch with city officials in Juarez, Mexico, just across the border from El Paso. OSCAR LEESER: We want to make sure that we're prepared. We've heard that numbers are really big in Mexico right on Juarez. And there's probably over 20,000 over there today that are waiting for Title 42 to be lifted. ROSE: El Paso is standing up an operation center and trying to identify enough shelter beds to get people off the streets. Temperatures here are dipping below freezing at night, which is, you know, pretty cold for people who, really, only have the clothes on their back. What El Paso officials want is to get more migrants processed quickly and bus them out of town to other cities, like San Antonio and Houston, that have bigger airports and better transportation networks than El Paso so that the shelters here don't overflow. MART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah. And so - OK, so the restrictions are in place. When might we know if they're going to be lifted or extended further? ROSE: It's hard to say, you know? For now, these restrictions allow immigration authorities to quickly expel migrants at the border without giving them a chance to seek asylum. Last month, a federal judge in Washington ruled that the policy is unlawful and ordered the Biden administration to end it. But a group of Republican attorneys general from 19 states have been trying to extend Title 42. They argue that lifting it would spark even more illegal immigration at the border. And then they've taken their appeal all the way to the Supreme Court. The court yesterday, in an order from Chief Justice John Roberts, didn't say much. It only says that the lower court ruling is stayed for the moment. It doesn't lay out any kind of timetable for how long the stay will continue. However, it does ask the Justice Department for a response by 5 p.m. today. That's not a long time, which suggests that, you know, we could get a relatively quick decision on whether these Title 42 restrictions are extended or whether they're allowed to end soon, maybe even in the next few days. Still a lot of ways that could go. MART\u00cdNEZ: Looking ahead, Joel, any long-term ideas for policy around asylum-seekers? ROSE: That is also a moving target. The Biden administration is reportedly weighing some major changes to the asylum system that would restrict who can apply for asylum at the border while trying to encourage migrants to apply from outside the U.S. and not to cross the border illegally. But administration officials have not made any formal announcements yet about exactly what they are planning. And I don't expect that they will until we get, you know, some more clarity about what is next with Title 42. MART\u00cdNEZ: That's Joel Rose, covers immigration for NPR. Joel, thanks. ROSE: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MART\u00cdNEZ: The House committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol held its last hearing Monday afternoon, outlining what the public can expect from its final report. INSKEEP: The hearing fell on the second anniversary of then-President Trump's tweet calling for supporters to come to Washington to protest his election defeat. He wrote that the protest, quote, \"will be wild.\" That call to action was the heart of the committee's case against Trump for inciting an insurrection. MART\u00cdNEZ: We're going to hear from NPR's senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro. Domenico, the major headline from the hearing is the committee's unanimous referral for criminal charges against Donald Trump. So outline those for us, please. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Well, the committee is alleging that Trump obstructed an official proceeding, conspired to defraud the United States, conspired to make a false statement and assisted, aided and comforted those involved in an insurrection. More than 900 people have already been charged with crimes stemming from January 6. And the FBI says some 2,000 may have been involved. But Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland, one of the members of the committee, said Trump is the one who inspired the riot and should also face charges. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JAMIE RASKIN: Ours is not a system of justice where foot soldiers go to jail and the masterminds and ringleaders get a free pass. MONTANARO: Remember, we're talking about inspiring a mob to storm the Capitol, pressuring elections officials around the country, participating in a scheme to submit fake electors. And all of this was to overturn the election results of an election that Trump lost fair and square. It's a remarkable thing. And it's never happened before, a former U.S. president being referred for crimes to defraud the United States. And he's running again for the job. MART\u00cdNEZ: Now, much of the work of the committee is already public. But did it reveal anything new? MONTANARO: Well, there's certainly a lot of recap. And part of that is because the committee acknowledged there just are millions of people, especially Republicans, not tuning in. But yesterday, we did hear from Hope Hicks, Trump's former White House communications adviser. We hadn't heard from her before in these hearings. And Hicks pointed out in taped testimony that she told Trump that by continuing to make these false allegations of fraud, he was potentially damaging his legacy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HOPE HICKS: He said something along the lines of, you know, nobody will care about my legacy if I lose. So that won't matter. The only thing that matters is winning. MONTANARO: The bottom line is that Trump had no exit ramp from losing the election. And here's someone in his inner circle - formerly inner circle - confirming that was his mindset in those days after the 2020 election. MART\u00cdNEZ: OK. The committee also referred four Republican congressmen to the House Ethics Committee. Domenico, so, I mean, what now? What impact might all of this have? MONTANARO: Well, we'll see if the ethics committee, which is evenly split between the parties, actually pursues this. Of course, Republicans are going to be in charge of Congress next term in just a couple of weeks. You know, the four members of Congress were referred, ironically, for not complying with a congressional subpoena. They're Kevin McCarthy, the man who will be in line to be next House speaker - or wants to be. Andy Biggs of Arizona, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, and Jim Jordan of Ohio. You know, for their part, they're dismissing the referrals as partisan. But, you know, the committee wanted to talk to them because they're close to Trump. They talked to him on or before January 6. But now, any consequences for them or others involved really is in the hands of the Justice Department because at this point, the January 6 committee really is out of time. And when it comes to whether or not Trump winds up being the standard-bearer once again for the Republican Party, it's really going to come down to those Republican primary voters. And like we said, many of them just haven't been tuning in. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Thanks a lot. MONTANARO: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MART\u00cdNEZ: Disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein was found guilty of three of seven charges in his sex crimes trial in Los Angeles. INSKEEP: Three of seven. And as for the others, the jury could not reach an agreement on three charges and acquitted Weinstein on another. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR's Mandalit del Barco reports this was his second rape conviction. She joins us now. And one note, this conversation will discuss rape and assault. Mandalit, it's a split verdict. Why wasn't it a slam dunk? MANDALIT DEL BARCO, BYLINE: Well, you know, A, the jury of eight men and four women found Harvey Weinstein guilty of raping and sexually assaulting one woman. But they acquitted him on another woman completely. And after deliberating for 10 days, they couldn't come to a decision on charges related to two other women at all. And the judge declared a mistrial on those counts. You know, a case like this is very hard to win. And even though we've read so much about Harvey Weinstein in the news, despite the Pulitzer Prize-winning investigations and documentaries and feature films about him and despite the fact that he was the original villain of and kicked off the entire #MeToo movement, well, that's not what was tried in court. More than 100 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct. In court, he was called a predator and a monster who lured women to hotel rooms for his attacks. Harvey Weinstein did not take the stand. But his lawyers worked very hard to convince the jury that these were all consensual affairs, that the women had engaged in so-called transactional sex to get ahead in Hollywood. And they said that Harvey Weinstein was simply part of the casting couch culture. MART\u00cdNEZ: OK. Now, what are the victims and their lawyers saying? DEL BARCO: Well, the jury found Weinstein guilty of all three charges related to a model and actress identified only as Jane Doe. And after the verdict, she told news outlets that Weinstein forever destroyed her the night he raped her after a film festival in 2013. In a statement, she said, quote, \"I hope Weinstein never sees the outside of a prison cell during his lifetime.\" Now, another of his accusers was Jennifer Siebel Newsom, the wife of California's governor. She said in a statement that, quote, \"throughout the trial, Weinstein's lawyers used sexism, misogyny and bullying tactics to intimidate, demean and ridicule us survivors.\" Her attorney, Beth Fagan, told NPR that Newsom and another accuser she represented were disappointed that Weinstein wasn't found guilty on all counts. BETH FAGAN: Harvey Weinstein's defense team really took the approach of not defending his actions or explaining why he did what he did, but instead in attacking the women and calling them bimbos. I mean, their testimony was courageous. It was powerful. It was incredibly emotional. And the defense team's attack on them, attack on their character really exacerbated their trauma. DEL BARCO: You know, Fagan and Newsom both said the results of this trial is a reminder that society has a lot more work to do to support survivors. MART\u00cdNEZ: What happens to Harvey Weinstein now? DEL BARCO: He faces a possible sentence of 24 years in prison on top of the 23-year sentence he's already serving for his rape conviction in New York. That's something he's now appealing. On the other hand, Harvey Weinstein is 70 years old. He's not doing well physically. And he could spend the rest of his life behind bars. MART\u00cdNEZ: That's NPR's Mandalit del Barco in Los Angeles. Mandalit, thanks. DEL BARCO: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "The Atlantic's Caitlin Dickerson spent 18 months filing lawsuits for documents to put together the story of the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant families at the border.  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. \"The Secret History Of The U.S. Government's Family-Separation Policy\" is the cover story of the new issue of The Atlantic magazine. This investigative article was written by my guest, Caitlin Dickerson. The separation policy, called zero tolerance, was created during the Trump administration, mandating that parents across the southern border illegally with children be separated from their children until legal proceedings concluded and parents were either granted asylum or deported, which could take a very long time. During the Trump administration, over 5,000 children were separated from their parents with no records that would enable parents and children to be reunited. For a year and a half, Trump administration officials denied that family separation even existed. Then they said separation wasn't the goal. It was just an unfortunate result of prosecuting parents who crossed the border illegally. But Dickerson found that separating children wasn't a side effect. She says it was the intent. She writes that instead of working to reunify families after parents were prosecuted, officials worked to keep them apart for longer. Her article, titled \"We Need To Take Away Children,\" is based on the year-and-a-half investigation she conducted, which included more than 150 interviews and reviewing thousands of pages of internal government documents, some of which were turned over to her after a multiyear lawsuit. During the Trump administration, she reported on the story as it unfolded for The New York Times, where she covered immigration. She's now a staff writer for The Atlantic. Caitlin Dickerson, welcome back to FRESH AIR. Congratulations on this remarkable investigation that you've conducted. Why did you want to continue investigating the story after Biden became president and after the Trump administration policy ended? CAITLIN DICKERSON: Thank you so much, Terry. I wanted to keep going with this story of family separations because even at the conclusion of zero tolerance in the summer of 2018, there was just so much that reporters and that the public still didn't understand. It was confusing. We knew that thousands of families had been separated, but you had Trump administration officials, including the top immigration enforcement official, Kirstjen Nielsen, saying, you know, we don't have a family separation policy. It was really unlike a story that I'd ever covered before in that, you know, what the administration was saying didn't seem to line up with the facts. And the other reason I wanted to stay with the story is that so many parents and children remain separated. Hundreds of them to this day have not been reunited. GROSS: When the policy of separation was announced in the spring of 2018, it had already been underway for months. Why hadn't it been announced? And why, when journalists like you asked about it after it became obvious what was happening, why was it denied? DICKERSON: I think that the hundreds of separations that took place really in secret in 2017 were kept quiet because of the kind of unusual way in which they came about. So this idea to separate families, it was formally proposed right at the beginning of the Trump administration, but it was rejected. You might recall at the time John Kelly was the DHS secretary. He considered this idea and then said publicly that he had declined to proceed. But you still had a man named Jeff Self - he was the head of the Border Patrol in El Paso - he took it upon himself to basically pursue this idea anyway. It's one that had been floating around in the ether among border enforcement officials for many years, and many of them believed, like Self, that it was a good idea, that it was going to significantly decrease border crossings. And so his office approached DOJ officials locally in their region, and they launched what was later described as a pilot program. At the time, it was just a local effort to minimize border crossings and begin separating families as a way to do that. So when the pilot was discovered at DHS headquarters, it seemed to directly contradict John Kelly's orders. And so it seems - that seems to be the reason why when reporters asked what was going on, we didn't get a straight answer. And in fact, we were told, you know, these separations weren't happening at all. GROSS: The program in El Paso became a model for the national policy instituted during the Trump administration. And although there was family separation in that national policy and the administration denied that, you got access to a document that came out of this basically pilot program in El Paso, Texas. What did you learn from that report from the El Paso project that really contradicted everything that the administration was saying? DICKERSON: I think there were two big takeaways from the report that came out of the El Paso pilot program for me that contradicted what we were hearing from Trump administration officials and what I continued to hear in my reporting. The first was this argument you referenced earlier, that separations weren't the goal of zero tolerance. You know, simply, prosecution was the goal. That's an argument that evolved over time, that you started to hear more and more as time went on and as outrage from Democrats and Republicans grew over family separations. But it wasn't being made in the earliest days of the pilot program or in the earliest days of discussing immigration enforcement in the Trump administration. And that's very clear in this report, which uses iterations of the phrase family separation more than 10 times. And it talks about the initiative very clearly as a family separation program, one that the Border Patrol locally got approval for. You know, it talks about how in the past, basically, the agency wasn't allowed to separate families, but they felt that they'd been empowered to do so, referencing various documents they felt gave them that permission. And so they went ahead with it. And the other big contradiction I took away from that record is that, you know, in my reporting, when I would ask the officials who were responsible for and who signed off on zero tolerance, how is it that you lost track of parents and kids, how could things have gone so wrong, they said, well, we never could have anticipated all the disorganization that would follow the fact, that we wouldn't be able to keep track of relatives. And that's not true. The document states very clearly that there wasn't an adequate system in place for keeping track of parents and children. And in fact, it concludes with a single recommendation, which is that a process for doing so be developed. GROSS: So there was chaos in El Paso after the policy was instituted. That part of the lesson was not learned by the Trump administration when this policy went national. DICKERSON: That's right. And that document is just one example of many records I found that show people within the government, within various federal agencies, raising red flags around the idea of a nationwide family separation policy and saying, you know, we're going to lose track of parents and kids. You're going to have very young children and, in some cases, even infants separated. One report that I reviewed warned that, you know - future populations of U.S. orphans was the quote that it used. So these warnings were raised in many different places and to many different high-level officials, and they just weren't heeded. GROSS: The point of separating families was deterrence. Like, we're going to make things so bad that no family will cross the border because it's going to be hell for them. We're going to make it that way for them. John Kelly, before he was in the Trump administration, was stationed at the border. And when Jeh Johnson was head of the Department of Homeland Security in the Obama administration, Kelly gave Jeh Johnson the advice, like, don't bother with deterrence. It's not going to work. There are so many problems that are - there's so much violence and gangs that are driving people across the border. Nothing you're going to do is going to scare them. They're going to come across. So is that one of the reasons why Kelly was determined to reject the family separation policy - because they thought deterrence is pointless? DICKERSON: That's right. So John Kelly was our highest-ranking military official overseeing the Northern Triangle, where most migrants were traveling from to the United States, prior to joining the Trump administration. And he did feel that deterrence wasn't going to be effective because he'd become, at that point, you know, intimately familiar with the prevalence of gang violence and, really, the lack of opportunity, the lack of jobs, you know, the number of people who just didn't have enough to eat every day. As well as he talks about remittances that were sent from the United States back to Central America. All of these forces, he felt, were so strong that, you know, prosecuting people wasn't going to discourage them. And, you know, there's a second reason that he points to for opposing family separations or separations through prosecutions when he joined the Trump administration. He does say he felt immediately that it was inhumane, that, you know, it was unnecessarily cruel, and he didn't believe in it for that reason. It's not the approach that he took in opposing it. He talked about the policy's logistical failings when he pushed back against separating families under the Trump administration. And he says that he did that because he felt it would have been more effective than making a moral argument when it came to speaking to people like Donald Trump or Stephen Miller, Trump's chief immigration adviser. GROSS: Your article is titled \"We Need To Take Away Children.\" That line comes from something that then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a phone call to assistant DAs who were prosecuting people who had crossed illegally. Give us the context for that sentence in the Jeff Sessions phone call. DICKERSON: So Jeff Sessions got a lot of blame during zero tolerance and even after. Again, when I'm interviewing officials who were at very high levels in DHS, for example, a lot of them basically made this argument that Sessions made me do it. And it's kind of no surprise that so much focus was put on Sessions. He'd made a career in the Senate as being someone very hawkish on immigration who believed in harsh enforcement. And I found in my reporting that to be true. But when it came to the specifics and the details of zero tolerance and the legal authorities necessary to put it into place, those actually don't trace back to Sessions. He was someone who was embattled in the administration. You know, Donald Trump never forgave Sessions for recusing himself from the inquiry into whether there had been collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russian operatives. And so Sessions was always trying to win back the president's support. And so he would generally make these pronouncements of, you know, we've got to crack down on the border. We've got to be harsh. Sessions believed in it, but he also really wanted to win Trump's affection. And so this phone call seems to be an example of that. You know, there are several instances I document where Sessions is addressing U.S. attorneys who are saying, hey; we don't have the resources to do zero tolerance - you know, same thing that John Kelly and others argued. We don't think this is a good idea. We don't think it's going to work, and it will completely overrun our departments. And Sessions would just generally say back, we've got to do it. We've got to dig in. We've got to be harsh. And in this case, he made this comment on a phone call with each of the U.S. attorneys who are stationed on the southwestern border and said to them very clearly, we need to take away children. He felt that's what was necessary in order to discourage migration. GROSS: How did you learn about that phone call? DICKERSON: That phone call was actually documented by the Department of Justice's inspector general initially. And the quote comes from contemporaneous notes taken by several of the U.S. attorneys who were on the phone call with Sessions. The call itself was later recounted to me by several of those who were present who said to me, you know, we were trying to raise these specific concerns and specific red flags before the attorney general. He didn't seem to be hearing us. He just kept saying, in general, you need to be harsh. We need to double down. We need to take away children. GROSS: So, you know, you write that family separation wasn't a side effect of prosecuting parents who crossed the border illegally. It was the intent. And, in fact, some administration officials worked to keep families separated longer. Would you explain? DICKERSON: Yes. So yet more evidence showing that the goal for those who were pushing for zero tolerance most harshly was not just merely prosecuting parents, but also separating them from their children for significant periods of time, comes from emails that came out of one of the federal lawsuits against the government filed on behalf of separated families. In the discovery process associated with that suit, we've seen some very revealing emails. And it's actually noteworthy that, you know, I didn't get these emails in my FOIL lawsuits, that the House Judiciary Committee didn't get these emails in their inquiries. You know, they specifically point out to me - and I write this in the story - that they felt like DHS was withholding documents. And so it's worth noting that no one else had seen these emails until this discovery process began. But they show, even before zero tolerance being implemented, one deputy at ICE - his name's Matt Albence - raising a concern that he worried if certain parents were prosecuted very quickly, that perhaps they could be returned to the border patrol stations where their children were still waiting, and that the families might be reunited. And so he started to suggest ways to prevent that from happening. He said, you know, maybe we can expedite the process through which we transfer children into HHS shelters, many of which were in other states - you know, places like Michigan and New York, far from the border. Let's send those children to the shelters more quickly to make sure they're not reunited. He also proposed, after prosecution, sending parents to different border patrol stations if necessary or to ICE facilities if necessary - anything he could come up with to keep parents from being returned to the facilities where their children were waiting. And then later, once zero tolerance is in place, there's a series of emails that show Albence and other officials saying - you know, raising concerns about the fact that these reunifications were indeed happening in some cases. One quote from Albence - he said, \"we can't have this.\" He talked about contacting the head of the Customs and Border Protection Agency for support and other high-level officials trying to get anybody involved that he could to try to stop these reunifications. GROSS: Well, let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Caitlin Dickerson. She wrote The Atlantic magazine's new cover story, which is called \"We Need To Take Away Children: The Secret History Of The U.S. Government's Family-Separation Policy.\" We'll be right back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF RED HEART THE TICKER SONG, \"SLIGHTLY UNDER WATER\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Caitlin Dickerson, who wrote The Atlantic magazine's new cover story, \"We Need to Take Away Children: The Secret History Of The U.S. Government's Family-Separation Policy.\" The policy, called zero tolerance, was created during the Trump administration, mandating that parents who crossed the southern border illegally with children be separated from their children until legal proceedings concluded. Let's talk about Stephen Miller. And Stephen Miller is a really hard-line, anti-immigration extremist. He was a speechwriter and an aide to President Trump and headed up efforts to crack down on immigration. And I think he really wanted to make crossing the border - you know, policies about crossing the border as draconian as possible. You say he hired people from the anti-immigrant fringes for his Washington staff. What are some of the ideas - in addition to family separation, what are some of the ideas that came out of his office? DICKERSON: Stephen Miller came up with ideas that include Title 42, the ban imposed, actually, by the surgeon general in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Stephen Miller found that in federal statute and tried to propose that we entirely seal the border in response to much smaller and less serious public health threats - for example, outbreaks of scabies in immigration detention facilities. He proposed things like, you know, building a wall through private property and through waterways, where they could never be sustained, you know, sending National Guard troops to the border to prevent people from entering the United States at all - ideas that people who were career immigration enforcement officials said to me reflected how little he really understood about the mechanics of border enforcement, and how little he was willing to acknowledge the legal limitations that an administration faces in trying to seal the border. He was laser focused on this goal, which is not really surprising. One of the most surprising things I did take away from learning more about Stephen Miller and his role here is that, you know, he did not have a very senior role when it came to the chain of command in this administration. He was an adviser to the president. And yet, you had him ordering around cabinet secretaries, making demands of people who were running entire agencies. And they were falling in line. And I would ask - you know, so many of them would lament, you know, Miller's just constant, you know, calling them and visiting their offices and ranting and really not letting them get a word in edgewise. They were so frustrated with his demands. And I would say, you know, did you push back? Why did you allow this to happen, you know? Did you complain to the president's chief of staff or someone higher in the chain of command, knowing that in a normal administration, an adviser to the president would never be able to get away with this kind of behavior? But Miller was so revered and almost feared because of this narrative that developed around him that he was responsible for getting Donald Trump elected president. It was his speeches about immigration that carried Trump into office. And so because of that, he was very protected. People were afraid to push back against him and let him really run over them, even though they had more authority than Miller did. GROSS: Well, General John Kelly doesn't strike me as somebody who is fearful. How did he get around Kelly? DICKERSON: So John Kelly was very frustrated with Stephen Miller from his earliest days in the Trump administration. And so Miller just started going around him. He would call into DHS, you know, high-ranking people, but also lower-level bureaucrats, anybody he could find who was sympathetic to his views. He would start proposing policies. And he would basically try to convince people to offer some sort of an affirmative. Yes, I think this is a good idea. Or, yes, we'll take it under consideration. And then Miller would take that back to the White House and say, DHS is on board. DHS agrees with this. Let's go ahead. You know, John Kelly would find out about it and be incensed, not only because Miller had violated the chain of command, which Kelly, you know, as a career military officer, believes in very strongly, but also because it meant that Miller was actually using, you know, the approval or the sort of passive OK of low-level DHS officials, who had no authority to support or, you know, to turn down an idea. He was using their statements in order to go back to the White House and say, OK, we've got buy-in. We're ready to go. Let's push this forward - really violating so many structures that are designed to prevent, you know, bad policies from being put into place, policies that are not logistically feasible, that are not ethical, that are, perhaps, not even legal. GROSS: Let me reintroduce you. And then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Caitlin Dickerson. And she wrote the really in-depth cover story in The Atlantic magazine, which is called \"We Need To Take Away Children: The Secret History Of The U.S. Government's Family-Separation Policy.\" We'll talk more after we take a short break. I'm Terry Gross. And this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF ELIOT FISK'S \"ESTRELLITA\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Caitlin Dickerson, who wrote The Atlantic magazine's new cover story \"We Need To Take Away Children: The Secret History Of The U.S. Government's Family-Separation Policy.\" This policy, called zero tolerance, was created during the Trump administration, mandating that parents who crossed the southern border illegally with their children be separated from their children until legal proceedings concluded and parents were either granted asylum or deported, a process that could take a very long time. Over 5,000 children were separated from their parents during the Trump administration. There were no records linking parents with children, so they couldn't find each other. Hundreds of children have not yet been reunited with their parents. Caitlin, when the family separation policy was being implemented, it sounds like no one who came up with the policy was thinking ahead about, how will the parents and children be reunited? And who will be keeping track of that? And it sounds like agencies who had to handle the consequences of this policy weren't very well-informed. They weren't given much advance notice. Can you talk about some of the things that happened before implementation that made it obvious that this was going to be a disaster? DICKERSON: So this administration stands out from any other I've looked at in depth in the way that members of the bureaucracy, subject matter experts who are responsible for the nuts and bolts of our government functioning, were left out of really critical conversations around policy. And this is one of the starkest examples of that. You know, the decision to pursue zero tolerance and separate families on a large scale was really limited to a small number of people who had shown their fealty to the administration, had shown their undying commitment to secure the border at any cost, including separating families. And anybody who raised red flags or showed concern about this idea was just left out of the conversation. Slowly, over time, rooms that included many more people where this idea was proposed - they got smaller and smaller. You know, the number of people who were allowed to weigh in - it shrunk until you only had people who favored zero tolerance and no one who had any concerns about it. Despite that, concerns were raised among members of the bureaucracy as these early separations that occurred in the El Paso pilot program we discussed came out. And also just because rumors about the idea to separate families - those were everywhere, starting in the early months of the Trump administration based on leaks. There was always a fear at DHS and at HHS, the agency that's responsible for housing children in federal custody. There were always concerns that separating families was going to come up. And so people started to produce documents and reports pointing out all the ways in which this was not a good idea and would go wrong based on the systems that were in place at the time. One report came out of the DHS Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. They not only warned that parents and children may be lost to one another, perhaps permanently, but they also proposed very specific systems and recommendations that could have prevented this from happening. You know, they suggested that the department come up with a database, for example, where you could search. You know, if you know who and where a child is, you could find out who and where their parent was - things like this that don't seem to have been taken into consideration meaningfully based on any record that I've seen. And, you know, that could have prevented problems. GROSS: I was going to say a database seems like the most obvious thing to have when you're separating parents and children. DICKERSON: It does. And it's even more obvious when you take into account that DHS has a database for adults who are detained in federal custody. It's something that I've used in my reporting since I started covering immigration. If you have a person's last name and their date of birth and their country of origin or if you have something called their alien number - you know, a federal number that's assigned to each immigrant in federal custody - you can find out where an adult is. And so why couldn't that system simply have been expanded to include children? One of the U.S. attorneys who prosecuted zero tolerance cases is quoted in the story saying, even if we didn't have an online database to keep track of parents and children, there were many other opportunities to find ways to reunite them. You know, he suggested perhaps an Excel spreadsheet. You know, he says that 5,000 is a huge number in terms of human consequences but not when it comes to data management. That's actually rather straightforward. There are many, many ways that losing track of parents and children could have been prevented, and none of them were pursued. GROSS: You learned in the spring of 2018 that, although there was no official database that the government was keeping that would enable parents and children to find each other - that one individual in the Office of Refugee Resettlement, Jim De La Cruz, had been keeping a list of children separated from parents and was using that to track down children to try to reunify them. But he was keeping the list quiet, knowing it would be controversial. Tell us about that list and how you found out about it, how it was leaked to you. DICKERSON: So Jim De La Cruz was part of a group of federal officials who tried to come together to stop family separations from happening as soon as they heard the idea was proposed in early 2017. And then when separations began anyway, he began to track them. There was utility in this list. He used it to speak to officials at ICE and to convey information on a case-by-case basis that would help workers inside of HHS shelters track down the parents of children - you know, inconsolable and confused children they were caring for in order to hopefully be able to reunite them one day. But De La Cruz knew that he was working in a very politicized environment. He knew - it was very clear at that point that even though hundreds of separations had taken place, he had evidence of them. He was hearing the administration say officially in statements to reporters like me that these separations weren't taking place. So he knew that having this list - it seems, based on what sources have told me - he knew that it was not something that the administration was going to look kindly on. And so he kept it quiet. And in fact, when one official who had access to the list provided it to me and I corroborated it with several others who also had direct access to it, I wrote a story about it in The New York Times. And De La Cruz's boss was so upset, he asked that De La Cruz stop keeping the list. He said it made it look like DHS was doing something that it wasn't when, of course, the opposite is true. The list reflected that separations were in fact taking place even though the administration was arguing that they weren't. But De La Cruz and his colleagues pushed back. And they kept adding to it because they were determined to do anything that they could, you know, if not to stop separations from happening then to at least try to get as many of these children reunified as possible. GROSS: So it sounds like the more important goal to people involved with this family separation program at that time was to keep it a secret, as opposed to making sure there were safeguards to make sure parents and children could be reunited. DICKERSON: That's right. And, again, this stood out from my experience as a reporter. You know, usually, when you're working on a story that government officials - you know, regardless of the administration or political party - don't like, they'll either tell you, you know, no comment or they'll try to change the subject or they'll offer context that at least presents, you know, their side of the story, where they're coming from, even if they know the public isn't necessarily going to like it. It was really outside the norm to be told something that was happening wasn't happening. That is in part because officials at DHS headquarters, at least early on, didn't know about these separations that started to take place in places like El Paso. But over time, officials did know about this effort, did know that hundreds of separations had taken place, and they chose not to acknowledge it, you know, in response to questions from reporters and in response to questions from Congress. GROSS: Let me reintroduce you here. My guest is Caitlin Dickerson, who wrote The Atlantic magazine's new cover story, \"We Need To Take Away Children: The Secret History Of The U.S. Government's Family-Separation Policy.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF PATTI SMITH SONG, \"SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Caitlin Dickerson. She wrote The Atlantic magazine's new cover story, \"We Need To Take Away Children: The Secret History Of The U.S. Government's Family-Separation Policy.\" The policy, called zero tolerance, was created during the Trump administration mandating that parents who crossed the southern border illegally with children be separated from their children so the parents could be prosecuted criminally. A real turning point was in June of 2018, when ProPublica leaked an audio recording of separated children crying for their parents inside a government facility. And at that point, more than 4,000 children had been separated from their parents. We're going to play the audio that was leaked. But first, I want you to set it up for us because the audio - even if you speak Spanish, the audio isn't always that clear. So tell us what we're hearing. DICKERSON: These are children being processed in a CBP facility. They've been... GROSS: That's Customs and Border Protection. DICKERSON: Thank you. Yes. They've recently been separated from their parents, and they're crying out for help. Some are saying, I want my mom, I want my dad. I want to go with my parent or I want to go with my aunt. You know, they're asking for information. One child recites her phone number that her mother had her memorize in case something like this were to happen. And so they're basically crying out for help. GROSS: So this is from June of 2018. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: (Crying, speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: (Crying, speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: (Speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #3: (Crying, speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #3: (Speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #3: (Crying, speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: (Crying, speaking Spanish). GROSS: It's painful to hear that. DICKERSON: It is. GROSS: That was a turning point. In what way? DICKERSON: I think this audio was really significant for a couple of reasons. You know, at this point in 2018, you've been hearing the administration say over and over again, we do not have a family separation policy, that this isn't happening when it clearly was. But you also, in particular in conservative circles, have - throughout the administration, I should say - been hearing this narrative that really vilifies people who cross the border, even those who do so to seek asylum. They were described in official communications by the administration as criminal as, you know, active threats to the homeland in the United States, painting with this broad brush this entire group as really bad and scary and threatening. And then you have this audio, which, one, very clearly shows children crying out for their parents, their mothers and their fathers, which illustrates, of course, these children had been separated, but it also kind of brought back down to Earth the narrative vilifying these families. You know, when you've been hearing for many months that, you know, anybody facing border enforcement measures is, you know, a bad criminal threatening gang member, but then you hear these cries, which, of course, the cries of children are universal - there's no real difference between what a Central American migrant child sounds like crying out for their mom and, you know, an American child born here in this country sounds like. And so there was a way in which those sounds, I think, just cut through the politicized narratives and made very clear, you know, who is it that's being impacted by these policies? GROSS: So you write that that audio caused so much outrage that Republicans started worrying about losing the midterms. DICKERSON: That's right. Paul Ryan, who at the time was the Republican speaker of the House, actually said in a meeting with John Kelly, who at that point had been elevated to become President Trump's chief of staff, that if a law, you know, banning the separation of families for the purposes of deterrence wasn't passed, he felt that the Republican Party was going to really suffer in midterm elections and lose a significant number of seats. It was a moment when you had Republicans like Ted Cruz coming out and saying, you know, nobody believes that children should be taken away from their parents. Children need their parents. That tenor of that conversation has, of course, changed among Republicans. It was a rare moment of kind of universal frustration and universal cries for this policy to go away. And eventually, it did. GROSS: So after zero tolerance was officially ended, what was the policy? DICKERSON: After zero tolerance officially went away, the administration turned toward other harsh border enforcement policies to try to mitigate illegal immigration. So you may recall the migrant protection protocols, which required asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for their asylum proceedings to be handled. Then, with the rise of the coronavirus pandemic, they introduced another policy called Title 42, which really took away the legal right to access asylum, based on this argument that it was necessary to protect public safety in the United States. And then, you know, you had the separation of families stop, but it really wasn't clear what was going to happen to the thousands of kids who were still in federal custody at the time and their parents, who were either detained in most cases or had been deported. And so it wasn't until a federal court ruling that reunifications were ordered and began. GROSS: And where are we in that process now? DICKERSON: So to this day, there are hundreds of families who have not been officially reunited. The number is between 700 and a thousand, depending on whether you're talking to the ACLU and the federal government. You know, that highlights a problem that really impacts this whole story, which is that separations weren't well-documented. So the data today remains imperfect. But we do know that even among that group, there are more than 150 children whose parents still haven't even been located by the federal government. So the process of reunification has been mandated by this federal court case, and the process is underway. But it's been slow going. And even those families that have been reunited are very much still struggling today - you know, the kids as well as the parents. GROSS: You spoke to some parents earlier and more recently for this story. What did you learn directly from them about how they're doing? DICKERSON: What I hear from these families is that they've, in many ways, not really been able to move on. One father, Nazario Jacinto Carrillo, I interviewed him in 2018 when he was separated from his 5-year-old daughter, who turned 6 in federal custody. He was one of the parents who was told by officials in DHS that if he agreed to be deported, his daughter would be sent back to him in two weeks. So when we first connected, even more time had passed, and his daughter, Filomena, still wasn't home. You know, when I called him and let him know that I was going to be writing this story, I told him, at that time, that there were some families that still hadn't been reunited. And he was completely speechless. You know, I asked if Filomena looks back on her experience in the United States, and he actually tried to put her on the phone with me so that she could answer herself, but she immediately started crying just from hearing her dad talk about this. So it's hard to overstate the degree to which this experience is still present daily in the lives of the families who went through it. GROSS: What has the Biden administration been doing both in terms of trying to reunite families that have not yet been reunited? And also, how have they changed policy about families crossing the border illegally? DICKERSON: So the Biden administration has been unequivocal in its opposition to family separation. Of course, you heard President Biden, even while he was campaigning, talk about how he felt like this policy was criminal. And it's not one that they've pursued. They formed a task force to try to reunify the remaining separated families. And at this point, they've reunified at least 400 of them. Now they're getting to these more difficult cases that are just going to take longer because so much time has passed. It's hard to track people down. And those who haven't gone through the process of applying for reunification yet, in many cases, they don't have the resources to do it. They continue to push forward. You know, what you haven't seen is substantial accountability for what happened. And I asked Biden's DHS secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, about this. He said that accountability for those responsible for zero tolerance, including those who still work in the federal government, should fall to the Department of Justice. But the Department of Justice, in court cases brought by separated families, has been defending the practice. And you really see them struggling to figure out how to deal with their own increasing border crossings, you know, and not resorting to policies like family separation, but really also being on the receiving end of frustration from both progressives, who would like to see more permissive policies or more clarity in terms of who's allowed into the United States and who isn't, and then, on the Republican side, this criticism that they're being too lax. GROSS: Let's take another break here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Caitlin Dickerson. She wrote The Atlantic magazine's new cover story, which is called \"We Need To Take Away Children: The Secret History Of The U.S. Government's Family-Separation Policy.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF CHARLIE HADEN SONG, \"HE'S GONE AWAY\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Caitlin Dickerson. She wrote The Atlantic magazine's new cover story, \"We Need To Take Away Children: The Secret History Of The U.S. Government's Family-Separation Policy.\" That policy, zero tolerance, was created during the Trump administration mandating that parents who crossed the southern border illegally with children be separated from their children so the parents could be prosecuted criminally. Your article ends with you trying to reach Stephen Miller, the anti-immigration hawk who really pushed through family separation. And you couldn't reach him for a comment. You finally reached him, and he said he had run. So you really didn't get to talk with him. And then you got an explanation from one of his friends about why he didn't have time to talk with you. Tell us what you heard. DICKERSON: When I was struggling to get a hold of Stephen Miller as I reported this story, I heard from a close friend of theirs that, you know, since Miller and his wife, Katie, who'd worked for DHS and was one of the spokespeople who told me families weren't being separated when they were, you know, ever since they had children, they had just kind of fallen off the map socially. People were having a hard time getting a hold of them because they were so focused on being parents. And Miller actually gave me that explanation or a version of it as well at one point when I got him on the phone. And he quickly said he had to run and sent me a text and said, you know, sorry, I'm with our little one. I included that detail as well as the fact that throughout my interviews, you know, really countless of these officials, invoked their own children in our conversations casually, you know, by saying, you know, can we schedule this interview around, you know, a soccer game that my kid has or, you know, can I call you back? I have to go pick them up from school. I included that because we'd be having these conversations about a policy that that obviously has lifelong consequences for the children impacted by it. And a lot of times, these officials seemed to kind of disassociate from those consequences. You know, people were described as data points or they were described as, you know, being in opposition to this administration and its goals and its promises to voters. And then they would turn and talk about their own children in, of course, entirely different terms. And it just seemed that they weren't able to make the very clear connection between the two groups. And so I included that to point that out. I think that that disassociation between officials' own children and children crossing the border was really critical here in how this policy came to be. GROSS: You think that this story of the family separation policy and how it was implemented and the chaos that happened and how people signed off on it without really understanding what the consequences would be, you think that this should be studied by organizational psychologists and moral philosophers. Why? DICKERSON: Because it's no surprise that, you know, people like Stephen Miller or Jeff Sessions, you know, who made careers arguing for harsh enforcement policies, proposed zero tolerance and other policies like it, what was surprising here was the number of people I interviewed who to this day say they opposed separating families, that they had grave concerns about it and didn't believe in it. And yet they were responsible. You know, it was their job as members of the bureaucracy who are subject matter experts, who had, you know, moral concerns, as well as very clear concerns based on their own expertise, to point out why this policy wasn't a good idea, wasn't going to be effective, that the government wasn't prepared to put it into place, and they didn't do so. They offered a variety of explanations. You know, they would say that it wouldn't have been strategic for me to raise concerns in front of Stephen Miller because he was so influential. I couldn't alienate myself in front of him. Or they would say, you know, I figured this idea was so outlandish and ridiculous that it would never be put into place, and so I didn't spend a whole lot of time on it as a result of that. You know, this sort of tacit allowing of this policy to proceed all the way to the point of implementation, that was enabled by a lot of people who really don't seem to have understood, at least at the time, how much they were doing to allow it to happen. And that, to me, feels like it has a much broader lesson for all of us. GROSS: Caitlin Dickerson, thank you so much for speaking with us. And thank you for this incredible piece of reporting.

You know, some of the weird knock-on effects is that passenger rail service - Amtrak - has shut down most of its cross-country service and track employees aren't going to strike. But outside of the Northeast Corridor, that busy rail corridor between Boston and Washington, Amtrak trains run on tracks owned and operated by the big freight railroads. Freight railroad workers go on strike, those tracks will be closed to passenger service. So and track is pausing the long routes now to keep from stranding passengers later if there's a strike. Lots of shipments are starting to taper already - hazardous chemicals, especially, new cars, intermodal service. Some grain shipments could stop today. INSKEEP: Yeah. I guess you wouldn't want hazardous chemicals sitting out in the middle of nowhere for an undetermined amount of time. But how else... MORRIS: Nor anything valuable. INSKEEP: Yeah. How else are companies preparing? MORRIS: Well, I mean, this is not going to be an easy thing to gulp down. Trains carry about 28% of the stuff moving around the country on any given day. So you stop that, and suddenly power plants stop getting deliveries of coal to generate electricity. Trains full of imported goods aren't making it inland from the coasts. Factories aren't getting parts, raw materials and packaging. That said, Lee Sanders with the American Bakers Association says that after the pandemic-related shortages and supply chain problems over the last 2 1/2 years, U.S. companies have learned to keep more supplies on hand. LEE SANDERS: So instead of having just in time, now you have to really prepare for just in case. And this is another just-in-case situation. INSKEEP: OK. So some companies may be ready if there's a disruption of days or weeks or who knows how long. But why is it that railroad workers would be talking of a strike now? MORRIS: The impasse, Steve, is primarily over work rules that govern locomotive engineers and conductors, the two-person crews that operate every cross-country freight train. Conductors and engineers feel like they've been jacked around for years. Railroad companies can keep them on call for weeks on end. Michael Lindsey is an engineer for Union Pacific, and he says that working for the railroad, it's impossible to have a life. MICHAEL LINDSEY: You can't even make a dentist appointment or a doctor's appointment. You don't know when you're going to be working. And then when you're gone, you're gone 36 to 48 hours at a time. MORRIS: Lindsey says it's gotten worse in recent years. He says now 90-hour workweeks aren't uncommon. INSKEEP: Wow. So they're struggling with the same work-life balance as many Americans, except this is an extreme, extreme example. MORRIS: Yeah. INSKEEP: Are the railroads offering to make any changes? MORRIS: So, Steve, the offer on the table was developed by a board appointed by President Joe Biden, and it does include a big pay hike, 24%. Most of the unions representing rail workers have tentatively signed off on that deal, but it doesn't address work rules. So conductors and engineers are saying no. If they strike, the other unions would support them. And the president of the two unions have been summoned to the Labor Department today to meet with Secretary Marty Walsh. Biden's talking about using emergency powers to keep certain essential goods moving in the event of a strike and working with other types of shippers - trucking, shipping and airfreight - to find workarounds. He personally called the unions and railroads Monday, and Congress could, and probably would, force railroad employees back to work. Lawmakers have to agree on the new terms of the contract, and the easiest thing to do would be for them to adopt the recommendations from Biden's committee, which would not please locomotive engineers and conductors. INSKEEP: Frank Morris, thanks so much. MORRIS: Thank you, Steve. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: Rarely, if ever, has a possible presidential candidate faced so many investigations for his past conduct. MART\u00cdNEZ: The Justice Department is in court over the federal documents recovered from Trump's Florida residence, and it's also still investigating the former president's bid to stay in office by overturning his election defeat. A House committee plans fresh hearings in its own investigation. And all this happens while Trump talks of a possible third bid for the presidency in 2024. INSKEEP: NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is thinking through Trump's possible future. Mara, good morning. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: What still makes Trump the leading Republican contender despite or, maybe I should say, because of the investigations? LIASSON: He has an intensely loyal base of supporters. And this is the real challenge for Republicans. Many Republicans in the party establishment would like to move on from Donald Trump. They try not to talk about him. They don't want to alienate Trump's base, which is the base of the party. And Trump has convinced large numbers of Republican voters to believe the lie that he actually won in 2020 when he lost, that the election was stolen, even though that claim has been thoroughly debunked. We have seen his base get more energized and more intense the more the pressure is from the Department of Justice on Trump. But that is not broadening his support. Our recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found that, yes, a majority of Republicans want Trump to run again, even if he's charged with a crime. But among independent voters, two-thirds of them say he shouldn't run again under any circumstances. So even if he's using these investigations to paint himself as a victim for his base, he's not convincing the broader public. And that has always been the dilemma for Republicans because he energizes his supporters as well as his opponents. INSKEEP: I feel we need to underline a couple of things here. First, when people say half the country is for Trump and half against, that's just completely false. It's a relatively small minority of people that remained intensely loyal to Trump. LIASSON: Well, yes, but in a matchup between Trump and Biden, he still polls very, very competitively. INSKEEP: OK. And then the next thing to underline - when you say independent voters, these are normally thought of as somewhat conservative-leaning voters that Republicans would generally get a lot of and would need. These are people who've turned against Trump. Is that right? LIASSON: Yes, at least when they're asked the question, do you want him to run again? INSKEEP: So how is Trump defending himself? LIASSON: Well, he always comes back to the idea that there's a witch hunt against him, no matter what the facts are - from the Russia investigation, his first impeachment, over withholding defense funding for from Ukraine for political purposes, now to the January 6th committee and the Mar-a-Lago document search. In this case, he's arguing that former presidents, or that he, should have special privileges. And the Department of Justice is arguing against the idea that former presidents should be above the law on handling and accessing classified documents, documents that deal with national security. And we are seeing a familiar modus operandi here where a lot of the claims that Trump has made, like these documents were planted or that he declassified them, are not being made by his lawyers in court. Just like when he said the 2020 election was stolen, there were a lot of things he said in front of the television cameras that were not said before a judge under penalty of perjury. INSKEEP: In a few seconds, would he insulate himself if he did declare for the presidency in 2024 and did it soon? LIASSON: Well, that's possible. The Department of Justice has some pretty big decisions to make. Should they go after a former president? Should they go after someone who might be a presidential candidate? But politically, Democrats would like Trump to declare his candidacy for 2024 as soon as possible because they think that helps them in the midterms. It changes the conversation from inflation to Donald Trump. INSKEEP: NPR's Mara Liasson. Thanks so much. LIASSON: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: A far-right party with roots in neo-Nazi groups is expected to play a central role in Sweden's next coalition government. MART\u00cdNEZ: The Sweden Democrats have grown more influential in recent years after it moderated some of its positions and expelled some of its extremist members. Its anti-immigration, tough-on-crime platform resonated with Swedish voters in Sunday's election. INSKEEP: Charlie Duxbury is the Stockholm correspondent for Politico Europe and joins us. Welcome. CHARLIE DUXBURY: Good morning. INSKEEP: I just heard A say they moderated their positions. What did they stand for in the past, and what do they stand for now? DUXBURY: Yeah. So the Sweden Democrats do have roots in neo-Nazi groups of the late '80s, early '90s in Sweden. In the years since, they've kind of clean things up and moved more towards the mainstream. But they still stand for a very hard line on immigration and a hard line on law and order. And that's what seems to have attracted voters in Sunday's vote. INSKEEP: Hasn't Sweden welcomed a relatively large number of refugees from the Middle East and elsewhere in recent years? DUXBURY: That's right. During Europe's migration crisis from 2015 onwards, Sweden took a relatively large number of those asylum seekers, and the government at the time, social democratic government, was relatively welcoming in the same way that Germany was, and tens of thousands of asylum seekers arrived in Sweden. Since then, there's been a kind of backlash in - among some groups, particularly the Sweden Democrats, who've said that that was a mistake and that the integration of immigrants since then has been a failure. INSKEEP: Well, what does it mean that they did so well in Sunday's election? And how much influence do they now have? They wouldn't be leading the coalition, I guess. DUXBURY: No. So the count's still ongoing. We should have a final result by this evening. What's expected to happen is that the center-right moderate party will lead the government but will lean heavily on the Sweden Democrats, who achieved a score of about 20% of the vote on Sunday. And the Sweden Democrats will be under pressure from their own voters to show that they can deliver on some quite ambitious campaign pledges to cut down on immigration, to increase policing powers in sentencing in the courts in Sweden. So that will be a closely watched discussion over the days and weeks to come. INSKEEP: Is the center-right party that seems likely to lead the coalition in a position where they would essentially have to do what the Sweden Democrats demand on their particular issues to keep the coalition together? DUXBURY: They'll certainly have to offer some serious concessions to the Sweden Democrats to hold this loose coalition together. They may decide to offer them ministerial positions. They may decide to try and run a minority government with the Sweden Democrats outside. But either way, the Sweden Democrats are going to demand serious influence over the government in the four-year mandate period to come, and they will have to show the voters that they've achieved that. INSKEEP: Charlie Duxbury, correspondent for Politico Europe in Stockholm, thanks so much. DUXBURY: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Moscow cut off all energy supplies to Poland and Bulgaria. A federal judge blocks Title 42, a pandemic immigration policy, from being rolled back. New economic data is released Thursday morning.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Russia cut off gas supplies to two European countries, and the head of the European Commission says she got the message that sends the rest of Europe. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) URSULA VON DER LEYEN: It comes as no surprise that the Kremlin uses fossil fuels to try to blackmail us. AMART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: Ursula von der Leyen spoke after Russia cut gas to Poland and Bulgaria. Russia is responding to economic sanctions by the U.S. and its allies. It has not yet cut off gas to countries like Germany that use a lot more of it. Russia itself depends on the profits to pay for its war in Ukraine. INSKEEP: NPR international affairs correspondent Jackie Northam joins us. Jackie, good morning. JACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: So we just heard this called blackmail. How is Russia describing the gas cutoff? NORTHAM: Well, they say it's justified. A few weeks ago, it began insisting that Europe pay for natural gas with rubles. And by doing that, instead of paying with the usual dollars or euros, you know, it would undermine sanctions that Europe has imposed on Russia. And Poland and Bulgaria, you know, they refused when their bill came due, and so they were cut off. I spoke with an analyst, and he said, you know, these are easy targets because even though Bulgaria and Poland depend on Russian natural gas, they're not huge customers, not like, say, Germany. And both countries have some gas stored up now. But I talked with an energy analyst named James Waddell, and he's the head of European Gas at the London-based analysis group Energy Aspects. And here's what he had to say about what's important about Russia's move. JAMES WADDELL: It does show that Russia is willing to halt supplies if people don't subscribe to the new payment system. It is a warning shot for other, bigger buyers in Western Europe that, you know, they are willing to carry out their threat. NORTHAM: So, Steve, this is about, you know, Russia raising the specter of a European energy shortage and, you know, all the high prices and the economic slowdown that that could bring, even if it could cost Russia, too. INSKEEP: Well, yeah, let's talk about that. When the U.S. and its allies imposed sanctions on Russia, there was a lot of concern there would actually be some blowback, some harm to the people imposing the sanctions. Could it harm Russia to impose this blackout on gas supplies? NORTHAM: It could, sure. I mean, energy is Russia's biggest export. Natural gas sales to Europe bring in about $400 million a day. So it's an important part of the Russian economy, and Russia needs to sell gas. But it also makes customers start to doubt the reliability of Russia, you know, as a reliable supplier of natural gas. Russia could try to find new customers, like China, but in the past, China has really hammered out low prices for any Russian crude. Now it could ask for more control over production, just to make sure that it's never cut off, which is, you know, what Russia's threatening to do with Europe now. INSKEEP: What are Europe's options? NORTHAM: Well, there's some talk that European gas companies may try to find a workaround, see if they can figure out some sort of exemption. But the European Commission is really pushing that Europe remain on board and refuse to pay in rubles. Countries like Poland are trying to line up new sources. They've been actually trying to do that for a while now, to get other ways of getting gas in there. Countries like Germany say they're going to step up and diversify their sources of natural gas, but that's not going to happen overnight. So we'll just have to see what Russia is going to do. If - you know, if Germany's bill comes due and it doesn't pay in rubles, let's just wait and see what Russia does. INSKEEP: NPR's Jackie Northam. Thanks so much. NORTHAM: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: President Biden would like to end the application of a pandemic policy at the southern border. MART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah, it's known as Title 42, the public health order that's blocked many migrants at the border during the pandemic. The administration says it should be lifted, though many people have been waiting to get in. Republican-led states have resisted, and a judge has temporarily blocked the administration's move in three states. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy blasted the White House's plan to end the policy during a visit to Border Patrol agents in Texas this week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KEVIN MCCARTHY: If Title 42 is lifted, it will be much worse. It's not just unsustainable now; it'll be uncontrollable then. And if a Democrat believes it should be lifted, come here. INSKEEP: Some Democratic lawmakers have been reluctant to lift Title 42. NPR's Deepa Shivaram joins us now. Good morning. DEEPA SHIVARAM, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: OK, so you're talking with us today because Alejandro Mayorkas, the head of Homeland Security, is supposed to take questions before Congress. What is he expected to say in defense of the administration's attempted move? SHIVARAM: Right. So DHS secretary testified on Capitol Hill yesterday, and today he's in front of the House Judiciary Committee, which is known for its pretty heated partisan debates. So today we're likely to get even more of a partisan divide in questioning from Democrats and Republicans. Jim Jordan, the lead Republican on the committee, wants Mayorkas to focus on data of border crossings since Biden took office, and he wants answers from the secretary on the administration's plans to handle the border once Title 42 is set to lift, and that day is supposed to be on May 23. And his questioning is likely to fall in line with what we heard yesterday from Republicans, who repeatedly used the word failure to describe the border. And some have even been calling on Mayorkas to resign. But on his end, Mayorkas has put out more detail on how DHS will handle the influx of migrants at the border, and he's also talking about increasing their capacity to process new arrivals and adding law enforcement officials on the border. And he said yesterday that the administration has been, quote, \"effectively\" handling the border. But he's kind of in a position now where it's really hard to explain away the policy of all of this stuff from the administration when the political division has been so loud. INSKEEP: Well, it's not hard to imagine if Title 42 is lifted and if there is any kind of rush or any kind of chaos, anything out of the ordinary, that it would dominate cable TV news for quite some time in the middle of a midterm election year. How is the politics affecting this? SHIVARAM: Right. So things have gotten pretty complicated in the last few weeks for Democrats. More moderate members of the party have been calling on Title 42 to be extended and saying that the White House's plan so far isn't sufficient. But meanwhile, immigration advocates are sounding the alarm on the risks of a lukewarm approach to Title 42. They say that Democrats standing up to Republicans on issues of immigration and supporting asylum-seekers is what helped them win elections in 2018 and in 2020. Here's what Vanessa Cardenas, the deputy director of America's Voice, said to me earlier this week. VANESSA CARDENAS: In an election year where margins matter, Latino voters and other voters who care about this issue are going to be profoundly disappointed. SHIVARAM: And she added that the party could lose some of its base voters, and backing away from the message now could be detrimental for the party in November. INSKEEP: The date the administration is looking at to lift Title 42 is May 23. Is that a real date? SHIVARAM: Right. So May 23 is the day to keep in mind right now because that's the deadline that the CDC has set. But we're waiting to see what a federal judge's ruling could do to change that. And there's a potential here for Congress to act legislatively with some of these other bills coming up, where they could slip Title 42 in for a vote. INSKEEP: Deepa, thanks so much. SHIVARAM: Thank you. INSKEEP: NPR's Deepa Shivaram. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) INSKEEP: You know, the U.S. economy has a lot going for it, but you wouldn't know that from GDP numbers coming out this morning. MART\u00cdNEZ: Now, the Commerce Department is expected to report slower growth in the first three months of the year, maybe even a contraction. Is that as bad as it sounds? INSKEEP: NPR's Scott Horsley joins us now. Scott, good morning. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: How bad are today's numbers likely to be? HORSLEY: If you just looked at today's report card, you might think the economy had fallen into a ditch. Forecasters expect to see little or no growth in GDP, maybe even a decline for January, February and March, which is a big letdown after the sharpest growth in decades last year. But economists say that's not as worrisome as it might sound. The first-quarter slump is mainly due to some technical factors involving trade and business stockpiles. If you look deeper at how consumers and businesses are doing, it's actually pretty good. Certainly, the omicron current wave of coronavirus infections did drag on the economy in the early weeks of the year, but Ben Herzon, who's a senior economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, thinks we're in for a much more upbeat spring and summer. BEN HERZON: People are taking their masks off. People are getting back to consuming the services they were consuming before the pandemic. And that's a pretty powerful push that will help to propel consumer spending and GDP, broadly, higher into the second half of this year. HORSLEY: You can see that people are eating out more. They're buying more airline tickets. Also, the job market is very strong. Unemployment's low. Wages are rising. Certainly there are challenges for the economy, but overall, it's proven to be surprisingly resilient. INSKEEP: What about inflation, though? HORSLEY: Yeah, that's one of the big challenges, and it's a big reason that many people say they're gloomy about the economic outlook, even if they're still spending pretty freely. You know, there's a nonprofit business-mentoring service called SCORE that just did a big survey of small-business owners. They found more than half are raising their prices on average by about 11%. I talked to a business owner named Becky Rawls-Riley in Olathe, Kan. Her company sells hats and head wraps that are popular with motorcyclists and gardeners. She had to raise her prices a bit this year because she's paying her workers more and because her materials cost more. But so far, she says, sales have held up pretty well. BECKY RAWLS-RILEY: When we talk about inflation impact in our business, there are some who will buy, who will buy, who will buy. If you wear a hat, you wear a hat, you wear a hat. Headbands - same thing. Some are watching their pennies. HORSLEY: This past weekend, Rawls-Riley had a sales booth at the Tulip Festival in Wamego, Kan. She's glad to see more of those festivals are back in business this year. Typically, she travels to craft fairs in seven states, but she does say she might cut back a little bit on the most distant travel because of the high cost of gas and hotels. INSKEEP: Did you pick up a head wrap when you were talking with her, Scott? HORSLEY: (Laughter) I did not. INSKEEP: Oh, OK, well, you can do that a little bit later. Now, the Federal Reserve has started raising interest rates. How does that affect everything? HORSLEY: Well, it's already having an impact on the housing market. Mortgage rates have now topped 5%, and that is going to be a drag on home sales in the months to come. The Fed raised rates by a quarter percentage point last month. It's expected to follow up with another half-point rate hike this coming week and more interest rates to follow after that. What the central bank is trying to do here is engineer a so-called soft landing - that is, slow the economy just enough to cool inflation without tipping it into a recession. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged last week that won't be easy or straightforward. One thing that should help, though - many Americans are still sitting on a lot of extra savings, money they didn't spend during the pandemic, and that's money that could help cushion the fallout from inflation and prop up spending in the months to come. INSKEEP: Scott, thanks so much. HORSLEY: You're welcome. INSKEEP: NPR's Scott Horsley. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Georgia's next U.S. Senator will be the incumbent or a former NFL player. Both men are Black. The race pits the Black church's legacy of social justice against the white conservative evangelical vote.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: On the surface, the Georgia Senate runoff is a race between incumbent Raphael Warnock and former NFL superstar Herschel Walker. But these two Black men have come to represent two very different religious traditions - the civil rights legacy of the Black church and a growing movement of mostly white Christian nationalism. NPR's Sandhya Dirks reports. SANDHYA DIRKS, BYLINE: The first sermon Reverend Raphael Warnock gave after his 2020 election as Georgia's first Black U.S. senator was about God's victory over violence. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RAPHAEL WARNOCK: We have to resist the violence of prejudice and fear and bigotry. DIRKS: In the wake of January 6, it made sense to talk about rising political violence on the right. But that wasn't all. Warnock, the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.'s pulpit, preached about King's final unfinished work - his 1968 Poor People's Campaign. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WARNOCK: And the minimum wage has less purchasing power in 2020 than the minimum wage had in 1968. That is a kind of violence that crushes on the humanity of poor people. DIRKS: This is a kind of liberatory theology that sees freedom from systems of oppression as part of the work of God's people. It has a long history in the Black church, says Anthea Butler, the chair of religious studies at the University of Pennsylvania. ANTHEA BUTLER: African Americans are thinking about Jesus bringing justice, about a God of justice, a God of mercy, a God that looks out for those who have been downtrodden, and that's from slavery on forward. DIRKS: Butler says on the other hand, white evangelicals are often more focused on an individual relationship with God. That's reflected in specific language Herschel Walker has been using on the campaign trail. He talks about overcoming his mental health struggles through God's redemption and personal salvation. These are signals to evangelicals that he's one of them. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANTHONY GEORGE: Lord, we know that this is a battle he's facing. DIRKS: The morning after an ex-girlfriend of Walker's came forward with a story that he had pressured and paid for her abortion - an accusation Walker's denied - a prayer circle gathered around him. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GEORGE: It's more vicious than any sports field he's ever played on. UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: Amen. DIRKS: This is the language of evangelicalism. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GEORGE: We call forth your ministering angels. (CROSSTALK) GEORGE: And we ask you to rebuke the devil. UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: Amen. DIRKS: Daniel Darling, a pastor and director at the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, says evangelicals have always been called to help the most vulnerable. DANIEL DARLING: We're trying to share the good news of the gospel - that Jesus saves sinners, that he's rescuing sinners, that he changes lives. DIRKS: Darling knows that Southern Baptists have a racist history. The denomination began as the church of slaveholders. But they've made moves in recent years to apologize and confront the past. And he says just look at this political race. DARLING: You have a contest between two African American men in a state in the Deep South. I think this is a real sign of progress in our country. DIRKS: But Anthea Butler of the University of Pennsylvania says it's really an illusion of progress. BUTLER: It allows them to not think that they are racist. That is the whole point of Herschel Walker. DIRKS: She points to white evangelical support even in the face of scandals surrounding Walker. BUTLER: But in reality, what they're doing is supporting the stereotype that they have of a Black man in their mind. DIRKS: If the history of slavery and Jim Crow is what shapes the theology of Black church, that more individualistic-based evangelical ideology is also shaped by that history, says Public Religion Research Institute's Robert Jones. ROBERT JONES: The way that I think many white Christians have made peace with really white supremacy, racial domination, segregation, slavery was to just narrow the Christian concern to my own personal relationship with Jesus. DIRKS: That personal relationship can be incredibly powerful and not just for white folks. It was for Bradley Onishi, who was born again when he was 14. He left the evangelical church in his 20s. He's now a professor of religious studies at San Francisco State. And he says he's seeing more evangelicals outwardly embrace the idea that America should be a Christian nation, that... BRADLEY ONISHI: The country should be ordered in a way that white Christians are on top of the social, political and cultural hierarchies. DIRKS: Christian nationalism, Onishi says, is a new name for an old phenomenon. It's a vision with white men at the top - no trans people, no gay people and people of color but only in service of white supremacy, Onishi says. At the same time, as white evangelical Republicans have embraced Herschel Walker, campaign ads and messaging paint Raphael Warnock as not a real Christian. ONISHI: He represents somebody who's talking about collective change and systemic racism. Well, that would upset the order. DIRKS: Pastor Daniel Darling says it's wrong to question Warnock's Christianity, but his political record does conflict with core evangelical beliefs. DARLING: A lot of the conservative evangelicals or conservative voters might look at him and say, you know, the positions he's taken on the sanctity of life and other issues seem to conflict with my understanding of scripture. So I think that is a fair assessment. DIRKS: It's not just Warnock's support for abortion rights, Darling says. Evangelicals prize religious freedom. They want to be able to support and uplift the families and lifestyles that fit their longstanding historical definition of family and morality. Reverend Jaqui Lewis, pastor at the progressive, intentionally diverse Middle Church in New York, says the problem isn't with the freedom to practice personal beliefs. The problem is when people want to force those beliefs onto others. JAQUI LEWIS: It is insisting on its own way. White Christian fascism believes it is chosen to dominate the world. DIRKS: What's different now, Lewis says, is the right, and white Christian nationalists have incorporated diversity. LEWIS: And the story that we're being asked to adopt as true is white power matters. And a Black senator might be elected to maintain white power.

Katelyn Diaz thinks it's time for the GOP to take notice of its young members. \"There's people who don't want to pass on the microphone or the torch,\" said Diaz, a sophomore at University of California Irvine. \"But I see young people in the Republican Party rising up more and more.\" In 2018 and 2020, young people turned out to vote in historically high numbers, helping Democrats cement a power trifecta in Washington. Diaz hopes her cohort turns out to vote this cycle in numbers that will enable Republicans to retake control of Congress. Still, Diaz has found people often assume she supports Democrats. \"When people find out I'm pro-life, they're very shocked,\" she said. \"I've had people dumbfounded, because I'm a woman of color, disabled \u2014 they expect me to have certain political views and I don't have those political views.\" It's important to bust a myth that all young people under 30 are liberal. Abby Kiesa, Deputy Director at CIRCLE of Tufts University Abby Kiesa, Deputy Director at CIRCLE, a Tufts University research group focused on youth political engagement, says that misconception is common. \"It's important to bust a myth that all young people under 30 are liberal,\" she explained, noting that in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, more than a third of young people voted for Donald Trump. \"One of the things that is important when we think about electoral participation is that young people who are Republicans are less likely to be contacted by a campaign or by their party than young people who are Democrats,\" Kiesa said. She said outreach not only conveys important information but can help young voters feel a part of something bigger \u2014 and that ignoring the power of young voters imperils political parties. \"You're leaving millions of votes on the table if you're not paying attention to young people,\" Kiesa said. NPR spoke with some first-time voters across the country who are planning to support Republican candidates in the midterm elections. Connor Gibson looks forward to casting his ballot for Republicans on Tuesday. \"I want leaders that are going to try and attempt to reach out to young people and understand our needs and our concerns,\" he said.\n                \n                    \n                    Melany Hodges\n                    \n                \nhide caption Connor Gibson looks forward to casting his ballot for Republicans on Tuesday. \"I want leaders that are going to try and attempt to reach out to young people and understand our needs and our concerns,\" he said. Gibson says he's been interested in politics from a \"really young age,\" admiring political figures like Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. He's already seen the power of people coming together to affect change, pointing to Mississippi lawmakers voting to remove the Confederate battle emblem from the state flag. \"Having that old state flag with the Confederate battle emblem on it did not serve the purpose of having a unifying banner for all Mississippians,\" Gibson, who is passionate about the issue, told NPR. \"Having something that young people can proudly display in their college dorm rooms and on their flag poles was very important to me,\" Gibson added. \"It was just very important for me as a young person knowing that one day I'm going to have children and grandchildren in the state, wanting them to have something they can be proud of.\" Director of Collections Nan Prince pulls out the Mississippi flag from the state's capitol on Sept. 25, 2020.

Gibson is currently finishing up his term as chairman of the Mississippi Teenage Republicans. The group garnered some national attention last year, after state chapters denounced QAnon and conspiracy theories. \"Conspiracy theories, like QAnon, harm the Republican Party's ability to reach out to new voters and isolate our base,\" the statement read. The next generation will save this country.  Good work. https://t.co/c8NpfATjKs Republican Reps. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., and Jaime Herrera Beutler praised the stance; former Florida Gov.

Connor Gibson It came shortly after another statement from the group on Jan. 6, 2021, condemning the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol. \"I was floored,\" Gibson remembered. \"How could you not be floored when you see thousands of people converging on the Capitol in what was a violent raid?\" \"One thing that stuck out to me on that day was I was helping a neighbor put her Christmas tree up in her attic and she was laughing,\" he recalled, shaking his head. \"She was laughing about - justifying what was happening and I don't think that there is any doubt in my mind that what happened on Jan. 6 was nothing short of disgraceful and disgusting, regardless of how you feel about the election.\" Gibson, who would like to see former Vice President Mike Pence or South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott run for president in 2024, is concerned \"the extremes have taken over.\" The views he expressed to NPR are his own and not that of his organization. \"Not in the sense of in numbers but in rhetoric, and it really overshadows a lot of policy discussions that we need to be having,\" he said. \"For me, [being a Republican] is about lower taxes, less government, not about these crazy culture wars that a lot of people like to chase down rabbit holes.\" Reece Smith says she wants to see Sen.

So I'd prefer for it to be in a safe environment.\" Like Gibson, she's concerned about divisions within the party - and points to Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene as a \"distraction.\" \"She has said things that are terrible. The thing about the Jewish space lasers is ridiculous. And she spoke at a rally with Nick Fuentes, who I think is a racist, sexist person, a homophobe, so I don't appreciate that,\" she said. \"And I don't like it when Republicans go after other Republicans in the party, because at the end of the day, we're just trying to get an agenda passed that's going to help people.\" Matthew Landau credits former President Trump for getting him interested in politics.\n                \n                    \n                    Matthew Landau\n                    \n                \nhide caption Matthew Landau credits former President Trump for getting him interested in politics.

He lists energy independence and crime as top issues. \"We have to be a nation of safety, integrity, and the whole nine - we got to make sure that if somebody does something illegal, we cannot just be bailing them out, they have to have some sort of consequence.\" When it comes to the 2024 campaign, Landau's in a bit of a tough spot. \"As far as who I want to see run, I mean - who got me into politics was Trump - I gotta stick with my guy, he got me into this whole thing,\" he said.

I think a lot of older people kind of forget what it's like to be starting out your life.\" Diaz is a strong supporter of Trump and wants to see him run again. \"Sometimes people have a negative connotation with the word nationalism. But to me, that's a positive word. I think [Trump] puts America first in almost everything he does,\" she said. \"We all need to unite behind Trump because ever since he became president, I admit the GOP has taken a shift further to the right and I think that's a good thing.\"",

            "article_content": "Israel's fifth election in under four years may give right-wing former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu his return to power - though Tuesday's vote is still being counted.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Israel's former prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, seems poised to take power once again. Israel's votes are not all counted, and assembling a governing coalition is tricky, but Netanyahu's party received the most votes in this week's election, and he consolidated the right-wing vote with hard-right campaign promises. So let's talk this through with NPR's Daniel Estrin, who's in Tel Aviv. Hey there, Daniel. DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: How certain is Netanyahu's win? ESTRIN: It does seem fairly certain. By this point, most votes have been counted, at least 85% of the votes. Netanyahu has the big advantage. His Likud party got most of the votes. His allies on the far right have come in third. And together it seems that they will pretty easily be able to form a coalition together with Orthodox Jewish parties. So here's what Netanyahu said to his supporters early today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: (Speaking Hebrew). ESTRIN: He was still being cautious, but he said, we are on the cusp of a very big victory. And it is looking good for him because parties opposing him are much more splintered than the parties that are in favor of him. Two parties on the left may not even make it into Parliament this time. We're talking about a secular Arab nationalist party, which probably didn't get enough votes. And it's unclear if Meretz, the left-wing pro-LGBTQ party, will even make it into Parliament this time. If both of those parties would have made it, we probably would have seen a stalemate. INSKEEP: Wow. So Netanyahu was prime minister in the '90s, was then prime minister more recently for a decade, was then finally pushed out of office amid allegations of corruption and other things, could be back in power. How are Israelis responding? ESTRIN: Well, there were celebrations at the campaign headquarters of the far right, calling for the next government to have tough law enforcement against Palestinians and Palestinian citizens of Israel. One Netanyahu voter told us today that he doesn't care who's prime minister; what's important to him is the Jewish character of the state. Now, on the other side of the map, Israelis who are - oppose Netanyahu are frankly beside themselves this morning. You see a lot of that on social media. We ran into Marik Shtern today. He's a political analyst but also a very unhappy voter. MARIK SHTERN: The feeling is quite bad, actually. It's sort of despair. The country is going into a very clear direction of nationalism and religious extremism. But we will be OK. The problem would be with the Palestinian citizens of Israel, the Palestinians in the West Bank. All of them are in real danger for the near future. ESTRIN: And, you know, he is right. We have spoken to worried Arab voters, especially worried about a far-right provocateur, Itamar Ben-Gvir, who is poised to be a cabinet minister in a likely Netanyahu government. INSKEEP: Setting aside the personnel, is it really clear what a Netanyahu government would do? ESTRIN: I think the biggest changes that we would likely see is mostly the weakening of the independence of the judiciary. Netanyahu is on trial for corruption. He wants to avoid going to jail. And his allies have made it very clear they're ready to make far-reaching changes to checks and balances in Israeli democracy. INSKEEP: OK. Again, if you missed the top, Israel held another election. Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party is in the lead, and he appears to be poised to form a governing majority, a governing coalition. NPR's Daniel Estrin. Thanks so much. ESTRIN: You're welcome.

            "article_content": "Former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could be on the verge of a historic comeback. He's doubling down on his hard-right positions and a win could help him stave off a corruption trial.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: The leader of Israel's right wing is trying to stage a comeback. Benjamin Netanyahu was ousted last year, and he's on trial for corruption, but he's a frontrunner in Tuesday's elections. He's promising to form a government with politicians on the far right. NPR's Daniel Estrin reports on what Netanyahu hopes to achieve. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking Hebrew). DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: His supporters chant, Bibi, king of Israel. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: (Speaking Hebrew). (CHEERING) ESTRIN: Bibi - Benjamin Netanyahu - is crisscrossing the country holding campaign rallies, sometimes three a night. He's 73 years old and with boundless energy. Here, he greets a crowd in Ofakim, a blue-collar town in Israel's south. NETANYAHU: (Speaking Hebrew). ESTRIN: He says, do you want to bring back your personal security? Do you want to bring down the cost of living? Do you want to bring back our national pride in a Jewish country? Those are the themes that resonate with his supporters - the rising cost of living, but also nationalism and security - the classic Israeli issue of Arabs versus Jews and who has the upper hand. Voter Ortal Shlomo says without Netanyahu in office this past year, she hasn't slept well at night. ORTAL SHLOMO: (Speaking Hebrew). ESTRIN: She says those who came to power ruined the country. They gave the Arabs power and strengthened them. An Arab political party was part of the governing coalition this year, a first in Israel's history. Netanyahu offers a different vision for Israel. If he's reelected, he says he'll give a cabinet minister seat to far-right Itamar Ben-Gvir, whose campaign is to exile Arabs he deems hostile. Ben-Gvir is shunned by the pro-Israel group AIPAC, but Netanyahu's party claims he's more moderate than the past. SHLOMO: (Speaking Hebrew). ESTRIN: Shlomo says, \"We need someone like Ben-Gvir in the government. We need his power of deterrence. He is moderated from his extremism. We need him just as he is. He will cause them to go back into the holes where they came from - the Arabs.\" Another major issue Netanyahu's allies are pushing is to strip the justice system of some of its powers. Netanyahu is on trial for corruption, and his supporters think it's a plot by left-wing justice officials. Voter Gila Dree. GILA DREE: (Speaking Hebrew). ESTRIN: \"I think it's a trial to topple a government. It cannot be the judges get to decide for the country,\" she tells me. Hebrew University politics professor Reuven Hazan says Netanyahu wants to return to office to exert the right pressure needed to try to shake off his trial. REUVEN HAZAN: He truly believes that while in power, he can do the best in order to avoid his trial ending up in a guilty verdict. For that reason, I think he is dangerous to Israeli democracy. ESTRIN: In this tight race, polls suggest Netanyahu's bloc could get just enough votes for him to build a coalition with the religious far right. CHAZAN: He will be at the whim of the most extremist elements in his governing coalition. And those extremist elements, to put it bluntly, are non-democratic elements. ESTRIN: Another option - Netanyahu could ditch the far right and convince some of his political opponents to partner with him instead. What doesn't seem likely is an outright win for the anti-Netanyahu bloc of parties. There could be a stalemate, and if Netanyahu doesn't win, some in his party could defect, making it hard for him to return to office again. NETANYAHU: (Speaking Hebrew). ESTRIN: Back at the rally, Benjamin Netanyahu tells his supporters, \"we are so close to victory.\" The message is optimistic, but this may be his last chance at a comeback.

            "article_content": "NPR's Mary Louise Kelly talks with Black Voters Matter co-founder LaTosha Brown about if she thinks Black voters will turn out for Democrats this year.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: The last time I talked to activist LaTosha Brown, she was celebrating. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) LATOSHA BROWN: (Singing) Well, the first thing I did right was the day I started to fight. Keep your eyes on the prize and hold on. Hold on. KELLY: LaTosha Brown was singing because Democrat Raphael Warnock had just been elected as the first Black senator from Georgia in a runoff election that came two months after Black voters helped to turn the state blue for Joe Biden. Warnock's victory, along with that of Jon Ossoff, handed control of the Senate to Democrats. And it was due, in no small part, to the efforts of organizations like Black Voters Matter, of which Brown is a co-founder. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) BROWN: We wanted people - we wanted Black voters, in particular - to feel a sense of their power and their agency and, in spite of all odds, what we could do in pushing this country forward. KELLY: Now, almost two years later and facing another election, I wanted to check back in with Brown - see if she thinks the promise of that moment has paid off for those Black voters who turned out in 2020 and 2021 - see if she thinks they'll turn out for Democrats this year. LaTosha Brown, welcome back to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. BROWN: Thank you for having me on. KELLY: We're going to get to that big-picture question that I just laid out. But first, just tell me, in terms of issues that you're focused on or that the voters you're reaching out to are focused on, what's the message? BROWN: You know, there's been three kind of core issues that come up over and over again. There's a lot of concern around economic security... KELLY: Sure. BROWN: ...And where the economy is going. And people are feeling the pinch. They're feeling the pinch in their pocketbooks. They're feeling the pinch around housing and housing insecurity. They're feeling it in a variety of ways - from gas prices to food prices. We also hear around criminal justice reform. There is continuing to be this desire, particularly with young people we talk to, that they want real criminal justice reform, and we've not seen that yet. You know, when we saw the George Floyd uprisings that happened in 2020, you know, you've got the largest group of people who entered the process, but they entered the process in hopes that we would actually move this conversation forward and policy forward to give criminal justice reform. You know, and a third thing that constantly comes up is around voting rights - that people have been witnessing over the last two years the voter suppression that has just ravaged this country. And there's a real genuine concern around - how are we going to combat voter suppression, and what do we need to do to make sure that we're protecting our democratic rights? KELLY: So let me bring us up to the big-picture question that we want to focus on, which is the voters you're talking to, many of whom helped to deliver President Biden's win in 2020 and then helped to deliver Democratic control of the Senate - are they feeling like it worked out - like the Democrats delivered? Because it sounds like these are a lot of the same issues that were on the table back in 2020. BROWN: You know, I think that's a great question because, when we talk to voters, there's a mixed bag. I think, on some level - you know, I always talk about - I think that Black voters are very nuanced and sophisticated voters, in terms of we recognize that many of the things that we want and we desire for our communities - that it is going to require real structural change. It's not just going to be enough at having a particular political party in power or a particular candidate, but that we need fundamental structural change. And I think that there is an understanding of that. But there's also a frustration around things that people want and what they voted for - that some of those things have not panned out. And there's a certain level of discontent around that. But then I do... KELLY: Well, and let me hold you on that point of discontent and frustration that you're talking about because I know, earlier this year, President Biden was down in Georgia. He gave a big voting rights speech. You skipped it, and it was reported that this was because you're frustrated with what you see as inaction on things like voting rights legislation. BROWN: You know, what we saw coming right after the 2020 election - immediately, the next legislative session, we saw Republican legislature pass the SB 202 bill. That's basically the blueprint for voter suppression in this country. It does the three things that I often talk about. One - it has - it restricts access to the ballot, from drop-off sites to shortening the time that people can vote absentee. Secondly, it weaponizes the administrative process, essentially giving the Republicans - even the governor - power, where they can actually overturn results if they're not satisfied with those results. The third thing is to create this culture of fear. And so you saw within that law where it criminalizes groups like ours and others that give comfort care for voters in line - something as simple as giving them water or pizza - people who may stand in line for hours. And so in the midst of that, what we recognized early on was that voting rights was a central, core issue among all of the issues 'cause it would impact how voters are able to freely and fairly engage in the political process. And so we wanted to send a message loud and clear to the president, to the administration, that voting rights should have been and should continue to be a priority because all other rights - all other policy issues are going to be impacted by people's ability to freely and fairly vote. KELLY: So let me turn you to a practical question. How are you getting people motivated to show up and vote this time around, when there's frustration - and it sounds like you feel it personally - that everything they showed up to vote about last time around hasn't gotten done and when, in a lot of places around the country, the mechanics of voting have gotten harder? BROWN: Well, let me say this. The administration has actually done some really progressive, powerful things. When you look at when we had the extension of the child tax credit - you know, that had an impact on our community. When we see, just recently, people who have convictions around marijuana - that affects thousands of people. You know, when we see the Inflation Act. When we see - there have been many things that have passed, but there is a nuance that we're helping voters to understand that, yes, there are some elements that are part of the agenda that we want that have not been addressed - that we want to see movement on. But there have been good things that have happened - that this administration and having a Democratic Senate - how that has made a difference in our lives, but also saying that we have to continue to push forward so that we can get the other things that we want as well. And in order to do that, we've got to have people in office that will respond to our needs. And at the end of the day, if our faith was based on us being disappointed in one election, I mean, where would I be as a Black Southerner in this nation? And so ultimately, what we're moving people to start thinking about is that it's not just about participation, it's about building power. KELLY: Before I let you go, we heard you at the beginning singing, and you were singing about keeping your eyes on the prize. What is the prize in 2022? BROWN: Oh, excellent question. You know, I think that the prize is - we literally have to make sure that people are engaged to see what is happening - that there is a full-fledged attack on our democratic rights in this country. There is a party that is aligning itself with white nationalism, and that has to be stopped at all costs. And so the eyes on the prize for me is having an America and a nation that has a democratic process, that supports pluralism, that every single voter has equal and fair access to the ballot and that we start seeing policies that are not driven by profit, but are focused on centering people. And so ultimately, keeping the eyes on the prize for me is for us to continue to move forward so we can have the America that we reimagine - an America that is inclusive, that is fair, that is democratic. KELLY: LaTosha Brown - she is co-founder of Black Voters Matter. Thank you. BROWN: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Democrat Pat Ryan speaks during a campaign rally Monday in Kingston, N.Y., before defeating Republican Marc Molinaro in Tuesday's special election for New York's 19th Congressional District. Ryan had stressed abortion rights on the trail.\n                \n                    \n                    Mary Altaffer/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democrat Pat Ryan speaks during a campaign rally Monday in Kingston, N.Y., before defeating Republican Marc Molinaro in Tuesday's special election for New York's 19th Congressional District. Ryan had stressed abortion rights on the trail. Abortion rights once again appeared to be a key motivator for Democratic voters, and the party establishment showed it still has an advantage, with election results in New York and Florida Tuesday night. A win in a key special election in New York State is giving Democrats hope of doing relatively well in these midterm elections. They clearly have momentum, though they should probably temper expectations. Plus, key races in Florida are now set, with Democrats hoping to stop Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis from winning reelection and a platform to perhaps bigger things \u2014 and the first Gen Z candidate won with a likely path to Congress, signaling where things may be headed for Democrats. Here are four takeaways from Tuesday's elections: How many examples does it take to make a trend? Democrat Pat Ryan won a special election in an evenly divided Upstate New York House district that is one of the swingiest in the country. Former President Obama won it in 2012, former President Trump won it in 2016 and President Biden won it in 2020. Ryan won it by about 2 points Tuesday, and following on abortion-rights supporters' win on a ballot measure in Kansas earlier this month, he made abortion rights the key issue in his election. Republican Marc Molinaro, on the other hand, made his race about inflation and crime. It can be tempting to overread the results of special elections. They are generally low-turnout affairs that draw the most engaged voters. In recent years, however, they have been indicators of which party has the most enthusiasm, and the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade is a pretty clear line of demarcation. In midterms, history is usually on the party out of power's side, and Republicans had success early on in Biden's presidency, overperforming in races in Virginia and New Jersey, as well as special elections earlier this cycle. But as the Cook Political Report's Dave Wasserman lays out, that changed post-Dobbs: House special election results since start of June:#CA22 (6/7, Trump +5): R+24#TX34 (6/14, Biden +4): R+5------(Dobbs)-------#NE01 (6/28, Trump +11): R+5#MN01 (8/9, Trump +10): R+4#NY19 (8/23, Biden +2): D+2#NY23 (8/23, Trump +11): R+7 The big question is whether that enthusiasm holds into November when there will be far higher turnout. What's more, political momentum has shifted quickly in this election cycle. And before rank-and-file Democrats get their hopes up too high, while there may now be an outside shot at the party retaining the House, it's still considered a longshot. At the moment, Republicans need to net just five seats to take back the House, and they have redistricting and history on their side. Democrats have had problems with setting expectations that they can lasso the moon and then disappoint their base when they only make it to space \u2014 even though that's a pretty good accomplishment. (See: Biden's original Build Back Better plan.) What abortion rights has done is likely given Democrats a real shot at keeping Republicans' margins down in the House and maybe help them retain the Senate, both of which would be major wins. For as much as Republicans want to stereotype Democrats as extreme progressives, once again the perceived-to-be more moderate or establishment candidates won \u2014 in a key Florida race and even in one of the most Democratic-leaning places in the country: Manhattan, Brooklyn and the areas just north of the city. \u2014 Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee head Sean Patrick Maloney defeated progressive Alessandra Biaggi, 67%-33%. Biaggi had the backing of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. \u2014 Dan Goldman, who prosecuted the first impeachment case against Trump, defeated a splintered field of more progressive candidates. In fairness, had progressives consolidated and not split the vote, one of them may well have won. Rep. Mondaire Jones, who was essentially forced into this district because of redistricting and Maloney's decision to run in the 17th District, and Yuh-Line Niou held a news conference before the election encouraging voters not to cast ballots for \"conservative Democrat\" Goldman. (Only in Manhattan or Oakland could Goldman be considered \"conservative.\") Yet, they and several others, remained on the ballot and divided up votes, giving Goldman a path to a narrow victory, which he got, by about 2 points over Niou. \u2014 And in Florida, in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, Rep. Charlie Crist handily defeated Nikki Fried, the state's agriculture commissioner, by more than 20 points. This race highlighted a generational divide within the party \u2014 and an old school-new school divide over how to do politics. Crist, a former Republican governor-turned-Democrat, cashed in on contacts and worked political power broker networks, and for now, that old-school style won out again. New school is coming, though. In the Orlando area, the likely first Gen Z member of Congress won his primary \u2014 and it may signal the future for Democratic politics. \"Today's election is proof that Central Florida's working families want representation that has the courage to ask for more,\" Maxwell Frost, 25, said in a statement. Frost is favored to win election to Congress this fall because of the liberal bent of the district. If more moderate Democratic establishment candidates are winning in many places, the opposite has been true mostly for Republicans this cycle, who are being pulled more to their polarized extreme. Though candidates Trump endorsed had mixed results Tuesday night, overall, people pushing his election lies are winning or being boosted, though several of them lack political experience. That's led to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell questioning his party's \"candidate quality.\" The Trump and MAGA brands are going to be tested in purple states and swing districts. And while a wave can push even flawed candidates over the finish line, that's less true with a lazy river current, which is what this election is looking more like. What's more, even Tuesday, candidates who only a couple cycles ago would have been seen as far off on the fringe lost, but got better than 40% of the vote. That was the case in Western New York with Carl Paladino, a political gadfly with a history of making offensive comments, and Laura Loomer in Florida. Loomer has regularly posted conspiracy theories, including about COVID-19 vaccines, and calls herself a \"proud Islamophobe\" and \"pro-white nationalism.\" She won a GOP primary in 2020 before losing by 20 points in the general election. This time, she lost her GOP primary, but still received 44% of the vote and added a new wrinkle \u2014 some Trump-style baseless griping. \"I'm not conceding, because I'm a winner and the reality is our Republican Party is broken to its core,\" Loomer said in a non-concession speech Tuesday night. With tears streaming down her face, Loomer, who has been banned from social media platforms, added, \"We are losing our country to big-tech election interference.\" Incumbent Republican Sen. Marco Rubio against Rep. Val Demings is now official. And this race so far has had a heavy dose of Trump. Rubio has criticized the FBI search of Trump's Florida home, while Demings was a Trump impeachment manager. But there's another issue that is notable to watch \u2014 how a Democrat who positions themselves as pro-law enforcement does in a state that's been tipping toward the GOP. Demings, a former Orlando police chief, hasn't been shying away from that record. She ran an ad, for example, denouncing the idea of \"defund the police.\" \"In the Senate, I'll protect Florida from bad ideas, like 'defund the police,'\" Demings says in the ad. \"That's. Just. Crazy.\" Rubio still has the advantage and this is seen as a bit of a stretch for Democrats to be able to win in this environment, but Demings has outraised Rubio and has done well in some early polling. The main event, though, very well may be the gubernatorial showdown between Crist and DeSantis. DeSantis has landed in repeated controversy over his stances on education, women's rights, redistricting and voting, but he's seen as a rising star in Republican circles. Many conservatives see him as a more disciplined version of Trump, someone who can carry the culture-war mantle forward without the chaos. There's been plenty of DeSantis 2024 talk, but he has to win reelection as governor first. Democrats went with Crist over Fried, in some measure because of Crist's perceived strength of electability. That's going to be tested. Crist knows the stakes. \"This guy wants to be president of the United States of America, and everybody knows it,\" Crist said in his victory speech Tuesday night, of DeSantis, without using his name. \"However, when we defeat them on Nov. 8 that show is over. Enough.\"",

            "article_content": "New York Times journalist Charles Homans says scores of groups at the state and local levels, with the help of right wing media figures and activists, are taking  aim at the electoral  system.  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. The movement to reinstate President Trump has gone far beyond him and now threatens the future of American elections. That's one of the takeaways of Sunday's New York Times Magazine article \"How 'Stop The Steal' Captured The American Right\" by my guest, Charles Homans. He tracks how Stop the Steal morphed into a movement geared toward future elections. Homans says scores of groups at the state and local levels, with the help of right-wing media figures and activists, are taking aim at the electoral system. He also tells the backstory of Stop the Steal and traces its roots in the Tea Party movement that started after President Obama's election. Some Tea Party leaders were active in trying to overturn the 2020 election. The Stop the Steal movement didn't succeed in reinstating Trump, but it did succeed on another level. Homans cites polls showing that only about one-fifth to one-quarter of the Republican electorate considers Biden's presidency legitimate. Charles Homans is a New York Times reporter covering ideas and activism shaping domestic politics. He's a former politics editor at The New York Times Magazine. Charles Homans, welcome to FRESH AIR. Let's look at one example of a politician who kind of represents the continuity of Stop the Steal into the future, and this is Doug Mastriano, who I think is fair to say is a Christian nationalist. He's running on the Republican ticket for governor of Pennsylvania, which is a swing state. And he was very active in Stop the Steal. We'll get to how in a moment. But if he wins as governor, what control will he have over elections in this Pennsylvania swing state? CHARLES HOMANS: Well, in Pennsylvania, the governor directly appoints the official who has the most direct oversight of elections in the state. And this is different in every state, which is part of why this all becomes very complicated. But in Pennsylvania, it's somewhat unusual in that the governor himself or herself has that authority to appoint that person. So he would, in effect, be picking the person who would be directly overseeing the next election in the state where he still very loudly believes the last election was stolen. GROSS: So let's talk about his role in the Pennsylvania state legislature, where he is still a state senator - his role in trying to overturn the election. HOMANS: Right. So Mastriano is an interesting figure because he bridges really kind of multiple phases of this big - the big story of how Stop the Steal evolved. You know, he was somebody who, you know, first came to prominence - he's still very new to politics. You know, he was first elected in a special election, you know, I think about a year and a half before the 2020 election. And, you know, he originally came to prominence in - over the course of the protests against the quarantine measures and lockdowns in Pennsylvania in the spring of 2020. And he really built a profile very much outside of the statehouse there. You know, he was not a huge player in Pennsylvania politics qua politics, but he had this real following that he'd build over the course of the pandemic. GROSS: Because he was adamant in opposing any kind of masking mandate. HOMANS: Right. And he was, you know, often present for these protests outside of the Capitol in which he was serving and was a very vocal opponent of pretty much all the measures that the - that Governor Tom Wolf's administration had put in place by that point. And after the election happened, he very quickly became - you know, he had been a Trump supporter before that, and he very quickly became a real, you know, amplifier of the claims that Trump and Trump's lawyers were making about how the election had been stolen. And the sort of key thing - I mean, I write in the story about how he was - you know, literally within hours of the election being called for Biden, you know, Senator Mastriano is at the barricades outside the Capitol again in the same place where he had often been present for these anti-lockdown demonstrations. And he's speaking to the Trump supporters who gathered there about how the election had been stolen and about how the Democrats are cheaters and liars and sort of the need to address this. GROSS: So Mastriano, as a state senator, became known for opposing all of the governor's - all of Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf's masking mandates and other COVID mandates. And, you know, he gained a following for that. And then after the election, when Stop the Steal started, he was one of the leaders of trying to get the Pennsylvania state legislature to appoint fake electors. Tell us about his role in that scheme. HOMANS: That's right. Well, so what we know - I mean, so he kind of first shot to prominence in the claims about the election late in November after the election, when he convinced this Republican Policy Committee to host this hearing, which really spotlighted both Trump himself and his claims, and also Rudy Giuliani, who testified before the committee. And after that, you know, the Trump team, I think, recognized that he was an important figure in pushing these claims in the state, which was one of the half dozen states that they really saw as key to being able to overturn the election through this - you know, this whole strategy that had been advanced by John Eastman, a lawyer close to Trump, that states - state legislatures could appoint their own slate of electors if they thought the election outcome was in doubt. And Mastriano became that person for Pennsylvania. We now know from my colleagues Maggie Haberman and Luke Broadwater reporting in the Times there was a real effort to sort of shore up his support for that project of sort of convening this slate of electors - this sort of shadow slate of electors in Pennsylvania, which could then be submitted as an alternative to the ones who were being sent to certify that Joe Biden won the election. GROSS: So to connect the dots here, if they're not already obvious, if he becomes governor of Pennsylvania, a person who wanted to appoint fake electors to overturn the 2020 election would now be appointing the equivalent of a secretary of state who oversees the Pennsylvania election. HOMANS: That's right. And he's already spoken about how he would sort of appoint a like-minded person to that position. GROSS: Mastriano's speeches sometimes use the language of Christian nationalism. First of all, what is Christian nationalism? HOMANS: I think you can define it as a vision of - I mean, there's a lot of different definitions of it, but I think the - you know, the one that's sort of most germane here is that it's a way of thinking about the identity of the country as being a fundamentally Christian nation and that it's - exists on Earth by some divine providence and to achieve a certain purpose on Earth and is intended to be governed according to that purpose, which is important to distinguish from, I think, a lot of other, more conventional strains of kind of activist conservative evangelical thinking, which we've known in this country in the past, which have sought to sort of maximize evangelical influence on the government, but have not quite gone where, you know, this stream that we think of as Christian nationalism has gone in terms of really proclaiming the extent of the degree to which Christianity is just central to the country. GROSS: And some Christian nationalists believe that the Constitution was divinely inspired. HOMANS: Right. There's a whole sort of, you know, theology built around the founding fathers in this, which, you know, very much informs the way that somebody like Doug Mastriano talks about politics today. GROSS: Mastriano's slogan is walk as free people. What does that mean in the language of Christian nationalism? HOMANS: So that is a reference - if you see Mastriano's campaign literature, there is always - or often in small letters sort of around the margins of it, the verse John 8:36, which is the verse that reads, if the sun therefore shall make you free, you shall be free indeed. And that's what walk as free people as he's described it is referring to. And it's interesting to think of that in the context of the Bible, where it occurs. You know, this is Jesus. He's - you know, it's sort of early in his proselytizing. He's got basically a still skeptical audience that he's addressing. And he's trying to describe to them a law and order that goes far beyond the old laws of Abraham, which they had been following to that point. And he brings up this verse a lot. And I think it's - you know, it's a way of talking about a form of politics that is sort of, you know, operating on a different plane from politics, as we've known it, is sort of my read on that. GROSS: And one of the things about Mastriano is that he's very connected to the far-right. He paid $5,000 to the platform Gab, which is very far-right. And the founder of Gab, Andrew Torba, said that the money was for an ad campaign. And to give a sense of what Gab is like, Andrew Torba posted, look at the fruits of what happens when we allow pagans, Jews, nonbelievers, atheists to run our country - massive inflation, a border invasion, billions and billions of dollars being sent to foreign countries. So he's talking about allowing pagans, Jews, nonbelievers and atheists to run our country and how dangerous that is. Mastriano's opponent is the Democratic attorney general, Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish. HOMANS: Right. You know, I think the way that Torba kind of wraps the broader project of Gab in this religious language is sort of exemplary of something you see a lot on the right, right now, which is not new. But it is sort of in a space that's much more proximate to Republican politics than it used to be, where you see a lot of groups that are quite extreme and, you know, sometimes openly white nationalist, sometimes, you know, more quietly so, really wrapping what they're doing in the language of religion in a way that really parallels the way that that language is being used now in, you know, right-wing politics, electoral politics in this country. GROSS: So Mastriano won the primaries by 20 points or more than that. What does that tell you? HOMANS: You know, I think it's an interesting primary to look at because pretty much all of the serious contenders in that primary - in the Republican primary - were in one way or another sort of genuflecting towards Trump's claims about the 2020 election, but in different ways. But Mastriano is something different, I think. He really kind of articulated a way in which Trump's claims about the elections fit into a much bigger political story, one that reaches back to the pandemic and the way that state governments - Democratic state governments handled the pandemic and paints this much bigger picture of this real sort of ideological struggle, which began before Trump, which kind of reached its fever pitch during Trump's presidency, and then was sort of capped off by, you know, what they claimed to be the theft of the election, which is this great crime that had sort of opened the door on to these politics on the other side of it, where politicians speak much more openly about, you know, something that, you know, sounds much less like normal politics and much more kind of, you know, we must punish our enemies and reclaim power. And I think that that is a story that you see recapitulated in a lot of the politics around, you know, the sort of extended afterlife of Stop the Steal now, which is different from the way that Trump even himself talks about this. I mean, if you listen to how Trump talks about the election, it's still very much in the language of personal grievance and sort of his own wronging and not in the sort of much bigger canvas that somebody like Mastriano is working on. GROSS: Let me reintroduce you here because we need to take a short break. If you're just joining us, my guest is Charles Homans. And his latest piece in The New York Times Sunday magazine is titled \"How Stop The Steal Captured The American Right.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF SOLANGE SONG, \"WEARY\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday with Charles Homans. His latest article in The New York Times magazine is titled \"How Stop The Steal Captured The American Right.\" It's about how the Stop the Steal movement has its roots in the Tea Party movement and now goes beyond Trump and is threatening the future of American elections. So another politician who was active in Stop the Steal and is now charting a path beyond Trump is Couy Griffin, who is one of the Otero County commissioners in New Mexico. And he's the founder of the group Cowboys for Trump. What was his role in Stop the Steal? HOMANS: He was one of these sort of minor figures in the protests leading up to January 6 - between the election and January 6. He was - before that, in 2019, he started this group called Cowboys for Trump, which was sort of enough of, you know, an interest on social media that they, you know, got a meeting with Trump at one point. And after the election, he was one of a number of these local officials who became sort of part of this rolling bus tour that, you know, crisscrossed the country in those months. It was called the March for Trump. And it was one of the sort of main vehicles for the Stop the Steal protests in that time period. And its organizers went on to organize some of the big rallies in D.C. that immediately preceded the attack on the Capitol. And a lot of the people who spoke along a tour were local officials, local activists. And Couy was one of them. He - you know, he ended up joining the tour and was, you know, appearing across the country on this bus tour and you know, believed, I think, going into January 6 that he was going to speak at the rally at the Ellipse and was not actually included in the bill but was outside the Capitol as the crowd was storming in. GROSS: He has a role that would have been considered, you know, very minor in the past. He is a county commissioner in Otero County, N.M., but he has power in that position that he has been using. What has he done to challenge votes? HOMANS: Right. So after January 6, Griffin went back to New Mexico. And he was eventually charged and convicted with a misdemeanor offense related to going into the excluded area at the Capitol on January 6. But while his sort of legal proceedings around that were going on, he returned to his county commissioner position. And when the 2022 election rolled around in Otero County, he and both of his fellow commissioners refused to certify the results of the primary this spring. And they claimed that it was because there were still outstanding questions over the 2020 election in Otero County. And to outward appearances, this is very strange 'cause Otero County, New Mexico, went for Biden, but Otero County is a very Republican county that, you know, was clearly won by Trump and by - you know, by, I think, a double-digit result. But Griffin argued that there was a need to sort of revisit what had happened there in 2020. And until that was squared away, the subsequent election results, however inconsequential they might have been one way or another, needed to be considered suspect. And so, you know, they launched a whole audit in the county, which itself found no evidence of voter fraud that had occurred. But Griffin kind of continued to push this case and continued to the point of refusing to certify the election even after the state Supreme Court intervened and said that they had to. At that point, the other two county commissioners agreed to do that. But Griffin kind of remained a protest vote on the certification. GROSS: So he's an example of how people in politics who were connected to Stop the Steal can have an impact even at very local levels of government. How many people know who their county commissioner is? How powerful do people think of county commissioners as being? But they can interfere with elections. HOMANS: Griffin is a good example of somebody who's already in office who, you know, is sort of extrapolating the lessons from, you know, Trump's narrative around 2020 to a local action. And you've also seen since the 2020 election, a lot of people volunteering or, you know, running and, in some cases, winning seats that have direct oversight over elections who share those views that 2020 was stolen. And I don't think we know yet, you know, all the directions that's going to go once people, you know, with those views are really overseeing, you know, pieces of the election system on the local level. And Griffin is a good example of how even in, like, a pretty minor office, that can have real consequences. You know, this is - you know, he was able to sort of throw sand in the gears of the election in New Mexico, you know, from where he was sitting on the county commission. And it became a thing that went up to the state Supreme Court. And, you know, that's sort of exemplary of the kind of, you know, the power that some of these positions in theory would have if people chose to use them that way. GROSS: Griffin is an example of what you're saying in your article about a lot of people in politics have moved past Trump and are charting a post-Trump future. He said - and he is Christian - I don't know. Would you describe him as a Christian nationalist before I read this guy? HOMANS: He was - I think he would fit that description. Yeah, he - I mean, he's a pastor, like a former cowboy church pastor, and he prayed over the - you know, the rioters on Jan. 6. So, yes, I would - yeah, I think that's fair. GROSS: So here's his quote. \"I truly do believe that we're past the point of being rescued politically. If God wanted to bring our nation back through the realm of politics, President Trump would be sitting in office right now. Instead, it's almost like we started forming this golden calf with Donald Trump thinking that he was going to be our savior.\" So he's saying, like, Donald Trump isn't going to be our savior. He was just, like, a false god, a golden calf, so he's moving past Trump. It's a little unclear to me where he's moving. HOMANS: Yeah. I think it's interesting 'cause I asked him about that comment. He had said that in a podcast interview, and I asked him about it when I met him outside of the courthouse in Washington where he was being sentenced for his Jan. 6 case. And, you know, he said - you know, he spoke - when I asked him and when I brought that up, he spoke about, you know, like, how Trump kind of delighted in sort of being that object of adoration a little - you know, in a somewhat unseemly way. And I think that it was - for people like Griffin, it was a lesson to sort of look to the broader project rather than to leaders. And I think, you know, as he made pretty clear in that interview, he has these sort of, you know, basically religious, you know, views of how this country should be run and a vision in which what local officials like him do is sort of in direct concert with those plans. GROSS: Well, let's take another break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Charles Homans, and his latest article in The New York Times Sunday magazine is titled \"How Stop The Steal Captured The American Right.\" We'll be right back after a short break. I am Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF TERENCE BLANCHARD'S \"FOOTPRINTS\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday with Charles Homans about his latest article in The New York Times magazine, which is titled \"How 'Stop The Steal' Captured The American Right.\" It's about how the Stop the Steal movement has its roots in the Tea Party movement and now goes beyond Trump and is threatening the future of American elections. Charles Homans is a New York Times reporter covering ideas and activism shaping domestic politics. He's a former politics editor at the New York Times Magazine. You write about the connections between the Stop the Steal movement and the early days of the Tea Party and also the birther movement. So I want to start with the birther movement, and that was the movement that claimed that President Obama was illegitimately elected president because he wasn't qualified to run in the first place 'cause he wasn't born in the U.S.; he was born in Kenya. And, of course, he was not born in Kenya. He was born in Hawaii. He showed his birth certificate proving that. That was never good enough for the birthers. One of the loudest voices in the birther movement was Donald Trump. So what connection do you see between challenging Obama's legitimacy and Stop the Steal? HOMANS: I think that the birth certificate claims - or the birther claims, which, you know - as late as the end of Obama's presidency, you know, 40% - more than 40% of Republicans, you know, believed that he - you know, by some polling, that he was not born in the United States. So this was not a fringe position necessarily. But I think that the birther claims reflected a broader sense of the illegitimacy of the competition, the political competition. And that was something that Trump, of course, himself very personally latched onto and I think informed - and the language - if you go back and see sort of the language that attended the discussion of the - you know, the birther conspiracy theory in 2009, it really echoes very directly forward to the way that the 2020 election was discussed. GROSS: So one of the people clearly connecting the Tea Party movement to Stop the Steal is Amy Kremer, who was a prominent birther. She was a leader of the Tea Party, one of the organizers, and one of the people who protested President Biden's victory and wanted to overturn the results of the election. So what was her role as a Tea Party leader? What were her greatest contributions to getting the Tea Party off the ground? HOMANS: She was an early organizer of the Tea Party Patriots, which was one of the first really important Tea Party groups. And then she went on to be a principal of the Tea Party Express later on, which was a somewhat slicker and, you know, more kind of - more directly connected with Republican politics sort of wing of the Tea Party later on. GROSS: And what was her role in the 2016 election of Trump? HOMANS: In 2016, Kremer was one of the first real stars of the Tea Party world who threw her weight behind Trump in a series of political action committees starting very early in 2016. And notably, I mean, her - the first political action committee that she was a part of supporting Trump in that election cycle was sort of one of the organizations that was really advancing the idea that this election - the primary election in 2016 was going to be stolen from Trump at the Republican convention and sort of promoting that idea and using that idea to fundraise during the Republican primaries that year. GROSS: So she was concerned about the Republicans stealing the primary election from Trump before she was concerned about the 2020 election and wanting to overturn the results, planting the idea that you could steal - that even the Republican Party could steal an election. HOMANS: Yeah. And I think that's an important part of the history to understand - is that when Stop the Steal as a sort of slogan and as an idea first surfaced, it was not in the context of a Democratic, you know, challenge to Donald Trump. It was in the context of the Republican primary in 2016. And its main - the sort of main villain of the narrative as it was sort of, you know, originated in that election was Ted Cruz, not Hillary Clinton, although it was eventually turned towards Clinton in the general election. But when this first became a thing that people were rallying around and the, you know, sort of advisers to Trump were sort of encouraging people to rally around, it was really about the Republican primaries and the very first Republican primaries of 2016. GROSS: Roger Stone, who was a 2016 Trump campaign adviser and was deeply involved in the Stop the Steal movement - he registered the URL stopthesteal.org in February of 2016, the day after the Nevada Republican caucuses. So what do you know about why, back in 2016, he registered the web address of stopthesteal? HOMANS: Well, at this point, Stone, who had briefly worked for the Trump campaign the previous year, was sort of nominally out of Trump's orbit and running his own political action committee aligned with Trump. And one thing that's important to remember is that Trump, from the very beginning, was claiming that these elections were stolen from him. Literally going back to the Iowa caucuses, he was making these baseless claims that there had been voter fraud swaying the election away from him. But very quickly, around that time, after, you know, Trump proceeded to win most of the immediate following early primaries - and it was in that context that Stone started to advance this claim. And he, you know, wrote about this often at the time in places like Infowars and Breitbart about how there was going to be this Republican establishment plot to, you know, to take the election away from Trump. And he connected it in some of these interviews to what had happened to Barry Goldwater in the party, who he's always, you know, identified as one of his real heroes, and that there was going to be a plot afoot in the Republican Party to marginalize Trump the same way that Goldwater had been marginalized after his loss in 1964. And that was sort of - you know, he, from the very beginning, was drawing this big picture of this sort of cabal of elites who really transcended party but were, you know, there to stop this nationalist, as he described him, candidate from winning the nomination of the party. GROSS: And Trump was sowing the seeds of illegitimate elections after he won in 2016 when he insisted he also won the popular vote. There was his famous tweet - I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally. And, of course, there were not anything like millions of people who voted illegally. It's totally false. And in 2020, he told a rally, the only way we're going to lose this election is if the election is rigged. So, you know, people like Stone and Trump were setting the stage to challenge the election before the election. HOMANS: Yeah. And I think that's an important thing to remember here. And I do think it's what distinguishes the movement that grew up around this and around Trump from kind of what I would characterize as more normal skepticism or even conspiracism around elections, which has, you know, been a feature of American elections, you know, as long as we've had them, really. I mean, the - you know, we do have an election system in need of security updates from what we use now. But - and there are people who are legitimately, you know, lobbying for that and pushing for that and have ideas for how to do that. But the important thing that's always distinguished Trump and the movement around him is that all of this actually precedes him and really has sort of progressed independent of what's actually happened in any election involving Trump. You know, he's always found a way to claim that he was being robbed even when he was winning, and he's claimed that he was going to be robbed before elections even happened in many cases. GROSS: So to end our interview, I want you to read something that you wrote in your new New York Times Magazine article, and it's about how Trump basically opened up a hole that other people have walked through to start something new. Would you read that for us? HOMANS: (Reading) Trump had jolted American politics, probably irrevocably, by urging his supporters to see themselves as an American people distinct from the American population, a people whose particular loyalties, identities and values designated them as the nation's true inheritors regardless of what the ballots might have said. If this vision was enabled by his ego, which took him to places no other American president had dared to go, it was also constrained by it, limited by Trump's inability to imagine much of anything outside of himself. This was the paradox of the final, desperate act of his presidency. The hole he punched in American democracy out of sheer self-interest had allowed his followers to glimpse a vision of the country restored to its divinely ordained promise that lay beyond that democracy but also beyond him. GROSS: And is that where we are now - that Trump opened up this door to people who will take it further beyond him, and they don't necessarily need him anymore even though he still is a central focus? HOMANS: I think that's right. I mean, I think one way of thinking about what he did in the wake of the election was as this act of imagination that he was sort of brazen enough to pursue that no other president before him had pursued. And even though it failed in the moment, it enabled other people to think of what might be possible and to think in terms that were beyond the pale of democracy in this country before. And I think that that's a very dangerous door to have opened, and I don't think we know what's on the other side of that door. I think you see a range of thinking and kind of experiments in this space, you know, at the local level or the organizational level now, but we don't really see what it adds up to yet. And that, to me, is maybe the most important question of American politics in the years to come. GROSS: Charles Homans, thank you so much for talking with us. HOMANS: Thanks for having me.

There's an influential minority of Americans who envision the United States as a Christian nation. Lately, this group has been making significant progress in its mission. Recent rulings from the U.S. Supreme Court reversing Roe v. Wade and protecting prayer in schools are chief among these victories. These legal wins for the Christian Right, though, are happening at a time when a growing majority of Americans are strongly opposed to their views. \"This is the most disproportionate power that the Christian Right has had in my lifetime,\" says Robert Jones, CEO and founder of the Public Religion Research Institute \u2014 a nonpartisan group that conducts research on the intersection of politics, culture and religion. More and more white evangelical Christians are now talking about the U.S. as a Christian nation in ways that verge on or outright embrace Christian nationalism \u2014 the idea that the U.S. is a Christian nation and its laws should be rooted in the Bible. On the Sunday after the Supreme Court reversed a decades-old ruling that legalized abortions in the U.S., Republican congresswoman Lauren Boebert spoke to a crowd at a church in Colorado. Among other things, Boebert complained that faith communities have long had to deal with laws in the U.S. that they don't agree with. \"The church is supposed to direct the government,\" she said. \"The government is not supposed to direct the church. That is not how our founding fathers intended it. And I am tired of this separation of church and state junk. It's not in the Constitution.\" Of course, the Constitution does explicitly ban the establishment of a specific religion. It's in the First Amendment. Republican Reps. Mary Miller of Illinois, left, and Lauren Boebert of Colorado appear at a Save America rally with former President Donald Trump at the Adams County Fairgrounds on June 25, 2022, in Mendon, Ill.\n                \n                    \n                    Michael B. Thomas/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican Reps. Mary Miller of Illinois, left, and Lauren Boebert of Colorado appear at a Save America rally with former President Donald Trump at the Adams County Fairgrounds on June 25, 2022, in Mendon, Ill. But Timothy Head, executive director of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, says he thinks that part of the Constitution was written to keep the government from interfering with religion. \"Not to keep anybody that holds a religious view out of government,\" he said. \"All of us have certain kinds of worldviews. Some of those are based on college professors, or your favorite philosophers, or a comedian somewhere. It just so happens that some people base their worldview on biblical teachings.\" Jones said even though the Christian Right is currently as emboldened as it's ever been in a long time, it is not winning over public opinion. \"White evangelicals in particular have lost a lot of ground,\" Jones said. Since at least 2008, white evangelicals have been shrinking in population size, and median age \u2013 now 56 \u2013 has been climbing. During the Christian Right's heyday in the 1970s and 80s, though, Jones says it was aligned with most of the country. \"When they said things like 'We are the moral majority,' there was a kind of truth to that \u2013 even if it wasn't a demographic truth,\" he said. \"If you look at some of the issues, for example, like same-sex marriage, most of the country agreed with them.\" But those days are gone. Jones said about seven in 10 Americans support same-sex marriage now \u2013 and that number also keeps growing. And about six in 10 Americans say abortion should be legal in the U.S. Amelia Fulbright, a progressive pastor at the Congregational Church of Austin, said religious communities should not expect to see their particular theology reflected in the country's laws. \"I don't think it is the role of faith communities to use politics to impose their worldview on others,\" she says. Fulbright has spent almost a decade advocating for the rights of LGBTQ people, as well as abortion rights, in Texas. She said in the past few years Republican state lawmakers have been crossing a line \u2014 making the case for laws by citing Christian ideas. \"There is not even an effort to conceal that these are theological ideas \u2013 that there is just a full-throated unapologetic attempt to impose a certain Christian worldview on everyone else. Fulbright said for years she relied on the Supreme Court to block laws in Texas that were explicitly rooted in Christian theology. But since Republicans secured a conservative majority on the court, Fulbright and others say those guardrails have been knocked down. Tim Whitaker, creator of a group called The New Evangelicals, says this is how the Christian Right has decided to respond to waning public opinion \u2014 instead of embracing changing views. \"White evangelicalism rejects pluralism \u2013 completely,\" he said. \"They do not see themselves as coexisting with other religious views or other sexuality ethic views. They see it as a spiritual battle and they are on God's side.\" Whitaker, who created his group to counteract less tolerant strains of evangelicalism, said decades of this sort of campaigning has amounted to an immense amount of influence, particularly in the Republican Party. \"When they start getting a taste \u2013 a small taste \u2013 of just making room for other viewpoints, that's perceived as a loss of power,\" he said. \"And then they campaign on that.\" Donald Trump put three anti abortion-rights justices on the Supreme Court in his four years in office, delivering on an essential campaign promise to the Christian Right. These groups have also galvanized power in state legislatures across the country. Head dismissed the assertion that Christian conservatives are trying to push their views on everyone. \"I don't think that religious views or Christian people should be given special positions,\" he said, \"but they also shouldn't be excluded from the public discourse either.\" And while Whitaker said not all Christian conservatives support extreme views like Christian nationalism, an influential number of them do. \"It truly does concern for the future of the country because ultimately Christian nationalism is not about democracy,\" he says. \"It's really about \u2013 I hate to use such blunt language \u2013 but it's really more about theocracy.\" Jones said he also sees the Christian Right beginning to part with democratic norms. For example, many Christian conservatives have been supporting voting restrictions and backing Trump's election lies. Jones said it's one of the ways they can make sure their country is a Christian nation. \"I think we are seeing the last kind of desperate grasp \u2013 that by the way includes violence \u2013 that is kind of a desperate attempt to kind of hold on to that vision of the country and to hold on to power,\" he says. Ultimately, Jones said, this period in American history could be a hingepoint for democracy. \"I think if we can protect our democratic institutions and we can weather these attacks on it, then I think there is light at the other end of the tunnel,\" he said. \"But I do think we are in for some dark days.\"",

            "article_content": "NPR's Daniel Estrin talks with Sylvie Kauffmann, editorial director at Le Monde, about what France's election means for the future of the country.  DANIEL ESTRIN, HOST: France has a choice this weekend - Macron or Le Pen. Polls favor President Emmanuel Macron to win a second term on Sunday. But the gap is much closer than five years ago, when he defeated Marine Le Pen. This time around, the right-wing populist has rebranded, and she has won a lot of support. So what does that mean for France? We're going to talk about that with Sylvie Kauffmann. She's editorial director at the French newspaper Le Monde. Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. SYLVIE KAUFFMANN: Thank you. Thank you for having me. ESTRIN: So we know Marine Le Pen comes from a far-right-wing family. She has supposedly moderated her politics. What is her vision for France? What would she do if she became president? KAUFFMANN: That's a very good question because she didn't put forward immediately this time, in this campaign, a very clear vision of how she sees the future of France. And so towards these last few days, since the first round, really, you know, people had a closer look at her program. And also, Emmanuel Macron, I think, did a good job of pointing out, you know, what were the misleading features of her campaign. And so when you look closely, you can see that, for instance, what she advocates is the equivalent of leaving the European Union because... ESTRIN: Wow. KAUFFMANN: ...She - yes. I mean, not - you know, we call it a Frexit (ph) in disguise, right? ESTRIN: Wow. Is her position truly a surprise for her supporters? I mean, why has she won so many new supporters this time around? KAUFFMANN: She did attract more votes this time. That's a fact. And I don't think it's because of her positions on Europe. I think it's more because of - her main focus this time was the cost of living because it is true that we also have an inflation problem. And so she has been very effective at telling people, if you elect me president, you will have subsidies. You will have - you know, I will cut the price of gas - you know, all these kind of promises. ESTRIN: So even if she is not elected, her rise in popularity in this campaign says something, right? I mean, first of all, does it... KAUFFMANN: Yes. ESTRIN: ...Reflect trends elsewhere in Europe, in the rise of populism, nationalism in the U.S., too? KAUFFMANN: Well, it's - yes. We've been having those trends in various countries, but that's not only Marine Le Pen in the populist trend in France. There is a third politician, Jean-Luc Melenchon, who we might compare to Bernie Sanders if you want, and he got almost as many votes as Marine Le Pen. She got 23% of the vote, and he got 22% of the vote. And he's a left-wing politician. So we have two important parties and politicians now in our political landscape which are populist parties, one on the left and one on the far-right. And so between those, you have Emmanuel Macron. And he's now the only political force in the center because the mainstream traditional parties on the center have totally collapsed. So our political system is really - it's a field of ruins.

India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, is holding state elections as the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party of Narendra Modi looks to defend its majority. LUCKNOW, India \u2013 Five years ago, prospective landlords in Mumbai recoiled when Kajal Singh told them where she was from. Singh grew up in Meerut, a city in India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh. Both her hometown and home state had a reputation for crime. They're where the gangsters are from in Bollywood movies. So when Singh moved to Mumbai for a job with an airline, she had trouble renting an apartment. No one would trust a tenant from her state, she found. \"I started telling them I'm from a different place, not U.P. I used to lie!\" she admits, laughing. Five years later, in a visit to friends in Uttar Pradesh's capital Lucknow, she finds a different situation. She and her friends are able to socialize at a roadside tea stall at night \u2014 something Singh, 23, says she would not have felt safe doing before. \"But now things have changed,\" she says. \"Now I can proudly say I'm from U.P. Now we are feeling safe.\" Crowds turn out to cheer India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a road show in support of Uttar Pradesh state elections on Friday in Varanasi, India.\n                \n                    \n                    Ritesh Shukla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Crowds turn out to cheer India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a road show in support of Uttar Pradesh state elections on Friday in Varanasi, India. A dramatic drop in crime is part of what Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party is running for reelection on in local elections this month. Singh, for one, cites it as the reason the party will have her vote. Most opinion polls predict the party will win in Uttar Pradesh -- one of five Indian states voting this month. According to India's National Crime Records Bureau, rape, murder and theft fell in 2020 to their lowest levels in Uttar Pradesh since 2013. Preliminary data from 2021 shared by Uttar Pradesh police suggests the trend has continued. With more than 200 million residents, Uttar Pradesh is bigger than all but a handful of countries. The results of these elections will be examined as a bellwether of Modi's own reelection chances in 2024. But political scientists say the government's crime data is opaque, incomplete and probably biased. Human rights groups say any perception of safer streets in Uttar Pradesh has come with \u2014 or possibly because of \u2014 a spike in police brutality against minorities. While many residents say their streets feel safer, some of their Muslim neighbors \u2014 members of India's largest minority group \u2014 say they have never felt less safe.

Uttar Pradesh police say aggressive policing has lowered crime. They've been flooding the streets with officers. In a public service announcement on TV, state police promise to respond to any call for help or any crime tip in 15 minutes or less. There's been a massive media campaign, especially during elections. A Hindi music video for Modi's BJP, with more than 6 million views, shows Uttar Pradesh's incumbent Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, a hardline Hindu priest and close Modi aide, interspersed with footage of Hindu festivals, illustrations of Hindu deities and photos of highway overpasses built during Adityanath's time in office. The lyrics go like this: \"All the thieves, gangsters and looters have been wiped out.\" Those lyrics hark back to a promise Adityanath made shortly after winning power in 2017. He promised to \"knock down\" criminals if they didn't mend their ways. Ominously, he predicted that more suspects would kill themselves in police custody under his administration. And he sought to link crime to those working in now-illegal cow slaughterhouses. That's shorthand for Muslims, who often work in India's leather industry. Much of what he promised has come true. \"In the time that Adityanath has been chief minister, there have been more extrajudicial face-offs between the police and purported criminals, and a number of people have been shot dead and killed in these police encounters,\" says Milan Vaishnav, author of When Crime Pays: Money and Muscle in Indian Politics. Between March 2017, when Adityanath took office, and August 2021, Uttar Pradesh police say they shot and injured at least 3,302 alleged criminals in 8,472 extrajudicial face-offs, known in India as \"police encounters.\" Many suspects were shot in the legs. At least 146 died, police say. Some custodial deaths have been labeled by police as suicides.

The numbers reflect a more than tenfold increase in annual police encounters in Uttar Pradesh, says retired police inspector S.S. Darapuri. He spent 32 years in the Indian Police Service, most recently in Uttar Pradesh. Before 2017, he says, there were at most 100 or 150 extrajudicial confrontations a year. State police say the increase in these violent encounters reflects their \"zero-tolerance policy\" and deters crime. But the result can also be skewed crime statistics. Suspects might get punished before they're even charged. Immediate police action might lead some victims not to press charges, meaning the crime may never be recorded. Darapuri, 78, has become a human rights activist since he retired from the police force, and is now critical of his former colleagues. He says officers allegedly frame suspects, then mete out \"instant justice\" against their personal enemies or those they've profiled unfairly. \"It is a repressive, persecuting attitude of the police, who enjoy so much power and misuse it,\" he says. \"Instead of protecting rights, they themselves violate rights.\" Human rights groups accuse Uttar Pradesh police of staging these encounters. Last month, a group of international criminal and human rights lawyers asked the U.S. Treasury Department to impose sanctions on Adityanath and two top Indian police officials for alleged human rights abuses related to police killings. In 2019, four United Nations human rights experts wrote to the Indian government, expressing concern about extrajudicial police killings in Uttar Pradesh and noting a \"pattern\" of \"individuals allegedly being abducted or arrested before their killing, and their bodies bearing injuries indicative of torture.\" Modi's BJP is perhaps most famous for its push to make India a Hindu nation. That means prioritizing the rights of the roughly 80% of Indians who follow Hinduism \u2013 often to the detriment of the country's minorities, who include Muslims, Christians and Sikhs. In Lucknow, where the centuries-old palaces of India's past Muslim rulers still stand, a senior Muslim lawyer rattles off a long list of names of victims of police violence. Most are minorities. \"If you consider police brutality to be a crime, then crime in U.P. has actually gone up,\" says Mohammad Shoaib, 74. Muslims are arrested disproportionately in Uttar Pradesh and in India overall. They also die disproportionately in police custody \u2014 often without ever being charged with a crime. Vaishnav estimates at least 40% of those targeted, maimed or killed in police encounters in Uttar Pradesh are Muslims, even though they account for about 20% of the state's population. Faisal Husain, 18, was one of them. He died in police custody last May in his rural hometown of Bangarmau. \"After Friday prayers, he went to the market to try to sell lemons,\" his mother, Naseema Bano, who is in her 50s, says tearfully in the courtyard of her tiny brick home. \"But police hauled him away.\" Police handed Husain's body back to his family the next day, claiming he'd had a heart attack. The family says his skull was crushed. His crime: violating COVID lockdown rules.

He died in police custody. Uttar Pradesh police did not respond to NPR's requests for comment. Darapuri, the retired police inspector, says the department \"is becoming more and more subordinate to political bosses\" since Adityanath's election in 2017. Some officers may feel pressure to compete for politicians' favor, he says. \"Things have totally changed. Now, even a petty politician can threaten a senior officer, and if you do not submit to their wishes, then they will accuse you of being a follower of the other political party,\" he says. \"So the situation is very worrisome. Police are acting like muscle men of the goondas [corrupt politicians]. They are hardly bothered about their own image, nor the rights of the common man.\" Darapuri says there's also a problem with recruitment. Many police recruits come from small villages across Uttar Pradesh, where caste and clan rivalries pervade. They bring those biases with them, he says. In addition, state government data show that Adityanath's administration has hired more members of the chief minister's own Thakur caste and other dominant castes to top police jobs, over members of other castes. Adityanath, who himself faced criminal cases including murder charges earlier in his political career, is accused by opposition politicians and human rights groups of using his government powers to clear his own criminal record. As chief minister, he has clearly stated that his goal is to prioritize the safety of his state's Hindu community. That sets the tone for police, Darapuri says, and it skews crime data even more. Minorities are scared of police. They're less likely to call for help \u2014 and less likely to expect justice from the system. This scenario may sound familiar to Americans, who've had their own reckoning with police violence against minorities in recent years. \"What's slightly different in the Indian case, though, is that there's not a sense of public outrage,\" Vaishnav says. \"There are many people [in Uttar Pradesh] who are willing to tolerate police violence, police brutality, if the outcome is a perception of safer streets.\" In the case of Husain, who died in police custody last May, there's a ray of hope. \"We are very confident we'll get justice in the courts for my brother,\" says his sister Kushnuma Bano, 28. The reason she's confident is that security cameras were in the market where Husain was arrested last May, and in the police station where he was held. Some of his neighbors got hold of what they say is the footage. Mohammad Ayan, Faisal Husain's brother, sits between parents Islam Husain and Naseema Bano.

TEL AVIV \u2014 Partnering with the far-right, conservative Benjamin Netanyahu appears poised to return to power as Israel's prime minister, with most votes now counted in the country's close race. It's a blow to Israel's anti-Netanyahu bloc of parties, led by centrist Prime Minister Yair Lapid, which unseated Netanyahu last year after he spent more than a decade in power and currently faces trial for alleged corruption. \"We are on the cusp of a very big victory,\" Netanyahu \u2014 known by his nickname Bibi \u2014 told supporters after exit polls were released. They cheered, \"Bibi, King of Israel.\" His right-wing Likud Party is the clear frontrunner. His main ally, the far-right Religious Zionism party, made historic gains in Tuesday's vote, becoming the country's third-largest party. Together with Orthodox Jewish parties, they will likely be able to form a stable right-wing governing majority in parliament. Netanyahu's victory is likely because two small left-wing parties may not have received enough votes to enter parliament: the nationalist Arab party Balad and the liberal pro-LGBTQ party Meretz. If those two parties would have gotten enough votes, the race could have resulted in a stalemate and a repeat election. Vote counting may be complete later Wednesday or Thursday. Next week, Netanyahu would likely be appointed to try to form a government. Netanyahu consolidated the right-wing vote by campaigning against the ruling coalition that deposed him, which included an Arab political party for the first time in Israel's history. He called to return \"national pride\" in a Jewish state and impose tougher law enforcement against Palestinians and Palestinian citizens of Israel. \"My hopes were that the Jewish people would win and Judaism would win, and we won in the end,\" says Netanyahu voter Haim Asher. \"It doesn't matter that much who is the prime minister.

After her get-out-the-vote effort in Arab communities, she says she is considering quitting the group, disillusioned by the election results. \"All the time was holding hope, and I was really believing that I can do my job, I can make our life better, I can collect people, I can bring people together,\" Alkadi says. \"But I am sorry to tell you that I feel disconnected to the reality, and Israel's going to a sad, dark, bad place.\" An Arab Israeli voter casts her ballot at a polling station in the northern Israeli village of Maghar on Tuesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Ahmad Gharabli / AFP / Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption An Arab Israeli voter casts her ballot at a polling station in the northern Israeli village of Maghar on Tuesday. A Netanyahu-led, hard-right government is poised to introduce major changes to the checks and balances of the judiciary, which could help Netanyahu avoid imprisonment in his corruption trial, says Yohanan Plesner, director of the nonpartisan Israel Democracy Institute. \"It's a government that's expected to have an unprecedented agenda that will, if implemented, contribute to an erosion of Israeli democracy,\" Plesner says. Anti-Netanyahu voters have posted gloomy memes on social media. \"It's sort of despair,\" says Marik Shtern, a political analyst and unhappy voter. \"The country is going into a very clear direction of nationalism and religious extremism ... but we will be OK. The problem will be with the Palestinian citizens of Israel, the Palestinians in the West Bank. All of them are in a near danger for the near future.\" Unlike Palestinian citizens living in Israel, Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza do not have voting rights in Israel. In a statement, Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh said his people would suffer from Israeli policies no matter who won elections. \"The difference between the Israeli parties,\" he said, \"is the same as the difference between Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola.\"",

This surveillance photo of Secor is cited in the government's application for a search warrant. On Jan. 6, 2021, Christian Secor, a student at UCLA, broke into the U.S. Capitol along with hundreds of rioters, entered the Senate chamber while carrying the flag of an extremist anti-immigrant and antisemitic movement, and sat in the chair recently vacated by former Vice President Mike Pence. Not long after, Secor posted on Twitter that Trump supporters should be \"proud\" of the Capitol riot, in which more than 140 police officers were injured. \"One day accomplished more for conservativism than the last 30 years,\" he wrote. On Wednesday, the 24-year-old Secor was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison. Earlier this year, he pleaded guilty to obstruction of an official proceeding, a felony. Judge Trevor McFadden, who was nominated to the federal court by former President Donald Trump, said Secor's conduct was, \"about as blatant and obstructive as any [he's] seen from that day that didn't include actual violence.\" The probation office recommended a decrease in the sentencing guidelines due to Secor accepting responsibility for his actions, and the defense submitted letters in support of Secor's remorse. However, McFadden told Secor, \"I'm not sure I've really seen that from you, sir.\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Kimberly Paschall, the prosecutor in the case, emphasized Secor's enthusiasm for guns and his involvement with America First, which the government called an extremist group. \"It is that ideology, coupled with action, that concerns the government,\" Paschall said. She also said that Secor's specific presence in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office, and in Vice President Mike Pence's chair on the Senate Floor, were concerning given his prior comments about civil war. That context, Paschall said, \"makes him more culpable in the eyes of the government than someone who walked in, saw the rotunda, and left.\" The Department of Justice had asked the court to sentence Secor to just under 5 years in prison. In addition to storming the Capitol, prosecutors had raised concerns about Secor's large purchases from firearms and tactical gear retailers, a GoPro video in which he wielded an AR-15-style rifle in his room, and his discussion in text messages of conducting \"future operations\" that were \"ultra secret\" after Jan. 6. At his hearing, Secor declined to speak, other than to say that the \"operation\" referred to in those messages referred to a business idea rather than any violence. Prosecutors also said that six days after the riot, an associate texted Secor about buying guns: \"hey bro do you make any Glocks or AR for sale?\" \"Never say anything remotely of that nature on an unsecure [sic] line. We are in a civil war,\" Secor allegedly responded. \"The short answer is no.\" Secor also allegedly searched on Google, \"can you find a guns owner with serial number.\" Secor's attorney, Brandi Harden, told the court that Secor \"enjoys the ability to put together guns in a legal way,\" but that it's not relevant to the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol. She also made clear that Secor did not bring a gun to the Capitol. \"If his plan was to take over, as the government wants you to believe, he could have packed it,\" Harden said. Secor had asked for a sentence of two years' probation, with no prison time. His defense attorney noted that he did not commit any violence during the Capitol riot, and argued that his young age weighed in favor of leniency, citing research on the development of the brain's prefrontal cortex into a person's 20s. \"This late development of the prefrontal cortex can explain in part, but not excuse, why Christian may have made the choices he did on January 6,\" his attorney wrote. \"His lack of maturity, along with his lack of judgment, led him to where he is today.\" While at UCLA, Secor led a campus group called the America First Bruins - named for the school's mascot, as well as an extremist movement led by a far-right livestreamer named Nick Fuentes. Nick Fuentes (left) shakes hands with Christian Secor (right) in a photo cited by the Department of Justice in its criminal case against Secor. Fuentes is a far-right extremist podcaster who has repeatedly engaged in Holocaust denial. A student activist at UCLA saved the photo from Secor's Twitter feed, which has since been deleted.\n                \n                    \n                    Twitter\n                    \n                \nhide caption Fuentes, in the words of DOJ prosecutors, \"is a public figure known for making racist statements, celebrating fascism, and promoting white supremacy.\" He has expressed support for domestic violence against women, and promoted tenets of Holocaust denial. His followers often refer to themselves as \"Groypers,\" a reference to the \"Pepe The Frog\" meme that became popular on the far-right. Secor advanced Fuentes' political movement at UCLA, and also made anti-immigrant and antisemitic comments, according to court documents and interviews with other students. In tweets cited by prosecutors, Secor said that fascism \"sounds epic\" and said while he supported \"nationalism,\" he did not support \"extreme Jewish over representation in politically relevant sectors.\" After Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, Fuentes helped organize \"Stop The Steal\" protests, and cheered on the crowd of Trump supporters in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 6. He called it a \"glorious day\" and said \"the Capitol Siege was f***ing awesome.\" The congressional committee investigating the attack on the Capitol issued a subpoena to Fuentes for documents and testimony. Fuentes has not been criminally charged in connection with the Capitol riot. In addition to Secor, federal prosecutors have brought charges on a handful of other followers of Fuentes who allegedly breached the Capitol. UCLA student Oona Flood raised concerns about Secor and his extreme rhetoric on campus before he participated in the Capitol riot. Reached by phone on Wednesday after Secor's sentencing, Flood said they hoped the prison sentence sends a message to far-right students that, \"just because you're young, you can't get away with everything.\" Flood, however, warned that extremist rhetoric at UCLA has not abated since the Capitol riot and the charges against Secor. \"They're just as radical as before,\" said Flood, who now leads UCLA's college Democrats. Despite Flood's reservations about the criminal justice system, they said, \"at least there's been some semblance of justice.\"",

People say we haven't been this divided since the Civil War. But you don't have to go back that far to find the dis-United States. Look to the 1960s for a nation beset by political violence, cultural convulsions and rage in the streets. NPR tracked down people who were activists and witnesses of the anti-war movement and the civil rights struggle, who today are watching with dismay as the country is again torn asunder. We asked them to reflect on 2020s America compared to 1960s America. In general, figures from the counterculture movement cited pervasive misinformation as a striking feature of the new divide. Participants in the civil rights movement are alarmed at the setbacks to hard-earned racial progress: police and civilian shootings of unarmed Black people, the massacres of Black worshippers in Charleston, S.C.,  and Black supermarket shoppers in Buffalo, N.Y., a White House that courted white nationalism, the Confederate battle flag paraded through the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, and new state voting restrictions transparently aimed at Democrat-leaning Black communities.

Bennie Thompson, chair of the Jan. 6 Committee, speaks virtually during a hearing on July 21.\n                \n                    \n                    Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Bennie Thompson, chair of the Jan. 6 Committee, speaks virtually during a hearing on July 21. In the opening moments of the Jan. 6 Committee hearings, Chairman Bennie Thompson drew a line across history, connecting the Lost Cause to the Big Lie. \"I'm from a part of the country where people justify the actions of slavery, the Ku Klux Klan and lynching,\" Thompson began. \"I'm reminded of that dark history as I hear voices today try and justify the actions of the insurrectionists on Jan. 6, 2021.\" The Lost Cause is the racist myth that justifies chattel slavery. It tells a false story of generous slave owners and happy slaves, as well as lies that the Civil War wasn't really fought over slavery \u2014 it was about states' rights. Everything that follows, the nadir of American race relations, the violent dismantling of Reconstruction, Jim Crow, the rise of the Ku Klux Klan, the erections of Confederate monuments and the conflation of a treasonous Confederate flag with patriotism, are all in the name of this Lost Cause. The Big Lie has come to mean the lie that Donald Trump won the 2020 presidential election but that it was stolen from him. It was a lie so large that it drove the insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, and extended out to include another lie, one that painted the violent attempt to overturn the election as a peaceful protest. Just as the Lost Cause denied the brutal racism of slavery in order to perpetuate violent inequity through other means, at the heart of the Big Lie is also a drive to protect a racist order, according to Stanford University political scientist Hakeem Jefferson. Jefferson says both the Lost Cause and the Big Lie are myths meant to justify \u2014 and at the same time deny the existence of \u2014 violence meant to preserve white power. Thompson's direct mention of race and America's legacy of racism at the top of the hearings was a bit of an aberration. There has been little direct mention of race during the televised hearings, which paused in August and are set to resume in September. While not a criminal trial, the proceedings have had a legal laser focus, to show the culpability of the former president. But just the symbolism of Thompson at the helm of the hearings places race and history on display, Jefferson says. \"How striking to see someone who looks like Bennie Thompson wield this amount of institutional power, against a person like Donald Trump, who is awash in the markings of whiteness and privilege and all that it affords.\" Trump, born into his wealth, has previously peddled a racist conspiracy theory denying the legitimacy of the nation's first Black president. Thompson got his start in politics registering Black people to vote in Mississippi during the civil rights movement. It's Thompson's very Black Southern-ness that allows him to \"weave into this narrative, both explicitly and implicitly by way of his identity, how much this has to do about race,\" Jefferson says. \"It's not by some dent of the universe or some sort of random act that the faces that we see in these photographs and videos from Jan. 6 are a bunch of white people,\" Jefferson says. \"We were watching, in real time, a racial backlash.\" More precisely, he says, it is part of a white backlash against the very perception of racial progress and the idea, unrealized though it may be, of multiracial democracy. \"Some white people are really concerned about a loss of power and status in American society,\" Jefferson says. Jefferson says at the center of the Jan. 6 insurrection is the maintenance of white power. But not all white power cloaks itself in a white hood. \"It is also about the power to tell a narrative of one's self and one's identity group,\" he says. \"The power some white people want to hold onto is a power of narrative.\" \"So it's not about power that's maintained by burning crosses. It's about power that's maintained about telling some stories and not some others in schools,\" he says. \"It's about power to elect people who you think will do your bidding.\" It is also about power, Jefferson says, that has been wielded explicitly through the disenfranchisement of others. When Republicans \"talk about protecting 'our' country and making sure 'our' country isn't taken away from us by other people,\" Jefferson says, \"the 'our' is doing some work here.\" \"What's implied is that this country is moving in a direction where white people have less power.\" Supporters of President Donald Trump take the steps on the east side of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n                \n                    \n                    NurPhoto via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supporters of President Donald Trump take the steps on the east side of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. That, says political scientist Robert Pape, is what drove the events of Jan. 6, 2021. \"What we are really observing are the consequences of the fear of white status decline,\" Pape says. Pape, the director of the Chicago Project on Security & Threats, has been researching those who were arrested for storming the Capitol, digging into the data of who was there that day. The results have surprised him. \"Of the over 800 people who have been arrested on Jan. 6, we see a striking pattern,\" he says. The pattern? \"They don't fit the profile of a far-right extremist.\" At Fox News, Tucker Carlson, who has peddled variations of the Big Lie, has consistently denied that the Jan. 6 insurrection had anything to do with race. A few months after the riot at the Capitol, he spoke to his nightly average of 3 million viewers: \"There's no evidence that white supremacists were responsible for what happened on Jan. 6. That's a lie,\" he said. \"Contrary to what you've been hearing, there's also no evidence that this was a, quote, 'armed insurrection.' \" Except there is evidence on both counts. In June of this year, Carlson again reiterated the building blocks of the Big Lie to his audience, both in denying the culpability of the pro-Trump Jan. 6 crowd, hinting that FBI agents were planted in it, and in suggesting the 2020 election was compromised. \"A lot of the protesters on Jan. 6 were very upset about that, and they should have been, all of us should be,\" he ranted. \"But the Jan. 6 Committee ignored all of that completely. Instead, on the basis of zero evidence, no evidence whatsoever, they blamed the entire riot on white supremacy.\" Unpacking almost anything Carlson says is like having to undo a Russian nesting doll of falsehoods, dangerous innuendos and outright lies. The Jan. 6 Committee has very carefully not come out and blamed the riot on white supremacy. In fact, it has had a light to almost nonexistent touch when addressing the role of race in the insurrection. Instead, the committee has carefully crafted a credible narrative that blames Trump's lies about a stolen election for riling up the crowd. But why was this crowd so susceptible to those lies, and why did they act so violently in response to them? That, says political scientist Pape, has everything to do with race and the preservation of white supremacy. While members of violent extremist groups like the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers certainly helped plot the attack and were mixed in among the swelling crowds, \"nearly 90%\" of the people arrested for their actions on Jan. 6 \"are not members of these militant extremist groups,\" Pape says. They were mostly white and mostly men, but other factors are markedly different: \"We see that over half of those charged with breaking into the Capitol are business owners, CEOs, are from white-collar occupations \u2014 doctors, lawyers, architects, accountants,\" Pape says. Most traveled to Washington from their homes in suburbs and cities, places that Joe Biden won. And this is what is so key, Pape says. The ZIP codes that the insurrections call home \"are the parts of the country where diversity is happening the fastest.\" \"The counties that lost the most non-Hispanic white population are the counties that produced the most Jan. 6 insurrectionists,\" Pape says. They came from places that used to be almost all white and aren't anymore. Pape says that this fact parallels another recent incident of explicitly racist violence: a white supremacist's targeting and killing of 10 Black people at a Tops supermarket in Buffalo, N.Y., this May. The shooter went to a supermarket in a Black neighborhood of a diverse city to commit a racist massacre. But the place he came from, Broome County, is small, population-wise, but has a rapidly shifting population. \"It's in the top 15% of counties who have lost non-Hispanic white population since 2010,\" Pape says. Broome County, like many of the places that produced insurrectionists, is becoming less and less white. Pape says people, like the shooter and the Jan. 6 insurrectionists, are being radicalized online and by right-wing media and politicians. Taken together with living in places that are no longer white spaces, it creates a toxic mix. \"This is dovetailing with rhetoric by politicians and by media figures \u2014 stoking fear about the great replacement,\" he says. The racism of replacement theory, a conspiracy theory peddled by the likes of Carlson, purports that people of color are replacing white people as part of a nefarious Democratic plan to take power and steal elections. And it is no longer a fringe ideology; it's now believed by a majority of Republicans. Nearly 7 out of 10 Republicans believe replacement theory ideas, a recent poll from the Southern Poverty Law Center found. Pape's research shows that the driving force among the insurrectionists \u2014 and those who support them \u2014 is replacement theory. The conspiracy theory is a racist lie, but the fear it stokes is real \u2014 fear that the white majority is becoming a minority and will have to give up power. And that isn't just driving elections and politics, Pape says. It's driving violence. \"What's dangerous is when a group like this begins to adopt the mindset or the rhetoric of an oppressed minority,\" says Jefferson, the Stanford political scientist. Jefferson says when members of a group that still holds very real privilege, like white people, imagine themselves on the margins \u2014 that is precisely the moment when violent white nationalism takes hold. Race has been a subtext in much of the Jan. 6 Committee hearings, simmering beneath the surface. Most of the witnesses have been Republicans and Trump loyalists, telling their story of that day and the days leading up to it, often from the inside. The story presented has been that of a petulant, out-of-control president, desperate to hold onto power. But there is one notable exception: Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Shaye Moss. \"I've always been told by my grandmother,\" Moss told the committee and the country, her voice shaking slightly, \"how important it is to vote and how people before me, a lot of people, older people in my family, did not have that right.\" Moss and her mother are Black women, and both were poll workers during the 2020 elections. Moss told the committee she loved her job and she was proud to help people vote, especially older folks. Her job was not partisan; she didn't work in the service of one party or another. Her work was to help average, everyday voters, to facilitate the small moments that make democracy function. Then she was falsely and publicly accused by Trump of tampering with votes. After he called out her and her mother by name, they were bombarded with death threats and racist harassment. Jefferson says these two women represent the opposite of people in power \u2014 they represent the right of the average person to vote. \"So many Black people, Black women in particular, work on these front lines of democracy,\" he says. Shaye Moss, a former Georgia election worker, is comforted by her mother, Ruby Freeman, as Moss testifies during a hearing of the Jan. 6 Committee on June 21.\n                \n                    \n                    Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Shaye Moss, a former Georgia election worker, is comforted by her mother, Ruby Freeman, as Moss testifies during a hearing of the Jan. 6 Committee on June 21. They often do so, Jefferson says, because voting is a right that for many was achieved only in recent memory. Black people have an intimate understanding of how precious \u2014 and how fragile \u2014 the right to vote has been and still is. Increasingly fragile, Jefferson says, because America's incomplete multiracial democracy is in grave peril. The Jan. 6 insurrection was not, in the end, a successful coup. But, Jefferson says, the spectacle of that day both reveals and conceals much more subtle threats. \"Americans are really responsive to the spectacular,\" he says. \"The problem for us is that democracy dies not often in these moments of the spectacular.\" Instead, it dies \"in these sort of incremental or seemingly legal \u2014 or at least procedural \u2014 ways of taking away and short-circuiting democracy.\" That slow-moving threat is happening right now, Jefferson says, and it's being driven by the Republican Party. The Supreme Court is set to take a case that could allow a fringe legal theory to give state legislatures control of elections, leaving the choice of who gets power in the hands of those who already have it. Because of gerrymandering, many state legislatures don't function as representative democracies, especially as maps are drawn to dilute and diminish the votes of people of color. A temporary Supreme Court ruling this February made it even more difficult to push back against deliberate racial gerrymandering. And then there are voter suppression laws, like some of the ones now on the books in Georgia, overseen by Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. When Raffensperger spoke at one of the Jan. 6 Committee hearings, he was lauded and applauded for standing up for democracy and against Trump. But back in his home state of Georgia, he is championing laws that make it harder for people of color to vote. \"January the 6th was a racial project,\" Jefferson says. \"But the everyday undos and attacks on American democracy are also a part of a racial project.\" It is a racial project as old as the Lost Cause, reborn in the Big Lie. The project has always been about maintaining white power, often at the expense of democracy itself. It is part of a larger battle that has never really ended, over whose votes get counted and whose votes get to count. To Jefferson, race is not just the elephant in the room during the Jan. 6 Committee hearings. \"It's the whole damn room,\" he says. \"This is all about race all the time.\"",

            "article_content": "People watch TV news reporting Japan's former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was shot, in Tokyo, Friday, July 8, 2022.\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption People watch TV news reporting Japan's former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was shot, in Tokyo, Friday, July 8, 2022. TOKYO \u2014 Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a divisive arch-conservative and one of his nation's most powerful and influential figures, has died after being shot during a campaign speech Friday in western Japan, hospital officials said. Abe, 67, was shot from behind minutes after he started his speech in Nara. He was airlifted to a hospital for emergency treatment but was not breathing and his heart had stopped. He was later pronounced dead despite emergency treatment that included massive blood transfusions, hospital officials said. Police arrested the suspected gunman at the scene of an attack that shocked many in Japan, which is one of the world's safest nations and has some of the strictest gun control laws anywhere. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and his Cabinet ministers hastily returned to Tokyo from campaign events around the country after the shooting, which he called \"dastardly and barbaric.\" Nara Medical University emergency department chief Hidetada Fukushima said Abe suffered major damage to his heart in addition to two neck wounds that damaged an artery, causing extensive bleeding. He was in a state of cardio and pulmonary arrest when he arrived at the hospital and never regained his vital signs, Fukushima said. Abe was Japan's longest-serving leader before stepping down in 2020. Public television NHK aired a dramatic video of Abe giving a speech outside a train station in the western city of Nara. He is standing, dressed in a navy blue suit, raising his fist, when two gunshots are heard. The video then shows Abe collapsed on the street, with security guards running toward him. He holds his chest, his shirt smeared with blood. In the next moment, security guards leap on top of a man in gray shirt who lies face down on the pavement. A double-barreled device that appeared to be a handmade gun is seen on the ground. Nara prefectural police confirmed the arrest of Tetsuya Yamagami, 41, on suspicion of attempted murder. NHK reported that the suspect served in the Maritime Self-Defense Force for three years in the 2000s. Other videos from the scene showed campaign officials surrounding Abe. The former leader was still highly influential in the governing Liberal Democratic Party and headed its largest faction, Seiwakai. Elections for Japan's upper house, the less powerful chamber of its parliament, are Sunday. \"I use the harshest words to condemn (the act),\" Kishida said as he struggled to control his emotions. He said the government planned to review the security situation, but added that Abe had the highest protection. Opposition leaders condemned the attack as a challenge to Japan's democracy. In Tokyo, people stopped on the street to grab extra editions of newspapers or watch TV coverage of the shooting. When he resigned as prime minister, Abe said he had a recurrence of the ulcerative colitis he'd had since he was a teenager. He told reporters at the time that it was \"gut wrenching\" to leave many of his goals unfinished. He spoke of his failure to resolve the issue of Japanese abducted years ago by North Korea, a territorial dispute with Russia and a revision of Japan's war-renouncing constitution. That last goal was a big reason he was such a divisive figure. His ultra-nationalism riled the Koreas and China, and his push to create what he saw as a more normal defense posture angered many Japanese. Abe failed to achieve his cherished goal of formally rewriting the U.S.-drafted pacifist constitution because of poor public support. Loyalists said that his legacy was a stronger U.S.-Japan relationship that was meant to bolster Japan's defense capability. But Abe made enemies by forcing his defense goals and other contentious issues through parliament, despite strong public opposition. Abe was a political blue blood who was groomed to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather, former Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi. His political rhetoric often focused on making Japan a \"normal\" and \"beautiful\" nation with a stronger military and bigger role in international affairs. Many foreign officials expressed shock over the shooting. Abe said he was proud of working while leader for a stronger Japan-U.S. security alliance and shepherding the first visit by a serving U.S. president to the atom-bombed city of Hiroshima. He also helped Tokyo gain the right to host the 2020 Olympics by pledging that a disaster at the Fukushima nuclear plant was \"under control\" when it was not. Abe became Japan's youngest prime minister in 2006, at age 52, but his overly nationalistic first stint abruptly ended a year later, also because of his health. The end of Abe's scandal-laden first stint as prime minister was the beginning of six years of annual leadership change, remembered as an era of \"revolving door\" politics that lacked stability and long-term policies. When he returned to office in 2012, Abe vowed to revitalize the nation and get its economy out of its deflationary doldrums with his \"Abenomics\" formula, which combines fiscal stimulus, monetary easing and structural reforms. He won six national elections and built a rock-solid grip on power, bolstering Japan's defense role and capability and its security alliance with the U.S. He also stepped up patriotic education at schools and raised Japan's international profile.",

            "article_content": "The House select committee hearings on the Jan. 6 insurrection began earlier this month and have already revealed new facts and information about the assault on the U.S. Capitol and the people involved. The committee is presenting the findings of its investigation into President Donald Trump's responsibility in the attempted coup, the fake electors scheme, financial support of the insurrection, right-wing groups that breached the Capitol, and which witnesses failed to cooperate with the select committee. To help you better understand these findings as they're presented over the next few weeks, we've compiled a list of books on the events of Jan. 6 and its aftermath. On the last day of 2020, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland lost his only son, Tommy Raskin, who died by suicide. A week later, Raskin was at the Capitol when it was attacked by an armed and violent mob attempting to undermine the 2020 presidential election results. Fueled by his son's values and memory, Raskin pushed through his grief to lead the impeachment effort against President Trump for inciting the violence. In his intimate, vulnerable memoir, Raskin details the impeachment prosecution that led to a historic bipartisan vote on Trump's role in the attack against the government and discusses the dire threats American democracy faces. He gives a harrowing account of the events of Jan. 6 from inside the Capitol and navigates his personal and professional trauma in his fight to defend American democratic principles. In the two months leading up to Jan. 6, Trump, his allies and his supporters tried to reverse the presidential vote results, based on false election fraud claims. Veteran reporters Mark Bowden and Matthew Teague document the rise of this conspiracy, focusing on six key states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The Steal is a thoroughly reported collection of stories about the local officials who stood resolute against accusations of falsifying election results in the face of threats, distrust and personal attacks. Many heroes of the book are conservatives \u2014 and include Trump supporters \u2014 who made sure every vote was counted. These portraits create a snapshot of how elections are run state by state and county by county \u2014 and of the core honesty and patriotism of the people who oversee them. Understanding the Constitution \u2014 and what acts violate it \u2014 will be key to the hearings. The line between patriotism and treason can be blurry, which is why The Oath and the Office is a good read to help make sense of the Capitol insurrection and its relationship to the Constitution. Constitutional law scholar and political science professor Corey Brettschneider analyzes the document \u2014 its articles and amendments \u2014 as well as legal cases to help readers better understand the powers granted to the presidency, and what the president can and cannot do. He also describes the ways \"we the people\" can influence the office of the presidency. President Trump's final year in office was marked by chaos as he struggled to respond to COVID-19 and threatened to send federal troops to quell Black Lives Matter protests after the death of George Floyd. Pulitzer Prize-winning reporters Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker hone in on witnesses, key players around Trump, who were in the room when he made decisions that doomed his presidency. I Alone Can Fix It is a window into Trump's behavior and thought process leading up to Jan. 6. The reports provide crucial insight into who empowered Trump and his decisions, and who thwarted them. They shed light on how former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani urged Trump to declare himself the winner in the 2020 elections, and how Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, discouraged the use of force in several situations. The book concludes with a detailed, minute-by-minute account of the breaching of the Capitol building on Jan. 6. Based on more than 200 interviews and 6,000 transcripts, Peril details the political turmoil and challenges of the transition of power from Donald Trump to Joe Biden. Bob Woodward and Robert Costa report on the days leading up to and following the Capitol siege, from the roles Trump and Republican officials played in the assault to Biden's struggles in handling the ongoing pandemic, economic woes, crippling partisan divide and the crisis in Afghanistan. These in-depth accounts give an intimate side-by-side contrast of the two presidents and not just their policies, but also how they treat their staff and associates. They portray Trump as aggressive and intolerant, compared to Biden, who is chummy and benign, perhaps to a fault. An end to the remarkable \"Trump trilogy\" by Woodward \u2013 the other two are Rage and Fear \u2014 this is a story of the events that came before the Jan. 6 insurrection, how officials like Milley and others sought to block Trump and how Biden has tried to pick up the pieces. Similar to Peril, This Will Not Pass recounts the end of a presidency and the beginning of another, covering Trump's attack on the 2020 election to Biden's struggle to consolidate his Democratic colleagues. On top of comparing the presidents, this book emphasizes the Republican party's deference to Trump and the exhaustion of a country burdened by national traumas. One thing that is particularly noteworthy about this book is that examines Trump's vengeance against Republican leaders who renounced him after Jan. 6. Even now, more than a year after the end of his presidency, Trump's influence still runs deep within the GOP. New records give background on how notable Republican leaders, such as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, privately supported punitive measures against Trump, but later rescinded their criticisms. Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns expose the pitfalls of the American two-party system and examine whether the tumultuous clash between the parties has damaged the fabric of our democracy to the point of no return. Members of the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, Three Percenters and QAnon were among the crowd that descended on the nation's capital to stop Congress from certifying Biden's victory, rising to prominence along with Trump. Investigative reporter David A. Neiwart conducted years of research to document the growth of these far-right ideologies. He notes important figures such as Steve Bannon, Milo Yiannopoulos and Alex Jones, who Neiwart argues have used the right-wing media to cultivate these philosophies of white supremacy and xenophobia. Once regarded as nuts and zealots, these men \u2014 and their followers \u2014 went mainstream, feeding off conspiracy theories, white nationalism and deep distrust of government. As we find out more during the hearings about the planning and motivation of groups involved in the insurrection, Alt-America can shed light on their emergence and deep roots in America.",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump speaks during the American Freedom Tour on Saturday in Austin, Texas.\n                \n                    \n                    Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former President Donald Trump speaks during the American Freedom Tour on Saturday in Austin, Texas. Following the shooting in Buffalo, N.Y., focus has been trained on the \"replacement\" theory, also known as \"white replacement\" theory. That's because a white man, who killed 10 Black people and injured three others, posted a 180-page document online that promulgated racist conspiracy theories often referred to as the \"great replacement.\" And he allegedly used the conspiratorial idea that minorities were and would be replacing whites as a reason to justify what he did. The FBI is investigating it as a hate crime. \"I want to be clear, for my part, from everything we know, this was a targeted attack, a hate crime, and an act of racially motivated violent extremism,\" FBI Director Christopher Wray said Monday. \"Replacement\" theory began in white supremacist circles, but has since moved more mainstream on the political right in this country and among many Republicans, explicitly or implicitly. We explore that and how former President Donald Trump used it for political gain in a Q&A with an expert below, but, first, some background. It can be seen by implication, for example, at least as far back as the \"White Hands\" ad that late North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms ran during his 1990 reelection campaign. \"You needed that job, and you were the best qualified, but they had to give it to a minority because of a racial quota,\" a narrator in the ad says as a man crumples up a piece of paper. The country has become browner and more diverse. In 1990, for example, the population of whites not of Hispanic origin was about 76% of the U.S. population. Today, that is down to 60%. Whites are heading toward minority status in the United States, even if all immigration was shut down today. In 2018, U.S. Census estimates showed for the first time that whites dropped to below 50% of the under-15 population. That change is largely due to migration of Latinos and Asian Americans. Latinos are the largest-growing group, while Asian Americans are the fastest growing. \"I believe without a shadow of a doubt this is the last election,\" former Rep. Michele Bachmann, who failed to win the GOP presidential nomination in 2012, told the Christian Broadcasting Network's David Brody three months before the 2016 presidential election. \"This is it. This is the last election. And the reason why I say that, David, is because it's a math problem. It's a math problem of demographics and a changing United States.\" That's right in line with \"replacement\" theory, and Trump \u2014 who made immigration the foundation of his 2016 presidential campaign and arguably catered to and weaponized white grievance unlike any candidate in U.S. history \u2014 ran with it. \"I think this will be the last election that the Republicans have a chance of winning,\" Trump told Brody backstage at the Values Voter Summit shortly after Bachmann made the remarks, \"because you're going to have people flowing across the border, you're going to have illegal immigrants coming in, and they're going to be legalized, and they're going to be able to vote and once that all happens you can forget it.\" After Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, in an effort to bolster his lie that he actually won when he didn't, he lied and said there were \"illegal immigrant voters\" in the election, which, of course, is not true. Trump was later kicked off Twitter for the amount of misinformation and disinformation he was putting on the platform. Republicans have become more explicit about embracing the actual words, helped by the amplification of Fox News, particularly prime-time host Tucker Carlson. Rather than implying it, as many on the right previously had, Carlson is explicit \u2014 even if he denies somehow that he's talking about the \"racist fantasy,\" as he called it. But just look at his words: \"I know that the left and all the little gatekeepers on Twitter become literally hysterical if you use the term 'replacement,'\" Carlson said in April 2021, \"if you suggest that the Democratic Party is trying to replace the current electorate, the voters now casting ballots with new people, more obedient voters from the third world. But they become hysterical because that's what's happening actually.\" After that, the Anti-Defamation League called for Carlson to be pulled off the air. That prompted Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., to actually call the Anti-Defamation League \"a racist organization.\" .@TuckerCarlson is CORRECT about Replacement Theory as he explains what is happening to America.The ADL is a racist organization. https://t.co/32Vu60HrJK Carlson's employer, Fox News, defended its most-watched host. And then, here was Carlson in September: \"In political terms, this policy is called the 'great replacement,' the replacement of legacy Americans with more obedient people from faraway countries.\" Fox continues to defend Carlson, saying he does not advocate violence. Fox also successfully defended him in court in a 2020 defamation case, saying, he literally can't be believed. After the Buffalo shooting, Republican Reps. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Liz Cheney of Wyoming pointed at GOP leadership for enabling this attitude among their lawmakers and voters. Kinzinger specifically called out House No. 3 GOP leader Elise Stefanik of New York, saying she \"pushes white replacement theory.\" The criticism centers on Facebook ads Stefanik's campaign committee ran, one of which read: \"Radical Democrats are planning their most aggressive move yet: a PERMANENT ELECTION INSURRECTION. Their plan to grant amnesty to 11 MILLION illegal immigrants will overthrow our current electorate and create a permanent liberal majority in Washington.\" Stefanik, an upstate New York congresswoman, decried the shooting in Buffalo, but pinned it on an uptick in \"violent crime\" rather than the racist ideology to which the shooter ascribed. \"Any implication or attempt to blame the heinous shooting in Buffalo on the Congresswoman is a new disgusting low for the Left, their Never Trump allies, and the sycophant stenographers in the media,\" Stefanik senior adviser Alex DeGrasse said in a statement. \"The shooting was an act of evil and the criminal should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\" On Monday morning, Stefanik tweeted: \"Democrats desperately want wide open borders and mass amnesty for illegals allowing them to vote.\" Democrats \u2014 and some Republicans \u2014 say it's not about electoral politics, but that there's a broken immigration system that needs to be fixed with a path to citizenship for those immigrants in the U.S. illegally to come out of the shadows \u2014 and pay taxes. It wasn't long ago that then-President George W. Bush, a former border-state governor (Texas), as well as the late Sen. John McCain, also from a border state (Arizona), advocated for comprehensive immigration reform. During the Obama administration, a comprehensive plan actually passed the Senate with 68 votes, including many Republicans. But that was nearly a decade ago. Trump ran on building \"the wall,\" and the GOP hardline on immigration, which had always been latent, took hold as the party's policy \u2014 and a principal motivator to get the base to the polls. The sentiment is catching on, especially among Republicans. A recent, large-sample AP/NORC poll found that a third of respondents agreed that there is a group of people in this country who are trying to replace native-born Americans with immigrants who agree with their political views. Almost half of Republicans said so, compared to about one in five self-identified Democrats. Belief that replacement is happening is also higher among viewers of right-wing media like OANN, Newsmax and Fox News than other outlets. Casey Kelly \u2014 a professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln who has studied Trump's language and is the author of Apocalypse man: The death drive and the rhetoric of white masculine victimhood \u2014 helped explain. This conversation took place months before the Buffalo shooting, but just after a rally in which Trump said that white people were being asked to get to the \"back of the line\" for therapeutics in New York \u2014 something that was far exaggerated. The Q&A has been lightly edited for clarity and length: MONTANARO: Where did \"white replacement\" theory or the \"great replacement\" theory begin and how much has Trump been pushing it, at least implicitly? KELLY: Certainly in white supremacist circles there's been a longstanding theory of white genocide or the great replacement, which is that by way of immigration laws that bring over large numbers of, quote, and I use this term of quotations, of high-fertility immigrants, meaning the idea that they are more likely to reproduce at greater rates than white populations, that that's an intentional effort to replace white people with diversity, with different people from different countries and people from different racial backgrounds. And that is longstanding. There's lots of different roots, both in European white nationalism and American white nationalism, of that theory making its way throughout the culture. And what's interesting is that I don't know to what extent he's [Trump] aware of it, but I certainly know that his arguments are consistent. If people are steeped in that culture, if they're aware of this this idea-- and people like Tucker Carlson will sort of trot out these talking points that came from white nationalists on his own show. So they do have a mainstream presence. But he doesn't sort of call them that or cite them in a way that explicitly references it. But that's where that theory originates. And so when he talks about issues of displacement and replacement, that certainly resonates with people who, if they are steeped in white supremacist discourse, have absolutely heard this idea. And they're having the [former] president of the country who is also aligning and saying things that are, if they're not directly referencing it, are consistent with that theory. MONTANARO: How does Trump capitalize on feelings of white resentment? KELLY: One of the, I think, primary appeals of Trump is that he basically could take these abstract feelings of being dispossessed and displaced. And these are feelings that were felt over the decades, where automation and outsourcing were essentially destroying the Rust Belt of America, the places where there was manufacturing and industry in the United States. And that is a structural transformation in the economy that, while it happens to affect people in rural America, it was not designed as an explicit attempt to dispossess white Americans \u2014 even though that was the effect it's tended to have. And so what he tends to do is to frame that dispossession of rural America. He attempts to frame it as if it were an explicit, racially motivated discrimination against white people, a sort of reverse discrimination or victimage. And he, of course, sort of blames Democrats for this, that it was a sort of systematic, structural effort to dispossess white America, to displace America, as they knew it. And so what he does \u2014 what he did \u2014 that is both troubling but also is effective, is he reframed the experiences of alienation that many people in rural America have, the belief that the culture doesn't reflect who they are anymore and that there are a lot of difference in otherness that they don't quite understand. And that's happening concurrently with a burgeoning opioid crisis combined with the collapse of infrastructure and manufacturing and good quality union jobs in rural areas of the country. He enables them to view that as a systematic dispossession, that it's by design to hurt them, because it's an effort by progressives to institute their version of America, which is supposedly fundamentally different than their version of America. And what he offers then is to alleviate their victimhood by putting them first, saying that for a change \u2014 they've been told that \"they have white privilege\" and that \"whiteness is a problem\" \u2014 but what has happened is that it's resulted in discrimination against white people. And so the way that he sells what is objectively bad things that are happening to people in rural America, he reframes them in a way that makes them feel like it's an identity politics, that actually there's a concerted effort on the part of progressives to supplant the values of rural white America with progressive values that don't necessarily match with their understanding of what America is \u2014 and that it's a purposeful effort and that it's malicious, that it's evil in its intent to displace white Americans. And so what he gets them to do is think about themselves as victims of this social change that, while regrettable in many ways, were not explicitly designed as racial discrimination against white people. MONTANARO: He seems to have knack for identifying the things that will particularly play well as grievances. KELLY: Trump seems to have a nose for white victimhood, meaning that he is very effective at finding issues that can easily be reframed as reverse discrimination against white people, meaning that he can sniff out white resentment, and he can tap into it by pointing out the ways in which certain kinds of social, economic, cultural and political change, whether they be the restructuring of the U.S. economy from outsourcing or whether they be a culture-war issue like the \"war on Christmas\" or about Confederate monuments and people wanting to take away people's history, he can find those moments that are big changes that may displace certain views of America that change and evolve America. He is really good at representing those as a systemic effort to displace and discriminate against white people, which makes him so effective at garnering white resentment. MONTANARO: Trump, of course, wouldn't be president if this line of reasoning didn't resonate with a base of supporters. Race seems to be at the underpinning of all of this. What should people know about that? KELLY: I don't think that all of his supporters are racist. Really, what I think that what he does well is he frames issues that that sort of allows people to see their identities as being aggrieved in the way that other racial identities in America are aggrieved. And so what he does effectively, I think, is permit white people who may have no overt white supremacist commitments to think about themselves as being discriminated against the same way that Latinos or African Americans may have been discriminated against. And therefore, they have entitlement to some sort of redress.",

COLOMBO, Sri Lanka \u2014 Sherry Fonseka joined millions in 2019 in electing President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, a military strategist whose brutal campaign helped end Sri Lanka's 30-year civil war 10 years earlier. Now he is one of thousands who, for weeks, have protested outside the president's office, calling on Rajapaksa and his brother, Mahinda, who is prime minister, to resign for leading the country into its worst economic crisis since its independence from Britain in 1948. With the island teetering near bankruptcy, Fonseka, who owns a small garment business in the capital, Colombo, has resorted to spending his own savings to pay the salaries of his 30 employees. But he knows he will soon have to let them go and is clear about who is to blame. \"All of us thought we made the correct decision (to elect Rajapaksa), but we've realized we were wrong. We should have the backbone to tell people, and the world, that we made a mistake,\" he said. In recent weeks, protests have erupted across the country demanding that Rajapaksa quit. The protests highlight the dramatic fall of the Rajapaksas from Sri Lanka's most powerful political dynasty in decades to a family grasping to retain power. Despite accusations of atrocities during the civil war, Gotabaya and Mahinda, who was previously president, remained heroes to many of the island's Buddhist-Sinhalese majority and were firmly entrenched at the top of Sri Lankan politics before the revolt by previous supporters like Fonseka. \"The pendulum has swung from 'it's all about the Rajapaksas, they are the people who saved this country,' to 'it is because of the Rajapaksas that the country is now ruined,'\" said Harsha de Silva, an economist and opposition lawmaker. The unravelling of Sri Lanka's economy has been swift and painful. Imports of everything from milk to fuel have plunged, spawning dire food shortages and rolling power cuts. People have been forced to queue for hours every day to buy essentials. Doctors have warned of a crippling shortage of life-saving drugs in hospitals, and the government has suspended payments on $7 billion in foreign debts due this year alone. \"The Rajapaksas, like an octopus, have held on to every aspect of public life in Sri Lanka,\" de Silva said. \"They have been running it as if it was their kingdom. They wished and they did \u2013- that's how it was and people were with them.\" President Rajapaksa has defended his government, partly blaming the pandemic and Russia's war in Ukraine. \"This crisis was not created by me,\" he said in a speech last month, adding that his government was working hard on solutions. They include approaching the International Monetary Fund and World Bank for assistance, after repeated calls to do so. But as protesters seethed, the president and prime minister have changed tact in recent weeks. They have admitted to mistakes they made that exacerbated the crisis, such as implementing a short-lived ban last year on importing chemical fertilizers that badly hurt farmers and conceding that they should have sought a bailout sooner. Influential Buddhist monks have urged Rajapaksa to form an interim government under a new prime minister, signaling a further decline in the family's image as protectors of the country's 70% Buddhist-Sinhalese majority. Some observers say it's too soon to measure how much support for the Rajapaksas has fallen among their hardcore base, but for many their response has been too little and too late. \"There is now recognition across the government of several missteps, but it's one that's come at a huge cost to the people,\" said Bhavani Fonseka, a senior researcher at the Colombo-based Center for Policy Alternatives. The Rajapaksas were a powerful land-owning family which for decades dominated local elections in their rural southern district, before rising to the helm of national politics in 2005 when Mahinda was elected president. He remained in power until 2015, overseeing the end of the civil war against ethnic Tamil rebels in 2009, before losing to the opposition led by his former aide. Suicide bombings that killed 290 people on Easter Sunday in 2019 paved the way for the Rajapaksas' return, this time as Gotabaya launched a high-pitched nationalist campaign that tapped outrage and disillusionment with the previous government over the attacks. He vowed a return to the muscular nationalism that had made his family popular with the Buddhist majority, and also to bring the country out of an economic slump with a message of stability and development. Tourism had dropped sharply after the bomb attacks and Sri Lanka needed badly to boost revenue to service a slew of foreign loans for splashy infrastructure projects. Some involved Chinese money and were commissioned under his brother's presidency, but had failed to create profits, instead collecting debt. Just days into his presidency, Rajapaksa pushed through the largest tax cuts in Sri Lanka's history to spur spending even as critics warned that it would shrink the government's finances. According to Nishan de Mel, executive director of Verit\u00e9 Research, Sri Lanka's tax base fell by 30%. \"When you do something like that, you have some kind of internal analysis or document that shows why these cuts could help the economy. There was nothing of that sort,\" de Mel said. The move triggered immediate punishment from the global market as creditors downgraded Sri Lanka's ratings, making it impossible for it to borrow more money as its foreign exchange reserves continued to dwindle. Then the coronavirus hit, further crushing tourism as debts snowballed. Analysts say the Rajapaksas' response to the economic challenges underscored the limitations of their strongman politics and their family's near-monopoly on decision making, heavily relying on the military to enforce policy and passing laws to weaken independent institutions. Three other Rajapaksa family members were in the Cabinet until early April, when the Cabinet resigned en masse in response to the protests. \"Their entire political ideology and credibility is in serious crisis,\" said Jayadeva Uyangoda, a veteran political scientist. But many fear that things will only get worse before improving. A divided and weak opposition without a majority in Parliament has kept the Rajapaksas in power. An IMF bailout could see austere measures intensifying hardships for people before there is relief. Meanwhile, the focus remains on the protests, which are drawing people across ethnicities, religion and class. For the first time, middle-class Sri Lankans have taken to the streets in large numbers, Uyangoda said. They include Wijaya Nanda Chandradewa, who joined the crowd outside the president's office on Saturday. A retired government employee, Chandradewa said he fell for Rajapaksa's promise to rebuild a Sri Lanka scarred by the 2019 bombings. \"He said there will be one country and one law \u2014 now there is neither the law nor the country,\" Chandradewa said, adding that the only option now is for Rajapaksa to quit. \"He showed us a fairyland and cheated us and misled us,\" he said. \"We have to fix our mistakes and build a system to bring in the right leader.\"",

On a school night in late January, Stephana Ferrell, a 39-year-old mother of two elementary school children in Orange County, Fla., logged onto a virtual meeting with more than 200 other parents around the country who, like her, have been alarmed to see books pulled off the shelves of their children's schools. Ferrell, a family photographer who owns a business, began dipping her toes in local activism for the first time in early 2021 when she lobbied her school district to continue COVID-19 precautions as mask mandates were being lifted. But her involvement ramped up later in the year. That's when she began organizing parents all around Florida to oppose calls to ban books that some conservatives have deemed too \"divisive\" or \"pornographic\" to be in schools and curricula. Ferrell hoped her experience organizing a campaign against book challenges might be instructive to others who similarly oppose what she views as a politically-driven campaign at children's schools. \"Lawn Boy is not on the shelf right now, and then All Boys Aren't Blue says that it's in stock and available,\" Ferrell told the online participants. \"We had a high school student go in there and try to ask for it and they said, 'Sorry, that book's not available right now for checkout.' So that's a shadow ban on All Boys Aren't Blue.\" The session was the inaugural training of a national campaign called \"Book Ban Busters,\" organized by a left-leaning grassroots network called \"Red Wine & Blue.\" With the tagline of \"Channeling the Power of Suburban Women,\" the group was established in 2019 and has extended its reach across the country. Founded with the purpose of activating primarily left-leaning moms around local and school issues, it also emphasizes a social component to organizing. Prior to the pandemic, local groups affiliated with the network organized get-togethers at moms' homes or restaurants. During the past two years, much of their activity has been online. This past year, many of these parents have watched their schools become battle turf over mask mandates, vaccines and inclusive education. Locally, conflicts over book bans are often framed simply as the next in that series of culture wars. But to some political science experts and historians, the book bans resemble censorship campaigns that could strike at the very heart of democracy. \"I called the organization Red Wine & Blue because when these women would get together there would be wine and there would be some pretty good snacks,\" says Katie Paris, the group's founder. Paris, a mom in suburban Cleveland, previously worked in Washington, D.C., for left-leaning causes. She established the group to build on the political engagement of suburban women who rejected former President Trump's attempts to win over \"suburban housewives\" during the 2018 midterm elections. She says the network now includes more than 300,000 parents. \"The suburbs [have] really been shifting and changing,\" Paris says. \"They've always, traditionally in politics, been seen as these sort of conservative bastions. But the suburbs are becoming more diverse. They're shifting ideologically.\" Katie Paris speaks to members of Red, Wine and Blue during a meeting, Monday, Sept. 28, 2020, in Cleveland.\n                \n                    \n                    Tony Dejak/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Katie Paris speaks to members of Red, Wine and Blue during a meeting, Monday, Sept. 28, 2020, in Cleveland. For many parents at the local level, the push to remove inclusive materials from schools looked, from the beginning, very different from the contentious debates over masks and vaccines. \"It seemed to happen everywhere, all at once. It was clearly organized,\" Paris  says. \"So we knew pretty much off the bat that this is an orchestrated effort.\" That impression is born out in the data. More than 330 unique books were challenged from September through November last year, according to the American Library Association's Office for Intellectual Freedom. That's twice as many as the entire year before. Paris says moms in the Red Wine & Blue network were among the first to see the effort take shape. Early last summer, several began surfacing questions to ask if anyone had heard about something called \"Critical Race Theory.\" The term has been incorrectly applied by rightwing pundits seemingly to anything relating to race, diversity and equity. To some experts, the campaign carried all the hallmarks of a different controversy that played out years earlier. \"All of these organizations that appear to be 'grassroots parent organizations' that are outraged about what their [children] are learning, they all have ties to exactly the same donors that have been behind the campus free speech crisis,\" says Isaac Kamola, associate professor of political science at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut. \"It's the same network of people, the same funders that are kind of manufacturing this false narrative and then using this dense network ... in order to demand that society and the public take it seriously,\" he says. Kamola, who co-authored the book Free Speech and Koch Money, says that many institutions and people connected to the CRT debate have ties to the Donors Trust and Donors Capital Fund. Those organizations have facilitated huge contributions from ultra wealthy libertarians toward rightwing think tanks such as the Manhattan Institute, policy outfits like the Goldwater Institute, media outlets and legal organizations to advance an extreme conservative agenda. Ralph Wilson, who co-authored the book with Kamola and co-founded the Corporate Genome Project, has traced links between some of these entities and parents groups organizing to restrict instruction related to race in schools. As an example, he says that the group No Left Turn in Education offers model legislation with sections that closely mirror wording in an Academic Transparency Act proposed by the Koch-funded Goldwater Institute. No Left Turn in Education did not respond to questions from NPR. Wilson says many parents in these organizations may not be aware that their activism is around an issue that was manufactured to serve the interests of wealthy, corporate elites. \"They view critical inquiry, free inquiry that's done in the academy as a threat to their wealth, they see it as a threat to the future of capitalism and free enterprise in this country,\" Wilson says. \"The end political agenda that's being served doesn't actually help those parents that are involved in it. It doesn't actually help those children. It helps a larger political movement that's trying to capture the culture and ultimately capture the state.\" Book challenges have a long history in the U.S., with calls for censorship coming from the left as well as the right. There also have been precedents for the kind of legislation that would restrict public speech about certain topics, says Eric Berkowitz, a human rights lawyer and author of Dangerous Ideas: A Brief History of Censorship in the West. \"In the 1830s, all discussion of abolition was barred from the House of Representatives,\" Berkowitz says. \"It was for the purpose of 'restoring tranquility to the public mind.' So the notion of abolishing slavery was not only a political threat, but it was also advanced and, I suppose, sold on the belief that divisiveness, discomfort, things along those lines are bad for the public mind and a more docile population is a much more easily governed one.\" The nonprofit education news website Chalkbeat has tallied 36 states as of early February that had adopted or were considering legislation to put limits around teaching about race or racism. But Berkowitz says history has shown that these type of \"gag rules\" rarely work in the long run. \"These kinds of ham-handed efforts to mold discourse through the banning of books or through the banning of movies or through the banning of entire subjects only causes greater interest in them,\" he says. Political scientists, nonetheless, have been particularly troubled by how the recent spate of state legislation and policies to circumscribe discussion of race in schools has happened amid a tide of rising anti-democratic populism around the globe. The measures fall into a category called \"memory laws,\" says Harvard government lecturer George Soroka. \"Memory laws, in the sense of official prohibitions on how the past can be talked about, are very much a modern phenomenon, and until quite recently, they were primarily a European phenomenon,\" Soroka says. According to Soroka, who has helped build a database to track memory laws, there has been a relatively recent proliferation of this type of legislation particularly in post-communist European states. Countries such as Russia, Poland, Ukraine and Hungary have enacted measures to downplay the role some of their countrymen had in the Holocaust and to foster a single, heroic narrative about those countries' experiences in World War II. Soroka says there are parallels to the U.S., where so-called \"anti-CRT legislation\" and censorship ultimately may serve to whitewash the realities and legacy of slavery. \"Pluralist ideas about the past, multivocality of narratives are threatening ... when you are trying to foster a nation that is really exclusive in terms of its identity,\" he says. Soroka says the rise of these measures in the U.S. and elsewhere signals a troubling political shift. \"This is part and parcel of a crisis of democracy,\" he says. \"We see this with the rise of more xenophobic types of nationalism, this idea that how the past is remembered can be weaponized and can be specified by governmental decrees.\" Back in Florida, Stephana Ferrell says she sees efforts to erase or minimize marginalized voices from the classroom as clear attempts to undermine the values of a pluralist democracy. Ferrell points to the recent passage of HB1557, which opponents have dubbed the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill, as an example. The legislation would restrict discussion about sexuality and gender in the classroom. \"They're leaving people out of the conversation completely,\" she says. \"We have whole swaths of communities completely excluded and teachers tiptoeing around what they can discuss about LGBTQ+ people and Black and Indigenous people here in this country.\"",

President Biden's first formal State of the Union address focused on Ukraine, inflation, the coronavirus pandemic and a four-point \"Unity Agenda.\" He urged world unity in standing up to Russia, listed ways he's trying to address rising prices (even if they will likely have limited to no effect in the short term) and offered an optimistic outlook about the end of the pandemic. Biden made mention of some progressive policy items, such as the need for robust voting-rights legislation and stood up for transgender and abortion rights (while leaving out some other topics such as climate change). And he also touted some of his accomplishments of his first year, such as the COVID-19 relief bill and the bipartisan infrastructure bill. But the speech's emphasis on many of Biden's centrist policy positions, like not defunding the police, was a clear choice in an election year. It was reminiscent, in some ways, of Bill Clinton's 1995 State of the Union address made after Republicans' historic gains in the 1994 midterm elections. Here are five takeaways from Biden's address to Congress: Watchers of State of the Union addresses are pretty used to seeing, literally seeing, partisan applause lines. One half of the audience \u2014 the president's party \u2014 usually stands and applauds for most things, while the other half \u2014 the opposition party \u2014 sits quietly or ... voices their displeasure. But for the most part, the mood was more unified on Tuesday night. And that's because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian blue and gold was a hard-to-miss symbol of unity in a deeply polarized Congress with lots of members donning blue-and-gold flags and lapel pins. The president's defiant tone on the crisis elicited several moments of bipartisan applause, something rare in this partisan age. That is, of course, aside from some usual suspects. Another striking visual was the absence of masks in this speech in the age of COVID-19. It was a sign of the eagerness that Americans feel in wanting to move past the pandemic, and the president was cautiously optimistic. Biden called for people to get vaccinated, for children to get vaccinated, and for production and distribution of antiviral pills to protect vulnerable people. He also forcefully called for the country to get back to work, to \"fill our downtowns\" and to keep schools open. Still, unlike in last July when he was close to declaring independence from the pandemic, only to be derailed by deadly variants, Biden said, \"I cannot promise a new variant won't come. But I can promise you we'll do everything within our power to be ready if it does.\" On Wednesday, the White House is set to announce a new roadmap for moving forward on the pandemic. Biden tried to say he understands that inflation is pinching lots of Americans. \"I grew up in a family where if the price of food went up, you felt it,\" the president said, before pointing out that that's why he pushed to pass the COVID-19 relief bill. It was almost as if the White House had read the NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, which asked Americans what they thought should be Biden's top priority. Far and away, the top answer was inflation. \"I get it,\" he said. \"That's why my top priority is getting prices under control.\" Biden laid out a kitchen-sink approach. He said he authorized releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve; he spoke out against price gouging; and he called for the confirmation of his Federal Reserve Board nominees. He also took a nationalistic turn, promoting making products in America. \"Lower your costs, not your wages,\" he urged companies. \"Make more cars and semiconductors in America. More infrastructure and innovation in America. More goods moving faster and cheaper in America. More jobs where you can earn a good living in America. And instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let's make it in America.\" All that is intended to show he's on it, but traditionally, products made in the U.S. are more expensive because of the labor costs disparity between the U.S and other countries, such as China. Shipping costs are currently high, so there's an argument that now is a good time to make a transition to making more at home. But there isn't much a president can do to curb inflation in the short term. He has to hope as the pandemic recedes, inflation goes along with it. The speech struck a unifying tone early on, but Biden got in his digs on Republicans, too, while boasting of his first-year legislative accomplishments. \"Unlike the $2 trillion tax cut passed in the previous administration that benefitted the top 1% of Americans,\" Biden said, \"the American Rescue Plan helped working people \u2014 and left no one behind. And it worked. It worked. It created jobs. Lots of jobs.\" Talking about the bipartisan infrastructure bill, Biden thanked Republicans who voted for it, but got this dig in on former President Donald Trump. \"We're done talking about infrastructure weeks,\" he said. \"We're going to have an infrastructure decade.\" In this era of unabashed base politics, Biden needs to shore his up. The latest NPR poll found Biden lacking in his intensity of support. The White House has to hope some of this rhetoric \u2014 and pride \u2014 can help with that. Cowed by sweeping Republican gains in the previous year's midterm \u2014 and with an eye to his own reelection \u2014 President Bill Clinton gave a State of the Union address in 1995 that sought middle ground. Biden certainly tried to seek out a middle path that focused on what he called a \"Unity Agenda\" with four parts \u2014 beating the opioid epidemic, taking on mental health, supporting veterans and ending \"cancer as we know it.\" Beyond that, just look at how he talked about the police. Throughout his campaign, Biden broke from liberals in his party and called for more funding of police. He emphasized that again on Tuesday night. \"Let's not abandon our streets \u2013 or choose between safety and equal justice,\" Biden said, adding, \"We should all agree: The answer is not to defund the police. The answer is to fund the police. Fund them with the resources and training they need to protect our communities.\" Biden has been suffering with independents, a group he won in the 2020 presidential election, and Republicans have been trying to brand him a socialist beholden to the left wing of his party. These middle-ground statement were clearly an attempt to push back against that and appeal to moderates at a time when many of the issues hampering him are out of his control.",

The shrine is dedicated to their most revered god, Ram, and is being built on a plot of land where a 16th-century mosque stood, before a Hindu mob tore it down in 1992. It's one of several frenetic constructions \u2014 massive roads, hotels and a swanky new railway station \u2014 underway in Ayodhya, a dusty, holy city in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh where Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party is seeking reelection by touting Hindu-first politics coupled with economic prosperity.

Yadav said the government has failed to provide him \u2013 and millions like him \u2013 jobs. Still, he will vote for them again. The BJP's answer appears to be infrastructure, including mammoth expressways and airports to boost connectivity and tourism. But analysts are doubtful whether huge public spending on such projects is enough to kickstart growth in Uttar Pradesh, a largely poor and agrarian state where joblessness is rising. Under Adityanath, youth unemployment has increased fivefold, according to economist Santosh Mehrotra, who analyzed national labor data. The BJP, however, has made grand promises. It says it will attract investment, provide free electricity for farmers and generate jobs for 20 million people, but has provided few details. It is also wooing voters with welfare measures, doubling free rations for the poor and a tough stance on crime. But the party's core Hindu nationalist agenda is unmissable. In December, Modi took a dip in the Ganges River before thousands after he inaugurated a $45 million corridor that connects two iconic religious sites in the state. Such events, analysts say, have turned temple inaugurations into political spectacles that drive focus away from pressing issues. \"There is a limit to how much employment and development you can create around a temple,\" Mehrohtra said. The big-ticket projects, which deftly mix religion and infrastructure, are aimed at pleasing the BJP's Hindu base amid reports of discontent among key voters. The party won in the state last time by consolidating Hindu votes across castes. But multiple defections to the opposition Samajwadi Party, whose secular appeal has swayed voters from a wide range of castes as well as the Muslim community, have raised uncertainties. Farmers, an influential voting bloc, are still furious at Modi for pushing agriculture laws that triggered a year-long protest before he bowed to the pressure and revoked them in November. The BJP is also facing allegations of COVID-19 mismanagement in the state after a calamitous surge in infections last year saw numerous corpses floating in the Ganges. The polls are a referendum on the saffron-robed Adityanath, a poster figure for the Hindu right-wing, who some analysts believe is vying to be the next prime minister. In 2017, he was appointed the chief minister \u2014 the top state official \u2014 after the BJP won. \"It is an electoral test on his brand as a leader because he incarnates a more radical form of Hindu nationalism and is overly more communal than others in the BJP,\" said Gilles Verniers, a political science professor at Ashoka University. The head of an influential Hindu temple, Adityanath's rise has been marked by an increase in violence against Muslims, with numerous reports of lynching and other attacks. Recently, Adityanath declared the forthcoming election as a \"80% versus 20%\" contest, which roughly match Uttar Pradesh's Hindu and Muslim demographics. He later clarified the figures in an interview with local media as a majority that want development and safety over a minority that opposed it. \"The BJP has built houses and toilets for the poor without differentiating between their caste and religion. No one can claim the benefits of government schemes have reached only Hindus and not Muslims,\" said Vijay Bahadur Pathak, the BJP state vice president. But the meaning wasn't lost on Mohammed Noor, an auto-rickshaw driver in Lucknow, the state capital. \"Until the Yogi government came, nobody pointed out a Hindu from a Muslim here. But ever since the BJP has risen, they've created a feeling of divide, of difference \u2013 this has only grown,\" he said. \"The Muslim community have just given up \u2013 we have no hope, we have stopped reacting,\" said Shabbar Siddique, an 18-year-old in Lucknow. Even the construction of the temple in Ayodhya has been met with resignation from the city's Muslims. \"What can we say? Since the judgement has come from the highest court, we'll have to abide by it,\" said Syed Zia Haider Rizvi, a watch store owner. \"As a businessman, I should gain.\" The Supreme Court in 2019 ruled in favor of the temple, ending one of India's most protracted land disputes, and ordered alternative land to be given for a mosque. Many Hindus, who believe Ram was born at the site, rejoiced at the verdict, while a key Muslim body deplored it. The mosque's destruction in 1992 set off riots in which 2,000 people across India were killed, mostly Muslims. There's a a feeling among many Muslims in Uttar Pradesh of rising fear and uncertainty, although Hindu and Muslim residents in Ayodhya itself say there have been no religious tensions since the mosque unrest. The BJP spun the court verdict, which came after the 2019 national elections, as their success. Observers said the fervor behind the ruling likely boosted Modi's electoral sweep. But now analysts believe the party has squeezed all it can from the temple. \"They certainly take the cake for keeping Hindu passions alive in the name of the temple for decades and decades,\" said Lucknow-based political analyst Sharat Pradhan. \"But electorally, I think it has outlived its potential.\" BJP leaders are already invoking another holy city in Uttar Pradesh. In December, Adityanath first mentioned Mathura, believed to be the birthplace of Krishna, a major Hindu deity. A recent court case filed by Hindu priests over a 17th-century mosque there could rekindle tensions. Mathura, like Ayodhya, will also get a temple \u2013 work for it was already \"in progress,\" Adityanath was quoted as saying by local media. \"Now that they have won Ayodhya, they will need another battle - which site are they going to fix their eyes on next?\" said Verniers, the political science professor. \"The moment they inaugurate the Ram temple, they will have to find something else.\"",

            "article_content": "New York Times journalist Alan Feuer says some members of Trump's inner circle have close ties to the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, whose leaders have been charged with seditious conspiracy.  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Extremism and political violence is the beat my guest, Alan Feuer, covers for The New York Times. He's been reporting on the Justice Department's investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election, as well as doing some reporting on the House Select Committee's January 6 investigation. Over the past few years, Feuer has done extensive reporting on the Proud Boys, the far-right group that took the lead in confronting police, crossing police lines and breaching the Capitol on January 6. He contributed to a remarkable New York Times video showing how they led the charge. The video is based on court documents, text messages, a video recording of a Proud Boys meeting to prepare for the 6 and videos recorded on the 6 from many sources, in which The Times was able to locate exactly where and when Proud Boys were during the attack. Five members of the group have been charged with seditious conspiracy. On Tuesday, after the House Select Committee heard testimony from Cassidy Hutchinson, who was an aide to Trump's final chief of staff, Mark Meadows, Feuer wrote about how this could lead the former president closer to federal criminal charges. We recorded our interview yesterday. Alan Feuer, welcome to FRESH AIR. Busy time for you, huh? (Laughter). ALAN FEUER: Indeed, it is. Thanks for having me, Terry. GROSS: Oh, my pleasure. One of the things you flagged when you were writing live about the Hutchinson testimony for The New York Times was that Trump asked Meadows, Trump's final chief of staff, Mark Meadows, to contact Roger Stone and Mike Flynn on the night before January 6. And Cassidy Hutchinson doesn't know what was said but knows the conversation took place. Why do you think that is so important? FEUER: Yeah. So the phone calls that Hutchinson describes between Meadows, Stone and Flynn are important, if unresolved, for this reason. While we don't know what Meadows may have said to Stone and Flynn, what we do know is that Stone and Flynn both have extensive contacts to far-right militia groups that were intimately involved in the attack on the Capitol. And I want to stress that those contacts are what they are, and we don't know if those contacts are - have any anything incriminating about them, right? And we may find out more about them, and we may not. And that will come in the fullness of time. But it is without dispute that in the run up to January 6, there were two pre-January 6 big pro-Trump rallies in Washington, and one was in November, and one was in December. And Stone and Flynn both played very active roles in speaking at those events and in pushing the big lie that there was fraud in the election and then, you know, taking part in, you know, kind of the support of Trump's overarching message that he should stay in power. And at those events, Stone and Flynn were often accompanied by members of the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers and a third group which we will probably hear more about soon called the 1st Amendment Praetorian, who served as both kind of personal bodyguards for them and did event security for the larger rallies. On January 6 itself, Roger Stone was guarded by a contingent of Oath Keepers. GROSS: They're a militia group. They're a far-right militia group. FEUER: They are a far-right militia group and one of... GROSS: And Mike Flynn is Trump's former national security adviser. FEUER: Mike Flynn is definitely - and both - let's not forget, as the committee pointed out yesterday, both Flynn and Stone received presidential pardons from Donald Trump in the weeks leading up to January 6, right? So you have a situation where two very close advisers to the president receive pardons from Trump in the weeks leading up to January 6. They then proceed, throughout the post-election period, to appear, you know, as sort of, you know, keynote-ish-like speakers at a bunch of pro-Trump rallies where the lies about the election are being spread. They are guarded by members of far-right groups. And, for example, you know, some members of Roger Stone's Oath Keeper security detail on January 6 itself are part of the seditious conspiracy case that has been brought against the Oath Keepers. And interestingly, one of those three guys has pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy and is cooperating with the government's investigation. GROSS: Wow. OK. So if Mark Meadows at the time was Trump's chief of staff and Trump asked Meadows to contact Roger Stone and Mike Flynn the night before the insurrection, that kind of connects Trump to the planning for it? Is that what's being suggested here? FEUER: Look; we don't know what conversation Meadows had with Stone and Flynn. It could - look; we have to leave open the possibility that, you know, it was, you know... GROSS: Hi. How you doing? (Laughter). FEUER: Hi. How you doing? GROSS: Yeah. FEUER: You know, you guys getting good service over there at the Willard Hotel, right? We have to leave that open. Nonetheless, it is a potential conduit in which Trump could be connected directly to these militia groups that, ultimately, were at the vanguard of the attack on the Capitol. We're going to hear more about this when the committee hearings resume in mid-July. Representative Jamie Raskin is going to lead another hearing that will specifically look at this question, the connections between, you know, Trump world, so to speak, and the militia groups on the ground that day. I'm not convinced yet that there is any smoking gun that the committee has found. I think that there is a lot of well-established and preexisting ties between Stone, Flynn and the militias and, of course, between Stone, Flynn and Trump, right? Those ties are kind of - if you know this world, they're there to be seen. The question is, were those ties used in a way to facilitate any criminal violence? GROSS: And let's just bring up here that Mike Flynn, in a closed-door hearing with the January 6 House committee, was questioned by Lynne Cheney (ph), and she asked him if he believed in the peaceful transfer of power, and he took the Fifth. FEUER: He also took the Fifth when he was asked if he felt that the violence that erupted at the Capitol was problematic legally and morally. And we should also point out that Roger Stone, in a similar fashion, took the Fifth multiple times during his own appearance in front of the House committee. So, you know, that is what it is. That is a closed box that we can't see into. And so, you know, what we do know is this - Roger Stone, for example, has long-term and pretty profound connections to the Proud Boys. He is - has been a kind of friend and associate of the Proud Boys' former chairman Enrique Tarrio for a long time. Tarrio is now locked up on seditious conspiracy charges of his own. When Stone went to Washington for the January 5, January 6 - you know, those two days, he brought with him a member of the Florida Proud Boys, you know, which is the same kind of - which is - you know, Tarrio himself is from Florida. So he was literally accompanied that whole time by a member of the Proud Boys. You know, his relationship to Tarrio, for example, is close enough that when you used to call Tarrio's cellphone and it clicked over to voicemail, it was Roger Stone who was on the voicemail saying, like, you've reached Enrique Tarrio's phone or whatever. GROSS: Oh, really? (Laughter) Wow. FEUER: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. They have long-term ties going back to when Stone himself was being prosecuted for his involvement in the Trump-Russia investigation. And he ultimately ended up threatening the federal judge in his case by putting on social media an image of the judge with, like, crosshairs over her face, right? The people who actually made that image for him were Enrique Tarrio and a group of Florida Proud Boys. They were doing Roger Stone's social media work. So they have this long-term - you know, it's like - he's very enmeshed in that group. And then, of course, as we were just talking about, Stone on January 6th was being personally bodyguarded by a contingent of Oath Keepers. So what does that mean? I - you know, you tell me, Terry. I don't know what it means, but, you know, presumably, people are looking into this. And as I mentioned, one of the guys who was on his team, on his Oath Keeper team, has pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy and is cooperating. GROSS: So what does Stone have to say about this? FEUER: Well, Stone adamantly denies that he had any role whatsoever in the violence that occurred at the Capitol on January 6th. And that has been his position more or less since Day 1. So, yeah, that's where he's coming from. GROSS: Well, let's take a short break here because there's really a lot more to talk about. So let me reintroduce you. If you're just joining us, my guest is Alan Feuer, who has been reporting on extremism and political violence for The New York Times and reporting on the Justice Department investigation into attempts to overturn the 2020 election. He's also done extensive reporting on the Proud Boys. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF YO LA TENGO'S \"HOW SOME JELLYFISH ARE BORN\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday with Alan Feuer, who's been reporting on extremism and political violence for The New York Times. He's been covering the Justice Department investigation into attempts to overturn the 2020 election as well as doing some reporting on the January 6th committee, the House committee investigating the attack on the Capitol. And he's been writing extensively over the years about the Proud Boys. The Justice Department has been very careful and not talking about what it's doing exactly. So a lot of people are wondering what, if anything, will these Justice Department investigations lead to? So where are we, to your knowledge, in the Justice Department's investigations? Like, what are the paths that you know of that it's pursuing now? FEUER: So the most obvious and sort of least newsworthy path is, of course, the fact that 840-plus criminal cases have been filed against people who were physically involved in the storming of the Capitol, right? Let's set that aside 'cause I think everybody knows about that. What the Justice Department is also pursuing is a investigation into whether crimes were committed by people who put their names to these slates of, you know, fake pro-Trump electors in states that Joe Biden actually won. Those people are mostly, like, state-level Republican officials in Arizona and Pennsylvania and Michigan and Georgia and other key swing states that were the fulcrum of the election, right? And these people got together, and they kind of did this thing that had never been done before and said, hey, Biden won the state, but we are going to create this other, you know, document that says that Trump won the state. And we're going to use that, and we're going to send it up to Mike Pence for use on January 6th. So this wing of the election starts with those people, and it looks ultimately towards the people who kind of devised and implemented that plan, who are lawyers close to Donald Trump. And so we've seen subpoenas that have gone out from this grand jury that's investigating the fake elector angle. And sort of - right there in the subpoenas are names like Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman and sort of lesser-known names like Jenna Ellis, Boris Epshteyn and them. But they're mostly a bunch of lawyers who kind of put all this together. There is also a grand jury investigation that is looking into people who organized, spoke at, provided security for Trump's event at the Ellipse on January 6th. GROSS: Is that the seditious conspiracy angle? FEUER: Well, the seditious conspiracy charges are already lodged, right? They're lodged against the Proud Boys. They're lodged against the Oath Keepers. The question is, what is the connection between the militia groups that have been charged with sedition and the political organizers with whom those groups worked multiple times in the post-election period? And what is their connection, if any, to folks inside the White House? And that - I suppose if you're asking about the political organizer bucket and - is that the seditious conspiracy investigation? I would say, yeah, kind of, because the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers figure into that broader investigation, right? That doesn't mean that there will be seditious conspiracy charges brought against anyone else. But that is all part of the same kind of large universe of characters, if that makes any sense. And this thing is like multitentacled, and it's like an octopus's, you know, arms all wrapped around each other. It's very complicated. It's very overlapping. And it's very hard to sort through. And I should say, there's one extra thing that just happened last week that we're still trying to figure out, which is that some lawyers who were involved in this, namely John Eastman and a former Justice Department official named Jeff Clark, had their phones seized by the Justice Department. And, you know, it's not entirely clear which lane of the investigation that feeds into. But we do know that it is part of the broader January 6 effort by DOJ. GROSS: Let's talk about your writing about the Proud Boys. And the Proud Boys are the far-right, pro-Trump group known for starting fights and inciting violence. Five of them are facing charges of seditious conspiracy. And so why have you been keeping your eye on them? FEUER: In short, because I've been following them since they, essentially, were created in 2016. I've been writing about them, you know, on and off for, you know, what is now, you know, more than half a decade. And so when it became clear that they were at the forefront of what happened at the Capitol, I just sort of inevitably became involved in the criminal cases that started getting filed, you know, in connection with January 6. GROSS: So the Proud Boys played a key role in the attack on the Capitol. They were there in five different locations, igniting the group that stormed the police lines and tried and succeeded into breaking into the Capitol. And so before we get to the details of how they managed to do that, let's talk about a video call that was leaked to The New York Times. And I don't know if it was leaked to you personally. This is a call of a meeting held by Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys, a week before January 6. And he and some top lieutenants held a video conference with a handpicked crew and started a new special chapter called the ministry of self-defense. What was it? FEUER: The ministry of self-defense was, as you described, was a handpicked crew of what I'll call elite members of the Proud Boys who were chosen by Tarrio and his top leaders for what one of them described as their throttle control. The idea was this - there was a pro-Trump rally in Washington on December 12, 2020. It got very violent in its aftermath. There were street fights after nightfall. Some members of the Proud Boys got stabbed. This took place around the time when Tarrio and a group of his members vandalized a historic Black church and stripped down a Black Lives Matter banner from the facade and burned it in the street. So that event was kind of a disaster all around. And, you know, if you take Tarrio's description of the ministry of self-defense at face value - and we can talk about whether we should do that or not - that group was chosen so as to avoid the chaos and sort of, you know, lack of discipline and order that took place in December when the Proud Boys returned to Washington on January 6. And so they put together not only, you know, a kind of group of trusted members, but they organized them in this kind of hierarchical structure and 10-man teams. And they imposed a bunch of, you know, rules of order, you know, no drinking, you know? Adopt a defensive posture. Stay away from so-called normie protesters, meaning just, like, normal sort of pro-Trump supporters, you know? And, you know, kind of obey police lines on the ground on January 6. What's fascinating about this meeting, which goes almost 2 hours, is that virtually none of what Tarrio was suggesting actually happened on the ground on January... GROSS: The opposite. FEUER: The opposite happened. So what's the difference here, right? What's going on? And that's just sort of an open question. GROSS: Well, one difference is that Tarrio couldn't be in Washington on January 6 because shortly before that, he was arrested - right? - for carrying two high-capacity rifle magazines. FEUER: He was arrested directly in connection with the banner burning at the church that I described, right? And then, when he was being prosecuted - when he was arrested, he was coming off the plane. It's January 4, two days for January 6. He's flying into D.C. He's coming off the plane. He's essentially told that he's going to be arrested. He gets off the plane. He's arrested. They charge him with the banner burning. They process him, lo and behold, he's carrying two high-capacity rifle magazines imprinted with the Proud Boys, you know, like, rooster logo. I don't know if you can picture it, but whatever. And that's what takes him off the table for January 6 because as part of his release conditions by the judge, he is ordered to leave Washington, D.C. and not come back. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Alan Feuer. He's a reporter for The New York Times who's been covering the Justice Department investigation into the attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. We'll be right back after a short break. I'm Terry Gross. And this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF SO PERCUSSION AND STEVE REICH'S \"STEVE REICH: MALLET QUARTET III FAST\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I am Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday with Alan Feuer, who covers extremism and political violence for The New York Times. He's been reporting on the Justice Department's investigation into January 6th and attempts to overturn the election. He's also written extensively about the Proud Boys, the far-right extremist group that took the lead January 6th in confronting police, crossing police lines, removing barriers and breaching the Capitol. Five of the Proud Boys are charged with seditious conspiracy including the group's leader, Enrique Tarrio. But he was arrested when he arrived in Washington on January 4th. So on the 6th, he wasn't able to be with the Proud Boys at the Capitol. All right. So the person who takes over for him on January 6th as the leader of the group is Joe Biggs. Just tell us a little bit about Joe Biggs. FEUER: So it's sort of Biggs and another guy. But sure, Joe Biggs ends up kind of having what I'll call tactical control on the ground. Biggs is a former soldier, former Army sergeant, who saw combat overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan. He then transitions into a kind of interesting role in right-wing media. He ends up befriending Alex Jones, the conspiratorial-minded impresario of Infowars, and becomes an Infowars correspondent and goes all over the - you know, the world sort of doing right wing-affiliated reporting for Alex Jones. He ultimately ends up joining the Proud Boys sort of, like, around 2018, and he becomes very close to Tarrio. They both live in Florida at the time. And Biggs and Tarrio start doing a bunch of what they do, these provocative street rallies that often end in brawls, many of them out West in liberal bastions like Portland. And, you know, Biggs is involved in the Proud Boys all throughout the very hot summer of 2020 when the Proud Boys are fighting with Black Lives Matter activists in the street who were coming out after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. And that's a sort of like, you know, like - it's the most recent sort of upsurge of, well, preelection that the Proud Boys were involved in. GROSS: So in a video before January 6th, Biggs says, this time we're not going to be wearing the colors you're used to seeing us in - 'cause they basically wore - was it orange? And what was the other color? FEUER: It's black and yellow. GROSS: Black and yellow, yeah. They basically used to wear black and yellow, you know, identifying themselves as Proud Boys. But this time, he says, they're not going to do that. He says, this time, myself and other leadership decided we're going to go incognito. We're going to be blending in like an old lady with some pins in her hand making a sweater. You won't know who's standing beside you. It could be Antifa. It could be me. What's the significance of that? FEUER: The significance on the ground - right? In other words, the result of it is that it was impossible to know in the melee that took place at the Capitol who was a Proud Boy and who was not. And so when we all looked at this video of the day in real time, we didn't know at first how many Proud Boys were involved in key advances and breaches at the building because there was no way to know who they were. And so what the passage of time and the grueling labor of dozens, if not hundreds, of volunteer, open-source intelligence researchers has shown us is that there were way more Proud Boys in the crowd operating on the ground in tactical fashion than we originally knew. And I want to stress here for a sec that the work, the grueling, painstaking, detailed work of finding these people in the videos of that day is an astonishing accomplishment because there is no single, you know, like, catchall basin for these videos. Don't forget, January 6th is this massive, digital crime scene that was documented by people with their own cameras that they put online. It was documented by, you know, like, news media cameras that was broadcast on TV. There was CCTV footage from the Capitol security cameras. There was body-worn cameras on the police that day. And slowly, all of this visual evidence has kind of seeped into the public. And there are people out there who did nothing for months but look through clip after clip after clip and angle after angle after angle, identifying Proud Boys in the crowd. GROSS: And this was work that was done for a really remarkable New York Times video that you were part of analyzing and putting together, that connects text messages, court documents and the videos that you were just describing so that you can see exactly where the Proud Boys were during all the breaches of the Capitol. And you could see that they took a leading role. Joe Biggs is suspected of starting the first breach of police lines at the Capitol. And this was about 15 minutes before Congress was set to start certifying the results of the election. How did he set it off, according to your knowledge? FEUER: As you said, there is a crowd gathered outside the most exterior barricades of the Capitol grounds just before Congress is about to go into joint session. And at some point, a guy comes up to Biggs who has no clear-cut connection to the Proud Boys. There is video of Biggs having some sort of exchange with this guy, puts his arm around - you know, they put their arms around each other. You could see them talking. You don't - we don't know - we don't have video or audio of what was said. But what we do know is that immediately after speaking to Joe Biggs, this guy - his name is Ryan Samsel. He's a barber from Pennsylvania. He walks alone - separates himself from the crowd and walks directly up to the barricades behind which there's a small group of cops. He starts to kind of rattle the barricade and agitate and sort of confront the police at that barricade. Within seconds, others join him at the barricade. And within minutes after that, that barricade falls. And that is essentially the tipping point of the entire riot that day. Now, when Ryan Samsel gets arrested, he tells the FBI what happened that day. And he says that Joe Biggs, in their conversation, encouraged him to go up and agitate and confront the cops. And, you know, he kind of demurred and said he hesitated. He said he didn't want to do it. And he claims that Biggs flashed a gun at him - like, you know - like, kind of flashed a gun from his waist, questioned his manhood and said, go do it. And so he did. Now, Joe Biggs, let's be clear, entirely denies that account. Joe Biggs has not been charged with having a gun. Nonetheless, that is the story that Samsel himself has provided the FBI with how this all kind of kicked off. GROSS: So once the barricades are breached, what do the Proud Boys do next? They move to another location - right? - and start instigating there. FEUER: Yeah. So what ultimately happens is a series of complicated, I will call tactical, maneuvers by the Proud Boys that day. And each one, it - you can kind of see a pattern of behavior in the visual evidence. They locate a kind of key, sensitive point at the Capitol. They kind of instigate other rioters around them who may - who aren't necessarily affiliated with the Proud Boys at all to kind of get everybody upset and encouraged. They kind of - they oftentimes sort of take part in, you know, instigating violence against the police. And then they let the crowd do its thing. They almost step back once the crowd has been excited and they - you know, the crowd moves through. And they kind of do the same thing again and again. GROSS: By constantly moving, inciting the crowd to violence and then, like, moving to another location, do you think the Proud Boys were trying to become more invisible? I mean, remember, like, they're not wearing their colors, so they're not easily identified. Once the police lines are breached, they often, like, move away and go to another location. So it's kind of like wiping away their fingerprints. FEUER: So, look, if you talk to the Proud Boys' lawyers, they will adamantly deny that there was a preplanned conspiracy to storm the building, to do any of this stuff, that - you know, like, there's no - they'll say there's really no smoking gun evidence. There's no text from, you know, Tarrio to Biggs or from Tarrio to others or Biggs - that says, here's the plan - right? - ABC. That said, the visual evidence is what it is, and you can see them using these tactics again and again that day. And whether it was purposeful or whether they were just making it up in the minute, you know, you are right in that what they are doing on the ground is pushing other people forward, allowing the chaos and violence to accelerate. And then they themselves recede and move on. GROSS: Let's take a short break here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Alan Feuer, who's been reporting on the Justice Department investigation into attempts to overturn the 2020 election, as well as reporting extensively on the Proud Boys. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF JOAN JEANRENAUD'S \"AXIS\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday with Alan Feuer, who's been reporting on the Justice Department investigation into attempts to overturn the 2020 election. And he's been reporting over the years extensively on the Proud Boys, including their role in the insurrection on January 6. So now that five members of the Proud Boys, including the leader, Enrique Tarrio, are charged with seditious conspiracy, what are the Proud Boys up to? FEUER: So in the immediate aftermath of January 6, as the Justice Department was rounding up members across the country, there are now - almost 50 members of the Proud Boys have been charged that we know of publicly. The group went into a tailspin of panic and paranoia, right? Everybody thought that the other guy was working with the FBI and that there was this kind of, like, you know - like, snitch mania went through the Proud Boys. What they ultimately ended up doing was sort of taking a step back from marquee, big-picture, public rallies, the stuff that they had been doing essentially since the beginning of the Trump administration. And they started to home in on local issues. So members of Proud Boys chapters in Wisconsin and Michigan and in small-town Ohio started showing up at school board meetings where hot-button issues like the teaching of anti-racist curricula were being discussed. You know, more recently, Proud Boys have started showing up at drag queen shows at libraries because that is the new hot-button culture war issue. And they are at the forefront of that on the ground. At the same time, the Proud Boys have mounted a concerted, purposeful effort to run for local political offices. And the best example of that has been going on in Miami, Fla., which is Enrique Tarrio's hometown. Over the past several months, the Proud Boys have managed to gain a small but significant foothold on the executive committee, essentially the steering committee of the Miami-Dade County Republican Party organization. So these are the people who set policy for the local Republican Party in Miami-Dade. And, you know, it's really remarkable the extent to which they have been able to kind of lay hold to the levers of mainstream political power. And that's a purposeful thing. Tarrio, before his arrest, had spoken about wanting to run for office himself. I think he already had run for office, at least tried to at one point. GROSS: So I want to talk with you a little bit about the origins of the Proud Boys because it dates back to Gavin McInnes, who was one of the founders of Vice. And his intention was a kind of, like, rude, like, male-only, you know, macho, we love to fight and drink and make crude jokes men's club. Tell us about what his original intent was. FEUER: Well, it's an interesting question about what his intent was, of course. He set this up... GROSS: Well, I guess you can't answer that, but yeah. FEUER: Well, no, no. But I just want to - but it's to the point here, right? It's to the point because he sets it up as, you know, a so-called drinking club. We're like the Elks or the Shriners. We're just guys looking for some guy time. He had a podcast, you know, at that point. And he would, you know, invite, like, his buddies over the podcast. They'd start drinking. They'd take over a bar. And it was all kind of codified around this sort of male, macho culture, right? But, you know, the notion that the Proud Boys were ever just a drinking club, it kind of obscured something that was a little different and a little darker. That's what I'm talking about, like, the intent thing. And what I'm talking about is the Proud Boys had, from the beginning, styled themselves as what McInnes liked to call Western chauvinists, right? And, essentially, what that meant to the group was that, you know, it was a way to fight back against a perceived belief on the left that Western culture was inherently racist and sexist. And it was a way to suggest that - you know, that manly men have nothing to be ashamed of, that, you know, Western culture, which is, of course, by McInnes' own description, mostly white culture, should have no kind of racial guilt for its position of hegemony. And it kind of mixed these quasi-white nationalist notions in a friendly, digestible package that disavowed overt white nationalism but allowed for this kind of band of brotherhood based on male grievance and sort of, you know, resentful anger toward the left. GROSS: Yeah, and people of color and women (laughter), resentment toward them. FEUER: Yeah. Well, what's interesting is that - I would say this, the overt misogyny of the Proud Boys was always there from the beginning. The Proud Boys have always allowed in members of any race. I remember being at a bar with a group of Proud Boys after a rally in June, 2017. And you did see a, you know, mostly white crowd. But there were absolutely have been and - there always have been members of minorities who, for whatever reason, joined the group. In fact, Enrique Tarrio, who took over the leadership from McInnes, is himself of Afro-Cuban descent. And so that is an interesting - I think, you know, that McInnes, who is a shrewd media operator, very savvy in that area, has always played the line between kind of overt, you know, expressions of white nationalism and, you know, a more palatable version that allows for a kind of plausible deniability. GROSS: Well, let's take a short break here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Alan Feuer, a reporter for The New York Times who's been covering the Justice Department's investigation into attempts to overturn the election. And he's also reported extensively on the Proud Boys, including their role in the attack on the Capitol. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF JAY-Z AND BEYONCE SONG, \"'03 BONNIE AND CLYDE\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday with Alan Feuer, who's been reporting on extremism and political violence for The New York Times. He's been covering the Justice Department investigation into attempts to overturn the 2020 election, as well as doing some reporting on the January 6 House committee investigating the attack on the Capitol. And he's written extensively about the Proud Boys and their role in the January 6 attack. So the Proud Boys were never meant to be, like, an intellectual club. When McInnes started it, he said, we're bringing back hedonism, stupidity, ugliness. We're getting rid of taboos. We're getting armed. And we're having fun. And I hope you'll join us. So that says something right there - especially, we're getting armed. FEUER: The Proud Boys have always celebrated violence. You know, I remember the first time I met Gavin McInnes. He complained to me that the true violent people were the leftist activists - right? - antifa. And I remember saying to him, OK, well, if that's the case, you know, if you find yourself confronting a violent antifa mob, you as a rugged Proud Boy and your manly men Proud Boys, why don't you just take a page out of the civil rights playbook and walk into the teeth of the antifa mob and let them beat you guys up on camera, and then everybody will see sort of, you know, who celebrates violence and who doesn't? And his answer to me was very telling. He's like, there's no way we would do that because we just like to fight. GROSS: (Laughter). FEUER: So they've always celebrated violence. GROSS: Yeah, yeah. And this is crazy. You write, as a character-building exercise, the Proud Boys forbid masturbation and pornography and that the group's initiation rituals - and this is early on, you know, during the McInnes era, the group's initiation rituals included reciting the names of five breakfast cereals while being slugged by other Proud Boys members (laughter). Like, that sounds crazy. FEUER: Well, see; but I think - I mean, first of all, yes, it is crazy. But the way you just laughed at it, because it is laughable, is kind of the McInnes mindset that if we can make part of this jokey and stupid and pranky... GROSS: Right, yes. FEUER: ...And like a frat, it deflates the seriousness of it. GROSS: And I fell right into that, didn't I? I just laughed. Yeah. FEUER: Well, I mean, whatever. But you're right - because it is silly, and it is goofy. But I have the sense that that was purposeful. GROSS: That's a whole thing on the far right now is, like, putting everything into italics so it's kind of ambiguous. It's like, into scare quotes, saying, oh, that was meant to be a joke. I was being ironic. Yeah. FEUER: Yeah, it's a little safety valve that McInnes has opened and closed very shrewdly over the years. GROSS: So, you know, weapons were not only conspicuous on January 6; weapons seem to be entering politics in a new way, especially through several ads by Republicans in the primaries that show the Republicans, you know, the candidate, with a weapon. And the most extreme of these is a recent ad by Eric Greitens. And you actually wrote about this recently. Tell us about the ad for people who haven't seen it. FEUER: Sure. So Greitens is running for the Senate in Missouri, and the ad essentially shows him standing with a shotgun outside a home, flanked by what looks like a military assault team dressed in full body armor, carrying AR-15-style weapons. And Greitens essentially says - he cocks - he racks the shotgun and says, we're going RINO hunting. You know, like, no limit, no - you know, bag and tag them. Here we go. And you see these armed and body-armored soldiers, SWAT team style, kick the door down and in they go. And like you said, Terry, it's really kind of the most exaggerated use of weapons as an expression of political language that's come out in a season where Republican candidates have leaned very heavily on the use of firearms to codify a kind of devotion to anything from kind of, you know, manliness to traditional values, that the gun represents something sort of fundamental to the Republican vision of politics. And so Greitens' ad was just like - just took it to the next level. But his was clearly not the only one to do that. GROSS: Alan Feuer, it's really been great to talk with you. Thank you so much for explaining so many things. FEUER: Well, thanks for having me, Terry. I really appreciate it.

AILSA CHANG, HOST: Violence in Baghdad has now killed at least two dozen people and injured hundreds in the last two days. Supporters of the popular cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, some of them armed, clashed with Iraqi security forces, which include members of Iran-backed militias. The fighting comes as a result of a deadlock in forming a government some 10 months after parliamentary elections. There's a split between Sadr and Iran-backed groups. Sadr has now told his supporters to end their protests and to leave government areas that they have occupied. To understand more about the situation, we have reached Sarhang Hamasaeed, the Middle East Program's director for the United States Institute of Peace. Welcome. SARHANG HAMASAEED: Thank you - good to be with you. CHANG: Good to have you. So can you just first help us understand better who Muqtada al-Sadr is? Like, he is one of Iraq's most powerful leaders. What else can you tell us about him? HAMASAEED: Muqtada al-Sadr comes from a religious family. His father and his uncle have been known as to be religious credentials. In recent years, he has been able to brand himself as a Iraqi leader who is against foreign interference, including Iranian interference, who stands for justice, for Iraqi nationalism. And Iraqi civil society leaders have allied with him in different elections. And the jury is still out how much do you believe this rebranding. CHANG: Well, I understand that his bloc was the biggest winner in Iraqi elections last fall. But then this summer, all of his allies in parliament quit in protest. What happened there? HAMASAEED: He formed an alliance with the Sunni Arabs of Iraq and a major force of the Kurds, the Kurdistan Democratic Party. That gave him enough votes in parliament to be able to form a government and appoint a prime minister. The Iranians and their allies in Iraq have managed to form what was known as the obstructing third in the parliament - so about 120, 130 votes that prevented al-Sadr from forming the government. The deadlock in the political process and in the electoral process led to, as you rightfully mentioned, Sadr to decide that he would actually ask all the MPs who are representing him in parliament to quit. And they did so in June. And that meant to this date, it is a huge point of surprise why did he give up this much parliamentary power in the system. CHANG: Still, can you explain how this current power struggle in Iraq, how this current political situation could affect U.S. interests? HAMASAEED: Yes. So the U.S. has several interests in Iraq. Obviously, from a national security standpoint, a stable, democratic Iraq serves in the way where Iraq does not become a place for terrorism. Second, Iraq is a major oil producer. So for the stability of the global economy and for U.S. allies, this is an important factor. And third, for regional stability, Iraq is an important country where the - Iraq and the countries of the region are unhappy with the expansion that Iran had in the region. So there are several factors that Iraq plays an important role for U.S. interests. But the U.S. leverage to affect those outcomes is far less today than it was some years ago. CHANG: That was Sarhang Hamasaeed, the United States Institute of Peace's Middle East Program's director. Thank you very much for joining us today. HAMASAEED: Thank you. Thank you for having me.

            "article_content": "China scholar Michael Beckley says China is engaged in the largest military buildup since World War II, and is being increasingly aggressive with its Asian neighbors and with the U.S.  DAVE DAVIES, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. In 1941, millions of Americans were shocked when Japanese forces attacked the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor. Our guest today, Michael Beckley, begins his new book with co-author Hal Brands by positing the notion that the Chinese military could take advantage of a disputed election result in the United States in 2025 to attack Taiwan and, in the process, hit a U.S. aircraft carrier with a ballistic missile, provoking a war between China and the United States. Beckley and Brands' book argues that China is making increasingly aggressive moves against its neighbors in Asia and defining its future in terms of a strategic battle with the United States for influence in a changing world. Beckley writes that, in recent years, China has embarked on a military buildup unlike any since World War II. The book argues that China today fits the profile of a dangerous adversary, a rising power that has reached a point where its growth seems to have peaked and its leaders become increasingly reckless in striking out against rivals allying against them. Michael Beckley is an associate professor of political science at Tufts University who's written widely on China. He's a former fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School and is currently a nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. His co-author, Hal Brands, is a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Their new book is \"Danger Zone: The Coming Conflict With China.\" Well, Michael Beckley, welcome to FRESH AIR. I wanted to begin with a recent controversy. You know, your opening anecdote is about, you know, an imagined attack by China on Taiwan, which draws the U.S. into the conflict. And, you know, recently, U.S. - United States House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, and there was reporting that said that President Biden's national security team thought this was a bad idea. Some thought it was reckless and provocative. Others said, good that she's standing up for democracy in the authoritarian Chinese state. What's your take? Was this a good idea for her to make this trip? MICHAEL BECKLEY: I understand the logic. I mean, for the past year and a half, China has carried out the most provocative and sustained show of force in the Taiwan Strait in more than a generation, sending warships and combat aircraft across the median line towards Taiwan. I also understand Nancy Pelosi's logic, just wanting to cement her legacy as someone who has always stood up for human rights and has been tough on China. But from a strategic perspective, I think that this was almost an example of what not to do. And I think it's important to note that the Chinese looked at this visit in the context of what they view as a slippery slope of the United States changing its Taiwan policy. There has been massive arms sales to Taiwan in recent years. There's been a steady stream of high-ranking officials, Cabinet secretaries, congressional delegations. President Biden has said three times that the United States will defend Taiwan and that it's a commitment that the United States has made. That would be a sort of new interpretation of the Taiwan Relations Act. And there's legislation pending on Capitol Hill that would upgrade America's relationship with Taiwan or upgrade Taiwan's international status. So for the Chinese, this was a very provocative maneuver, and I'm just not sure there's really much strategic payoff in poking a dragon before you've had the time to really get the military weapons and other - and your strategy together to back up your claims. DAVIES: It's interesting that in the book, you know, when you have this chilling opening anecdote where China attacks Taiwan and then the United States is simply not yet in a position to mount a meaningful military response - it doesn't have the kind of assets it would need nearby to resist - and having already had one of its ships attacked, it must - then considers a tactical nuclear weapon. I mean, this is a pretty chilling notion. Is this realistic? Could this happen in three years? BECKLEY: I think - so a major war is always unlikely, but I think the likelihood of war in the Taiwan Strait is higher than it's been certainly in a generation. I mean, every - you know, it's important to note that every Chinese leader has said Taiwan is going to be reabsorbed; it's just a matter of when and how. I think up until about 2016, China's approach, with some glaring exceptions, was relatively peaceful. They basically tried to buy reunification by forging deep economic links with Taiwan. But what's changed is that strategy has clearly not worked. Taiwan's people have become more and more determined to maintain their de facto independence. And so as these peaceful reunification options have disappeared, China has started turning to military options. And we fear that China right now has a window of opportunity because it's coming off of about a 10-year period of just churning out ammunition, churning out warships at a rate we haven't seen from any country since World War II. And at the same time, the United States and Taiwan have been slow to respond to China's modernization, to spread out their forces, to harden them. And so there is this possibility of China carrying out a Pearl Harbor-style strike on - not just on Taiwan's bases but on the two American bases on Okinawa, which are the only American bases within 500 miles of Taiwan, as a way to cripple the United States in route to taking Taiwan. DAVIES: Let's talk about some of the book's broader thesis, that you can see China - apart just from just Taiwan, that you can see China becoming aggressive on a whole number of fronts. One of them you've already mentioned - this huge military buildup, shipbuilding on a huge scale. Another thing is they've been building islands in the South China Sea. A lot of people probably don't realize you can build an island. I guess they build on existing coral reefs or whatever. What are they doing? What's the significance of that? BECKLEY: So, you know, China has built up at least seven artificial islands in the South China Sea and has militarized them - put, you know, guns and airstrips and ports for naval ships on them. And I think this reflects part of China's response to its peaking power, which is to carve out a territorial empire. I mean, according to the Chinese narrative, there are lost Chinese territories that need to be taken back, and that includes roughly 80% of the South China Sea. And I think there are - you know, from China's perspective, they see it as legitimate security concerns because they are critically and chronically dependent on foreign markets and resources. Roughly 40% of their economy is wrapped up in international trade versus for the U.S., it's something like 20%. And China imports 80% of its oil, computer chips, advanced manufacturing equipment, advanced medical devices. It's the largest food importer in the world. And 90-plus percent of that trade flows through the South China Sea. DAVIES: And it's interesting when you describe them needing to preserve their access to foreign markets and foreign resources, it reminds you a lot of Japan in the 1930s, when they had this big industrial economy, and that led it to increasingly provocative moves, you know, annexing Manchuria, then attacking China. I mean, part of your thesis here is that China is at a point kind of like Japan in the '30s. Are there other examples of this in history that you see where, you know, kind of growing imperial powers or powerful nations reach a point where they're - where they feel stuck and threatened and then become more reckless? BECKLEY: Yeah, so we've - we looked at every case over the last 200 years where you had a peaking power, one - you know, one that has been rising for a long time, growing like gangbusters, growing in international power and prestige. But then either because its economy slows down or other countries start to encircle it or both, their power - they worry - they have to worry that their power is going to decline. And they're the most dangerous kind of country because, on the one hand, this era of a rapid rise has equipped them with the money and the muscle to shake up the world. But then this fear of future decline gives them the motive to move aggressively in the short term. And we've seen this throughout history. These peaking powers don't mellow out and dial back their ambitions; they crack down at home to secure their regime, and then they expand abroad to secure their economic lifelines, to beat back rivals - basically, to try to rekindle their rise or just grab what they can before it's too late. You mentioned that Japanese example. We also highlight Germany, you know, starts World War I in large part because it thinks it's about to get crushed in a Russian and French vise with an assist from Britain. So they had to beat back that ring of fire that was going around them. You know, we even look at Putin's Russia today. I mean, Russia was a resurgent power in the 2000s, banging out 8% economic growth rates annually and largely because of high oil prices. Then when the oil prices collapsed after 2009, it drags down Russia's economy and Putin's popularity with it. He tries to revive Russia's fortunes by pressuring former Soviet states to join a Russian customs union, basically trying to treat them as economic vassals of Russia. Ukraine says, basically, thanks, but no thanks. We'd rather sign a big trade deal with the EU, and we know how that turned out. So this pattern has played out over and over again. It's the rise, followed by the fear of a coming fall. And now it looks like China is walking down this very ugly path. DAVIES: You know, we'll talk about some more of the evidence on - about this argument. But it strikes me that, you know, I see this as accurately describing some of the nations or imperial powers in history. But I wonder - you know, it isn't true of all of them. I mean, look at the British Empire. I mean, it certainly, you know, had - it ruled much of the world, you know, a couple of hundred years ago and then went into decline. And, you know, it didn't get reckless and invade France. I mean, there is the prospect that enlightened leadership can find other ways to manage decline and, you know, without becoming so reckless. Do you think - I don't know. Can you be sure this fits? BECKLEY: Yeah, absolutely. So there's lots of other cases that are not nearly as extreme as, say, Imperial Germany or Imperial Japan. I would point out, though, that none of these peaking powers just kind of sat back. They all went out abroad. It's just that some didn't necessarily need to batter their way through a ring of encirclement. The two main factors that can lead to a more peaceful outcome are, first of all, if the peaking power has good trade prospects. So if, like, international markets are open, it can rely more on free trade rather than economic empire building to kind of rekindle its economic growth. And the second is actually the regime type. We found that authoritarian regimes tend to be more aggressive because you have these tight links between big business there that want to expand abroad in an imperial fashion, that kind of push the regime into much more aggressive policies. They also worry much more about their legitimacy. So there are cases that ended up somewhat more peaceful. So the United States at the end of the 19th century, you know, after the Civil War, there was, like, this big economic boom. But then in the 1880s, there are a series of major depressions. And people start to freak out that because the Americans had expanded across the continent, they were running out of investment opportunities. There was excess capacity. And this creates a surge of American imperialism, where it starts to pump exports and investment into Latin America and Asia, then build a big, powerful navy to defend those investments, then annex territory in order to defend those. And so, you know, it didn't lead to a world war, but it certainly wasn't peaceful. You could look more recently - so, for example, France in the post-war era, you know, after World War II, it has this economic boom. That peters out in the 1970s. And the French respond by basically trying to reconstitute their old sphere of influence in Africa. They deploy 14,000 troops there to their former colonies. They undertake a dozen military interventions. So these weren't catastrophic wars. But, you know, when times get tough, these peaking powers tend to get moving in various ways. And it can drag them into conflicts that even they have no interest in being in, but they just end up involving themselves in just trying to save their own trajectory. DAVIES: We need to take a break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Michael Beckley. He's an associate professor of political science at Tufts University. His new book with Johns Hopkins professor Hal Brands is \"Danger Zone: The Coming Conflict With China.\" We'll be back to talk more after this short break. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with Tufts University associate professor and China specialist Michael Beckley. His new book with Johns Hopkins professor Hal Brands argues that China is beset by internal problems and international challenges, and its leaders are increasingly aggressive toward its neighbors in Asia and the United States. Their new book is \"Danger Zone: The Coming Conflict With China.\" So there's plenty of signs that China is building up militarily and becoming more aggressive in trying to influence its neighbors and others around the world. Let's talk about some of the ways that you argue that this is actually born in part of weakness in China, concerns about that the future won't be as bright as the recent past. One of the things is economic stagnation. The Chinese claim that their economic growth rate is about 6%, which would make most economists happy in most places. What's the real story? BECKLEY: So there's been a number of systematic studies that essentially conclude the real growth rate is somewhere around half of what is normally reported. These are studies that use objectively measurable indicators. Like, you can see how much electricity is being used at night, you know, and that can be used as a proxy. Or you can use combinations of different industrial indexes to compile sort of a basic thing. In fact, China's No. 2 official in charge, Li Keqiang, invented his own index because he himself could not rely on China's doctored GDP numbers. They call it the Li Keqiang index. So I think you have to take China's growth statistics with a grain of salt. I think the more troubling problem for China, though, is just that the quality of its economic growth has deteriorated significantly over the last 10 years. Productivity, you know, making more output for every unit of input, that's what you need to really grow your wealth. That's actually been declining for a decade now in China. So China's spending more and more to produce less and less. And they've essentially kept their growth rates up by force-feeding capital through the system, just round after round of massive stimulus spending. And the obvious result of that is a huge increase in debt. China's debt load is three times bigger than the size of its entire economy and rising quickly and just a lot of wasted assets - bridges to nowhere, ghost cities. DAVIES: Yeah. You're - this is astonishing to read that they've built 50 ghost cities, essentially these empty apartment buildings and malls and airports that are standing there. I mean, how does that happen? I mean, did they anticipate people moving in and it didn't happen? BECKLEY: Yeah. I mean, you have to separate the interests of Chinese state-owned enterprises that just want contracts to build stuff. I mean, they'd be happy to dig a hole and fill it back up if they're making money on it. But the problem is that this investment-driven economy - and we've seen this in so many other cases - is going to be extremely wasteful. You're going to build a lot of assets that don't really generate economic value. And the problem is the people that are building the stuff, they make out like - you know, like bandits, but the nation, as a whole, has its wealth drained on wasting assets. You can look at videos online right now of them bulldozing buildings that aren't even finished yet. So that, I think, just illustrates the type of problem that they're dealing with. DAVIES: And you say this has generated a huge debt for China. Who is the money owed to? BECKLEY: Well, the vast majority is to China itself. So, you know, Chinese people - there are tight controls on what you can do with your money if you're a Chinese citizen. You basically have to put it in a state-owned bank where you are paid either - the interest you're paid, it doesn't keep track with inflation, so the value of your savings actually declines. And that just gives the regime, you know, a huge pile of cash to do all sorts of - this is why the Chinese government has so much money. And, you know, my Chinese friends have told me, you know, the Chinese government is rich, but the people are poor 'cause their only options are to invest in real estate, which were seen as a giant bubble, or to play around on China's stock market, which most people think is rigged and not very safe for your average Joe. You know, this is through what they call a process of financial repression. You know, you're able to just extract the wealth from the people and then use it for national purposes. The problem is this opens up the floodgates to corruption because you have high-level officials being able to work with people's money, and they're just not accountable to those people. DAVIES: All right. So if you have slower growth in the system, which basically transfers assets, money from the people to the government and state-owned enterprises, this is not good for a population that has become used to growing wages and increased opportunity. What does that create for the regime? BECKLEY: It creates a big legitimacy problem because for decades, the Chinese Communist Party said, look, we may not give you political and civil rights, but we are going to make your bank accounts grow every year. You will be better off than your parents and certainly much better off than your grandparents. So - and it's just much easier - anyone in government will tell you it's just easier to govern when growth is high because the gravy train of patronage is humming. You know, you can pay off opponents, you can bribe your cronies, and you can keep the people happy. But without that machine moving, the regime has to find another source of legitimacy. It has to explain why it deserves the right to rule in perpetuity in China. And that means going back to the pre-1978 forms of legitimacy, which was largely aggression and internal repression and delivering beatings and detention to the Chinese people, and dialing up nationalism, saying, look, we may not be growing as fast, but we are still going to make China great. We're surrounded by enemies, and so we need to rally together as a nation. I mean, we've just - again, we've seen this historically, that when the economic times get hard, the regime usually dials up nationalism as a way to rally the people around the regime. DAVIES: You know, there's one other problem that you note that China is going to face increasingly in coming years. And this is, basically, the demographics of its - the aging of its population. And this is due to its, you know, one-child policy of years back. And explain what happened here and what it's going to mean for China. BECKLEY: So China is about to have probably the most severe aging crunch we've ever seen, and it has a lot to do with its peculiar population history. So basically, in the 1950s and '60s, the government incentivized Chinese families to have lots of children to boost the population, which had been decimated by decades of war and famine. And Chinese families obliged. The population surges 80% in 30 years. But then in the late 1970s, the government starts worried about overcrowding and implements the infamous one-child policy. And so for the past three decades, you've had this massive baby boom generation in the prime of their working lives with few elderly parents to care for because so many had died in the wars and famines, and they had few children to care for 'cause they weren't allowed to have them. And so this population was primed for productivity. Demographers think this alone explains at least a quarter of China's rapid growth over the last 30 years. China had anywhere between 10 to 15 workers for every retiree in its population. That's two to three times the global average. It's five times what the United States currently has. And so it grew extremely quickly. But now, that is all flipping. Essentially, you know, China is running out of people. That baby boom generation is retiring and falling onto the backs of a tiny one-child generation. Just between now and the early 2030s, China's going to lose 70 million working-age adults. It's going to gain 130 million senior citizens. That's like taking an entire France of workers and consumers and taxpayers out of your economy and then adding an entire Japan of elderly pensioners. And this is going to happen in just over ten years from now. That 10 to 1 ratio I mentioned is going to collapse to 2 to 1 - two workers to support every retiree by the late 2030. So it's really a very dire situation. DAVIES: We need to take another break here. Let me reintroduce you. We're speaking with Michael Beckley. He's an associate professor of political science at Tufts University. His new book with Johns Hopkins professor Hal Brands is \"Danger Zone: The Coming Conflict With China.\" We'll be back to talk more after this short break. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF ERIC DOLPHY'S \"HAT AND BEARD\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. We're speaking with Tufts University associate professor and China specialist Michael Beckley. His new book with Johns Hopkins professor Hal Brands argues that China is becoming increasingly aggressive towards its neighbors in Asia and increasingly hostile toward the United States. They say China is particularly dangerous now because it's beset by internal problems and international opposition that could make its leaders more reckless. The book is \"Danger Zone: The Coming Conflict With China.\" You know, you write that there's a geographic reality which distinguishes China and increases the likelihood that it will be aggressive and reckless. So you say that, you know, the United States is lucky in that it is surrounded by friends and fish. That is to say its immediate neighbors, Canada and Mexico - it - are not a threat. And then the other - and then are oceans. China, by contrast, is surrounded by 20 nations - not all friendly, some quite populous and powerful. How does this fit into the picture? BECKLEY: Yeah. So China is in an extremely rough neighborhood. It's surrounded by 19 countries, most of which are very powerful, or they're unstable or some combination of those two things. I mean, if you've ever played Risk, you know that holding Eurasia is almost impossible. And that's basically what China has to do every single day. And, you know, for most of modern Chinese history, this vise has absolutely crushed China. So for more than 100 years, from the first Opium War in 1839 until the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the country just gets ripped apart by imperialist powers. It collapses into two of the worst civil wars in history. And then even after the Chinese Communist Party unifies the country in 1949, it immediately becomes America's No. 1 enemy. And then in 1960, China's alliance with the Soviet Union falls apart. And China was the chief enemy of both Cold War superpowers. So it's not until the 1970s that China has gotten some reprieve from this vise. But now things are changing because, you know, for a variety of reasons - COVID, China's own aggressive behavior - negative views of China around the world have soared to highs we haven't seen since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. Even countries that used to lean towards China and depend on it economically, like South Korea - you know, South Koreans now dislike China more than they dislike Japan, which is remarkable given the brutality that Japan inflicted on South Korea in their history. And this anti-China sentiment now is starting to congeal into concrete pushback. So it's bringing back that specter of a tightening vise around China. You're seeing for - militarily, a sort of double-layered military barrier emerging. So the inside layer are China's immediate neighbors. You know, Japan is doubling its defense spending. Taiwan is revamping its military. Vietnam is stocking up on mobile missile launchers and mines. And they're all basically just trying to turn themselves into prickly porcupines that can push China away from their coastlines. And at the same time, you have this outside layer of democratic powers - obviously the United States, but also Australia, the United Kingdom, India - that are providing aid and arms to China's neighbors, you know, building them up and sailing their warships through waters that China says are - is Chinese territory. So you just see this new - this strategic encirclement starting to build. And what we've seen in the past - I mean, we mentioned the Germany pre-World War I sort of nightmare example. You know, great powers tend to react quite negatively. They try to batter their way and break the ring of encirclement before it tightens and crushes their expansionist objectives. DAVIES: You've argued that the - China now has an opportunity to move militarily against Taiwan. And you say that there are writings by retired Chinese military leaders advocating this and that polling indicates support for this is rising among the Chinese population. BECKLEY: Yeah. I mean, according to state media, anyway, something like 70% of people in China support moving on Taiwan, not just in the long term, but, like, within this decade because they just feel like enough is enough. And, you know, I think the fact that China crushed Hong Kong recently is an ominous sign because China used to tread lightly on Hong Kong because the - what they called the one country, two systems offer that they were making to Hong Kong was the same one they were making to the Taiwanese, namely, look, you are part of China. You have to come back to the motherland. But we will grant you a substantial amount of local autonomy. So we'll have two different systems. You know, in Taiwan's case, we won't put our military on your territory. You'll have a local government there that - you can't have your own foreign policy. But for the day-to-day kind of stuff, you can still run, and we'll lay off some of your more liberal institutions. The fact that China has ended that charade in Hong Kong, you know, decades before it was technically allowed to based on the agreement it signed with Britain during the handover in '97 - it was supposed to wait until 2047 before it made big moves on Hong Kong - that is very ominous 'cause now it just shows - they recognize that there's not going be a willing embrace of China by these breakaway regions, that now, you know, they're not going to use carrots anymore. They're going to start using sticks. DAVIES: You argue that China has a military advantage now. What should the United States be doing? BECKLEY: It's actually relatively simple. In fact, defense analysts have been coming up with a strategy for more than a decade now where Taiwan, first of all, would turn itself into a prickly porcupine - you know, one that can beat back a bigger aggressor by stocking up on mobile missile launchers and armed drones and mines and building up its armies so that it can surge troops to any beach very quickly and then have a big reserve force that's essentially trained to fight guerrilla-style in Taiwan cities and jungles and have this big - you know, stockpiles and shelters for the population and just hoping that showing these preparations would scare China and just make it clear that this would be a hard slog for China, basically show that they can fight like Ukrainians, you know, against the Russians and not allow a decisive victory. And for the United States - the U.S. would disperse and harden its base infrastructure. And the goal is just by setting this up that you make it look impossible, that - make conquests look impossible, and hopefully China won't opt for it. DAVIES: That's essentially a military strategy for resisting China. Let me ask the contrarian question here, you know? I mean, great powers often have spheres of influence near their own shores. I mean, the United States, you know, going back to the Monroe Doctrine said, you know, we're going to want to hold sway in our neighborhood of the world. I mean, Taiwan is right off the shore of China. And there's a question of whether it's really wise for the United States to commit to the territorial - the defense of this region on the other side of the world. And, you know, remember its origins. I mean, you know, the government of Taiwan was formed after the Chinese Civil War of the 1940s, which the Communist side prevailed in. And the losing side, the Kuomintang run by Chiang Kai-Shek, established the government on Taiwan. But, you know, that was certainly an anti-Communist government, but not exactly democratic. It was very repressive in its early decades. And I just wonder, I mean, should the United States be making that commitment so far from its shores? And how different is that from, you know, the United States putting a half a million troops into Vietnam in the 1960s and the '70s in a losing effort to back one side in a civil war? BECKLEY: I think you can understand the Chinese logic that this is a great affront and a massive overextension of U.S. influence while also, simultaneously, if you're on the American side, wanting to resist China because, you know, Taiwan, I think, pound for pound, is probably the most strategically important place in the world. Aside from just being a flourishing democracy with 23 million citizens on it, and most of whom absolutely don't want to go back with China - just from a strategic perspective, strategists often call it the unsinkable aircraft carrier. And if you look at where it's located, it's smack dab in the middle of the crossroads of the East and South China Seas, which are the crossroads between the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean. Something like 40% of world trade flows through these waters. And if China was able to consolidate its control over Taiwan, it would then have a launching pad for further aggression. I mean, this is why the Japanese recently declared that a Chinese conquest of Taiwan or an attack on Taiwan, Japan would view that as a dire threat to its vital interests because Japan has islands that are very close, within a few hundred miles of Taiwan. And they would be the next obvious target. So if you think that revanchist, revisionist powers don't necessarily get satisfied, just - if you lop off one little piece of a region and give it to them and that they're just going to keep wanting to eat and just get more emboldened and powerful, then it's important to make a stand where you can. And Taiwan, despite the fact that China has modernized its military, still has a number of geographic and technological advantages that make deterring China still possible so that hopefully you don't have to face the choice, in the first place, of having to join a war with a nuclear-armed great power fighting over what it views as its territory. DAVIES: Apart from the military calculus, what else do we have to consider here? BECKLEY: Well, you know, the United States is also trying to undergird a global system of alliances that have turned zones of the world into areas of peace. So just - you know, the U.S.-Japan alliance, NATO, those alliances, the credibility of those alliances, I think, would be shattered if China were to assault Taiwan and the United States didn't lift a finger. I think also just the balance between democracy and autocracy around the world would be thrown into the advantage of autocracies if you see the CCP just crush the only Chinese democracy in the world and the world's most powerful democracy just sits by and does nothing. So there are also diplomatic and moral factors as well as the military strategic factor here. DAVIES: Let me reintroduce you once more. We are speaking with Michael Beckley, an associate professor of political science at Tufts University. His new book with Johns Hopkins professor Hal Brands is \"Danger Zone: The Coming Conflict With China.\" We'll be back after this short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF RHYTHM FUTURE QUARTET'S \"IBERIAN SUNRISE\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Tufts University associate professor and China specialist Michael Beckley. His new book with Johns Hopkins professor Hal Brands argues that China is beset by internal problems and international challenges and is becoming increasingly aggressive toward its neighbors in Asia and the United States. The new book is called \"Danger Zone: The Coming Conflict With China.\" You know, Michael Beckley, I know that your grandparents were interned during World War II when Japanese citizens were forced into these camps. Tell us what you know about that experience and the impact it had on you. BECKLEY: So I'm biracial. My Japanese grandparents, they were American citizens living in Seattle, but they were interned first for several months at the Washington State Fairground, which was sort of this dystopian landscape of internment camps next to an amusement park - I think they called it Camp Harmony - and then for pretty much the rest of the war, out in the middle of nowhere in Idaho. And they were in their early 20s. They had to sell their greenhouse, their livelihood, for 10 cents on the dollar. And they got married before so that they wouldn't be - so that they would be sent to the same camp. My grandma had three younger brothers. They all volunteered to serve in the 442nd Infantry, which, I believe, remains the most decorated military unit in American history. Their... DAVIES: Wow. Her sons were fighting in the war, and they were going through this? BECKLEY: Yeah, so - well, just - so my grandma's younger brothers were fighting. DAVIES: They were her brothers (ph). Brothers, yeah. BECKLEY: And then, she actually had a cousin who was in a special ops unit called Merrill's Marauders that - I mean, they were the most hardcore. They went - they were sent to the Pacific theater 'cause he was fluent in Japanese. And he would sneak behind Japanese lines to listen in on them. And then, his special ops team would just, you know, tear them apart, basically. And he actually was inducted into the Army Ranger Hall of Fame for that service. And, you know, my grandma's brothers - you know, one is killed in action. Another took a bunch of shrapnel to the face and received a Purple Heart. Their unit's motto was go for broke. And, you know, they did. They fought like hell in some of the worst campaigns of the war. And then, meanwhile, on the homefront, my grandma's cousin was a man named Gordon Hirabayashi, who was one of the main conscientious objectors to the internment. He took his case all the way to the Supreme Court where he lost on a unanimous decision. And they actually made him hitchhike to prison in Arizona 'cause I guess the government wouldn't pay for his transportation. But 40 years later, in the 1980s, he got a call from a political science professor who had uncovered documents showing the government had withheld information. And the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned his criminal conviction. DAVIES: Wow. Did you talk to your grandparents about this experience? BECKLEY: You know, I didn't talk to them. So my grandfather died before I was alive. But, you know, I - but I was very close to my grandma. And we didn't talk a lot about it, but I think - but I was very aware of all of these stories. And I think it just - just knowing that made international relations more personal for me. Like great power politics isn't some abstraction 'cause it flipped part of my family's life upside down. And I think that personal connection probably, you know, helped give me more energy to spend so many waking hours studying this stuff. I think it also just - it gave me a little bit more perspective because I was coming of age in the 1990s at the peak of post-Cold War triumphalism, and so as a kid, I only knew a world where democracy and free trade were spreading, and, you know, it just seemed like major war was unthinkable. I remember - you know, the Cold War didn't just end; it ends with David Hasselhoff, you know, singing above a soon-to-be-crumbling Berlin Wall wearing a piano-key necktie. You know, so without my family's history, I might have thought that that was the norm, but, you know, I only had to hang out with my grandma to be sort of subtly reminded that peace and prosperity and democracy don't just happen; they're historically rare and have to be reaffirmed. Her cousin, Gordon Hirabayashi, you know, said the Constitution is just a scrap of paper if the will of the people isn't behind it. And I've always just thought, you know, the international order is kind of the same. It's just a mirage if powerful countries don't support it. DAVIES: Yeah. You know, it's interesting that a lot of the steps that we've been talking about involve military responses. I mean, you can sound kind of hawkish when we talk about dropping mines into the strait of Taiwan. And, you know, your grandparents' experience shows also that even democratic nations, when they go to war, you know, can violate people's rights and be abusive. I don't know. Any reflection on that? BECKLEY: I think it's just shown me that, you know, war is hell. War is hell. And great power wars, they tend to get bigger and messier. They tend to last. We're not all going to be home by Christmas. You know, if there's a war between the United States and China, it's going to, at minimum, cause a global depression and, at maximum, could escalate, you know, into a global conflagration, possibly involving nuclear weapons. And I should say that I used to be much more dovish on China. Like, my first book and a lot of my earlier research was on the U.S.-China power balance, and I basically tried to show that China was still lagging pretty far behind. And a lot of international relations theory says, well, as countries, you know, don't catch up, they tend to get more mellow. You know, they don't become as ambitious. But it's when I started studying what happens to these peaking powers and then matching that with what I was watching from China - I just think we're at a point where there aren't great options now. And you kind of have to shore up deterrence as much as you can. There's not a lot of convincing Xi Jinping that he should leave Taiwan alone. You just have to show that a conquest would be more costly than it's worth for him. And right now time is of the essence there. So even - I've been - I'm sort of a reluctant hawk, but I just think we're in a fundamentally new era and one that actually bears more similarity to what my grandparents were dealing with than what I experienced as a kid in the 1990s. DAVIES: Well, Michael Beckley, thank you so much for speaking with us. BECKLEY: Thank you so much. You know, I listen to the show every day, so to be a guest is really a tremendous honor. DAVIES: Michael Beckley is an associate professor of political science at Tufts University.

He led the first impeachment and serves on the House's committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection.  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I am Terry Gross. My guest, Congressman Adam Schiff, has been very busy the past few years investigating Donald Trump. Schiff is the chair of the House Intelligence Committee. Schiff was the lead manager of the first impeachment and Senate impeachment trial of then-President Trump. That was the impeachment focusing around the call with President Zelenskyy in which Trump asked for a favor in return for weapons to fight Russia's military occupation of part of Ukraine. Now Schiff is serving on the House Select Committee investigating January 6 and Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. After FBI agents with a search warrant seized confidential and top-secret documents from Mar-a-Lago last week, Schiff asked the intelligence community for a damage assessment and a briefing for Congress. Schiff has served as a Democratic congressman from California since 2001. He served on the Judiciary Committee from 2001 to 2011. His memoir has just been published in paperback with a new afterword. The book is titled \"Midnight In Washington: How We Almost Lost Our Democracy And Still Could.\" We recorded our interview yesterday morning. Congressman Schiff, welcome to FRESH AIR. In the afterword, which you wrote in May, you question whether the Justice Department is acting with sufficient determination and vigor to investigate Trump's efforts to subvert our democracy. Has the search warrant that, last week, enabled the FBI to remove top-secret, classified documents stored in Mar-a-Lago affected your thoughts on Garland and the DOJ's work moving forward? ADAM SCHIFF: Well, it has affected it. I am more encouraged that the Justice Department is willing to do what it said it would do, which is follow the evidence where it leads. They certainly appear to be doing that in the case of classified materials, some with the highest classification markings that were found at Mar-a-Lago. I still am concerned a year and a half after the events of January 6 though that certain elements of the plot to overturn the election do not appear to be under investigation as they pertain to the former president. And sort of Exhibit A would be Georgia, the president on the phone with the secretary of state in Georgia demanding that he find 11,780 votes that don't exist. And the Justice Department now has evidence, as the result of our investigation, that in a meeting with top Justice Department officials at the time, when he sat down with them in the White House and they told him in no uncertain terms that these claims of election fraud were BS, that his answer was, just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republicans. That's pretty powerful evidence of intent. And we have yet, I think, to see that under the microscope by the Justice Department. GROSS: Well, the Justice Department also recently seized the cell phone of Scott Perry, a Republican congressman from Pennsylvania, and he leads the far-right House Freedom Caucus. And that was seized in connection with the Justice Department's investigation of fake electors to overturn the 2020 election. So is that an optimistic sign to you that the Justice Department is moving forward in investigating the fake elector scheme? SCHIFF: I think they're certainly investigating the fake elector scheme from what we can see publicly. And it is very significant that they took the step of seizing a phone of a member of Congress. What strikes me about that - and I spent almost six years with the Department of Justice - is that it means that they believe that there is probable cause a crime was committed in connection with that fake elector plot and that there was evidence of that crime on that phone. And given the sensitivity of seizing a member of Congress' phone, you have to think that they were doubly careful in terms of their evaluation of the evidence and the facts and the law. So it certainly means that the Justice Department thinks there's a crime here. It doesn't mean necessarily that that member of Congress has committed a crime, but they believe that there's evidence of a crime on that phone. And so, yes, that's a pretty powerful step by the department, I think an important step. And so it does appear that in certain areas and as respects to certain parties, they are being aggressive. And it's about time. GROSS: Do you think the Mar-a-Lago documents put Trump in legal jeopardy? SCHIFF: I think they do. You know, anyone in the intelligence community or, frankly, outside of it that had top-secret documents in their hotel or their private residence - and, in particular, after federal agents went to investigate - and if the - some of the public reporting is correct that those federal agents were told that they had turned them all over and they didn't, they would be in serious legal jeopardy. Now, we don't know the full facts of how they got there, the president's involvement, the president's knowledge, willfulness. These are all things that the Justice Department will have to investigate and analyze. But, yes, I think with respect to anyone else, they would be in serious legal jeopardy. And it shouldn't be different merely because you were the former president of the United States. GROSS: Is there any interaction between the Justice Department's investigation of Trump and the attempt to overturn the election and the January 6 Select Committee, their investigation, the investigation you're a part of? Like, your hearings are public, so the DOJ knows what you've been up to. It sounds like you don't really know what the DOJ has been up to. How do you hope that the January 6 investigation will inform the DOJ? SCHIFF: Well, you know, it's - a couple things. And this is now, I think, the second or third major investigation that I've been involved with where there have been contemporaneous investigations by the Justice Department and by Congress. And there is usually dialogue between the two branches about their investigations to make sure that one doesn't impede or jeopardize the other. In this case, it's, you know, been very public that the Justice Department has asked for Congress to turn over its files. It's not really what Congress does any more than the Justice Department turns over its files to Congress. But we do want to make sure that they get the information that they need to successfully bring people to justice. So we've been in a period of discussion and negotiation about how that accommodation should work. Generally, Congress ends up providing a lot more to the Justice Department than we get back from the Justice Department. In the case of what what's happening in Mar-a-Lago and what's happening in our own investigation, I can't go into the particulars. There have been times where issues of the handling of classified information have come up in the course of our investigation. And when they do, you know, they are obviously of interest and concern to us. But that hasn't been the focus of our investigation. The focus has been very much on the plot to overturn the election. And that plot obviously is a subject matter that we are grateful the Justice Department is also deeply involved in. GROSS: There's been violent rhetoric aimed at Attorney General Garland, the FBI and those who oppose Trump. And it's escalated to the point where it's being compared to the rhetoric before January 6. The FBI headquarters or the FBI office was attacked in Cincinnati. What are you hearing about violent rhetoric right now? SCHIFF: Well, I think this is such a destructive and dangerous turn for our country, that is the degree to which political violence has somehow become acceptable to more and more of the American people. It can never become acceptable. And part of what is responsible is we have the former president really stoking this, calling the FBI corrupt because they searched Mar-a-Lago when it appears they had every reason to do so and more. To - by the former president suggesting they were planting evidence, by the president and his enablers suggesting that people that oppose him, myself very much included, are somehow guilty of treason and - or as the president has said of many people he accuses of treason, that, well, there used to be a way of dealing with people who committed treason. And that was execution. All of this kind of rhetoric and talk about civil war just turns up the heat on the boiling pot. And we see the results, people going to FBI buildings armed to the teeth to shoot people. And, you know, look; I have been, sadly, the subject of death threats for years now. That's becoming widespread in Congress. And this is not the way it used to be in America, that people simply going about their public responsibilities had to deal with this all the time. But we do. And I think the public needs to be aware of it. And I think we need to uniformly, Democrats and Republicans, condemn it. We need to understand, particularly in the social media world now, that words have greater consequences than ever because they find their way to people who are unwell. And they also find their way to people who are motivated to use violence and view them as a call to action. GROSS: You mention talk of civil war. How far does this go? Do you fear that there might actually be a civil war? SCHIFF: Well, I think that a civil war is extremely unlikely. But I am gravely concerned about certain scenarios and where they would lead. And probably the one that concerns me the most is 2024. In my view, the worst-case scenario is not that Donald Trump runs and wins, as terrible a scenario as that would be. The worst-case scenario is that he runs and loses, and the election is overturned. And then you would just have chaos in the streets. If the Republicans deemed without any basis that there was fraud, just as they did in the last election, but lacked the votes to overturn the result and somehow had the votes to overturn the result, where does that lead the country? And to me, that is the most dangerous scenario. But the way to avoid that scenario is to make sure that Donald Trump never goes near the levers of power again. GROSS: Well, let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Congressman Adam Schiff. His memoir, \"Midnight In Washington,\" has just been published in paperback. We'll be right back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF AVISHAI COHEN SONG, \"GBEDE TEMIN\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Congressman Adam Schiff, chair of the House Intelligence Committee. He was the lead manager of the first impeachment of President Trump and now serves on the House select committee investigating January 6 and attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. His memoir, \"Midnight In Washington,\" has just been published in paperback with a new afterword. What are the things coming out of the January 6 committee investigation so far that you think could lead to criminal charges against Donald Trump? SCHIFF: To me, some of the most significant evidence has been evidence of the president's intent, of his involvement and his intent. And, you know, one of those I mentioned earlier, which is that meeting with top Justice Department officials, his own people, in which he's repeatedly told by - you know, earlier by Bill Barr and then later by other top Justice Department officials that these allegations of fraud are just bogus. So he's told this. He knows this. And he not only continues to try to change the election result, pressuring elections officials, pressuring legislators to go back into session and declare him the winner, but on January 6, as the crowd is amassing on the Mall and he's told that there's a problem - and it's not the same problem that he'd had at rallies, where there was a long line at the metal detectors because they were just taking too long to get people through. No, the problem on January 6 was that people wouldn't go through the metal detectors because they didn't want to have to give up their weapons. And his answer is, then take down the magnetometers. They're not here to hurt me. And what more powerful evidence could you have of the president's knowledge that these people were armed, knowledge that they were dangerous and dangerous to others, willingness to have the Capitol and everyone in it, including his own vice president, endangered? He goes back to the White House. He sits there for hours while this attack is going on. He doesn't lift a finger to stop it. People are calling him. They're texting him. They're going in to see him. They're urging him to do something, and he refuses. You know, this is very powerful evidence. And much of this has come out during the course of our investigation and the hearings that we've had. And as you mentioned, the Justice Department certainly watching, listening. We're glad that they are. But, you know, one of the questions I have when they come and they ask for our files and our interviews is, why haven't you done your own interviews with all the people that we have? Their subpoena power is very strong. Their ability to enforce it is much greater than ours. In fact, when we need to enforce our subpoenas, when people are in criminal contempt of Congress, we have to go hat in hand to the Justice Department. And so far, they have only a 50-50, you know, record of enforcement with our subpoenas. I can tell you, if they issued a subpoena to have someone come before the grand jury and they didn't show up, and they simply said, you know, I don't have to answer these questions; I don't have to give a reason, there would be no hesitation by the department to enforce their subpoenas. And they have the power to do it. So you know, I think we produced very important evidence. I think that's, you know, not our role, as some kind of an adjunct to the Department of Justice - we're not. We're doing it as part of our oversight and with an eye to reform, to protect the country going forward. But nonetheless, I think the evidence that has been produced and aired publicly is very important for the Justice Department to follow up on. GROSS: Every time it looks like the committee is ready to wrap up, the January 6 committee, there's more witnesses that are coming forward or that you're calling. And so the investigation keeps continuing, which I imagine keeps pushing back the timeline for actually issuing the report. So what's your latest deadline now for issuing it? SCHIFF: Well, you know, we'll certainly finish our work this session. You're right. The clock keeps - the timeline keeps slipping, and it keeps slipping because we still have this phenomenon where the more people we bring in, the more hearings that we do, the more other witnesses are encouraged, emboldened to come forward and speak with us. But, you know, having been involved as a prosecutor and a Congress with investigations, large investigations before, there is a natural rhythm to an investigation where you do get to a point where the length of time to get the next increment of evidence becomes too long. And it's a natural kind of conclusion point. You seldom get to the point where you think you know everything and that further investigation wouldn't get you, you know, more insights. But you do have to make a decision, OK, it's just going to take too long to get to the next insight. We need to make the public aware of what we've learned. And I'm confident we will wrap up this session. And - but while there's still important information and people coming forward and evidence to present to the public, we want to do that and - as well as move with alacrity on reforms like to the Electoral Count Act and other laws to protect us. GROSS: You write that for three years before impeachment one, that Republicans used to express concerns to you in private about President Trump. What about now? Are Republicans still confessing in private, concerns about Trump that they won't say publicly? SCHIFF: They are. And yes, you know, I mentioned in particular in the book how, you know, during the Russia investigation, passing a senior Republican, a committee chair, who in a hushed tone said, keep doing what you're doing, which, of course, was a heresy. But many felt that the work had to be done. They just didn't feel they could or would do it themselves, and that the political or election consequences were too great. And, of course, what you see happening to Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney and others demonstrates that there was all too much truth to that fear for them. Now, it doesn't excuse the fact that they didn't come forward, that they still haven't come forward in terms of whether they continued to confide those kind of misgivings to me. The, you know, the Trump camp and Fox News has made me such a villain. I don't think they feel comfortable sharing those kind of things with me. But I do hear from my other Democratic colleagues that Republicans continue to confide their horror at what the former president does. But so many of them just want to keep their heads down and just hope we get through this. But this is not the time where we can afford to keep our heads down. GROSS: Have you ever tried one on one to talk a Republican colleague out of a conspiracy theory or to talk a Republican colleague out of the belief that Trump really won the 2020 election? SCHIFF: You know, I haven't, because for the most part, it's not necessary. They know the big lie is a big lie. You know, this is the terrible... GROSS: So you think they know that? SCHIFF: Oh, without a doubt, without a doubt. I mean, these are smart people. You know, you have some of the destructive performance artists, the Marjorie Taylor Greene's and others. But for the most part, the vast majority of the Republican conference, they know the big lie is a big lie, and they know their party leader is a big liar. They just lack the courage to do anything about it. And - but they understand exactly the circumstances. You cannot tell me that representatives who are elected in the same election, on the same ballot don't understand the hypocrisy of claiming that the election was rigged and fraudulent as to one office on the ballot, but their election was somehow perfectly legitimate. You know, they understand this perfectly well. They just aren't willing to speak out. They don't want to be in Adam Kinzinger's shoes or Liz Cheney's or anyone else who has stepped up and now decided they had to retire or lose in a Republican primary. GROSS: Well, let me reintroduce you. If you're just joining us, my guest is Congressman Adam Schiff. His memoir, \"Midnight In Washington,\" has just been published in paperback with a new afterword. We'll be right back after we take a short break. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF ALBERTO IGLESIAS' \"COMANDANTE I\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday morning with Congressman Adam Schiff, chair of the House Intelligence Committee. He was the lead manager of the first impeachment of President Trump and now serves on the House select committee investigating January 6 and attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. His memoir, \"Midnight In Washington,\" has just been published in paperback with a new afterword. What is it like for you to work with colleagues who you believe, you know, who are amplifying falsehoods or conspiracy theories, who you believe know better and that they don't necessarily believe these falsehoods and conspiracy theories? But you're working with them on a regular basis. They're your colleagues. What's that experience like? SCHIFF: Well, you know, I have to say it has been a tragic epiphany for me over the last five or six years to see what many of my colleagues are made of. And I had thought more highly of them. And it was a rude awakening to see that at the end of the day, they really didn't believe in what they were saying. At least they didn't believe in it enough to stand up for it. Donald Trump, in so many ways, is no conservative. There is no conservative ideology in what he is articulating. It's just all about him and all about attaining power and keeping power. And so it has been a rude shock that I've just had to acclimate to. You know, I think the fever will break. This, too, shall pass. You know, we are a deeply resilient country. We've gone through other traumatic times in the past. We will get through this. But I do think that what we do in this moment will determine how quickly we get through it, how much damage we have to suffer along the way. And there is a role for every one of us right now to defend our democracy. GROSS: It looks like the Christian nationalism movement is growing. You know, Doug Mastriano, who's the Republican candidate for governor in Pennsylvania, is a Christian nationalist. There are other candidates and people in office who are - and I'm - oh, Viktor Orban, who, you know, is anti-Semitic, was invited to speak at CPAC, the conservative conference over the summer. And an earlier CPAC conference was held in Hungary. And I'm wondering - I mean, you're Jewish. You don't have to be Jewish to think that Christian nationalism that says that we are a Christian country - you don't have to be Jewish to think that that is a very narrow interpretation of who we are as a country. We're supposed to be a diverse country. We are a diverse country. But - so I'm wondering what you think about the growing Christian nationalist movement and if that's affecting you as somebody who is targeted by extremists. I imagine you're also targeted for being Jewish. SCHIFF: You know, there is a lot of anti-Semitic hate, particularly online, that I'm subjected to, but there's many others, as well. And yes, you know, the rise of the Viktor Orbans, the demonization of people like George Soros - you know, we've seen the kind of veneer torn off and, you know, an ugly vein of bigotry that's always been there. Robert Caro saying that power reveals - it's also revealed a lot about our country and bigotry that is right below the surface, that can be tapped and can be mined and can be used for political purposes. And, you know, those appeals to bigotry now are quite overt. The dog whistles are no longer whistles that only dogs can hear. They can be heard by everyone. And, you know, I think of all of the images of January 6. The ones that were the most disturbing were the Confederate flags, the Auschwitz T-shirts because that said to me that the road to recovery is going to be far longer than I would have thought if this were just a kind of Trumpist insurrection, that it was also a white nationalist insurrection. And, you know, we have to have our eyes wide open about this. And it so illustrative of the importance of having people of character in the Oval Office because when you have someone who is willing to appeal to the basest instincts and people and legitimize them, this is what happens. GROSS: Your memoir's just been published in paperback and in the new afterword, which was written in May, you write about having just recently returned from a meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy about how the war was going. And of course, while you were there speaking to him, you thought about the first impeachment, which focused on Trump's call in which he basically asks for a favor in return for American money and weapons to help Ukraine fight the war against the Russians. Well, obviously, that call took on new meaning after this current war with Russia, after Russia invaded Ukraine, as opposed to just an incursion into part of Ukraine, which had already started back in, I think, 2016. Did you consider talking with President Zelenskyy about that call and about the impeachment? Did you talk to him about it? And did you entertain the idea of talking to him about it? SCHIFF: You know, I did not talk to him about it. And yes, I would have loved to have talked to him about it. You know, we had, you know, much more pressing matters. We met with him for about 3 hours, and it was all about the war. What do you need? How do you need it? What's effective? And so it was, as it should have been, completely focused on the war. But, yes, I would have loved to have talked to him about it. And, you know, sitting across the table from him, I couldn't help but think about what it must have been like at the time of that call, that infamous call where Donald Trump tried to shake him down. He had only been president for a short period of time. And prior to being president, he was an actor, comedic actor, playing a comedic actor who becomes a president of his country in a case of life imitating art to an extraordinary degree. And so here he is on the world stage for the first time, having his first interaction with his most - second interaction but first really substantive one other than a congratulatory call - with his most important patron at a time where he's desperate to get weapons to help fend off the Russians. And he's shaken down by the president of the United States. And I wondered what he must have thought of the United States and whether he must have imagined, well, this must be just how the world works because if this is the United States, then how must other nations behave? It also told him, of course, that the United States didn't care about Ukraine except as a tool to help win an American election. And I did hope, as I sat there with him and given the strong support we have been providing Ukraine, that he has a different impression of our country now. But the fact that Trump is still viable, you know, is not lost on anyone around the world. And, you know, it grieves me to hear President Biden say when he does that in talking to people in Europe and talking about how America is back, that the response is sometimes, yes, but for how long? That's just - to me, that's just painful. And it speaks of the long damage that has been done to our standing. GROSS: You know, I think a lot about how during the first impeachment, Ukraine wasn't on the minds of a lot of Americans. And a lot of people probably couldn't even have told you where it was or what its relationship to Russia was. And ever since Russia invaded, you know, Ukraine and started, you know, bombing Ukraine - and so many displaced people and killed people, etc. - Ukraine has been on the minds of Americans. It's such an interesting contrast. Do you think about that a lot? SCHIFF: Oh, I do, absolutely, and wish the public had a greater understanding of the importance of Ukraine and the threat from Russia at the time of that impeachment to see how dangerous Donald Trump's actions really were. And - but now - and I do think this has been an important impact of the war - the American people have seen the horror that is Vladimir Putin. And now when you look back, in retrospect, of Donald Trump's sycophantic embrace of Putin, standing on the stage with him in Helsinki and saying that he believes Putin over his own intelligence agencies, even at the beginning of the war in Ukraine making excuses for the invasion of Ukraine and talking about how Putin was a genius, it has revealed just how dangerous and destructive Trump's relationship with Putin has been, his embrace of Putin has been. And that, I think, has been a real consequence. GROSS: Well, let me reintroduce you again. If you're just joining us, my guest is Congressman Adam Schiff. His memoir, \"Midnight In Washington\" has just been published in paperback. We'll be right back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF CUONG VU AND PAT METHENY'S \"SEEDS OF DOUBT\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday morning with Congressman Adam Schiff, chair of the House Intelligence Committee. He was the lead manager of the first impeachment of President Trump and now serves on the House Select Committee investigating January 6 and attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. So one of the things you describe in the book is learning how to gavel so that you really have control because there had been recent instances where the person gaveling the committee had lost control and it was a real food fight. So tell us what you learned about how to gavel with command and authority. SCHIFF: Well, you know, one of the big contrasts between the Ukraine investigation and our January 6 hearings is that we knew we were going to be facing disruptions by the Republicans during our hearings, an effort to distract from the testimony of these important witnesses like Fiona Hill and Alexander Vindman and Bill Taylor and others. And they would use every effort they could to try to needle me or get under my skin or provoke a fight. And so I needed to use the gavel very effectively. And we brought in the expert help of what we call the two Phils - two former staff of Henry Waxman, brilliant guys, very schooled in the use of parliamentary procedure. And we did all these rehearsals, you know, just the Democratic members. And they would play - you know, they would play Jim Jordan. Jim Jordan was brought onto the Intel Committee for the purpose of the Ukraine hearings - to disrupt. Now, if you don't remember the fact that Jim Jordan actually was participating in those hearings, it was - because he was, you know, just categorically unsuccessful. And a big part of that was the two Phils taught us how to deal with those efforts at distraction. And so I used to - I learned to use the gavel hard by slamming it down, but also more often by tapping it and by, you know, using it like a conductor would use his baton. And I think it was really important in being able to keep the hearings on track, keep the focus on the witnesses. And as you look back on those hearings now, I think most people don't remember what the Republicans were doing. And they were trying to do a lot. It just didn't work. And one of the things that I would... GROSS: So give us a tip of how to gavel effectively and prevent out-of-order outbursts. SCHIFF: Well, you know, I think how you use the gavel in the beginning of the hearing is the most important because if you can shut down efforts to obstruct in the beginning, then you'll shut them down indefinitely for the rest of the hearing. If you can't, then you're just going to have chaos the rest of the hearing. So, you know, I remember early in one hearing, both, I think, Jordan and Stefanik tried to interrupt. And I gaveled them down, and then, they essentially gave up and, you know, were quite docile in their objections for the rest of the hearing. And so I think, you know, the early use of the gavel and parliamentary procedure, knowing the rulings that you can make when questions are not in order, when things are not debatable and when they are, is really important. So it's not just how you bang the gavel, but also how you rule on objections and working as a team so that other members can also interject when necessary, make motions when necessary, to bring an end to dilatory debate. GROSS: So you were the lead manager in impeachment one, impeaching President Trump. And he was impeached in the House for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. And then you were the lead manager in the Senate trial, which did not convict him. In your book, you describe trying to come up with a strategy that would help convince Republican senators to convict Trump and remove him from office. And - because you felt that they knew that he'd done something wrong, but they weren't willing to actually convict and remove him from office. So I want to play an excerpt of your concluding speech to the Senate. And after we hear this, we'll talk about what you intended to do when you were saying this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SCHIFF: He has compromised our elections. And he will do so again. You will not change him. You cannot constrain him. He is who he is. Truth matters little to him. What's right matters even less. And decency matters not at all. I do not ask you to convict him because truth or right or decency matters nothing to him, but because we have proven our case and it matters to you. Truth matters to you. Right matters to you. You are decent. He is not who you are. GROSS: So Adam Schiff, when you said that he'd compromise his elections and will do so again, were you expecting an insurrection? SCHIFF: I was not expecting an insurrection. I didn't have that kind of clairvoyance. But saying what I did really didn't require much clairvoyance at all. It was very apparent who Donald Trump was at that point and the risk that he posed to the country. And I did realize during the trial - I had a bit of an epiphany that I write about, when one of my staff grabbed my arm before I went to do the closing for that day and said that they believe he's guilty. They want to know why he should be removed. And up until that point, I don't think I fully appreciated the fact that the senators who would go out during the trial and say there was no quid pro quo didn't believe what they were saying. In fact, it was reported at one point that Ted Cruz told Trump's defense team to stop making that argument because nobody believes it. They understood exactly what Trump had done. And what they needed to be persuaded was why he needed to be removed from office. Normally, during a trial and as a prosecutor, all you had to do was prove the facts. Well, we had proven the facts. And that wasn't enough for these senators. And I remember thinking to myself, God, if they realize he withheld 400 million in military aid to get help cheating in the election and that's not enough, what will it take? And I realized that they needed to be persuaded that he was a continuing danger to the country. And to me, what made him so dangerous then, what makes him so dangerous now is that he is fundamentally untruthful. He doesn't know right from wrong. And he is, basically, indecent. And I wanted to appeal to the decency of the senators. GROSS: Let me reintroduce you again. If you're just joining us, my guest is Congressman Adam Schiff. His memoir, \"Midnight In Washington,\" has just been published in paperback. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF BEBO VALDES TRIO'S \"PARE COCHERO\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday morning with Congressman Adam Schiff, chair of the House Intelligence Committee. His memoir, \"Midnight In Washington,\" has just been published in paperback. Do you watch Fox News and see how people are vilifying you? Or do you leave that for others to report to you? SCHIFF: That is the unfortunate task of my staff. So they will get clips of the attacks on me. And they will send them to me - and not all of them because they'd be sending them to me all the time. I used to watch Fox so that I could see what they were saying and what - you know, what people were listening to and watching and believing. But it just became so disturbing. I couldn't stomach it anymore. But I do need to know about the attacks because, you know, they're effective in trying to discredit their opposition, you know? This is one of the things that Trump does is, anyone who stands up to him, at his rallies, his, you know, sycophants and enablers on \"Fox Primetime,\" they do everything they can to tear down, to smear their opponents. And I see the effect of it. I'll be, you know, at a train station and step off the platform. And someone will come up to me and say, are you Adam Schiff? I just want to shake your hand. You're my hero. And the next person standing right next to them will say, well, you're not my hero. You lie all the time. Why do you lie all the time? And I will look at the two of them. And I'll say, I know what you're watching. And I know what you're watching. And it's not the same thing because I'm the same person. And I can't be both, right? And this, to me, is one of the most crosscutting challenges that we have is simply how we get our information from different places. And I'm convinced, you know, among the most significant differences between Watergate and today is the fact that Richard Nixon did not have Fox News. Had Richard Nixon had Fox News, he would have never been forced to leave office. It is not a media outlet as much as it is a state-run TV for Trump and the Republican Party. And it is astounding to me that Rupert Murdoch is willing to have someone like Tucker Carlson on, who is a Putin enabler, who describes Ukraine as something less than a real country, defends Russia in this. It's utterly shameful and unpatriotic. And I guess it's just all about the money because I can't understand any other reason why that kind of destructive propaganda would be aired to millions of Americans. GROSS: It seems like now if you're entering politics or if you're involved with overseeing elections, that you have to make a calculation not only about your own safety but the safety of your family. In your case, like, your children are grown. You live with your wife. You're not home all the time. You were worried about your wife. She was worried about her safety. Can you talk about making that calculation that knowing if you stick your neck out and become, you know, lead manager of impeachment and then serve on the January 6 committee, that there are going to be really serious threats against you and that that might affect your family, too, that they might be in jeopardy, too? SCHIFF: Well, you know, it's certainly nothing I contemplated before I ran for office. None of this is anything I would have contemplated years ago. And, you know, over the years, we would - and, you know, early on in the Trump administration, when my son was still at home - and I would be threatened. My kids would be threatened. My wife would be threatened. And and it wasn't the threats alone. I remember - and I describe this in the book - one night being in the kitchen with my wife, Eve, and she was very upset. And she's a very strong person, wasn't - it's not common for me to see her that upset. And I assumed it was the threats, but in this case, it wasn't a particular threat. She said, I just can't stand how millions of people - they just hate you. And, you know, it was kind of a boiling frog phenomenon for me. I had had to acclimate myself to the fact that, you know, Trump with his bully pulpit and Fox News with their, you know, primetime lineup - there was no way I could compete with that. Every time they would lie about me, there was no way I could get the truth to their viewers and get the truth to the millions of people that follow Donald Trump on social media. I just had to live with the fact that millions and millions of people were going to have the worst views of me, and there was nothing I could do about it. But I didn't realize how difficult that was for Eve until she said that. You know, up until the Trump years, I had a very different reputation publicly and among my colleagues. You know, I think I was viewed as one of the least partisan members of the House. And I don't think I've changed. I don't think that Donald Trump is is really a Republican. I think he's a Trumpist. And, you know, what my job required me to do made me a lightning rod. And I was fine with that. I am fine with that. But it's another thing for your family. And so that - you know, that, you know, from time to time has really been hard. GROSS: Congressman Schiff, thank you so much for talking with us. I really appreciate it. SCHIFF: My pleasure. Thank you. GROSS: My interview with Congressman Adam Schiff was recorded yesterday morning. His memoir, \"Midnight In Washington,\" has just been published in paperback. Tomorrow on FRESH AIR, our guest will be Beth Macy, author of the book \"Dopesick.\" She'll talk about citizen volunteers working to save lives and heal spirits in rural communities ravaged by the opioid epidemic. And we'll meet Michelle Mathis, co-founder of an organization doing that work. Macy has written a new book called \"Raising Lazarus.\" I hope you'll join us.

Prosecutors charged leaders of two far-right groups with seditious conspiracy. So what kind of contact did they have with former President Trump? Here's NPR investigative correspondent Tom Dreisbach. TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE: The two major investigations into January 6, one by the Justice Department and one by the House Select Committee, have different goals and strategies. JON LEWIS: The DOJ treated it like a crime scene from day one, right? So they started at the very bottom, slowly meticulously worked their way up. DREISBACH: This is Jon Lewis. He researches extremism at George Washington University and. He says the Justice Department began by charging foot soldiers from extremist groups like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, those who allegedly stormed the building. Eventually, they charged the group's leaders, who allegedly conspired behind the scenes to commit sedition. LEWIS: As DOJ has worked from the bottom up, you've had the committee effectively working from the top down. DREISBACH: The committee does not have the power to bring criminal charges. They have been more focused on the big picture, the role of former President Trump and the lawyers, advisors and officials who tried to overturn the election. What remains unclear is just how much these two inquiries might overlap. There are some possible clues, like the testimony of former Trump White House official Cassidy Hutchinson. Here's what she said about conversations involving Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CASSIDY HUTCHINSON: I recall hearing the word Oath Keeper and hearing the word Proud Boys closer to the planning of the January 6 rally when Mr. Giuliani would be around. DREISBACH: The committee did not provide more specifics, but we do know that the longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone has close ties to Florida Proud Boys, including the group's now-indicted leader. And Stone got security help from members of the Oath Keepers. The leader of the Oath Keepers, also indicted, has said he provided security for Trump adviser Michael Flynn at an event in 2020. So we know they had those connections to extremist groups before the riot, but it's still not clear if those connections played any role in what happened next. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LIZ CHENEY: The night before January 6, President Trump instructed his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, to contact both Roger Stone and Michael Flynn regarding what would play out the next day. DREISBACH: Congresswoman Liz Cheney asked Cassidy Hutchinson about that call. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHENEY: And do you know what they talked about that evening, Ms. Hutchinson? HUTCHINSON: I'm not sure. DREISBACH: Stone and Flynn have denied all wrongdoing. In their interviews with the committee, both asserted their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Trump, meanwhile, personally attacked Hutchinson on social media. Both prosecutors and the committee have also been looking at other extremists, like Nick Fuentes. He's a live streamer best known for pedaling white nationalism and Holocaust denial and helping lead pro-Trump Stop the Steal events after the 2020 election. During the riot on January 6, he rallied people outside the Capitol with a megaphone. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NICK FUENTES: Mike Pence has betrayed this president. And he has betrayed the people of the United States. And we will never, ever forget. DREISBACH: Fuentes also has political connections, including the backing of pro-Trump Congressman Paul Gosar, who supported efforts to overturn the election as well. Prosecutors have not charged Fuentes, though one of his followers pleaded guilty to storming the Senate floor. Congressional investigators have subpoenaed Fuentes but have not yet disclosed what they've learned. Tom Dreisbach, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Two men have been arrested for hate speech.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: India's Supreme Court has launched an investigation into hate speech against Muslims. It's focused on a conference of Hindu religious leaders last month where clerics called for violence against minorities. NPR's Lauren Frayer reports. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) POOJA SHAKUN PANDEY: (Singing in non-English language). LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: A devout Hindu woman in saffron robes sings a blessing at the start of a three-day conference last month in Haridwar, a city sacred to Hindus on the banks of the Ganges River. Her name is Pooja Shakun Pandey. She's a member of a Hindu supremacist group. And later in the conference, she screams passionately into the microphone. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PANDEY: (Non-English language spoken). FRAYER: \"We are ready to kill and go to jail,\" she says. \"If we can kill 2 million of them, we will be victorious.\" By them, she means Muslims - India's largest minority. Video of this conference was leaked to Indian media, showing hundreds of participants, men and women, young and old, raising their arms in a right-wing salute and taking an oath to transform India from a secular republic into a Hindu nation. NEETI NAIR: When it came onto the news, I was shocked. FRAYER: Neeti Nair is a historian who's tracked the rise of Hindu nationalism in India. This was a fringe gathering, not representative of the vast majority of Indians. But Nair was shocked to see on the video at least one politician from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's mainstream party. Nair teaches at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, a city that hosted a white supremacist rally in 2017 during Donald Trump's presidency. And she sees similarities in the way hate speech against minorities and attacks have increased under Modi in India. NAIR: The kind of vigilantism that we have seen is unprecedented. What is also unprecedented is the silence of the leadership. FRAYER: Modi has not condemned the Haridwar conference, though others from his party have. It also came up last week on Capitol Hill. Gregory Stanton, the head of Genocide Watch, a group that works to predict and prevent mass murder, testified before Congress that the language used against Muslims at that conference in northern India is the same type of hate speech he heard in Myanmar and in Rwanda before genocide there. GREGORY STANTON: We believe that is what the Haridwar meeting was especially aimed at inciting. Incitement of genocide is a crime under the Genocide Convention. And it is law in India. That law must be enforced. FRAYER: Police have detained two organizers of the Haridwar conference for alleged hate speech. They face multiple years in prison if convicted. The Supreme Court is demanding answers from the state government and weighing whether to order the halt of a similar conference later this month in a neighboring state. Both of those states, along with three others next month, will hold elections, and that's when hate speech tends to spike. Lauren Frayer, NPR News, Mumbai. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

            "article_content": "The Jan. 6 committee has been uncovering what led up to the insurrection, but lurking beneath the hearings is a sometimes unspoken reason \u2014 race and the loss of white power.  JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: The January 6 committee hearings painted an elaborate and often damning portrait of former President Donald Trump's role in the insurrection. But race is also playing a central, if sometimes unspoken, role. NPR's Sandhya Dirks has more. SANDHYA DIRKS, BYLINE: There's this striking moment back at the very beginning of the hearings in Senator Bennie Thompson's opening statement. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BENNIE THOMPSON: I'm from a part of the country where people justify the actions of slavery, Klu Klux Klan and lynching. And reminded of that dark history as I hear voices today try and justify the actions of the insurrectionists on January 6, 2021. DIRKS: Thompson draws a direct line from the lost cause to the big lie. Hakeem Jefferson, a political scientist at Stanford, says Thompson's very presence as an elder Black Southern man at the helm of the hearings holds meaning. HAKEEM JEFFERSON: To see someone who looks like Bennie Thompson wield this amount of institutional power against a person like Donald Trump, who is awash in the markings of whiteness and privilege and all that it affords. DIRKS: Whiteness, Jefferson says, is at the center of the events this hearing is interrogating. JEFFERSON: January 6 was a racial backlash. DIRKS: More precisely, he says, it's part of an ongoing white backlash against the very perception of racial progress. JEFFERSON: Some white people are really concerned about a loss of power and status in American society. DIRKS: At the heart of January 6, Jefferson says, is a story about power - white power. JEFFERSON: It's not about power that's maintained by burning crosses. It's about the power that's maintained about telling some stories and not some others in schools. It's about the power to elect people who you think will do your bidding. DIRKS: Over on Fox News, hosts like Tucker Carlson, who has peddled almost every conspiracy and lie about January 6, have consistently said that race or racism has nothing to do with it. Here he is in June, after falsely implying that the election could very well have been stolen. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT\") TUCKER CARLSON: A lot of the protesters on January 6 were very upset about that. And they should have been. All of us should be. But the January 6 committee ignored all of that completely. Instead, on the basis of zero evidence - no evidence whatsoever - they blame the entire riot on white supremacy. DIRKS: Of course, the January 6 committee hasn't really done that. The hearings haven't mentioned race much. And it is a central part of their case that rioters showed up precisely because they believed Trump's lie about a stolen election. But who believed that lie and why they believed it has everything to do with race, says Robert Pape, director of the University of Chicago Project on Security and Threats. ROBERT PAPE: What we're really observing are the consequences of the fear of white status decline. DIRKS: Pape has been researching those who were arrested for storming the Capitol. He says they don't fit the old profiles of extremism. PAPE: The counties that lost the most non-Hispanic white population are the counties that produced the most January 6 insurrectionists. DIRKS: Most are white and male, but more than half are white-collar - doctors, lawyers. And they come from cities and suburbs, many from places Biden won. Pape says his research shows that a driving force among insurrectionists and those that support them is a fear of a white majority becoming a minority and having to give up power. PAPE: These are the parts of the country where diversity is happening the fastest. This is dovetailing with rhetoric by politicians and by media figures, stoking fear about the great replacement. DIRKS: To put it simply, they came from places that used to be almost all white and aren't anymore. PAPE: Nearly 90% are not members of these militant extremist groups. DIRKS: That's the racist conspiracy theory that Black and brown people are replacing white people as part of a nefarious Democratic plan to take power and steal elections, a theory peddled by people like Tucker Carlson. And it's believed not just by many of the people who stormed the Capitol but by the vast majority of Republicans. Here's political scientist Hakeem Jefferson again. JEFFERSON: What's dangerous is when a group like this begins to adopt the mindset, or the rhetoric, of an oppressed minority. DIRKS: Dangerous because, Jefferson says, when members of a group that still holds very real privilege, like white people, imagine themselves on the margins, that's when violent white nationalism takes hold. The narrative the January 6 committee has presented for the most part has been told in the voices of Republicans and former Trump loyalists. There was one notable exception - Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Shaye Moss. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SHAYE MOSS: I've always been told by my grandmother how important it is to vote and how people before me, a lot of people, older people in my family did not have that right. DIRKS: Moss and her mom are both poll workers who Trump attacked by name, leading to death threats and racist attacks. Political scientist Akeem Jefferson says what these two women represent is not a political party or person in power but the right of average people to vote, a right that for many was only achieved within recent memory. JEFFERSON: So many Black people and Black women in particular work on these front lines of democracy. DIRKS: Jefferson says our fragile and incomplete multiracial democracy is in peril. It's not just January 6. It's also a slow-moving threat from the right, the Supreme Court, gerrymandering, voter suppression laws like some of the ones now on the books in Georgia overseen by Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. He was lauded at the hearings for standing up for democracy and against Trump. But back home, the laws he's championed have made it harder for people of color to vote. JEFFERSON: January 6 was a racial project, but the everyday undoings and attacks on American democracy are also a part of a racial project. So yeah, it's the elephant in the room, but it's the whole damn room. This is all about race, all the time. DIRKS: It continues a larger, longer battle that has never really ended over whose votes get counted and whose votes get to count. I'm Sandhya Dirks, NPR News.

            "article_content": "NPR's Daniel Estrin asks Tamar Hermann of the Israel Democracy Institute about the rise of the far-right in Israel.  DANIEL ESTRIN, HOST: Here in Jerusalem, in a matter of days, Israel will swear in the most right-wing government in its history. Its members will pose for the traditional photo. Benjamin Netanyahu will sit in the front, as the returning prime minister. Gathered around him will be some of Israel's most far-right figures - an activist who was convicted of inciting anti-Arab racism and who wielded a gun in confrontations with Palestinians. He'll be overseeing the national police. There will be a West Bank settler leader who wants to block Palestinians from having their own state alongside Israel, what's called the two-state solution. And there will be ultra-religious politicians who want to promote Orthodox Judaism in public life. Netanyahu says he'll be the one in charge and will promote responsible policies. Critics are mapping out what Israel might look like. NOA SATTATH: So I think the thing that is most - we're most worried about is the potential for violence. ESTRIN: I spoke to Noa Sattath, who directs the Association for Civil Rights in Israel. She recalls the Gaza war in May of last year, when there were street riots inside Israel between Jewish and Arab citizens. And she says she worries about something like that happening again, but this time with a far-right police minister. SATTAH: We're worried about violent cycles that will be longer and more extreme than in the past. We are worried that the police brutality around these violent cycles will be unprecedented. ESTRIN: She worries the new government will discriminate against Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel, like disqualifying Arab parties from running for office. SATTAH: They could draft a law banning the Palestinian flag, and that could be law. ESTRIN: She's concerned about liberalism in Israel. Ultra-Orthodox Jewish members of the new government want the power to separate women from men at public events and to allow business owners to refuse service to same-sex couples. And she's concerned about the government's plans for the supreme court. In the past, the court has struck down laws that discriminate against Palestinians and migrants. The new government wants lawmakers to have the final say. SATTAH: The stripping away of the power of the supreme court would be devastating, in the long-term, in terms of the - our struggle for human and civil rights. ESTRIN: So how can we understand the rise of Jewish, far-right ultra-nationalism in Israel? I asked Tamar Hermann. She studies public opinion at the Israel Democracy Institute. She says Israel has been moving rightward for about a decade now. Religious Jewish Israelis overwhelmingly define themselves as right wing. Orthodox families have high birth rates and their kids tend to share their politics. But this year, researcher Tamar Hermann saw a shift. Many young Israelis, who are not religious, voted for the far right. And a third of Israel's soldiers voted for the far right. The far right wants to loosen the rules on when soldiers patrolling Palestinians can shoot. TAMAR HERMANN: The message of the radical right was clear cut, it was simple, it had to do with the status of the Israeli Arab citizens. That has gotten much more complicated since May 2021, when we had these violent clashes in the mixed towns and cities. These are the common assessments. ESTRIN: The very slim majority of Jewish Israelis define themselves either as secular or following basic Jewish tradition, but not religious. What do they think about this incoming government, where ministers are going to be promoting Orthodox Judaism in public life? We've even heard one who says he wants to shut down soccer games on the Sabbath. We've heard about efforts to block schools from teaching progressive curriculum, like LGBTQ topics. Are most Jewish Israelis onboard with that? HERMAN: This kind of development was not expected, because they didn't expect the radical right to have such leverage to put pressure on Netanyahu - actually caught them by surprise. ESTRIN: Her latest polls show most secular Israelis who voted for Netanyahu don't support these new initiatives, which the far right has demanded in exchange for joining Netanyahu's government. But from their point of view, it's better than the outgoing, liberal government, which included an Arab political party that they couldn't stomach in a country that defines itself as Jewish and democratic. HERMAN: The relations between Jews and Arabs in Israel are now much worse than they used to be. Actually, we see a process of radicalization on both the Arab side and the Jewish side, not only on the right. This is something that we should keep in mind. Of course, the right is much more outspoken about it. But the average Israeli, the Jewish Israeli citizen, is now much more doubtful about the ability to have a benevolent cooperation with the Arab minority. And some of the Arabs and the Arab leaders are actually saying we don't want to take part in the political game. ESTRIN: What about the lives of Palestinians in the Israeli occupied West Bank? This is the big issue for the international community - Israel's occupation - its overarching control of the lives of Palestinians. What are Israelis thinking about that today? HERMAN: They're not thinking about it. As surprising as it may sound to people from the outside, the occupation was not on the table during the last five election campaigns. The status quo is perceived as something that Israel can live with, and actually, this is perceived as such on the center, and on the right, and also on certain parts of the left, because they don't see a partner on the other side. And there is no solution put on the table. No one put any real pressure on Israel, in this regard, for years now, neither Europe nor Washington, certainly not other players in the international community. So there is a big difference between what the international community is saying and what it is doing, on the level of actions, from the economic point of view, commercial point of view, security point of view. Everyone is cooperating with Israel. ESTRIN: Tamar Hermann, senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute. Tamar, thank you. HERMAN: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "America was polarized during the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Veterans from the movement say the racial backlash they feel today is reminiscent of the recoil they faced in 1968.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Many Americans feel they've never seen their country as divided as it is today. But some with longer memories recall the 1960s. The Vietnam War is widely seen today as a mistake. But opinions back then were deeply divided. The civil rights movement today is widely praised, but it drew fierce opposition back then. NPR's John Burnett examines today's divisions through the eyes of some veterans of the civil rights movement. VALDA HARRIS MONTGOMERY: Hi, everybody. First, welcome to Montgomery. Second, welcome to Centennial Hill. JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: And welcome to the Harris House. The home of brick and white siding where Valda Harris Montgomery grew up served as a refuge for civil rights legends like John Lewis and Martin Luther King Jr. MONTGOMERY: So if anybody has any questions, let me know. BURNETT: She's giving an informal tour to a group of Episcopal seminarians from Austin. The house sits a few blocks from the state capitol, where Alabama Governor George Wallace vowed, segregation forever. MONTGOMERY: This was the prominent African American neighborhood back in the 1800s. So it's going to be filled with Black history events, as well as civil rights events. BURNETT: Inside the house, the third-floor strategy room, they called it, is unchanged from back in the day - same wood paneling, beige sofa and stereo system. Montgomery's mother served spaghetti to movement foot soldiers, like the Freedom Riders, who rode buses through the South, pursued by white mobs, to integrate interstate transportation. Her father, a pharmacist, brought them antiseptic and bandages when needed. Sixty years later, Harris cannot believe the nation is again torn asunder, that we were again at each other's throats. MONTGOMERY: We thought we had gotten there in the '70s and the '80s. But we're so hate-filled that I'm just afraid that there's going to be some type of battle. You know, why do you hate Jewish people? Why do you hate Black people? Why do you hate LGBTQ people? How are they threatening you? BURNETT: The people interviewed for this story, who played roles, major and minor, in the civil rights years, thought America had evolved beyond this. MONTGOMERY: A lot of my friends, and that's what's - not just me, feel that we're just reliving the past, and that we have got to make sure that our children and our grandchildren understand that, that this is not new. TAYLOR BRANCH: Those things ripped the country and families apart back then. BURNETT: The Pulitzer Prize-winning author and historian of the civil rights movement, Taylor Branch, is 75 years old. He's in the middle of writing a sweeping new book about the influence of race in all of American history. BRANCH: I think we've always had extremely divisive issues. Right now, what we - I think that we lack is a more coherent, positive alternative. And that's what Dr. King and the civil rights movement provided. BURNETT: Branch says civil rights activists showed an abiding faith in the public trust, much as the nation's founders did. They believed that this nation's experiment in self-government would take the place of violence and free us. BRANCH: My view is that we are failing both the legacy of the founders in Philadelphia and the legacy of the re-founders in the civil rights era by allowing our politics to be so corroded and cynical. BURNETT: One of the leaders in the struggle for racial equality was Bernard Lafayette. He participated in the Freedom Rides, the Selma voting rights campaign and the Nashville student lunch counter sit-ins. BERNARD LAFAYETTE: I'm an expert on mean white folk. So if you want to know anything about mean white folks, you're looking at the right person. BURNETT: Sitting regally at a conference table at Auburn University in Alabama, where he's a visiting scholar, Lafayette, 82 years old, smiles and savors the question, how would he compare the fault lines in the 1960s with the 2020s? LAFAYETTE: Back in the '60s, whites had no inclination that Blacks could rise up in political power. So that is one of the things that has changed now. I think that today, it's more scared white folks. They have come to the conclusion that other minority groups can take over. BURNETT: There was American separatism 60 years ago. But it wasn't red and blue, it was Black and white. HANK SANDERS: Back in the '60s, they didn't call it polarization. They called it segregation. BURNETT: Henry Sanders is a 79-year-old civil rights attorney, former student activist and retired state senator in Selma, Ala. Sanders, too, has been disheartened by the setbacks. SANDERS: I was one of those people who were convinced that with the election of President Obama, race relationship was going to get better, because I said, you know, they'll see that he's an intelligent and capable man. He's got a wonderful wife and children. I was just shocked that it had the exact opposite reaction. BURNETT: Police and civilian shootings of unarmed Black people, the massacre of Black worshippers in Charleston and Black supermarket shoppers in Buffalo, the last White House courting white nationalism and the Confederate battle flag paraded through the U.S. Capitol on January 6, new state voting restrictions transparently aimed at Democrat-leaning Black communities - to veterans of the movement, this is an old script, measurable progress followed by a backlash. Clayborne Carson is an emeritus history professor at Stanford University, director of the Martin Luther King Papers Project and once a civil rights militant in California. He's sitting in his backyard in Palo Alto. CLAYBORNE CARSON: I don't think any of us who struggled to get civil rights and voting rights in the mid-1960s thought that this was going to lead to this huge political shift in America and that the winners, in a way, were the people who built their careers on that backlash. I don't think Richard Nixon would have won in 1968 if not for this backlash. BURNETT: Forty-eight years later, Donald Trump would build his movement on a backlash to President Obama. CARSON: The notion that in 2020s we would still be fighting over voting rights just didn't really occur to me. But here we are. BURNETT: Here we are, back where we started, at the historic Harris House in Alabama. But rather than end on a pessimistic tone, Valda Montgomery says she's encouraged by all the people who tour her home who want to know this overlooked history. MONTGOMERY: Groups that have come, people with a purpose. They want to be educated. And the majority of the groups are white groups or mixed groups. People are hungry for the actual story. BURNETT: The story, of course, is not over. The country continues to search for that coherent, positive alternative, as Taylor Branch puts it, that will bring America out of its maelstrom.

            "article_content": "Following the recent success of Ukrainian forces, NPR's Michel Martin asks retired U.S. Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman about what he thinks will happen next in Russia's war against Ukraine.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: After months of discouraging headlines about Russian advances and atrocities, in recent weeks, a turning point. Ukrainian forces successfully pushed back Russian troops from territory they had taken months ago, with some reportedly even fleeing on bikes and in ransacked civilian clothes. We wanted to know what has contributed to this turn of events and, to the degree possible, what could come next. So we called someone with a deep background in the region and deep knowledge of the capabilities on both sides. That's retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman. He served as the director for European affairs at the National Security Council in the Trump administration until he testified against former President Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine into investigating his political rivals. Mr. Vindman is now a fellow with a number of foreign policy and civic groups, and he is with us now. Welcome back to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. Thank you so much for talking with us once again. ALEXANDER VINDMAN: Thanks for having me on, Michel. I'm looking forward to it as always. MARTIN: So Ukraine's successes, as I understand it, have been aided by increased aid from the United States, including long-range artillery weapons and better sharing of intelligence. What else do you think the U.S. and NATO can do or should be doing to help ensure more successful efforts in the future? VINDMAN: So first, I think we should all, as Americans, be proud of the fact that we were able to help Ukraine in achieving this liberation of its territory. The reason that the Ukrainians, in part, were able to realize some of these objectives in a rapid manner is because we provided them with these very, very capable rockets, these now well-known HIMARS rockets that are effective to about 80 kilometers, 50 miles. The Ukrainians were extremely successful at targeting Russia's ammunitions depots to the point where Russia started to run out of artillery for their cannons, and Ukraine was able to break through without suffering significant military losses in the attack. MARTIN: What do you make of the concerns that if Ukrainians have access to longer-range missiles, they could shoot further into Russia and essentially spark World War III? I mean... VINDMAN: Yeah. MARTIN: ...Ukrainian officials have pledged in writing not to do so, but do you think there's any validity to those concerns? VINDMAN: I think it's illogical. Before you get to a nuclear war, you get to a conventional war. Before you get to conventional war, you have to have some prospect of success. Russia is not going to engage in the folly of fighting NATO when it is having disastrous campaign against Ukraine. That's why when I hear, you know, Jake Sullivan talk about providing these long-range rockets to Ukraine being the cause for World War III when he's addressing a group of policymakers and thinkers in Aspen just recently, it's shocking. It doesn't make any sense to me. MARTIN: Well, you've written about this, and then, of course, you've gotten - there's been an interesting back-and-forth about this. And you say that, look; if Ukraine - this is a piece you recently wrote for \"Foreign Affairs.\" You said, if Ukrainian democracy is going to prevail, U.S. foreign policymakers must finally prioritize dealing with Ukraine as it is rather than Russia as they would like it to be. Your argument being that the U.S. is still prioritizing Russia and allaying their sensitivities to the detriment of taking a more forceful stance to support a country that's trying to be a democracy. And, you know, obviously, there are those who disagree with that. They say, you know, Russia remains a nuclear power. There is no choice but to be concerned about allaying their sensitivities. Do you still feel, after all this time, that the U.S. is prioritizing Russia over Ukraine? VINDMAN: They're prioritizing the notion of what they would like our relationship to be. They want a post-war Russia that we could have a cooperative relationship with over the reality that we are locked in a cold war. Of course, we want to, you know, mitigate the risks of a broader confrontation, but we don't do that by metering in aid to Ukraine and protracting a war over the course of months, maybe years. We do that by helping Ukraine be victorious on the battlefield and foreclosing Russia's ability to conduct a long war. We should also watch and learn from the signals that Putin is sending. He has been clear. If he is blocked in his military aspirations, he will take a step back and look at other potential solutions. Around Kyiv, he didn't decide to use nuclear weapons or escalate against the West that was providing weapons at the time. He decided to take a more limited objective to Ukraine. He is somebody that is been around for a long time. His objective is to live to fight another day, and it's not a recipe for escalation. It's a recipe for a shorter war, less risky war for the United States, a war that doesn't result in spillover beyond what we are already seeing, this hybrid war between the U.S. and Russia, into a hot war. MARTIN: And what about for Putin? I mean, you've said it several times that the Russian president isn't suicidal. Forgive me. This is an area of speculation. But I'm wondering what you see as the fate of the Russian president or how this scenario ends for him? VINDMAN: Within weeks of the beginning of this war, I was comfortable saying that this was the beginning of the end of Putin. I put a mark on the wall, somewhat speculative, that the 2024 election in Russia, this would be an opportunity for him to step aside, still pull all the strings, but put a different face on Russian leadership. But there are other factors that have now started to come into play. I think we are starting to see increasing unrest inside Russia. There is a nationalist tide rising against Putin. Putin has emboldened, enabled, nurtured nationalism inside Russia as part of the conservative Russian identity. I think that might turn around to bite him in the end because this is a wing of the Russian power structure that is saying Russia should somehow do more. I mean, there is no silver bullet here. There's not much more that Russia can do. So I think this internal pressure is going to continue to build. And the release valve for Putin for a long time was this notion that he could just wait out the West. The West was weak; the West is inherently fractured, and he just needed to wait for those divides to materialize. That's looking increasingly unlikely. So he doesn't have a lot of really good options. MARTIN: Alexander Vindman is a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel. He served as director for Eastern Europe and Russia on the National Security Council during the Trump administration. Alexander Vindman, thanks so much for joining us and sharing this expertise with us once again. VINDMAN: Thank you, Michel. I'm glad to be on with you again.

            "article_content": "Appointed by President Clinton in 1997, Albright advocated for the expansion of NATO into the former Soviet bloc countries of Eastern Europe. She died March 23. Originally broadcast in 2003 and 2018.  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Today we remember Madeleine Albright, who became the first woman to serve as secretary of state. She died of cancer Wednesday at the age of 84. She was appointed secretary of state by President Clinton in 1997 in his second term. In his first term, she became the ambassador to the U.N. Among the things she's remembered for is advocating the expansion of NATO into the former Soviet bloc countries of Eastern Europe. Some of the other issues and crises she contended with during the Clinton years include the war in the Balkans, the genocide in Rwanda, the terrorist bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa, the suspension of weapons inspections in Iraq, Middle East peace talks and the start of the second intifada and the impeachment trial of President Clinton. A little later, we'll hear the interview I recorded with her in 2018 during the Trump presidency after the publication of her book, \"Fascism,\" in which she wrote about the growing threat of fascism in Eastern Europe and sounded the alarm about the growing threat of authoritarianism in the U.S. We'll start with our 2003 interview recorded after the publication of her memoir, \"Madam Secretary.\" She was born in Czechoslovakia, where her father was a diplomat. During World War II, the family fled to England just before Germany invaded Czechoslovakia. After the war, they returned to their country only to flee again, this time in 1948, as the Communists were taking over. We started the interview by talking about being the first woman to serve as secretary of state. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) GROSS: You write in your memoir, (reading) I am often asked whether I was condescended to by men as I traveled around the world to Arab countries and other places with highly traditional cultures. I replied, no, because when I arrived somewhere, it was in a large plane with the US of A emblazoned on the side. Foreign officials respect that. I had more problems with some of the men in my own government. What are some of the problems you had with some of the men in your own government? MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Well, I think that, especially when I started at the United Nations - and I was a member of what is called - the so-called principals committee, which is a small group that includes the national security adviser, the secretary of state, the secretary of defense, the chairman of the joint chiefs and the director of the CIA and the ambassador to the U.N. in our case because every administration can change the grouping of the principals. So I was a part of this group. And I had very strong opinions, especially about Bosnia. And I really was condescended to by the national security adviser who had - who has been a very good friend of mine and kind of made me feel as if my opinions were overly strong, or to use a word that's often used against women, emotional, mainly because I felt very strongly about it. Also, the thing that I found, and this is the hardest part, is that even men that are very good friends and very nice people and have wives and daughters don't often understand that some way - something that they say or the dismissiveness of their tone makes you feel that your views are not welcome. And I think for the most part, many of them don't know they're doing it. It just gets pretty irritating. GROSS: Tell me if you feel like you ever had to deal with this in your career as somebody who is very high-powered and having to fly around the world talking with heads of state. A lot of women, particularly women who are, like, in their 40s and over feel like they were brought up to be - socialized to be liked, to please and, you know, to accommodate. And sure, there's a certain amount of pleasing an accommodation that's a part of diplomacy, but there's also the necessity of, you know, of being tough, of saying no, of holding your ground no matter what. Do you feel like in your career you ever had to overcome that impulse to accommodate, to be nice, to be liked? ALBRIGHT: Oh, my goodness. Yes. I can't tell you how many times. First of all, I do think that most women want to be liked. And they don't want to have face-to-face personal arguments. It was even larger in my case, because as I write in the first part of my book, having come to the United States as a foreigner and having constantly been moving around, I really wanted to be part of a group. And I did want to be liked. I still want to be liked. So I think that it's something that's very much a part of me and a part of women. Now, the other thing that I learned, and I learned it very quickly when I got to the United Nations, is that you can't do the kind of normal women thing, which is to wait a while to get a sense of what a meeting is like, you know, kind of get the tenor of the room, who says what. And I was - went to my first meeting of the security council and kind of thought I'd take my time. And all of a sudden it dawned on me; I couldn't take my time. I was the United States. If I didn't speak, then the United States would not - our views would not be heard. And so I got over that very quickly. The part that I think is very hard, and I think I probably speak for other women in this, is men are capable of having strong policy disagreements or arguments about a subject and then walk out of a room and go and play golf or have a drink or something. And I think women do take it more personally. And I don't think we like to have face-to-face confrontations. But I sure learned that it was essential to state my views very clearly and not care whether I was liked or not. And it took me a while to learn it. But I think others will testify to the fact that I did learn it. GROSS: What is it like to fly to a country like Saudi Arabia to practice diplomacy knowing that in that country women have to be shrouded? Women can't drive. And granted, they understand you're a woman from a different culture. But you're still a woman. ALBRIGHT: Well, first of all, you really do think about the fact that you're going into this kind of a country where sisters have a very different lifestyle. And I find it appalling. Nevertheless, I had to carry on my duties as secretary of state. And I did not wear any covering on my head when I spoke to the ministers or the king or the crown prince. So I did not take any particular action of that kind. And in my first meeting with what's known as the Gulf Cooperation Council - those are the ministers from all the Gulf States - we had a very serious conversation, and at the end of it I said to them, you may notice that I am not clothed exactly the way my predecessors were. And I thank you very much for your great courtesy and kindness. And next time we'll talk about women's rights. And they were a little surprised. On the other hand, one of the foreign ministers said, you know, I think we, in fact, might have a foreign minister as a woman in the period of the length of our history - 'cause they're relatively new countries - that's shorter than it took the United States to have a woman secretary of state. That same foreign minister then invited me to his home and introduced me to his daughters who had American educations and I think were probably going to end up having quite a different life from some of the other people. But it's - there's no question that it's a touchy issue and that it creates a certain level of difficulty, but not when you are representing the United States. I must say that I had the greatest respect from those leaders, especially - well, all of them. But I had a very good relationship with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Abdullah. GROSS: Your first position in the Clinton administration was as U.N. ambassador. Your father was a diplomat. Your father had served as U.N. ambassador from Czechoslovakia. How do you think that, you know, being from Czechoslovakia influenced your feelings about Bosnia and Kosovo and your stand that there should be military intervention? ALBRIGHT: Well, first of all, my - everybody has their baggage. And mine clearly was Munich, an agreement made in September 1938 by the so-called Western powers, excluding the United States, to give away a piece of Czechoslovakia to Hitler - in other words, to appease aggression. And that was kind of a signal moment in the history of Czechoslovakia and something that my parents talked about a lot, that if you don't stand up to an aggressor, that, in fact, the aggressor will only take more. The other parts that affected my life was that I clearly understood the horrors of not standing up to Hitler in other ways with the Holocaust and understanding that you could not permit ethnic cleansing to go unanswered. During the Second World War, a lot of people legitimately could say that they had no idea what was being done in terms of ethnic cleansing. We did know what was going on in Bosnia because of obviously a whole revolution in information. I also knew a lot about Yugoslavia from the fact that my father had been ambassador there. And while I had only been of the ages from 8 to 11, I grew up learning about the problems of Yugoslavia. So those were all the reasons why I thought it was important to stand up to Milosevic. GROSS: Shortly after becoming secretary of state, The Washington Post reporter Michael Dobbs came to you with information that your family was actually Jewish, not Catholic, and that three of your grandparents were victims of the Holocaust as well as at least one of your cousins. You write about this a little bit in your book and about how people couldn't believe you didn't know and that it made it - they made it seem like you had covered it up. You say, I was made to feel as if I were a liar and that - my father was portrayed as a heartless fraud. You never knew about it till Michael Dobbs told you? ALBRIGHT: Well, I - no, I didn't. I mean, what happened was that - I think I explained in the first part of the book that my parents talked a great deal about their lives in pre-World War II Czechoslovakia and about generally history and that when we returned after the war - I was 8 years old - and that my grandparents were not alive. And I was told that they died of old age. And I had no - this is a very tragic part of everything I have to say. I mean, I didn't know any grandparents, so they never were real people for me. So I didn't kind of absorb that at all. But I grew up as a practicing Catholic, actually a pretty good one. And I - there were no holes in the story of my life. And - but what happened - when I started being in the news, I would get letters from people saying that they knew something about my family. There were hints of things, but it didn't all come together until actually - in December 1996 as I was being named to be secretary of state, I got a letter that seemed to have all the facts together. And so when I was being vetted by the White House lawyers, I told them that I had reason to suspect that my family was of Jewish background, and they basically found that very uninteresting. I thought it was fascinating, and I really wanted to look into it more. And then Michael Dobbs called me during the transition period and said he was going to do a profile of me. And I gave him a bunch of addresses of people in Yugoslavia and in Czechoslovakia. And then he's the one who came up with the fact that three of my grandparents had died in concentration camps, which is quite different from finding out that you're of Jewish background. And it was the horror of finding out about the horrible death of my grandparents that truly was the great tragedy. And in addition to the divorce chapter, this was the hardest chapter to write. And I tried to really lay it out and try to explain why it was so difficult and how hurtful it was to have my father, whom I adored, be accused of trying to hide the facts when, from everything that I knew about my parents, all they ever did was try to figure out ways to protect us. GROSS: What do you think their motivation was? Not only in - I mean, I guess the motivation for changing their religion is fairly obvious, to survive during the Nazi era. But what do you think their motivation was to never tell you? ALBRIGHT: Well, again, it's hard to try to figure out motivation, but I think the following thing, again - that you have to put yourself back into the period. They had gone through having to leave their country twice. They came to the United States in 1948, '49, and it - and then in the '50s when we were getting our citizenship. And I think they just thought that it was safer not to tell. By the way, I have the highest respect for Harry Truman and think he's one of the great American presidents. But if you read what has recently been revealed about what he said about Jews, then I think one can understand why my parents, coming to a new country from a country where Jews have been exterminated, might have thought that it was wiser not to tell us. Why they didn't tell me later, I don't know the answer. GROSS: If you don't mind my asking, I'm wondering if you practice any religion now. Now, you grew up Roman Catholic. At your husband's request, when you got married, you joined the Episcopal Church and then found out later in life that your family is really of Jewish descent. So where are you now (laughter) in terms of faith? ALBRIGHT: Well, I have written actually that it's confusing. I mean, it's a little hard to be 66 years old and be unclear about something like this. I was raised a Christian, and I am a - I don't see myself not being a Christian. I find it very difficult to assimilate all of it. And I don't know. I mean, I go to an Episcopalian church when I go, but many of my beliefs are very Catholic because I grew up a Catholic. And I respect Judaism, but I don't see myself practicing it. So it - you know, I have to honestly admit that it's sad in many ways to be this old and to be unclear about something that is so basic. GROSS: We're listening to the interview I recorded in 2003 with former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. She died Wednesday at the age of 84. A little later, we'll hear the interview we recorded in 2018 during the Trump presidency after the publication of her book, \"Fascism,\" in which she warned about the growing authoritarianism in parts of Eastern Europe and sounded the alarm about the threat of authoritarianism in the U.S. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF BRAD MEHLDAU TRIO'S \"BEATRICE\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the 2003 interview I recorded with Madeleine Albright, the first woman to serve as secretary of state. President Clinton appointed her in his second term after she served in his first term as U.N. ambassador. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) GROSS: Now, you married Joe Albright, who was from a very wealthy family, the family that owned the newspaper Newsday. Did you suddenly find yourself in a much more privileged world than the world you had traveled in? I know your father had been a diplomat, probably knew a lot of very important and powerful people. But still, was this a different world for you? ALBRIGHT: Well, it was a completely different world. But the truth is that when my father had been ambassador, you know, we lived in an embassy and had a chauffeur and a maid and a cook and a butler and various other accoutrements of a privileged life. But then when we came to the United States, we were, as was known at the time, displaced persons and arrived in Denver with nothing beyond this green Ford coupe that my parents had bought. And so people lent us furniture, and we bought some junky furniture and lived in university rental housing. So life was quite different, physically, never different intellectually or emotionally because my parents were very clear that our life would go on in a respected way. But when I did marry into Joe's family, it was quite different. It is - it's a family that had many houses and servants and a lot of privileges. GROSS: You write in your book that your husband divorced you in 1983. He told you that he'd fallen in love with a woman who was a reporter, who was considerably younger and beautiful. And you say that you hope that he was just being noble and brave because he was really diagnosed with a brain tumor (laughter) and was just trying to spare his family the pain of watching him suffer. Well, unfortunately or fortunately, whatever, that wasn't the case (laughter), and he was just leaving you for another woman. You say that when he did leave you, it left you with no confidence in your looks. Did you get over that? And as a woman who spent her life in the limelight, in front of cameras, but not in a beauty pageant, in diplomatic positions, in secretary of state - you know, in the position of secretary of state, did looks matter to you? How important was that? ALBRIGHT: Well, you know, all I have to do is look in the mirror to know I'm no raving beauty, but it does help if you feel good about yourself. And so I think that if you go around moping or, you know, you decide one day you're never going to wear makeup, it doesn't work. I do think that you have to remember that you are representing your country. And it's very interesting. I actually don't think I wrote this in the book, but before I went up to the U.N., I met with Jeane Kirkpatrick, one of my predecessors and obviously also a woman and a professor. And Jeane Kirkpatrick, we probably disagree a lot on policy, but our lives are not dissimilar because we both taught at Georgetown. And what she did was ask me to come in and talk to her - or we had lunch. And she said - she was very funny. She said, Madeleine, get rid of the professor clothes, and buy yourself some good clothes because you really do need to look good for this job. So Jeane and I agree on those particular issues. And it does matter how you look. GROSS: It matters why? ALBRIGHT: Because I think not so much, I mean, if you're beautiful or not, but if you look confident and you look put together, I think it does play a role in how you present your case. And I tell one story in the book where we had had all-night negotiations on a resolution to do with Haiti, and I had done real retail diplomacy, gone around and talked to every one of the Security Council members. And I looked exhausted, and, you know, I'd rumpled my hair, and all the makeup was off of my face. But I - we were going to have time between what I was doing and the final vote. So I went back to my apartment, started all over, put on a blue linen dress that I thought I looked good in, came back, looked a lot better than all my colleagues, who were unshaven, and I think it looked as though I had confidence. We won the vote. I don't think because of my blue dress, but I think it does help to look good. GROSS: My interview with Madeleine Albright was recorded in 2003. She died Wednesday at the age of 84. After a break, we'll hear the interview we recorded in 2018 during the Trump presidency, after the publication of her book, \"Fascism,\" in which she warned about the growing threat of authoritarianism in parts of Eastern Europe and the threat to democracy in the U.S. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF JULIAN LAGE'S \"ROGER THE DODGER\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Today we're remembering Madeleine Albright, who became America's first woman to serve as secretary of state. She was appointed by President Clinton during his second term and served as U.S. ambassador during his first term. Albright died of cancer Wednesday. She was 84. The second interview we recorded was in 2018 during the Trump presidency. She had just published her bestselling book, \"Fascism,\" in which she wrote (reading) we should be awake to the assault on democratic values that has gathered strength in many countries abroad and is dividing America at home. The book examined how fascism took hold in Hitler's Germany and Mussolini's Italy. Then she warned about how authoritarianism was taking hold again in several Eastern European countries and was already well in place in Russia and North Korea. One chapter was devoted to Trump and the alarming threat of authoritarianism in the U.S. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) GROSS: Madeleine Albright, welcome to FRESH AIR. This book is a very personal one in a lot of ways because you fled fascism twice. Your family is from Czechoslovakia, where you were born. Your father was a diplomat. The family fled fascism when you were a child, first, from Hitler. You moved to England. And then after World War II, you returned to Czechoslovakia but fled again when the Communists were taking over and came to America. What is the warning you want to send to Americans about what is happening here? ALBRIGHT: Well, first of all, I'm delighted to be with you. But let me say, the reason that I wrote the book and the warning is, as you've pointed out, it's something that I saw or have certainly heard about from my parents. And part of the reason for writing it is to say that, in fact, this can happen in countries that have democratic systems, that have a population that's interested in what is going on, that is supportive, because so many of the things that have happened and happened in Czechoslovakia were steps that came as a result of ethnic issues with the German minority, but mostly steps that seemed not so terrible that there couldn't be a deal made. And so that's what's so worrisome, is that these - fascism can come in a way that it is one step at a time and in many ways then goes unnoticed until it's too late. GROSS: One step at a time within the system. ALBRIGHT: Within the system, and partially because it is a way of undermining democracy and the democratic institutions that are the basis of democracy or criticizing the press or thinking that there are those that are enemies of the people and are the cause of distress or bad economic situation. And it kind of works on the fear factor rather than the hope factor. GROSS: And with your father, for instance - he was a diplomat. He was close to the president of Czechoslovakia. And so when your father sensed that the Communists were taking over, the president of Czechoslovakia was saying, no, it's going to be fine. Don't worry about it. And your father left in spite of those reassurances. You know, the whole family left in spite of those reassurances. And you were lucky that you did. You write your father would have been put in prison had the family stayed in Czechoslovakia - so another example of how when fascism or authoritarianism or Communism is coming, not everybody sees it. ALBRIGHT: And that's absolutely true, because part of it, both with the fascism and with the Communism - there really was not enough pushback from the people and, to some extent, the authorities there at the time. Or there's an outside power that doesn't support. So, for instance, what happened when the fascists took over was the period that is known as appeasement that, in fact, was carried out by friends and allies, like the British, who gave in to what this group that was organized to help Hitler in what is known as Sudetenland, the small part of Czechoslovakia that was occupied by a German minority. And people thought, well, if we give in on this, nothing else will happen. And that's - is exactly what did happen. One step led to another. And if you are trying to feed the beast and the beast is a fascist, then it makes it very hard to push back. GROSS: Your book starts with a quote from Primo Levi. Every age has its own fascism. What are you trying to say by using that quote? Are you saying, don't expect fascism to look like it - exactly like it did with Hitler or Mussolini or Stalin? ALBRIGHT: Well, that's exactly - because one of the reasons that I wrote the book was to show the different ways that fascism has penetrated a lot of our societies now. And each one is a little bit different. And certainly, eras are different. And so one has to look at what some of the signs are but not expect a total replication that everything is exactly the same because - both the situations in the country, the international situation, what is happening with technology, how people see their lives. So it's very hard. And frankly, Terry, the hardest part in the book was really coming up with exact definitions because it's always slightly different. GROSS: Let's talk about what's happening in the United States. I want to read a passage that you write in your book, \"Fascism: A Warning,\" a passage about President Trump. You write, (reading) we've never had a president, at least in the modern era, whose statements and actions are so at odds with democratic ideals. Trump has spoken harshly about the institutions and principles that make up the foundation of open government. In the process, he has systematically degraded political discourse in the U.S., shown an astonishing disregard for facts, libeled his predecessor, threatened to lock up political rivals, bullied members of his own administration, referred to mainstream journalists as enemies of the American people, spread falsehoods about the integrity of the U.S. electoral process, touted mindlessly nationalistic economic and trade policies and nurtured a paranoid bigotry toward the followers of one of the world's foremost religions. Do you think that President Trump has the instincts of an authoritarian leader? ALBRIGHT: I think that he is the most antidemocratic president that we have had in modern history and that his instincts are really in that direction. And I think that that's what's worrisome. And the passage that you read really does show that what he's trying to do is undermine the press - and has disdain for the judiciary and the electoral process and minorities. And I think that his instincts are not ones that are democratic. And he is interested basically in, I think, exacerbating those divisions that I talked about. And so I am very concerned. And basically, this is - you know, I've written the book because I have picked up that phrase, see something, say something. And I am seeing some things that are the kinds of things that we've seen in other countries. And so I'm saying not only should we say something, but we have to do something about it. GROSS: President Trump, when he was campaigning, when he talked about NATO, he'd talk about how America was, like, spending too much and European countries are spending too little when it came to dues. And he seemed to see NATO as being about, like, some kind of business arrangement where America was being played. We were being taken advantage of because we were paying more. You were secretary of state when NATO opened its doors to Eastern European countries, in Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary. They entered NATO in 1999 when you were secretary of state. So NATO was very important during your tenure in in that position. I mean, the shape of NATO changed. And now we've seen Brexit, and we've seen President Trump having this kind of changeable, ambivalent position about NATO. How does that feel personally? Because you were so - like, NATO was such an important part of your professional life as secretary of state. ALBRIGHT: Well, I see it as the most unbelievable step backwards because I do believe that the United States is stronger when we have friends and allies to deal with the various issues, whether they are in-area, as we say, members of NATO itself or out-of-area, whether it's in the Balkans or Afghanistan, that the Europeans and NATO are really part of this incredible alliance that we've had. And I always say, as a European who has spent her life in the United States, I see the Euro-Atlantic alliance as one of the most important bulwarks of our society. So seeing this go on, I find appalling. And what is the issue, again, it's this lack of understanding of what this alliance is about. It is not somebody coming to rent hotel rooms to see if they can get the best price or - it's not transactional. It is something that is basic to our system. And so I think one of the parts, though, Terry, is that he's gone back on certain things, so that he generally has now said that he is supportive of NATO. So one of the parts that's a little bit confusing, what is he really for? What is he against? Is it one of those things where the last person that speaks to him has all the influence? But I do think that what is going on with Europe and our relationships with Europe are part of the very - you know, are really a big part of the problem in terms of a lack of understanding about America's role. And then one other part I think that is really part of this story is that what Trump is doing is making America seem like a victim. Everything is somebody else's fault. Countries are taking advantage of us. The Mexicans are sending drug dealers. Countries are not paying their dues. The trading system is unfair. And by making Americans seem like victims all the time, it then is able to again make the divisions stronger in terms of who's with us, who's not with us and is totally anti-American foreign policy. And so I think it's very, very worrisome in terms of this victimhood. I don't see America as a victim. I see America as the most powerful country in the world that has a role to play standing up for democratic ideals and human rights across the board. GROSS: We're listening to the 2018 interview I recorded with former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. She died Wednesday at the age of 84. We'll hear more of the interview after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF BILL FRISELL'S \"LISTEN\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. We're remembering Madeleine Albright, the first woman to serve as secretary of state. She died Wednesday at age 84. Let's get back to the interview we recorded in 2018 after the publication of her book, \"Fascism,\" in which she warned about authoritarianism in several Eastern European countries and sounded the alarm about the assault on American democracy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) GROSS: Let's talk about Russia. We have evidence now that Russia interfered in the presidential election. We don't know what their plans are for the midterms. If you were secretary of state, would you see a role for yourself now in dealing with future Russian interference in our democracy? ALBRIGHT: Well, from everything that I have read, I think that it is a dereliction of duty not to see what the Russians have been doing and that this really requires a whole of government approach to it, where the president directs the various parts of the government to do what they have to do to figure out what the Russians are up to and how to prevent them from doing more during the midterm election and all the time, frankly. And then also - and as secretary of state, the other part that would be important is to point out what the Russians are doing in other countries. We know, for instance, what has been happening in Europe. Then they have, in fact, undertaken a lot of propaganda and false information throughout Europe. There are even those who think that they were involved in the Brexit vote. So as the secretary of state, what you try to do is to look at what are the effects of Russia's behavior among our friends and allies? Who needs help? How do we share intelligence? And what do we do to make sure that our democracies are not undermined? And that's the role of the secretary of state. GROSS: You met with Vladimir Putin when you were secretary of state. What was his position at the time? ALBRIGHT: Well, it was interesting. The first time I met him was when he was still kind of acting president in an APEC meeting that took place in New Zealand. And he was in a a stage of his life where he seemed to want to be very ingratiating to everybody and wanted to kind of pretend - or was, in fact, kind of a small figure. Then, when I went back to prepare for the summit that President Clinton had in the summer of 2000 - and I have to say, I was very impressed with how smart Putin was. And when he met with President Clinton, he - Putin - was able to talk without notes, as President Clinton was, and also took notes and really was very smart. I think that he is a smart man. He has played a weak hand very well. And he is a former KGB officer. And we can never forget that. GROSS: You wrote down your impressions of him after your first meeting. And you wrote, Putin is small and pale, so cold as to be almost reptilian. Putin is embarrassed by what happened to his country and determined to restore its greatness. That kind of holds up. ALBRIGHT: Well, it does. And part of it, I have to say, is that in '91, when I - before I went into the government, I did this survey of all of Europe after the end of the Cold War. And we did a lot of questionnaires, but also focus groups. And I will never forget a focus group outside of Moscow where this man stands up and says, I'm so embarrassed; we used to be a superpower, and now we're Bangladesh with missiles. And so what Putin has done is identify with that kind of loss of national pride that the Russians have had, and he has restored it from - in their eyes. And so he is popular, and it has something in terms of restoring Russia's position. And as I say, he has played a weak hand very well. GROSS: So an interesting anecdote in your book - and this takes place in 2003, when you were speaking in Turkey. And, you know, as we've been saying, like, identity is such a big issue in this era of, like, nationalism and anti-immigration feelings. So you're in Turkey. You're giving a speech. And then during the Q&A, you're asked your opinion of whether women should wear headscarves. And there's women with headscarves in the audience and women without them. And you say, well, that's easy; it should be a woman's personal choice. And you say that everybody in the room hated you after that. (Laughter) That was, like, an incredibly unpopular response. What's the moral of that story? ALBRIGHT: Well, I think the moral is that we cannot think that everybody wants to be like American women. I have - again, to go back on this survey that I did in the '90s, a lot of women that had lived under communism had basically been liberated to work twice as hard. So one of the questions that we asked in that was, do you want to have a marriage where you stay at home and take care of the children, or do you want to have a job? And I can't remember the exact numbers, but most of the women wanted to be at home with their children. And so I think we do have to be careful not to think that everybody wants to be like us. And so I believe that we need to be helpful where we can, where women in countries want to have support from outsiders, and be supportive of women running for office, and try to figure out how to end domestic violence and a variety of different things. But the issue there - and it really did surprise me, I have to say - was that I gave a typically American answer. I mean, I always think that for women, the best word for us is choice. We need to be able to choose what we do with our bodies, and our lives and how we generally operate. And I was surprised that I had given a typical American answer that didn't suit anybody. And it continues to trouble me because I think we have to be careful not to mirror image. On the other hand, we need to be helpful. GROSS: Well, Madeleine Albright, it's been a pleasure to talk with you. Thank you so much. ALBRIGHT: Thank you. GROSS: My interview with former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was recorded in 2018 after the publication of her book, \"Fascism.\" She died Wednesday at the age of 84. I'm Terry Gross.

The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol is calling it \"the Big Rip Off.\" It says the Trump campaign took $250 million in donations from supporters that it said would go to an election defense fund to pay for legal fees to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. But the fund was never actually created, Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., one of the committee members, said Monday in the panel's second public hearing. Instead, the money went to the Save America political action committee, she said, and the money went from there to several pro-Trump organizations which are headed by former officials close to Donald Trump's inner circle. \"Not only was there the Big Lie,\" Lofgren said, referring to Trump's false allegations of election fraud, \"there was the Big Rip-Off.\" Asked about the committee's allegations, Trump spokesperson Liz Harrington responded in a statement, \"The Unselect Committee continues to spread baseless lies against President Trump. No one is more committed to fixing our elections than he is, and our political spending is totally synchronized with that goal.\" The committee can't prosecute Trump or any of his involved allies for anything it is investigating, however it could recommend the Department of Justice pursue criminal charges. The question, though, is whether there is enough evidence to build a case that Trump and his associates did in fact break any laws. \"This is a difficult one,\" said Ken Gross, former associate general counsel of the Federal Election Commission. \"As distasteful as it is to raise money for a purpose other than what you're going to use it for, in the political arena, there's a good bit of latitude given to campaigns because oftentimes, money is used for some other purpose.\" He says an example would be a campaign asking for donations and saying it would go to TV ads but instead using them for a different effort within the campaign \u2014 things like that happen all the time. And unless there's evidence that shows the funds were converted for personal use and not within the political arena, Gross said it would be hard for a prosecutor to take on the case. \"Whether it would be actionable legally, I'm not quite ready to go there unless we have some further aggravating facts such as a conversion to personal use,\" Gross said. \"If [the funding from donors] stays in the political arena, even though it wasn't used for the political purpose that it was raised for, I think that's a tough case for a prosecutor to get real interested in,\" he said. Here's where it gets further complicated. Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, a professor of election law at Stetson University, told NPR that campaign finance law doesn't necessarily apply here. In this case, Trump said he was using money from donors for his legal defense fund. And it happened after the election was over. \"Legal defense funds fall outside of normal campaign finance. They are not considered either contributions or expenditures under the campaign finance law,\" Torres-Spelliscy said. \"You can raise money for legal defense funds that are not subject to classic campaign finance limits.\" For example, there are limits set by the FEC that dictate how much an individual donor can give to a campaign. But those limits don't apply to legal defense funds. But she added that that does not mean that no law applies. In this case, she believes the Jan. 6 committee is laying the groundwork for a case of wire fraud. \"With wire fraud, you use some of our telecommunications structure, like the internet, and you defraud a victim of their money. And if the Justice Department agrees, then they may well have a case against the former president and some of his associates for defrauding lots and lots of different donors,\" Torres-Spelliscy said. What information would prosecutors need to make a case? In short, more evidence. \"You would need some facts as to the scheming, if you will, behind this fundraising effort,\" Gross said. \"Intent is going to come into play ... prosecutors are going to need some aggravating factors before they pursue it.\" In other words, they would need proof that Trump knew the money was not going to be used to fight his legal battles in attempting to overturn the election. More on that topic might be coming from the House committee in the coming weeks as members spell out more of their case. Still, Gross says it would be a tough case to take on. But both Torres-Spelliscy and Gross pointed to a different example of when a Trump associate was tied up with accusations of misusing donated funds, though this one wasn't tied to an official campaign for office. In 2020, prosecutors charged Steve Bannon, Trump's former political adviser, with wire fraud after he raised $25 million in a campaign to build a wall on the southern border \u2014 but allegedly took millions of dollars of those donations to line his own pockets. \"You gin them up with something they care about, whether it's building a wall at the southern border or fighting phantom election fraud, and you get all this money from donors ... some of whom do not have this money to spare,\" Torres-Spelliscy said.",

After spending the afternoon anxiously watching the front door for the petitions she knew were coming, going over the events that had brought national scrutiny to the question of voter access in her rural east Georgia county, Bolton gave a defiant stare as she took the thick stack of papers into her tiny office, ending the awkward handoff. Back outside, gazing at a bank of cameras and reporters, Denise Freeman, a Lincoln County resident rallying opposition to the plan, let out a deep sigh. \"It is unconscionable that we would even have anyone to think about closing precincts in 2022,\" said Freeman, a Black pastor and former school board member. \"It takes us back to an era that we thought that we would never have to go back to.\" Hours before the petitions arrived at the door, Bolton had let out her own sigh as she considered how she had been portrayed in recent weeks. \"I would never do anything to disenfranchise anybody from voting,\" Bolton, who is Black, said. \"People can tell you I will go over and beyond. I'll do whatever is needed.\" This story comes from a partnership between Georgia Public Broadcasting and The Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit news organization that investigates inequality. The national spotlight in recent weeks has fallen, improbably, on Lincoln County, a \"sportsman's paradise\" of about 7,700 people that lies along the South Carolina border. Local election officials have proposed consolidating all seven polling places into the county's recreation complex, a single larger centralized site. The county voted 68% for former President Donald Trump last year, and less than one-third of the population is Black. Georgia is the epicenter of the voting rights fight, so much so that President Biden chose it as the site of a major speech on voting rights this month. In the aftermath of the 2020 election, Republicans in the state approved a massive overhaul of election laws that added new restrictions on absentee voting and changed rules in the wake of false claims of fraud pushed by Trump, one of the most high-profile examples of a series of GOP-backed restrictive state voting laws passed around the country. Into this charged atmosphere came the Lincoln County plan. Some voting advocates described it as an example of voter suppression. But local election officials say they proposed consolidation because the county doesn't have enough resources for the current configuration and more voters are casting absentee and early ballots. They promised to provide transportation to voters who need it and said the change would let them offer Election Day voters a better site and access to more voting machines. A Center for Public Integrity/Georgia Public Broadcasting analysis of voter rolls, polling place locations and other election data showed no more than a few hundred voters cast ballots at each polling place in the past three general elections. According to that same analysis: The data did not include race information for 386 voters. Precise locations for 122 voters were not available. Loading... As jurisdictions around the country wrestle with how to best allocate voting resources against a backdrop of changing election laws and voter preferences, the intense concerns over Lincoln County's plans suggest many election administration decisions will be viewed through a lens of growing mistrust. \"People just aren't taking it for granted that, you know, it's going to be done in a fair manner anymore,\" said Gowri Ramachandran, senior counsel for the democracy program at the nonprofit Brennan Center for Justice. The backlash to the proposal for a single site in Lincoln County shows it probably isn't the plan that best serves voters, said Rachel Orey, senior policy analyst for the elections project at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank. Orey said that based on the BPC's calculations, Lincoln County would ideally have at least three election sites, and she recommends that every county have at least two. Since a 2013 Supreme Court decision eliminating key provisions of the Voting Rights Act, advocates have tracked the number of polling places in counties that previously had to seek permission for voting changes from the federal government. They warn of shrinking numbers of polling places and increasing distances voters must cover to cast ballots. Georgia has closed more than 10% of its polls since 2013, especially in rural Georgia. Meanwhile, the state's voter rolls have grown by more than one million people \u2014 primarily around metro Atlanta. The state has a long history of racist voting laws that target Black voters, and in recent elections, nonwhite voters have been more likely to face long lines while trying to cast ballots. All that means the question of how to allocate resources to serve Lincoln County's nearly 6,100 registered voters is resonating far beyond its borders. The debate has become a microcosm of the increasingly contentious and bitter national brawl over access to the ballot. The rural Lincoln County Board of Elections has postponed a vote to consolidate its seven polling places into a single site after voting rights groups delivered a petition to temporarily halt the plan, calling it voter suppression. Local elections officials say they lack appropriate resources to keep every poll available.\n                \n                    \n                    Stephen Fowler/Georgia Public Broadcasting\n                    \n                \nhide caption The rural Lincoln County Board of Elections has postponed a vote to consolidate its seven polling places into a single site after voting rights groups delivered a petition to temporarily halt the plan, calling it voter suppression. Local elections officials say they lack appropriate resources to keep every poll available. Opponents of the Lincoln County consolidation plan have pointed out that Republican lawmakers in Georgia pushed through bills allowing them to reconstitute the elections boards in half a dozen counties, including Lincoln. In some of those counties, Republicans forced out Black Democrats and replaced them with Republicans. In Lincoln County, the composition of the five-member elections board has changed since the 2020 election \u2014 but not because of the new state laws. Shortly after the 2020 election, two members voluntarily resigned, said one of them, Howie Gunby. Gunby, who had been appointed by the Democratic Party, said he and his Republican counterpart had been on the board for many years and decided it was time to leave. The Board of Education, which has the right to name an elections board member, replaced its appointee around the same time. Amidst the turnover, the Republican-controlled county commission decided it wanted elections board members to have staggered terms. During that process, lawyers told the county commission the political parties could no longer be permitted to directly appoint elections board members; the commission now appoints three of the five members instead. Bolton, the elections director, said the Democratic Party appointee who stepped down was replaced by county commissioners with a candidate drawn from a list the Democratic Party provided to the county board. The current five-member elections board, which includes two Black Democrats, have all said they supported the polling-place consolidation plan, Bolton said. Loading... Locating polling places to best serve voters is complex, experts say, and a change in the number of polling places alone isn't enough to tell you whether voters have sufficient access. It also matters which voters are affected and how. Some counties are offering vote centers that give people choices about where to go, or a better building that can accommodate more machines or is closer to public transportation. \"What's important to focus on is how these polling place decisions affect Election Day capacity to process voters, as well as which communities will bear those burdens,\" said the BPC's Orey. Gunby, the former elections board member, said he still speaks frequently with Bolton, the elections director. He said he also would prefer a less dramatic reduction in polling sites. The changes to state law make it more difficult to predict what voters will need. Voting by absentee ballot, for example, may now be more difficult. State lawmakers made a series of changes to the deadlines and ID requirements for requesting and returning mail-in ballots. It's also important \"not to have a knee-jerk reaction\" to a polling place reduction, said David Becker, executive director and founder of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research and a former Department of Justice senior trial attorney who oversaw voting rights enforcement in several states, including Georgia. Voter suppression is real, and indefensible, even if it affects only a handful of voters and wouldn't change an election outcome, Becker said. But \"not everything is voter suppression, and it actually makes it more difficult to fight legitimate voter suppression when we call everything voter suppression,\" he said, stressing that he was speaking generally and had not studied the Lincoln County plan specifically. Lincoln County has no public transportation, making increased distance between voters and polling places an issue. But Bolton said many of the buildings she had used as polling places are insufficient to hold many machines or people. Some are as small as a studio apartment. Others are cinder-block buildings difficult to heat and cool, a problem for elderly poll workers spending a 14-hour day serving a relatively small number of voters. A single centralized polling place, she said, will allow her to put enough staff and up to 40 machines in the gymnasium at the county's recreation complex. That would be more than enough to handle the number of local voters, she said. \"Well, if I don't consolidate, I need some buildings,\" Bolton said. \"That's the reality of it, is they're not here.\" The idea to consolidate voting locations came last year, Bolton said, because of new voting equipment that took up more space, the coronavirus pandemic and the board deciding it was time for a change. In 2020, the county was one of many to receive a grant for election expenses from the Center for Tech and Civic Life, funded by Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg. Lincoln County got around $20,000 and Bolton said the money paid for \"everything to do with the election.\" But the new state law prevents counties from directly seeking such private grants, creating new struggles to maintain access offered during the pandemic. When the election board held public meetings in September 2021, some residents expressed concerns over the distance between the new site and remote parts of the county. Others shared \"non-related concerns over general voting in\u00adtegrity issues during the 2020 elec\u00adtion,\" according to the Lincoln Journal. In December, a plan to approve the consolidation was delayed for lack of a quorum. Media attention ramped up from there. Aunna Dennis, executive director for Common Cause Georgia, told the Augusta Chronicle in December that the county was \"trying to do this undercover precinct consolidation\" and several voting groups would begin a canvassing drive to stop the plan. \"I think there are bad actors who are wanting to pilot precinct consolidations and takeovers of elections boards in smaller counties,\" she said. But Bolton, the elections director, said the voting rights groups never asked to speak with her or offered alternative solutions to the problems she was aiming to fix. She said she wished they'd come \"to talk to me to see what I was doing, what was going on.\" Voting rights groups delivered a petition they said includes more than 600 signatures from three precincts in opposition to Lincoln County's plans to drastically reduce the number of polling places in the county.\n                \n                    \n                    Stephen Fowler/Georgia Public Broadcasting\n                    \n                \nhide caption At the press conference \u2014 after the petition was delivered \u2014 the voting groups said if staffing and polling places were an issue, they would be happy to help. The conflicting ideas on how to serve voters came to a head at a Lincoln County Board of Elections meeting on Jan. 19, where dozens of residents and advocates filled what is typically a sparsely occupied room. Many spoke about the need for multiple polling places spread throughout the county. Among them was resident Greg Grant, who said for people living in the far corners of the county, the new site in Lincolnton might as well be in a different state. \"There's a lot of people that live in the northern end of the county that work in Elberton and Athens, that the commute back into town is just more of an inconvenience,\" he said, though he added, \"Most people will do what they need to do to be able to get their vote in.\" The elections board meeting began with an announcement that no vote would be taken that night on closing polls. It ended abruptly after residents got into an exchange with the board chair over the proposal and the county's plan to offer rides to the polls for any voter who called. A Georgia law allows residents to halt plans to consolidate polling places if at least 20% of a precinct's voters sign a petition opposing the change. Voting rights groups said they gathered enough to cover three precincts. On Wednesday, Bolton sent advocates a letter saying they had met the required signature threshold in just one precinct. The group behind the petitions is reportedly seeking more information. Another meeting will likely be called soon to decide the fate of Lincoln County's seven polling places. It promises to be just as contentious as the last. When asked if, in hindsight, she would do anything differently, Bolton said no. \"It's for the betterment of the community, not pointing fingers at anyone, not trying to suppress anybody's vote,\" she said. This story was reported by GPB's Stephen Fowler, and Carrie Levine and Pratheek Rebala of the Center for Public Integrity.",

            "article_content": "Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas testified Tuesday before Republican lawmakers who threatened to impeach him. Immigrant advocates race to pass what they can during the lame duck.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: All right. Today, we got a possible preview of what a Republican majority in the House could mean for immigration policy. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas testified on the Hill, facing some of the same House Republicans who have been calling for his impeachment over his handling of the southern border. NPR's Joel Rose is here to talk about that hearing and what the new Congress could mean for immigration policy. Hi, Joel. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: OK, so what did they press Mayorkas on today? ROSE: Lots of questions were about border security and the record number of migrant apprehensions at the southern border last year, apprehensions that, by the way, remained very high in October as well. There were a few combative moments in the hearing today, particularly between Secretary Mayorkas and Representative Clay Higgins, a Republican from Louisiana, who asked a series of provocative questions, including, have you ever used your authority to suppress exculpatory evidence or to intimidate front line border agents? To which Mayorkas responded, I don't even know what you're referring to. And then this exchange. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLAY HIGGINS: It's been rumored, Secretary, that you're going to resign prior to January the 3. Is there any truth to those rumors? ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: That is a false rumor. HIGGINS: All right. We look forward to seeing you in January. ROSE: Higgins is one of a dozen Republicans who co-sponsored a resolution calling for Mayorkas's impeachment. So the threat was definitely there, although it was maybe a bit more subtle than in past hearings. CHANG: Right. OK. Well, I understand that these were the first public remarks by Secretary Mayorkas since a top U.S. border official resigned over the weekend. Did that resignation come up today? ROSE: Not much. The commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection stepped down on Saturday, as you say. Chris Magnus had been in the job for less than a year. Magnus said last week that he was forced out of the job. Mayorkas was not asked about that today. One Republican congressman did applaud the move. But if Magnus's departure was supposed to alleviate concerns about the border, it clearly did not. CHANG: Well, tell me this. You know, we heard a lot about the southern border before the midterm elections. Do we know how much this issue mattered to voters this cycle? ROSE: It does not appear to have been a big voting issue. Republican candidates certainly talked about the border a lot in their campaigns and in their TV ads, but it doesn't seem to have moved the needle that much, even in contested races where it came up the most, for example, in Arizona. And that seems to underscore something, you know, we've seen for a while now. Concerns about immigration are not evenly spread across the electorate. Polls show that Republicans care a lot, but for most Democrats and independents, it is just not a top-tier issue. CHANG: Well, then what do you think all of this means for immigration in the next Congress? ROSE: I think it's still hard to say with the majority in leadership, you know, in flux. I think it's telling, though, that a lot of immigrant advocates are not waiting for the next Congress to find out. They are putting a serious effort into this lame duck session. A lot of immigrants and their advocates are coming to Washington this week. That includes so-called DREAMers who were brought to the country illegally as children. They're worried about losing their protections and their work permits if the courts rule that DACA is illegal, which looks likely. Also, dairy farmers and growers who want to see agriculture workforce reform and Afghan evacuees who are seeking a path to permanent legal status. But top Republicans have said they want to see enhancements to border security before anything else happens on immigration. So the odds of any deal coming together in these next few weeks are long. And, you know, they're probably not going to get much better in January. CHANG: That is NPR's Joel Rose. Thank you, Joel. ROSE: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "In Texas, early voting is well underway ahead of Tuesday's primary election. Democrats haven't won a statewide election in Texas for decades, despite many attempts to \"turn Texas blue.\"  A MARTINEZ, HOST: In Texas, early voting is well underway ahead of Tuesday's primary election. Democrats from around the country, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have been campaigning there. And the New York congresswoman recently repeated a long-held political prediction. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ: Texas turning blue is inevitable... (CHEERING) OCASIO-CORTEZ: ...Inevitable. The only question is when, Texas. (CHEERING) OCASIO-CORTEZ: The only question is when. MARTINEZ: But NPR's Wade Goodwyn asks, is that the only question? WADE GOODWYN, BYLINE: How long has it been since a Democrat was elected statewide in Texas? I'll give you a hint. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANN RICHARDS: Poor George. He can't help it. (LAUGHTER) RICHARDS: He was born with a silver foot in his mouth. (LAUGHTER) GOODWYN: That was Ann Richards at the Democratic National Convention in 1988, joking about the first President Bush, George H.W. Three years later, she was elected Texas governor. But after she was beaten for reelection by the joke victim's son, George W. Bush, in 1994, not another Democrat has been elected statewide. No other state has gone longer. MATT RINALDI: We've been hearing since 2002, with the dream team of Ron Kirk and Tony Sanchez, that Democrats were going to take the state, and they didn't do it then. GOODWYN: Matt Rinaldi is the chairman of the Texas Republican Party. RINALDI: And then we heard again with Wendy Davis that Democrats were going to take the state, and they didn't do it then. And then we heard with Beto O'Rourke, and they didn't that time, either. So we've been hearing this over a period of about 20 years, and it's never played out. GOODWYN: It's not that there hasn't been progress for Texas Democrats. In the 2014 governor's race that Rinaldi mentioned, Democrat Wendy Davis was routed by Republican Greg Abbott by more than 20 points. Four years ago in the U.S. Senate race, Beto O'Rourke only lost to Ted Cruz by just over 2 1/2 points - quite promising, if nonetheless disappointing for Democrats. But last year, Joe Biden lost Texas to President Trump by nearly six points. That's closer than the margin Trump beat Hillary Clinton by in 2016. But in politics, it's still getting stomped. Here's GOP chairman Rinaldi again. RINALDI: Political relocations are greater than ever. We're actually importing Republican voters from other states - California and New York - coming here. And we saw that reflected in the Ted Cruz race. Ted Cruz won a majority of transplants, while Beto won a majority of native Texans. GOODWYN: Republicans have made progress with Hispanic voters on the Texas border. In the last election in both McAllen and Laredo, President Trump improved his share of Hispanic voters by more than 23 points, though he still lost those towns. While Democratic activists were calling Hispanic voters on the phone during the last election because of the coronavirus, Republicans were going door to door, connecting to conservative Hispanic Catholics and evangelicals - generations who may have well grown up hunting birds with friends and family along the largely rural border. Joanne Green is a political science professor at TCU. JOANNE GREEN: Issues like abortion, definitely Second Amendment issues, economic issues, oil and gas industry - many of them, when asked by academics, identify as white - so very much part of the Texas culture. COLIN ALLRED: Well, listen, I understand some of the skepticism around Texas turning blue. GOODWYN: Colin Allred is a Democratic congressman in Dallas. Allred says that although Texas hasn't turned blue as fast as was predicted, he still believes it's inevitable that there are a lot more liberal Hispanics in the cities than conservative Hispanics along the border. ALLRED: Then we have to remember that these are gerrymandered districts that were drawn so that they could not be flipped. And it is true in the most recent round of redistricting, both at the congressional level and the State House level, that we're not going to have as many competitive elections early on in the decade. But that happened last decade as well, and later in the decade we saw all of these districts flipping. GOODWYN: Early voting in the Texas primaries have started. The latest fundraising statistics from Transparency USA show Texas Republicans outraising Texas Democrats by 3 to 1. Beto O'Rourke, who's running for governor against incumbent Greg Abbott, is currently down by seven to 10 percentage points, according to the latest polls. But there's still a long way to go. The November elections this year and then again in 2024, will tell us a lot. Wade Goodwyn, NPR News, Dallas. (SOUNDBITE OF ERNESTO JIMENEZ'S \"MAR EN CALMA\") Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

            "article_content": "NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Nina Jankowicz, disinformation expert and author of \"How to Be a Woman Online,\" about abuse against women on the internet and Musk's planned buyout of Twitter.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: After an on-again, off-again, at times contentious flirtation with the social media platform Twitter, tech billionaire Elon Musk says he is once again interested in buying it. On Thursday, a judge gave Musk and Twitter until October 28 to close their deal and end their months-long legal fight and avoid a high-profile trial. But the latest twist in this ongoing saga has resurfaced questions about what the popular social media site will look like under the leadership of a so-called free speech absolutist. Musk has openly criticized Twitter's policies that monitor hate speech, disinformation and online abuse, and has publicly claimed he would work to undo some of them. That made us want to reach out to Nina Jankowicz. She is a disinformation expert who's spent years researching online behavior and safety. But her interest in this, as it is for many women in public life, is not just academic. Earlier this year, she was the target of a vicious campaign of online abuse, all because she was appointed to a federal government working group aimed at combating disinformation. So we thought about what a Twitter buyout could mean for the safety of women, and for that matter, other historically marginalized groups online. That's a topic she writes about in her book, \"How To Be a Woman Online: Surviving Abuse And Harassment, And How To Fight Back.\" And she's with us once again. Nina Jankowicz, thanks so much for joining us. NINA JANKOWICZ: Great to talk to you again, Michel. MARTIN: So it seems at least somewhat likely that Musk could own Twitter by the end of the month. Of course, the story has had so many twists and turns, you know, we can't know for sure. But as a person who spends a lot of time looking at social media and engaging with it, what was your reaction to this week's news? JANKOWICZ: For a free speech absolutist to take control of a platform like Twitter, where so many people spend their time and when there's where there's a lot of debate going on, this is not just about, you know, allowing a free speech free-for-all. This is about eventually silencing marginalized voices. That free speech free-for-all is going to mean less speech for marginalized groups. Because what happens online these days - and I know this personally, as you said - is it's not just the expressly illegal content or the content that directly incites violence. And that's the stuff that Musk said he would prohibit. All the rest of the policies would go away. It's not just that stuff that is silencing for marginalized groups. What I've experienced is that, you know, you get thousands and thousands of messages that are kind of borderline in terms of violence. Some of them are directly threatening. And what that does is change your calculus about how you engage online. You know, in Brazil, which is also in election season right now, Reporters Without Borders recently did a survey that showed that 80% of women journalists in Brazil change how they interact online because they're afraid of attacks, because they want to keep themselves safe from those attacks. And if we were to remove all the protections that Twitter has, I really worry about the silencing effect that that would have for women and marginalized voices. MARTIN: Could you talk a little bit about what that was like? As we mentioned, you were appointed to chair the Disinformation Governance Board. And then you quickly became the target of an online disinformation and harassment campaign. And I just want to point out that the purpose of this was to figure out how to deal with, for example, disinformation directed at would-be migrants, disinformation directed at people spreading falsehoods about COVID vaccinations and things like that. These are public safety measures and also measures designed to keep people from making bad decisions about whether to cross the border, for example, because we know that certain sort of campaigns are directed at some of these groups. So what is that like? JANKOWICZ: Yeah. I mean, so the first thing to understand is that the entire harassment campaign was based on this foundational lie that the Disinformation Governance Board would be policing American speech. And I think it's important to note that the board had absolutely no ability or purview to take any operational action like that. That's not political spin. That's just the truth. I would not have taken the job if that were the case. And so based on this foundational lie, I had thousands of my fellow Americans sending me, you know, things ranging from just kind of curse words and insults, picking apart my physical appearance, talking about the weight that I gained during pregnancy, things like that - because I was eight months pregnant at the time. But also, you know, direct threats to me and my family, my unborn child, people saying that I should be sent to Russia and killed, people saying that I had committed treason. And this was their 1776 moment. And I should, you know, watch my back, that sort of thing. My research, as you've noted, has focused on online harassment and abuse. And so I was probably as well-prepared as I could be for these attacks. But it was still really difficult because my work is online. And, you know, a lot of my life is online, as it is for most people these days. So by encountering these messages over and over and over, every time I opened up, not just Twitter but Facebook, but Instagram, every account that I have online, basically. And I've also received, you know, mail to my home, phone calls. It really does have an effect, even for someone who prides herself on being outspoken and will not back down. MARTIN: One of the things that I think is important to point out is that women aren't the only people who are subjected to this conduct. I mean, recently The Daily Beast wrote about a science fiction writer who four years ago wrote just a tweet saying he didn't think Norm MacDonald was that funny. I mean, this is before it was known that Norm MacDonald was suffering from cancer and so forth. But he just said, I don't think he's that funny. And so he has been subjected to a campaign of vicious harassment ever since by people who seem to think it's their job to do it. I mean, he has been swatted. He's had law enforcement falsely called to his home under false pretenses, and has been completely unable to defend himself from this conduct. And frankly, it's not an exaggeration to say that people who have been targets of online harassment campaigns have taken their own lives because it was just more than they could deal with. So the question I guess I have is, why is this not seen as more of a public health or criminal justice concern? JANKOWICZ: I think it's seen as a problem, but not seen as an urgent problem. So we heard from the Twitter whistleblower Mudge - Peiter Zatko - that things like online harassment just fall by the wayside because of the exigent problems that come up at platforms, security problems that they're forced to then throw all their resources to. And I think that's why his testimony is so powerful, along with the testimony of other tech whistleblowers that we've heard from over the past few years, because the tech companies are just putting out fires based on the problems that their platforms have created. They are not thinking proactively about the harm that their platforms can cause - or in some cases, they are actively looking the other way and really prioritizing profit over the humanity of their users. And we've seen in countries like Australia where there's an e-safety commissioner, and in the U.K., which is pursuing an online safety bill, that, you know, the tech companies are going to have to face some more accountability for their duty of care for their users. MARTIN: Periodically, there have been moves in the U.S. Congress and elsewhere in Europe and other parts of the world to think about how these tech companies should be addressed in the public sphere, given their impact on public life, not just in the United States, but around the world. And is there any urgency around that, or does this give us an opportunity to think about that again? JANKOWICZ: You know, Michel, I've really become quite pessimistic after my own experience that both the Congress and the U.S. government are really up to the task of conducting oversight over these platforms. Again, I do not want the U.S. government to have any right to silence Americans. It does not have that right, thanks to the First Amendment. But I do think there needs to be oversight over the ways that platforms are conducting content moderation calls and the policies that allow these types of network harassment campaigns to flourish. Other countries are further ahead than we are. But I really think that the solutions, at least in the short term, are going to be in the public sphere. And that's why I'm focusing my work on non-profit advocacy campaigns rather than trying to make big overarching policy change because it just does not seem like anyone is up to the task of taking on this hugely profitable industry that is flourishing on hate. MARTIN: Before we let you go, is it possible that people could just stop using the platform? Is that a thing that could happen? JANKOWICZ: You know, I just had a conversation with my husband about this this morning. And he said, you know, what are you thinking about? If Musk buys the platform, what will you do? And I think it's really important to underline that for so many people, not just Twitter, but platforms like Facebook and Instagram, it is a really important part, not only of their social life, but of their careers. I mean, I have not only put my work out there through Twitter, I've made really important professional connections around the world. Some of my closest colleagues and friends in my sphere of work are people that I primarily got to know on Twitter. Not to mention that, you know, when I do interviews, when I publish new pieces, when I testify before Congress, I share that and expose people to these ideas using the internet. So it is a decision I've not made yet, but I think it's important to underline that it's not just about fun cat pictures online. This is a place where people increasingly live their lives and do work. And so we really need to think about, again, the tech companies' duty of care to the millions of users that are entrusting them with this significant part of their lives. MARTIN: That's Nina Jankowicz. She's a scholar who researches disinformation and its effect on democracy. Her latest book is \"How To Be A Woman Online: Surviving Abuse And Harassment, And How To Fight Back.\" Nina Jankowicz, thanks so much for sharing your expertise with us once again.

That focus brought her to the plant, where Washougal staff thanked her for securing $1 million in federal funds to buy and install something called an anoxic selector. \"That's how you say it?\" she said with a laugh. \"I'm not going to lie, I can read it. I'm like, 'Let's support that. It looks important.' \" Herrera Beutler was one of just 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach then-President Donald Trump in the wake of the Capitol insurrection. And she is one of three who are on the ballot Tuesday \u2014 in Washington state and in Michigan \u2014 aiming to fend off primary opponents. In Washington, to the east of Herrera Beutler's 3rd Congressional District, Rep. Dan Newhouse in the 4th District faces a Trump-backed challenger. As does Rep. Peter Meijer in Michigan. In her race, Herrera Beutler \u2014 who stands by her impeachment vote but has not made it a focus of her reelection bid \u2014 faces multiple well-funded challengers from her own party, presenting for the first time the real possibility she may not make it past the primary. Those challengers include Trump-endorsed former Green Beret Joe Kent and Christian podcaster and homeschool advocate Heidi St. John, who cater to the district's most conservative voters. The six-term congresswoman, who was first elected in 2010, acknowledged that being flanked from the right is an entirely new experience. \"I've never been in this position, in this way,\" she told NPR. \"I have no metrics \u2014 no experience to say, 'This is how everything is going to work. And this is how I should be running this race.' \" So, she said, she's taking a business-as-usual approach. \"This isn't going to make a lot of social media feeds,\" she said of her wastewater treatment plant tour. \"Whereas I've always felt like if you do the work of the hometown congressperson, elections take care of themselves. And that has proven true now several times.\" That may be true of how and when she makes public appearances, but the congresswoman is also deploying a different tactic: appealing to moderates, independents and even Democrats. It's a strategy made possible by Washington state's top-two primary system. The so-called \"jungle primary\" puts all candidates on one ballot and advances the top two vote-getters to the general election, regardless of party. Because voters aren't required to declare a party affiliation, they can more easily cross the aisle if they choose. That is seen as likely to benefit Herrera Beutler, who will no longer have the district's dedicated conservatives behind her. While Washington's 3rd District overlaps with the Portland metro area, its rural voters have regularly sailed her to reelection. Her campaign ads are rife with rhetoric of unity, and mailers bill her as an \"independent\" candidate. \"Yes, I'm a Republican,\" Herrera Beutler said in the interview. \"But I'm also very independent in my approach. And that's what people want to see here. So I'm betting that's going to continue to be the thing that's most important to voters.\" It works in her favor that Democrats \u2014 who waged tough challenges in the last two cycles \u2014 have largely no-showed this year. One Democratic candidate, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, joined the race late and has raised far less money than the Republican challengers. Joe Kent, center, a Trump-endorsed Republican who is challenging Herrera Beutler, speaks during a \"Justice For J6\" rally near the U.S. Capitol in Washington, on Sept. 18, 2021, in support of people who took part in the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n                \n                    \n                    Nathan Howard/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption It also helps Herrera Beutler that Kent and St. John aren't just attacking her, but each other, too. Thanks to a spending spree by outside groups, mailers and television ads supporting St. John have poured into the district decrying Kent as a secret Democrat and a \"Bernie Bro.\" (Kent acknowledges that he voted for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in Oregon's 2020 presidential primary when he lived there, but he says his aim was to give Trump a weaker opponent.) Kent frequently vents that St. John is splitting the district's conservative voting bloc and indirectly supporting Herrera Beutler. \"I would not do the establishment ... the favor of being the person who is being manipulated to snuff out the voice of the people,\" Kent told a crowd of about 30 outside Vancouver, Wash., last month. Federal campaign filings show Kent has been heavily targeted by outside spending. The Women for Winning Action Fund, which has spent $518,000 on Herrera Beutler's behalf, has also spent $1.7 million against Kent. And a newly created and largely anonymous super PAC called Conservatives for a Stronger America has poured in money on St. John's behalf and spent $520,000 against Kent. After the town hall, Kent expressed frustration about the spending. He described it as \"death by a thousand cuts.\" Bad blood between St. John and Kent dates back to March 2021, when they both vowed at a public forum to withdraw and support whomever received Trump's endorsement to unseat Herrera Beutler. The former president endorsed Kent six months later, but St. John remained in the race. St. John has maintained that she made that agreement before learning more about Kent. She derides him as \"Portland Joe,\" as Kent, a Portland native, was a registered Democrat in Oregon until he moved to the 3rd District. The rift is creating a tough choice for the district's more conservative voters. Melinda Lucas, a 72-year-old Ridgefield resident, said St. John initially intrigued her, but she gravitated to Kent's policies. Kent supports strict borders, ending foreign wars and an audit of the 2020 election, which he falsely claims was stolen from Trump. \"Election fraud was a big one,\" Lucas said. \"And I will say, my husband said, 'He's a Green Beret. I trust him.' \" Still, other Republicans worry about Kent's ties to extremism. He was a keynote speaker at the so-called \"Justice for J6\" rally in Washington, D.C., last September, where he called for clemency for people facing criminal charges for the riot. In March, Kent had to distance himself from white nationalist Nick Fuentes after he publicly claimed Kent's campaign sought to work with him. Kent confirmed he had a phone call with Fuentes, but declined knowing anything about Fuentes and said the relationship never advanced. Kent's chief consultant, Matt Braynard, told Oregon Public Broadcasting in March that he set up a booth at Fuentes' \"America First\" convention. Braynard said attendees \"didn't seem too interested in us.\" And last week, the Associated Press reported that Kent's campaign paid more than $11,000 to a person identified by law enforcement as a member of the far-right Proud Boys. The Kent campaign told a reporter that the man had no \"current affiliation\" with \"outside organizations,\" the Associated Press reported. Mark Jager, a 64-year-old Vancouver resident, described St. John and Kent both as \"fringe\" Republicans but nonetheless said he considered them valid candidates. \"It's a part of the party that I don't identify with but they have absolutely the right to have their views and to be running in this race,\" Jager said. Jager said he would support Herrera Beutler in the primary. But Jager said that if Herrera Beutler fell short in the primary, he'd face a tough choice in November. Jager said he might even consider voting for the Democrat Perez. \"I will look at all candidates, you know, including the Democrat, and vote my conscience on that issue,\" he said. \"I will factor in all candidates in my decision, and may move to the other side of the aisle if I feel so moved.\"",

            "article_content": "One of the most intense battlegrounds between Republican moderates and extremists is in Idaho, where next month's primary is seen as a national test for how far to the right the GOP can be pulled.  LEILA FADEL, HOST: One of the most intense battlegrounds right now between moderates and extremists in the Republican Party is in Idaho. Primary elections next month in Idaho are seen as a national test for how far to the right the GOP can be pulled. NPR's Kirk Siegler reports on moderate Republicans who are organizing to fight against extremism. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: There was this moment when cattle rancher Jennifer Ellis decided she couldn't stand on the political sidelines anymore. It's when Ammon Bundy, who led an armed takeover of a federal wildlife refuge, moved to Idaho and began mounting his campaign for governor. JENNIFER ELLIS: When you see him rising in the national consciousness as some kind of a cowboy rancher, that gets a little touchy. SIEGLER: Ellis says Bundy gave the actual working public lands ranchers who follow the law a bad name. For her, the saga was a buildup to today's right-wing politics of conspiracies, trolling and just being mean and threatening. ELLIS: It's dividing communities. They love the politics of fear. SIEGLER: Ammon Bundy is now running as an independent, but Idaho's Lieutenant Governor Janice McGeachin, who's cozied up to white nationalists, is vying for the GOP nomination. There are also at least two openly militia candidates running for the legislature. Ellis, a lifelong Republican and former president of the Idaho Cattle Association, regrets not speaking out sooner. ELLIS: People like me kind of got tired of listening to the conspiracy stuff, and we just went home and went back to work. And so then the extremists were able to take control. SIEGLER: So last fall, Ellis helped form the political action committee Take Back Idaho. She and several former Republican elected leaders have raised close to a hundred thousand dollars to try to unseat at least 16 far-right legislators. That'll be a tough job here, where the far-right attacks conservatives at times as RINOs, Republicans in name only. ELLIS: There's nothing that Republican officeholders hate worse than being called a RINO or not Christian enough. And now we've got both of those operations going in this state. SIEGLER: Lately, around her ranch on the windy high prairie, new subdivisions have cropped up with homes bought by newcomers calling themselves blue state refugees. Trump 2024 flags started popping up around here right after President Biden's nomination. And in most states, Idaho Governor Brad Little would be a hard-line conservative. He just signed a Texas-style abortion bill. But here, some local GOP leaders call him a liberal. DOYLE BECK: We are a very conservative state with nothing but blue policies. SIEGLER: Doyle Beck runs a construction company in nearby Idaho Falls. A state GOP delegate, he says conservatives have worked hard to steer the party agenda toward eliminating most government and taxes on business. BECK: The status quo is the special interest groups and the cronies governing the state of Idaho. The Take Back Idaho's feeling like they're losing. SIEGLER: At the University of Montana, political scientist Rob Saldin is tracking moderate groups like Take Back Idaho, which, so far, are rare. ROB SALDIN: Where are the current high-profile Republicans who are endorsing and supporting this effort? I don't see many. And the ones you do, I mean, it's, like, Liz Cheney, who's in big trouble. SIEGLER: In Montana, former Governor Mark Racicot has been writing editorials in The Washington Post lately, similar in tone to Take Back Idaho. Racicot chaired the Republican National Committee under George W. Bush. At his home near Missoula, he told me that the party's far-right leaders are a threat to democracy. MARC RACICOT: There's really a huge, great middle of America that is concerned about us as a republic falling apart. SIEGLER: Racicot was a popular two-term governor in the '90s. Now the party base attacks him as a RINO. He calls that angry, cheap rhetoric. RACICOT: Any time that you get fat and happy about what it is that you're doing that's not focused upon the best interest of your country first - not your party, your country first - you end up placing your form of government at risk. SIEGLER: Racicot says many Republicans today are distracting with hate and division rather than dealing with tough issues head on. (SOUNDBITE OF CAR DOOR SLAMMING) SIEGLER: This was rancher Jennifer Ellis's take in Idaho, where lawmakers are going after librarians for exposing kids to, quote, \"harmful books\" and even debated whether Canadians were illegally coming over the border to vote in elections here. There's no evidence of that. ELLIS: I just have to wonder where the grown-ups in the room are on some of these things when we have got infrastructure that is really in peril. We have got schools that have not been funded like they should. SIEGLER: Today, Ellis is trying to raise money and fight extremism in the middle of calving season. ELLIS: Actually, I'm surprised that they haven't done a little bit of bellering (ph). SIEGLER: She's out in this pasture sometimes all day and night. ELLIS: He was born this morning. This wind - they'll get really muddy. SIEGLER: She says true Idaho conservatives are out here on the land working. ELLIS: We're not conspiracy theorists in Idaho. That's how - never how we've ran this state. It's a meat-and-potatoes state. We do important things. We don't deal with juvenile things. SIEGLER: Ellis is trying to pull the pendulum back to the middle. The first test may be primary day, May 17. Kirk Siegler, NPR News, Idaho Falls.

In this file photo, she talks in her office in Alamo, Texas, July 8, 2021.\n                \n                    \n                    Eric Gay/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican Monica De La Cruz-Hernandez flipped the 15th House Congressional District in one of Texas' only remaining competitive districts. In this file photo, she talks in her office in Alamo, Texas, July 8, 2021. Though more competitive than any previous election cycle, the Rio Grande Valley's midterm races reelected many of its Democratic representatives. Republican candidates across the Rio Grande Valley in Texas perpetuated a nationwide narrative that a \"red wave\" of GOP support would turn out to the polls on November 8. Blaming rising inflation and increasing migrant crossings on President Joe Biden's policies, their stances were shown in a flurry of attack ads across local news networks. But it seems that is all it was \u2014 a narrative, after the GOP managed to flip only one state house seat and one congressional district. Even in the state's biggest race, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott did not carry any of the Rio Grande Valley's four counties. Mayra Flores, Cassy Garcia and Monica De La Cruz became the face of the region's Republican hopes, dubbing themselves the \"triple threat.\" All campaigned as anti-abortion, border-wall-supporting candidates against the Democratic Party establishment, describing their opponents as corrupt or too radical for South Texas. Loading... Of the three candidates, only De La Cruz, an insurance agent based in Alamo, was elected. She won in Texas' 15th congressional district and is the first Republican to be elected to the seat. De La Cruz benefitted from a redrawn district that favored Republicans and would have been carried former President Donald Trump by 2.8 percentage points. Previously, the district favored President Joe Biden by 1.9 percentage points. Flores, the incumbent of Texas's 34th congressional district, lost to three-time Rep. Vicente Gonzalez by 8 percentage points. Garcia, a former staffer for Senator Ted Cruz, lost to nine-term Rep. Henry Cuellar by 13 percentage points. Of the three, Flores was the only office holder. She was elected during a special election after then-incumbent Filemon Vela left the seat to work with a Washington, D.C., lobbying firm. Flores' election against moderate, pro-life Democrat Dan Sanchez signaled to the GOP a possible turning of the electorate in the RGV, after it had already invested heavily into De La Cruz's race at the beginning of the year. But the margin of Flores' win in June was small, securing only 50.9% of the vote. So, too, are the margins of GOP voting increases in the Rio Grande Valley during this midterm, compared to the 2020 election. According to the Secretary of State's voter data, the region saw only small increases, and even decreases, in GOP voter turnout compared to 2020. Like Abbott, none of the Republican candidates carried a Rio Grande Valley county in their races. The GOP's heavy investment in the area, though, was not without some gains in the traditionally Democratic districts. Though turnout may have been limited from 2020 to present, compared to the 2018 midterms, all four Rio Grande Valley counties saw GOP voter turnout increase between 10 and 18 percentage points. Republicans did have some victories down the ballot, though not in many of the high profile congressional races. Some of those wins came in districts that previously favored Democrats which have been redrawn to lean towards Republicans. As reported by the McAllen Monitor, those redistricting efforts were paramount to the GOP's successes in the Rio Grande Valley. Cameron County GOP Chair and Texas Republican Party State Committeewoman Morgan Cisneros Graham wasn't surprised by the results, considering how the districts were drawn. De La Cruz and Flores' campaigns also had more national and state investment, compared to local races. Graham says the \"red wave\" narrative \u2013 a term she says she's never been a fan of \u2013 was helpful for the national and state GOP to fundraise from. But hardly any of that investment made it to local races. \"When people saw all this money getting pumped into our area, it was only being pumped into two federal races,\" Graham said. She continued, \"we did not see that [investment] going down at all into those local offices. On top of that, because the focus is at the top of the ticket, it always hurts your down ballot.\" When it came to local races in the Rio Grande Valley, most of the Democratic incumbents were reelected. Regardless, the GOP's gains in the RGV concerned the state's Democratic party. In an internal memo acquired by the Texas Tribune, the Texas Democratic Party blamed GOP dark money, gerrymandering, voting restrictions from Senate Bill 1 and lack of support from national Democratic organizations for the party not \"making even larger gains\" during the election. In a year where Republicans were supposed to win across the country in a landslide, they could barely eke out this one win here. They should probably pack up their bags and get the hell out of our region. Gilberto Hinojosa, Texas Democratic Party Chairman \"Not only did their insidious cracking-and-packing strategy simply make several seats more Republican-leaning, it also intentionally made 'safe Democratic' districts\u2013ones Republicans knew they could afford to lose\u2013even bluer,\" Texas Democratic Party executive director Jamarr Brown said in the memo. \"These less competitive races means less money invested and less overall Democratic campaigning\u2013which, as we saw, results in lower awareness and lower turnout across the board.\" But the GOP's gains in the area are not entirely unexpected. The Republican Party's investment in the area, in the form of heavy campaign contributions, opening a \"Hispanic Community Center,\" and grassroots organizing have directly engaged a base that has felt ignored by the Democratic Party. \"Those Democratic leaders that have been in power in the Valley for a long time, they haven't traditionally worked very hard to expand the electorate,\" Cecilia Ball\u00ed, cultural anthropologist and journalist, told NPR. \"So I don't think it's only the national Democratic party that has been taking Latinos for granted: I think that the local Democratic establishment has done the same. And so you have some disaffected voters who are willing to try something different.\" Flores capitalized on this feeling in her campaign, saying the Democratic Party had abandoned South Texas. After the election, Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa saw the GOP's gains in the Rio Grande Valley as a \"fluke,\" calling De La Cruz's election as a sign of the GOP gaining ground \"complete b*******.\" \"There was no red wave in South Texas,\" Hinojosa said in a statement. \"Republicans in Austin and D.C. should understand that if\u2013even in a year where Republicans were supposed to win across the country in a landslide, they could barely eke out this one win here. They should probably pack up their bags and get the hell out of our region.\" It was more of a purple wave and there was progress. Morgan Cisneros Graham, Cameron County GOP Chair Hinojosa's confidence comes from Democrats managing to hold onto most of the Rio Grande Valley seats up for election. Still, in the heavily Latino Rio Grande Valley, Democrats saw narrow wins - and narrow losses - that some say should give them pause. \"The thing that we're not going back to is this notion that the Democratic party automatically has Latino voter support because they are ethnically 'other,' and because they are working class,\" Ball\u00ed said. Local GOP Chair Morgan Cisneros Graham says the party is now looking towards the 2024 primary elections, focusing on local, judicial and school board elections in the Rio Grande Valley. Claiming the metric for what constitutes a \"red wave\" in Texas politics was never defined, she says the GOP's gains were a positive for the party. \"If somebody's more oriented towards foundational races, which I tend to be, then the impression would be that there was no red wave in the RGV,\" Graham said. \"But if you're somebody who looks more at the impactful, more legislative-type offices, some would argue, well, it was more of a purple wave and there was progress.\"",

In the Senate, Democrats retain control.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: All right. Well, more than one week after Election Day, Republicans have won control of the House of Representatives. That is according to the Associated Press, which NPR relies on for its calls. California's 27th Congressional District was won by Republican incumbent Mike Garcia, which gave Republicans the 218 seats that they needed to clinch control of the House. Now, there are a handful of races still to be decided that will determine the margin by which Republicans will have control, but the GOP will hold a slim majority. Joining us now to talk about all of this is NPR congressional correspondent Deirdre Walsh. Hey, Deirdre. DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa. CHANG: OK. So Republicans have the 218. What else do we need to know here? WALSH: Well, it took a little longer than they thought, but Republicans have eked out enough gains to secure 218 House seats. That's a majority in the House. Democrats right now have 209. As you said, there are still eight uncalled races. But if their current lead holds, Republicans are going to wind up with a 221-seat majority. That's just a three-seat majority in the House. CHANG: Wow. WALSH: That is not the red wave that Republicans predicted. CHANG: No. WALSH: Right. But this is still a significant win for them. And it means Washington is once again going to have divided government. But this is a very narrow majority. It's going to make things very hard to pass in terms of legislation or even govern starting in January unless Republicans have total unity. CHANG: Yeah, a very narrow majority. OK. So what pitfalls will Republicans have to navigate with such a narrow majority in the chamber? And what does that mean for President Biden? WALSH: Right. Well, the House speaker, who could be California Republican Kevin McCarthy, is really going to have little room for error trying to unite the far right and more moderate wings of his party to keep them all on the same page. We've already seen that dynamic in the leadership election where, yesterday, 31 conservatives opposed McCarthy's nomination for speaker. He did win the nomination inside the Republican conference, but he still has to be elected on the House floor in January with a majority of the full House. McCarthy's still working to get those votes. But the Republican House next year is expected to clash on pretty much every issue with the Democratic Senate. We're going to see fights over basic functions like funding the government or raising the nation's debt limit. As for President Biden, it means his legislative agenda is essentially kind of dead. He's going to be playing defense. McCarthy has already been - put out this agenda that called for rolling back some of the president's key accomplishments. The first vote next year is expected to be to repeal a bill that boosted money for the IRS, lowered prescription drug prices, invested in climate programs. But Biden does have a Democratic Senate to act as a firewall. In a statement earlier tonight, the president did congratulate Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, saying he was, quote, \"ready to work with House Republicans to deliver results for working families.\" CHANG: OK. So I'm curious, Deirdre. Over the next two years, are we going to be looking at lots and lots of investigations led by House Republicans? Is that what we're expecting? WALSH: We sure are. There's going to be an onslaught of investigations on a very wide range of issues. Republicans who are going to chair committees are now going to be able to issue subpoenas. That's a big deal. The administration is going to have to respond to a lot of requests for documents and testimony. Already tomorrow, the chairs of two committees, House Oversight and Judiciary, are having a press conference to lay out evidence they say they've already gathered regarding President Biden's son. I talked to Congressman James Comer, who chairs the Oversight Committee. He says it's a possibility they subpoena Hunter Biden. There's also going to be probes on the president's border policies, the origins of the coronavirus and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. CHANG: That is NPR's Deirdre Walsh. Thank you so much, Deirdre. WALSH: Thanks, Ailsa. (SOUNDBITE OF CHAD CROUCH'S \"SOLAN\") Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

With some races still not called a week after Election Day, Republicans picked up at least 218 seats, and will take over the chamber next year with GOP leaders facing blowback about failing to deliver in what many considered a favorable political environment for their party.

House Democrats' razor-thin five-seat majority, plus a significant number of retirements by veteran members, set up an uphill battle for them to retain power. Yet despite those historical headwinds, Democrats did much better than expected in this year's midterms and kept control of the Senate. A Republican House will likely clash on most issues with a Democratic Senate in 2023, with bitter fights over basic functions like funding the government threatening to paralyze Washington. GOP candidates hoped to capitalize on voter frustration with the rising costs of groceries and gas, framing the election as a referendum on President Joe Biden and his party's rule of both the White House and Congress. But voters in exit polls indicated other issues like abortion rights and protecting democracy factored into their decisions at the ballot box. Redistricting in New York and Florida also helped the GOP overcome lackluster results in most of the races rated as toss-ups. The last time the president and top congressional leaders were from different parties was 2019, when Democrats regained control of the House in the 2018 midterms, two years after former President Donald Trump was elected president. A new House Republican majority will mean Biden's legislative agenda is essentially dead, unless he can find bipartisan support for some narrowly crafted proposals. Biden's focus during the next two years of his presidency will likely be spent defending his signature accomplishments, like a bill lowering prescription drug prices and investing hundreds of billions of dollars to tackle climate change. GOP lawmakers have already said they want to roll back some of Biden's programs, or defund many of them. The Biden White House will also face an onslaught of investigations on a wide range of issues. Top GOP members on the House Oversight and Judiciary committees have already said they plan to probe the business dealings of Biden's son, Hunter Biden, the president's border policies, the origins of the coronavirus and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. But because the margin is so slim there may be pressure from more moderate Republicans to pull back on some of the probes and instead focus on issues that show a GOP chamber can govern. Loading... House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., is poised to take the gavel as speaker in January when the new Congress is sworn in and the full chamber votes on the top position, which is second in line to the presidency, after the vice president. McCarthy is a longtime ally of Trump and will manage a GOP conference with many members largely loyal to Trump. But even though McCarthy won an internal vote for the post this week, he doesn't have the 218 votes now that he will need in the public vote on Jan. 3, when the new Congress elects a speaker. McCarthy first ran for speaker in 2015 to succeed Speaker John Boehner, who was retiring. But he abruptly withdrew from the race, a sign he recognized he didn't have the votes. He went on to serve as House Speaker Paul Ryan's No. 2 at the leadership table, and since then has developed close relationships with many of the conservatives who derailed his initial bid for the top slot. McCarthy is regarded as skilled at developing personal relationships across his conference after years of criss-crossing the country campaigning and raising money for GOP candidates. But he has not developed much of a record as a legislator. McCarthy and top GOP leaders unveiled their agenda, called a \"Commitment to America\" in September. It focuses on broad goals in four areas: the economy, security, personal freedom and government accountability. Ohio Rep Jim. Jordan, who is expected to take the gavel as the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, sent letters to Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray the week before the election outlining lengthy lists of materials the panel was seeking and directing the agency heads to preserve materials ahead of continuing probes in 2023. Republicans also plan to change House rules that currently allow for proxy voting \u2014 a practice Democrats put into place during the coronavirus pandemic. They also pledge to remove the magnetometers that were placed at entrances to the House floor following the January 6 attack on the Capitol. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., 82, has not announced whether she will run to lead the House Democratic Caucus. In 2007, Pelosi became the first woman to be speaker, shattering the so-called marble ceiling in Congress. She took the gavel a second time in 2019, after leading her party back to the majority, but indicated that she would abide by a pledge that helped her secure the votes for speaker to term limit her tenure in leadership. Many newer members have expressed support for paving the way for a new, likely younger Democrat to take the helm of the caucus. The current caucus chair, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., is expected to run for the post as minority leader if Pelosi decides to retire. But Democrats' strong performance in the midterms has frozen any movement to replace Pelosi. She says some of her colleagues are urging her to run again for the top leadership post, and says the attack on her husband Paul Pelosi roughly 10 days before the election will impact her decision. Before Republicans take control of the chamber, Congress is already preparing for a lame duck session that is expected to stretch into the end of the year. Leaders hope to finalize a bipartisan budget deal to fund government agencies through the rest of the fiscal year and avoid a possible government shutdown. Pelosi also indicated that she would like Congress to raise the debt limit to avoid any contentious debate and threat of default early next year. Democratic leaders also plan to pass legislation that would clarify how Congress certifies the results of presidential elections with a revamp of the Electoral Count Act, a law first enacted in 1887. Confusion over provisions of the law was exploited by Trump and his allies on Jan. 6, 2021 and lawmakers say the new law is needed to prevent another attack on the Capitol.",

Loading... The victory is a relief to Arizona Democrats, who spent much of the campaign wringing their hands over whether Hobbs \u2014 the current secretary of state in Arizona \u2014 could defeat the made-for-TV Lake, who spent 22 years at a local Fox affiliate, much of it as a news anchor. Most polls ahead of the elections showed Lake with a slight lead in the race. Lake showed a knack for garnering headlines while antagonizing reporters in her first-ever campaign. She ran on an unabashedly pro-Trump agenda \u2014 promising to declare an invasion along the southern border and voicing support for the state's pre-statehood abortion ban \u2014 alongside a slate of Trump-endorsed candidates who won their primaries in the swing state of Arizona. Following the primary, Lake even boasted of driving \"a stake in the heart of the McCain machine,\" an unfriendly nod to Arizona's conservative establishment that's been overrun by allies of Trump in Arizona. For her part, Hobbs ran a far more subdued, traditional campaign, in a race she often described as a choice between \"sanity and chaos.\" Hobbs made national headlines, and faced withering criticism, for her refusal to debate Lake. Hobbs focused on messaging that would cross party lines and appeal to Arizona's influential independent voters, and even some Republicans who've grown tired of Trump. In 2020, Biden became just the second Democratic presidential candidate to win in Arizona since 1948. More Election 2022 coverage",

Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez has won election to the U.S. House in Washington state's 3rd Congressional District, according to a race call by The Associated Press, providing Democrats with a notable pickup in their bid to keep the chamber. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, an auto-shop owner who describes herself as an independent-minded Democrat, beat Republican Joe Kent, a Trump-endorsed candidate with controversial ties to far-right figures. Kent, an ex-Green Beret, narrowly topped incumbent Republican Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler in a primary after she drew Trump's ire for being one of 10 House GOP members to vote for his impeachment. Gluesenkamp Perez supports abortion access and policies to counter climate change, but also said she's a gun owner who opposes a ban on assault-style rifles, though she does support raising the age of purchase for such guns to 21. She wouldn't be a \"typical Democrat\" in Congress, she said. \"I am humbled and honored by the vote of confidence the people of Southwest Washington have put in me and my campaign,\" Gluesenkamp Perez said in a statement. It's a notable pickup because the Cook Political Report had labeled the district as \"lean Republican.\" It's the first race in a \"lean\" column so far to be won by the other party. The 3rd District covers the southwest corner of Washington state, along the Oregon border. Material from The Associated Press was included in this report.",

Nevada was one of Republicans' top targets as they tried to break the Senate's 50-50 split, and Cortez Masto's reelection was a toss-up coming into the election. She was running neck and neck with Laxalt, Nevada's former attorney general who has been endorsed by former President Donald Trump. Cortez Masto served two terms as Nevada's attorney general before becoming the first Latina ever elected to the U.S. Senate in 2016. She campaigned on women's reproductive rights, criticizing Laxalt for calling the Roe v Wade decision \"a joke,\" the Nevada Independent reported, and categorizing a vote for her opponent as an \"automatic vote for a federal abortion ban.\" Laxalt tried to pull voters in by promising to combat inflation, which he attributed to poor decision-making by Cortez Masto and President Biden.

Laxalt responded to the letter over Twitter, saying he wasn't surprised that some Democratic members of his family are supporting another Democrat, despite living out of state.

Follow live updates and election results here. This is why it's always important to remember never to assume you know exactly what's going to happen in an election \u2014 and to keep an open mind for potential surprises. We've been saying for months these elections were expected to be close, that many of these elections would take a while to be decided, asked whether things had settled into a typical midterm, where the president's party would suffer major losses, and said to not believe anyone who told you they knew exactly what would happen. There's still a lot we don't know, but one thing we do know is that Republicans did not have the night they were hoping for. Based on what we do know in the wee hours, let's dig in with six takeaways: Control of both the House and Senate are still not yet known, as of 5 a.m. ET. Senate races in the key states of Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin are still not called, though incumbent Republican Ron Johnson in Wisconsin led with 98% of votes in. Democrat John Fetterman won in Pennsylvania, which was seen as a crucial state for Democrats to be able to retain control. It is likely their one flip of the evening, as Wisconsin looks less likely. That means Republicans now need a net gain of two pickups to gain control. So far, they have gotten none. They were expecting to win up to 52 seats, and that now appears unlikely. Nevada and Georgia are close, but the Republican was  ahead in Nevada and the Democrat was ahead in Georgia. Arizona only had about 58% of votes in, and Democrat Mark Kelly was ahead at that point. In Georgia, Democrat Raphael Warnock was narrowly ahead, but not quite above the 50% threshold needed for an outright victory. So, let's say if Democrats hold on in Arizona, but lose in Nevada, then Georgia will decide control of the Senate in a runoff in about a month, Dec. 6. Wow. The House still looks like it's headed for GOP hands, but not by a huge margin. While votes continue to be tallied, Republicans will make fewer gains than they had hoped for to claim a red wave. Their gains will likely be anywhere from the single digits up to a dozen seats, which is on the low end of forecasters' projections. It's also far below the average for a president's first midterm. And it would mean a very narrow governing majority for Republicans. Since World War II, the party out of power has picked up a net of 28 seats, and 43 seats when a president's approval rating was below 50%, as President Biden's is today. A Republican net gain of nine would be enough for a majority \u2014 they only needed five \u2014 but it will also make for lots of Republican hand-wringing. Republican House leader Kevin McCarthy spoke at almost 2 a.m. ET and tried to set the narrative. \"It is clear that we are going to take the House back,\" McCarthy said. He pointed to diverse GOP candidates across the country and claimed that it was evidence of an expanding GOP tent. \"When you wake up tomorrow we will be in the majority \u2014 Nancy Pelosi will be in the minority,\" McCarthy added. Democrats would still be in control of the House until January when the next Congress is sworn in, but Republicans will be in charge in the new year and for at least the next two years. They'll be able to blunt Biden's agenda and not much will likely happen in Washington legislatively. And it's true that Republicans this year did put up a lot of diverse candidates relative to previous election cycles. More Republican women ran for the House and Senate this year than 2020, for example. But there are questions about the strength of McCarthy's potential bid to be speaker of the House. He lost out once before on being speaker because of messaging problems, and the exit polls showed McCarthy with a 27% favorable, 53% unfavorable rating. Does he get a renewed challenge as leader of the party in the House? Former President Donald Trump weighed in heavily in these elections, but even in this landscape, with inflation high, Republican House candidates underperformed (except perhaps in New York State, where Republicans might flip four seats, including Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairperson Sean Patrick Maloney's seat, which was too close to call at this writing). Overall, Democrats wound up narrowly winning with independents, according to the exit polls. Why? \"To me it's Donald Trump,\" Scott Jennings, a Republican who worked in the George W. Bush administration, told NPR in live coverage Tuesday night. We don't have all the results yet, but the underperformance in the House, and the lackluster performance of Trump-backed candidates in purple states, like celebrity TV doctor Mehmet Oz, who lost to Fetterman in Pennsylvania, and Herschel Walker, who is trailing in Georgia, could have a lot of Republicans, especially GOP professionals, wondering if continuing to be wedded to Trumpism is still what's best for them in purple states. That's especially true considering what happened in Florida. Gov. Ron DeSantis was announced the winner for reelection right when polls closed. Republicans have flirted with an alternative to Trump, and the name who continues to be on the tips of Republicans' lips is DeSantis. At a recent rally, Trump nicknamed DeSantis \"Ron DeSanctimonious\" while touting a lead in a hypothetical GOP primary poll. But Trump clearly sees DeSantis as a threat \u2014 and on Trump's mind. It might be why he is again suggesting he will announce for president soon to put a hold on the nomination as soon as possible. ... in other words, a state that used to be a swing state, but now seems firmly in the Republican hands. DeSantis won early, and shortly after that, so did Sen. Marco Rubio. Both won by impressive, double-digit margins. It wasn't even close. Let's be blunt: No Democrat has won an election to be Florida governor now in almost 30 years (since Lawton Chiles in 1994). And Democrats are shut out of statewide office. Think about that. This is a state Obama won twice and was decided by hanging chads in 2000 and has been thought of as a swing state for 20-plus years. But political maps, they are a-changin'. And as the sun has risen for Democrats in other parts of the Sun Belt states, in places like Georgia and Arizona, it may be setting for the party in the Sunshine State. Political maps aren't static \u2014 up until 1992, California had gone Republican in every presidential election dating back to 1968. There's going to be a conversation ahead of the 2024 presidential election among Democratic strategists and party officials about abandoning Florida \u2014 and its 29 electoral votes. It's such an expensive state \u2014 with multiple TV media markets \u2014 there will be questions about whether it's worth even playing there in a presidential election, when they could spend those millions in emerging states. Despite Democrats' decent night overall, they struggled again to energize Latino voters, who have been a key portion of their base. Exit polls showed Democrats won about 60% of Latinos overall, down from 65% in 2020, which was already considered a slip. But remember, Latino voters are not a monolith. Latinos of Cuban and Venezuelan descent have grown far more Republican-leaning, which is likely what helped DeSantis and Rubio to their big wins. Remarkably, they both won Miami-Dade County by double-digits. It's a place that used to be a Democratic stronghold. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the county by 29 points. It shifted more Republican in 2020 with Biden only winning it by 7, and that raised eyebrows about how Democrats were doing with this cross section of Latinos. In a year Biden won the presidential election, in 2020, Biden also struggled with Latinos in South Texas. Multiple counties shifted toward the GOP. In the Texas gubernatorial race, though, Democrat Beto O'Rourke in his loss to incumbent Republican Greg Abbott pulled in similar margins as Biden in two of the largest border counties \u2014 Hidalgo and Webb. In Arizona and Nevada, it was also unclear whether there was any discernible change. The exit polls had the margin for Latinos in Arizona down slightly for Democrat Mark Kelly from 2020, but up slightly for Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada, but those numbers could change as they are weighted to the final results. The book is still out on this, but it's safe to say that Republicans are making a genuine play for Latinos, they say, on the economy, crime and progressive policies. Black voters and younger voters appeared to turn out as similar shares of the electorate and margins as in past midterm elections. For months after the Dobbs decision that overturned Roe, it was clear there were cross currents in this election that could make it different than most midterm elections. And that appears to have turned out to be the case. Abortion popped as an issue in places like Pennsylvania and was slightly higher overall than had been seen in polling leading into Election Day. And a more concrete data point: There were four abortion-related measures on ballots in four states \u2014 and in all four they are in moving in the direction of support for abortion rights. Vermont, Michigan and California all approved legislation that adds the right to an abortion to their state constitutions. In Kentucky, a measure that would have amended its state constitution to say there was no right to an abortion was losing by 7 points.",

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: While election workers count ballots and candidates bite their nails, Democrats and Republicans are already looking at what this campaign has revealed about the American people and American democracy. Today on the program, we are talking with political consultants from both parties. Republican strategist Alice Stewart has worked on many presidential campaigns, including for Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee. It's good to have you back. ALICE STEWART: Hi, Ari. It's great to talk with you on such an important day. SHAPIRO: How confident are you feeling about the outcome tonight? Do you think Republicans are going to take back one or both houses of Congress? STEWART: Ari, looking at what we're seeing in the polls and talking with people across the country, it appears that there is tremendous enthusiasm with Republican voters. And I do anticipate that that could equate to Republicans taking over the House and a strong likelihood in the Senate. It's going to be a close one, but there's a lot of enthusiasm with Republican voters and more importantly, Ari, the independent voters and a lot of undecided voters. And they are driven in large part on economic issues. You know, we're fortunate that we've already seen some early exit polling data that has come out. And what we're seeing is the big issues that motivate voters are inflation. SHAPIRO: Yeah. STEWART: And, you know, the state of the economy is not great. And it's tending people to gravitate towards Republican because they want change. SHAPIRO: As you look back at the way this campaign has gone over the last few months, is there anything you wish your party had done differently, anything that you think the GOP could have done better? STEWART: Sure. I think the Republicans are right on the policies and the issues, and they've done a tremendous job focusing on economy, inflation and crime. But certain races across the country - there have been valid and legitimate questions about candidate quality. And these are the candidates that were really hand-picked by former President Trump. They are election deniers. They question the integrity of our elections, some even supporting the actions on January 6, which I think were atrocious. And those issues turn off a lot of voters. So we're seeing some candidates - Blake Masters in Arizona being one, Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania and others - that are election deniers that are struggling in races that Republicans could have been in a much better position had they nominated more moderate candidates. SHAPIRO: There are also a number of election deniers who seem likely to win their races. And in another part of the program, we spoke with Democratic strategist Joel Payne, who is concerned about the number of candidates who continue to reject the outcome of legitimate elections. Are you worried about whether American democracy can hold up under that kind of assault? STEWART: I'm confident in our election process. I've always had confidence in the election process, and I think the best thing we can do is restore confidence in the American people with that. I was deputy secretary of state in Arkansas. We ran elections. And I'm confident there are enough checks and balances in place in statewide elections that will prevent anyone from putting their finger on the scale and really having an impact on elections. SHAPIRO: If Republicans do win control of either or both houses of Congress, tell us one thing that you would really like to see the party prioritize when they take power. STEWART: Clearly, getting a handle on inflation. And what we've seen with Republican leadership - Kevin McCarthy and his commitment to America has vowed to really look at ways that we can, you know, reduce inflation and certainly also address crime and work to secure the border. And he has policies in place with a commitment to America in terms of reducing government spending, putting an end to wasteful spending, putting in pro-growth tax policies which he thinks will help. SHAPIRO: That is Republican strategist Alice Stewart. Thank you very much for speaking with us. STEWART: Thanks, Ari. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "With the possibility of a divided government and the 2024 election looming, how will the president and Congress govern? What, if anything, can they accomplish in the next two years?  ELISSA NADWORNY, HOST: It's Election Day, and it's a close one in a lot of places. So it will be a while before we know exactly how all the races turn out. But we do know that historically, the party out of power gains seats in midterm elections. And given how narrow the majorities are in the House and Senate, Republicans could regain control of at least one chamber. So what might that mean for President Biden and his agenda? Let's talk about that with Asma Khalid and Deirdre Walsh, who cover the White House and Congress, respectively. Welcome to you both. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Good to be here. DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Hey, there. NADWORNY: Deirdre, let's start with you. What would a GOP-led House agenda look like? WALSH: Well, the president's agenda would essentially be shut down. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has already said the first item on a House GOP agenda, if he's elected speaker, would be rolling back a signature Biden bill, the Inflation Reduction Act. McCarthy points to the cuts that he wants in that bill that would hire more IRS agents. Negotiations over spending bills would be really difficult. Republicans want to slash federal spending and force cuts in some programs in return for raising the nation's borrowing limit. Any kind of standoff over that could threaten a default unless Congress decides to raise the debt limit by the end of this year before any change in control. There are also questions about continued aid to Ukraine. Many GOP candidates on the ballot oppose it, and McCarthy has signaled a major focus of a Republican House would be on investigations of the Biden administration on things like the withdrawal from Afghanistan, the border and origins of COVID. KHALID: You know, if I can chime in here - I mean, all of these investigations will certainly put the White House on defense. As Deirdre mentioned, President Biden's legislative agenda will essentially come to a screeching halt, meaning you won't see new bills beyond, say, passing a budget to fund the government. But look, I will say, you know, the White House has known that this is a possibility. Biden himself joked - I was out with him the other day on the campaign trail - that Republicans, he says, want to impeach him. But, you know, one thing I want to mention - Deirdre said that the man who's expected to take over as leader in the House wants to repeal aspects of the Inflation Reduction Act, and Republicans will try that. But the president himself said - President Biden - that ultimately still, he has the power of the veto, and he intends to use it. NADWORNY: So how is Biden going to try and adjust his agenda to this potential new reality? KHALID: He's going to likely focus more on executive actions and foreign policy, and that is something that predecessors in similar positions have done. I will say that, you know, if Republicans take control of the House, it does establish for President Biden, I think, ahead of the 2024 election, a clearer contrast for him. You know, he hasn't had that these past couple of months given the fact that Democrats control Congress. He has not had a clear foil. And this is something I heard from Faiz Shakir. He's a Democratic advisor on the left. He said that potential House GOP majority actually makes it easier for the president to talk about what Democrats want to do. FAIZ SHAKIR: His conversation with the American public gets a lot easier, you know, in some ways. Politically, you could say, this is what I want to do. This is the agenda I want to pass, and I got Republicans here in the House standing in my way. NADWORNY: Deirdre, is there some risk for Republicans here if there's no legislative agenda and they just focus on investigations? WALSH: There definitely is. As Asma noted, you know, the president still has a veto pen. And a lot of the things that House Republicans could pass through a Republican House could not potentially get through a Republican Senate because it's unlikely, even if the Republicans gain the Senate and the House, they wouldn't have 60 votes in the Senate. So, you know, a lot of - there's just a lot of turnover of members of Congress. A lot of the members of Congress who are serving now weren't around the last time there was divided government with GOP leaders on the Hill and a Democratic president. So some of these new members who've been there for a couple of years and candidates are talking about bold changes that they want to pass through the House, like cuts to Social Security and Medicare. Those things have bipartisan support. They won't go anywhere in the Senate. And that could backfire on Republicans. KHALID: And a couple of people that I spoke with said that House Republicans could very easily overstep here. You know, it's one thing to do a House investigation on the Afghanistan withdrawal. It is an entirely other thing to do an investigation into Hunter Biden. And one of the dangers, I would say, that I've heard from analysts is that Republicans could potentially overread these election results as some sort of mandate. I spoke with Brendan Buck. He's a former spokesman for Republican House Speakers Paul Ryan and John Boehner. And he told me if Republicans have learned a lesson from the 2010 midterms, it's to interpret these results very carefully. BRENDAN BUCK: If Republicans find themselves thinking that it was all about them, they're at risk of seeing some backlash themselves, and that's what we saw in 2010 into 2012. KHALID: And Elissa, what he means by this is that, you know, it's - it's something, I should say, I also heard from other analysts - is that what happens in these midterm elections tonight is not necessarily an indication of what could happen in two years in a general election. They point to the fact that in 2010, Democrats lost 63 seats in the House. Two years later, Barack Obama won reelection. NADWORNY: Yeah. So could mean a lot of things. We'll keep watch all night. That's NPR White House correspondent Asma Khalid and congressional correspondent Deirdre Walsh. Thanks to you both. KHALID: My pleasure. WALSH: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

On a recent evening, a crowd was getting riled up during a debate between two candidates vying to represent Washington's 3rd Congressional District. The debate, hosted by nearby Oregon Public Broadcasting on the campus of Lower Columbia College in Longview, Wash. saw audience outbursts towards the candidates, the moderator and each other. \"No they didn't!\" \"Fact check! Pinocchio!\" \"Shush up!\" That's a small sample of what was heard from members of the audience during a gathering that lasted more than an hour. They were there to see political newcomer, Republican Joe Kent, face off against local business owner, Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez. Their district covers the southwest corner of the state along the Oregon border. The candidates sparred over reports of Kent's ties to white nationalist groups, among other controversial issues. Republican Joe Kent, left, and Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez wait before taking the stage for a debate in the race for the 3rd Congressional District, Tuesday, Sept. 27, 2022, in Vancouver, Wash.

Kent and Perez are battling for the newly open in seat in the southwest corner of the state after incumbent Republican Jaime Herrera Buetler was ousted in the primary. This year, Kent ousted Congresswoman Jamie Herrera Beutler, one of ten House Republicans who voted for former President Trump's impeachment. Like others on that list, she drew Trump's ire. Kent had earned Trump's endorsement, and running on a MAGA-style \"America First\" platform. He's also aligned himself with some of the more extreme House GOP members, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Paul Gosar of Arizona. The race has highlighted the GOP's tenuous and complicated relationship to popular candidates with controversial ties whose contentious races could help drive turnout. \"He wants to reestablish a white majority,\" Gluesenkamp Perez charged during one of the debate's most heated discussions over abortion. \"That's not true whatsoever. ...No, that's not true,\" Kent responded. \"She's calling me a racist and misrepresenting what I've said.\" A couple days after the debate, during a visit to a D\u00eda de los Muertos event at a Vancouver, Wa. church, Gluesenkamp Perez said she was worried about violence spilling out during the heated exchanges. \"The last debate, really at a couple of points, looked like audience members might come to blows,\" said Gluesenkamp Perez. \"It is boiling under the surface and I'm very concerned that we are entirely too sanguine about, frankly, Democratic collapse.\" Joe Kent, center, a Trump-endorsed Republican who is challenging Herrera Beutler, speaks during a \"Justice For J6\" rally near the U.S. Capitol in Washington, on Sept. 18, 2021, in support of people who took part in the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n                \n                    \n                    Nathan Howard/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Joe Kent, center, a Trump-endorsed Republican who is challenging Herrera Beutler, speaks during a \"Justice For J6\" rally near the U.S. Capitol in Washington, on Sept. 18, 2021, in support of people who took part in the Jan. 6 insurrection. Kent draws controversy, passionate support In an interview with NPR, Kent downplayed the worries, saying he saw many families in the audience. \"The crowd looked pretty tame,\" Kent said from a Mediterranean restaurant in Battle Ground, Wa. the next day. \"They were raucous, both sides were, but... they're not going to get in a fist fight.\" He also rejected reports on his ties to extremists by multiple media outlets, including the Associated Press, CNN and the New York Times. He's also faced questions about his more recent employment, including questions raised by one of his former campaign staffers. \"Absolute garbage journalism,\" Kent says, referring to one of the first articles reporting on the connections. Other stories that followed, \"that's the anatomy of a hit.\" Kent moved to Washington's 3rd Congressional District from Oregon in 2020. An ex-Green Beret who worked for the CIA, Kent entered politics after his wife Shannon Kent, a Navy linguist, was killed in a 2019 attack in Syria. That's when he met President Trump as he joined other families at Dover Air Force Base to receive the remains of the fallen. \"I mean he was very gracious. I mean, I think he was I think was really gracious of him to come and meet with all the families of the fallen personally,\" Kent said. He said the two talked foreign policy one-on-one for 10 to 15 minutes. \"I took the opportunity to just tell him that, 'hey, you're getting the foreign policy piece right like as far as getting us out of the Middle East... But you're being thwarted on all your goals,\" he said, arguing, \"because people deeply entrenched Washington, D.C., they want to stay in the Middle East.\" Soon after the father of two returned home to Oregon, he heard from the administration about potential jobs in a second Trump term. Kent said he met with White House Senior Advisor and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and other officials to discuss possibilities. However, once those second term plans fell through, Kent weighed a political future for himself in the Pacific Northwest. Kent, who is running on a Trump-style \"America First\" platform, has faced his own limits on running to Herrera Beutler's right. A far-right live streamer, Nick Fuentes, took aim at Kent. \"Some of the fiercest attacks I've had came from Nick Fuentes and those guys,\" he said. \"They spent money against me. They launched this whole website that I was some sort of a deep state operative. They sent people to heckle multiple town halls.\" Fuentes has rejected some of Kent's claims, and said the two tried to work together earlier in his campaign. Heated rhetoric impacting the race's tenor Gluesenkamp Perez, a mom who has worked in public service, says it has been challenging to break through the controversies that have taken up much of Washington's Third congressional race. She's facing a red district, trying to break through to voters with her rural background and ties to a fifth-generation Washington state family. One of her key goals is to draw out voters left abandoned after Herrera Beutler was ousted. \"I'm running this race on my own terms. I'm not here to be a cheerleader for any political party,\" she told NPR. \"I'm here to pay attention to what actually matters to small business owners, to people working in the trades, to people trying to find daycare. You know, working moms like me, that that just need real representation.\" Back at the candidate debate, voter Jeff Woll gets emotional when he explains why he's voting for Kent, saying America is falling behind other countries and his district needs someone with military experience to lead it. \"Joe Kent has, I mean, he's as honest as the day is long, and that's why we're supporting him,\" Woll says, with tears welling up in his eyes. \"It's a serious time.\" At the D\u00eda de Los Muertos event in Vancouver, voter Karen Morrison also gets emotional when she explains why she's voting for Marie Gluesenkamp Perez. As a Black woman, she said she's worried about Kent's extremist ties. \"I want a peaceful life like everyone else. I want to be able to have my family come here and feel safe and significant in this community,\" Morrison said. \"But with that rhetoric going on, I no longer feel safe.\"",

Prigozhin, an entrepreneur known as \"Putin's chef\" because of his catering contracts with the Kremlin, has admitted he interfered in U.S. elections and says he will continue to do so. Kremlin-connected entrepreneur Yevgeny Prigozhin admitted Monday that he had interfered in U.S. elections and would continue to do so \u2014 confirming for the first time the accusations that he has rejected for years. \"Gentlemen, we have interfered, are interfering and will interfere. Carefully, precisely, surgically and in our own way, as we know how to do,\" Prigozhin boasted in remarks posted on social media. The statement, from the press service of his catering company that earned him the nickname \"Putin's chef,\" came on the eve of the U.S. midterm elections. It was the second major admission in recent months by the 61-year-old businessman, who has ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Prigozhin has previously sought to keep his activities under the radar and now appears increasingly interested in gaining political clout \u2014 although his goal in doing so was not immediately clear. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday that Prigozhin's comments \"do not tell us anything new or surprising.\" \"It's well known and well documented in the public domain that entities associated with Yevgeny Prigozhin have sought to influence elections around the world, including the United States. The U.S. has worked to expose and counter Russia's malign influence efforts as we discover them,\" she said, noting that Yevgeny has been sanctioned by the United States, the U.K. and the European Union. \"Part of Russia's efforts includes promoting narratives aimed at undermining democracy and sowing division and discord. It's not surprising that Russia would be highlighting their attempted efforts and fabricating a story about their successes on the eve of an election,\" she added. In September, Prigozhin also publicly stated that he was behind the Wagner Group mercenary force \u2014 something he also had previously denied \u2014 and talked openly about its involvement in Russia's 8-month-old war in Ukraine. The military contractor also has sent its forces to places like Syria and sub-Saharan Africa. Video also has emerged recently of a man resembling Prigozhin visiting Russian penal colonies to recruit prisoners to fight in Ukraine. In 2018, Prigozhin and a dozen other Russian nationals and three Russian companies were charged in the U.S. with operating a covert social media campaign aimed at fomenting discord and dividing American public opinion ahead of the 2016 presidential election won by Republican Donald Trump. They were indicted as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference. The Justice Department in 2020 moved to dismiss charges against two of the indicted firms, Concord Management and Consulting LLC and Concord Catering, saying they had concluded that a trial against a corporate defendant with no presence in the U.S. and no prospect of meaningful punishment even if convicted would likely expose sensitive law enforcement tools and techniques. In July, the State Department offered a reward of up to $10 million for information about Russian interference in U.S. elections, including on Prigozhin and the Internet Research Agency, the troll farm in St. Petersburg that his companies were accused of funding. Prigozhin also has been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department for election interference. Until now, Prigozhin had denied Russian involvement in election interference.Russian media, prisoner's rights groups and relatives of prisoners this year reported an extensive effort by Wagner \u2014 and sometimes Prigozhin personally \u2014 to recruit convicts to fight in Ukraine. Prigozhin hasn't directly confirmed it, but said in one statement that \"either (the Wagner private military company) and convicts, or your children\" will be fighting on the front lines. Last week, Wagner opened a business center in St. Petersburg, which Prigozhin has described as a platform for \"increasing the defense capabilities\" of Russia.On Sunday, he also announced through Concord the creation of training centers for militias in Russia's Belgorod and Kursk regions that border Ukraine. \"A local resident, like no one else, knows his territories, is able to fight against sabotage and reconnaissance groups and take the first blow if necessary,\" he said. A one-time hot dog stand owner, Prigozhin opened a swanky restaurant in St. Petersburg that drew interest from Putin. During his first term in office, Putin took then-French President Jacques Chirac to dine at one of Prigozhin's restaurants. \"Vladimir Putin saw how I built a business out of a kiosk, he saw that I don't mind serving to the esteemed guests because they were my guests,\" Prigozhin recalled in an interview published in 2011. His businesses expanded significantly. In 2010, Putin attended the opening of Prigozhin's factory making school lunches that was built on generous loans by a state bank. In Moscow alone, his company Concord won millions of dollars in contracts to provide meals at public schools. Prigozhin has also organized catering for Kremlin events for several years and has provided catering and utility services to the Russian military. When fighting broke out in eastern Ukraine between Russian-backed separatists and Kyiv's forces in 2014, Prigozhin said through his spokespeople that he was seeking to \"put together a group (of fighters) that would go (there) and defend the Russians.\" Russian laws prohibit the operation of private military contractors, but state media in recent months have openly reported on Wagner's involvement in Ukraine.",

Kevin McCarthy of California would be the likely next speaker. Republicans are heavily favored to take back control of the House, likely breaking Democrats of full control in Washington. That's largely because of the difficult national landscape for the party in power and that many swing districts are in right-leaning places. Republicans need a net pickup of five seats to take control. And after redistricting, there are already seven Democratic-held seats where Republicans are favored, noted as either Likely Republican or Solid Republican, according to the Cook Political Report. Below are several of the key bellwether districts to watch on election night on Nov. 8 that might tell us how big (or small) a GOP wave might be (organized by poll-closing time): IN-1 (D-Mrvan) Toss Up: After redistricting, incumbent Frank Mrvan (D) is in a district that became more Republican, but would have gone for Joe Biden by 3 points in 2020. His challenger is Jennifer-Ruth Green, an Air Force veteran who would be the only Black Republican woman in Congress, if elected. This is a race that may be a toss up, but one that Democrats would likely have to win to hold the House or keep Republicans' margins down. VA-2 (D-Luria) Toss Up: Incumbent Elaine Luria (D), who is on the Jan. 6 committee, has made democracy part of her campaign. She's used to tough races, and she's got another one on her hands against state Sen. Jennifer Kiggans (R). The district has changed hands four times since 2000, and Republicans have won eight of the last 11 elections here. Kiggans has aligned herself with Republican Gov. Glenn Younkin, who cut an ad for her, campaigning on cutting inflation, prioritizing border security, getting \"wokeism\" out of education and pushing back \"against Democrats' efforts to defund or abolish our police departments.\" A Kiggans win would certainly indicate quite the change for the district \u2014 and for House priorities. VA-7 (D-Spanberger) Toss Up: Incumbent Abigail Spanberger (D) has outraised and outspent challenger Yesli Vega (R), though this remains a close and crucial election. Redistricting shifted this district bluer \u2014 Biden would have won the new district by about 7 points. Republicans represented the district from 1971 until 2018 when Spanberger defeated then-incumbent David Brat (R), who had upset then-Republican House leader Eric Cantor in a 2014 primary. Spanberger has highlighted her bipartisan record and hammered Vega for her hardline stance on abortion. Vega, a law enforcement officer, has centered her campaign on cost of living and public safety. She also makes an appeal mixing Spanish and English in this district where about one-in-five voters is Latino. NC-13 (Newly Created) Toss Up: State Sen. Wiley Nickel (D) is running against Republican Bo Hines, a 27-year-old former college football player. Hines has the backing of Donald Trump and is a self-described \"MAGA Warrior,\" but Nickel, who is a criminal defense attorney, has criticized Hines for his lack of qualification. Nickel is pushing for support from independents and moderate Republicans who disagree with Hines on issues like abortion, which Hines described as genocide. OH-1 (R-Chabot) Toss Up: Republican incumbent Steve Chabot is facing a tough challenge from Democrat Greg Landsman, a member of the Cincinnati City Council. The district favored Trump over Biden by 3 points. Chabot, a longtime House member, stands firmly behind Trump, fundraising off of the FBI raid at Mar-a-Lago and opposing both impeachments. His voting record, though, shows more moderate stances, as he broke ranks with most Republicans to support the CHIPS and Science Act and the bipartisan gun reform bill. Democrats have hit Chabot in ads as \"obsessed with banning abortion.\" Republicans are focusing on crime against Landsman. OH-9 (D-Kaptur) Lean Democrat: This district was made more Republican and opened up Democratic incumbent Rep. Marcy Kaptur to a challenge from Republican Air Force veteran J.R. Majewski. Kaptur is the longest-serving woman in House history, and if reelected, will become the longest-serving woman ever in Congress. Kaptur didn't back down and retire, and she's been a tough out for Majewski, who aligns wholeheartedly with Trump, painting his front lawn in the image of a giant Trump lawn sign and was at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 but says he left before the riot. Majewski has also come under fire for embellishing his military service. The House GOP campaign arm cut plans for a nearly $1 million ad buy in the district, so if Kaptur struggles, it could be a very long night for Democrats. OH-13 (D-Open) Toss Up: In this newly created seat, state Rep. Emilia Sykes (D), former state House minority leader, faces former Trump campaign staffer Madison Gessioto Gilbert (R). The redrawn district would have gone for Biden by about 3 points in 2020. Gilbert was a conservative commentator, then served on Trump's 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns and as an advisor to the National Diversity Coalition for Trump. This race has drawn lots of attention from outside groups who see this race as a key to House control. Democrats have hit Gilbert for his views on abortion, while Republicans have painted Sykes as soft on crime. IL-17 (D-Open) Toss Up: This race couldn't be more of a contrast. The race features Democrat Eric Sorensen, an openly gay former local TV meteorologist who believes in \"more science and less politics,\" against Republican Esther Joy King. King, an Army JAG corps veteran, was the GOP nominee for this seat in 2020. She describes herself as \"unapologetically pro-life\" and endorsed the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision. She's also made inflation and energy core campaign issues. This district politically leans slightly toward Democrats, so if King pulls off the win, it could be an indication of things going Republicans' way. ME-2 (D-Golden) Toss Up: Messing with lobstah in Maine can really ... pinch. It all came to a ... boil ... when Republican Bruce Poliquin hit Democratic incumbent Jared Golden during a debate for not returning a campaign donation from the head of a group that warned against buying Maine lobsters because of their supposed danger to whales. Golden says the money will go toward the defense of Maine's fishing industry. So it goes in politics Down East. The matchup between Golden and Poliquin is now being run for a third straight time. Golden is a rare species \u2014 not crustacean, but a Democrat in a district Trump won twice. NH-1 (D-Pappas) Toss Up: Incumbent Democrat Chris Pappas is facing Karoline Leavitt (R), a conservative Gen Z candidate who served in the Trump administration. Pappas leads Leavitt in fundraising, but the two remain neck and neck. During the primary, establishment Republicans supported Leavitt's opponent, but since her win, Republican House leaders have donated to her campaign. PA-7 (D-Wild) Toss Up: Incumbent Susan Wild (D) is in a rematch with Lisa Scheller (R). This district has shifted redder with 2020 redistricting, so Scheller is hoping the second time is the charm. Wild has focused on health care, childcare, Scheller's record on abortion and has attacked her for outsourcing jobs as a businesswoman. Scheller has focused on Democratic spending and wants to \"open up Pennsylvania's energy resources.\" Scheller has avoided commenting on whether she supports controversial GOP gubernatorial nominee Doug Mastriano. PA-17 (D-Open) Toss Up: Democrat Chris Deluzio and Jeremy Shaffer (R) are in a tight race for this seat vacated by incumbent Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb. The race is seen as a barometer for working-class voters. Deluzio, a moderate Democrat, has made bipartisanship a centerpiece of his campaign. This race has drawn lots of attention from outside groups, who have spent $12 million in this suburban Pittsburgh district that would have gone for Biden 6 points after redistricting. So it's one Democrats, in theory, should hold onto. If they don't, it could be a long night for the party in power. RI-2 (D-Open) Toss Up: This should have been a seat Democrats have no problem holding onto. Redistricting made it even more Democratic. (Biden would have won it by 14 points.) But that's not how it's worked out, and Republican Allen Fung is threatening to bring a Republican back to New England and the first from Rhode Island in nearly three decades. Democrat Seth Magaziner has outraised and outspent Fung, but Fung's a known quantity statewide, as a a two-time (failed) gubernatorial candidate, but a popular former mayor of the state's second-largest city. He's campaigned as a \"voice of moderation\" in Congress. Fung focused on the economy, while Magaziner has emphasized a need to prevent Republican control of the House. CO-08 (R-Newly created) Toss Up: This district stretches north of Denver along I-25 up toward Fort Collins in a quickly growing \u2014 and heavily Latino \u2014 area. Biden would have won with just 51% of the vote. The two issues dominating in this campaign are abortion rights and energy. The Democrat in the race is state Rep. Yadira Caraveo, a pediatrician. Her opponent, state Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, is focusing on inflation, the budget, energy jobs and trying to paint painting Caraveo as aligned with progressive Democrats. IA-3 (D-Axne) Lean Republican: Both parties see this district as key to control of the House this November. Democrat Cindy Axne is defending this seat against Republican state Sen. Zach Nunn. Axne was swept in with the 2018 Democratic wave, and her losing in a 2022 GOP wave would be symbolic. She has tried to tout times when she's worked across the aisle, and Nunn has tried to highlight his military service. But the controversies and allegations in this race have taken center stage \u2014 from spying with a baby monitor, Chinese-owned company donations, allegations of insider trading, proxy voting on vacation and painting the other as extreme on abortion with both candidates exaggerating the other's position. The mud is flying far and fast, as both candidates hope enough sticks in this evenly split district. MI-3 (R-Open) Lean Democrat: Republican Rep. Peter Meijer voted for Trump's impeachment and was ousted in the primary by Trump-backed John Gibbs, who has cast doubt on the 2020 election result. Gibbs is much farther right than Meijer, pushing Trump's election lies, having said some very controversial things about women and spreading conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton. Democrats spent money in the primary saying Gibbs was \"too conservative\" for the district, which had the intended effect of helping him win the primary and giving Democrats a better shot in a general election. And they do. The district became more Democratic after redistricting, so if Democrat Hillary Scholten, who worked in the Obama Justice Department, doesn't win, it will likely signal a big night for Republicans \u2014 and there will be lots of finger-pointing. MI-7 (D-Newly created) Toss Up: This newly drawn district is about as evenly divided as it gets. It features Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin against Republican state Sen. Tom Barrett. Inflation and jobs are key issues in this swing district. Barrett has had tough time defending his votes against tax incentives for auto companies to build new factories, as well as his position on abortion. Republicans have tried to tag Slotkin as a tax-and-spend Democrat in their ads, and the race has gotten in the mud with Barrett accusing Slotkin of \"living with a lobbyist,\" when Slotkin \u2014 and her husband \u2014 have been renting from the person. MI-10 (Newly Created) Likely Republican: After redistricting, this is a newly formed district that would have gone for Trump by only a point. But John James is favored here. The margin could be indicative of where control of the House is headed or how big the wave becomes. NE-2 (R-Bacon) Toss Up: Republican Rep. Don Bacon is seeking a fourth term, after winning his last election by 4 points despite his district swinging for Biden. State Sen. Tony Vargas (D) has leaned into abortion and lowering prescription drug and medical care costs. CA-22 (R-Valadao) Toss Up: Democrats have been targeting this heavily Latino district for years, and it's one of their top targets again this year. David Valadao's seat became even more tilted toward Democrats after redistricting, going from one Biden won by 9 points in 2020 to one he would have won by 13. Valadao is stressing his crossover appeal and Democrats' candidate, state Rep. Rudy Salas, is hardly campaigning on far-left causes in this Central Valley district. He touts both helping get overtime for farmworkers and raising the minimum wage, but also being the only Democrat in the state Assembly to vote against a gas tax increase. CA-45 (R-Steel) Lean Republican: This is the kind of district Republicans likely need to hold to take a fairly sizable majority in the House. Biden won this mostly Asian American district narrowly with 52% of the vote, yet Michelle Steel is favored. The latest controversy here erupted with Steel, who is Korean American, sending mailers into a heavily Vietnamese neighborhood, accusing her opponent Jay Chen, who is Taiwanese American, of being a Communist sympathizer. It's not the first spat over identity \u2014 earlier in the campaign, Steel took offense to comments Chen made about Steel's accent.",

            "article_content": "Iowa Republican congressional candidate Zach Nunn speaks at an October campaign event outside Des Moines.\n                \n                    \n                    Danielle Kurtzleben/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Iowa Republican congressional candidate Zach Nunn speaks at an October campaign event outside Des Moines. West of Des Moines, at a recent rally for Republican House candidate Zach Nunn, Jack Wharton rattled off a list of his top voting issues. \"Just like everybody else, inflation is right up there\" \u2014 he held a flat hand up next to his head. \"Abortion is way down here, nonexistent\" \u2014 he dropped his hand toward his hip \u2014 \"I don't care about that.\" He finished by tacking on a few more issues he worries about: \"The border, the economy, the military.\" Wharton, a lifelong Republican, said he doesn't like his current representative, Democrat Cindy Axne, because she \"supports Biden's agenda.\" His is Iowa's 3rd District, which covers Des Moines and much of the state's southwestern quarter and includes Panora, a town of 1,100. Karen Riley Sievers went to a coffee shop there to see Axne the day after Nunn's rally. Her top issues? \"Women's choice for our reproductive [rights],\" she said. \"And beyond that, I think we have to stop and think that what we're really dealing with, bottom line, is democracy, and inflation will not make a bit of difference if you don't have the system that allows you to do the fair voting and to have your voice heard.\"  Neither Sievers' nor Wharton's top issues are remarkable \u2014 voters across the country, in a variety of races, are worried about all these things. But that very homogeneity is a sign of a trend. \"A nationalized politics is one in which the same kinds of issues are resonant nationwide,\" says Daniel Hopkins, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania, and the author of The Increasingly United States, a book about the nationalization of U.S. politics \u2014 the way that national-level political narratives end up trumping local- and state-level concerns. For example, topics that have often played large roles in local and regional politics in Iowa \u2014 agriculture, trade and education \u2014 rarely came up in conversations with voters, or in campaign speeches. Both parties see this district as potentially pivotal in winning the House, and the race will be hard-fought \u2014 the Cook Political Report currently lists it as \"Lean Republican.\" Close races at a time when Congress is closely divided can further prompt voters to think nationally, Hopkins says. \"You know, if you think back, at least one branch of Congress has been up for grabs or has actually changed hands in basically every election since 2000,\" he said. One sign of nationalization is when candidates symbolically invoke politicians from elsewhere. In a fiery early-October speech to the Iowa Democratic Hall of Fame, Axne invoked an Ohio congressman as a specter of the dangers of GOP rule. \"If we don't hold the House, folks, Jim Jordan becomes head of Judiciary, begins impeachment proceedings against the president, drags him through the mud for two years so we don't win the presidential election, and we lose it all,\" she said. Similarly, when asked at the Nunn event about the causes of inflation, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo brought a Massachusetts senator into campaigning for an Iowa House race. \"Don't let them kid you \u2014 this price increase doesn't belong to Vladimir Putin. It belongs to President Biden. It belongs to Senator [Elizabeth] Warren,\" he said. In a nationalized political ecosystem, each party has its own system of symbols and language. Even knowledgeable voters in Iowa may not know a lot of specifics about Warren or Jordan's politics, but they only need to know enough to know that Warren is unapologetically progressive, or that Jordan is pugilistic and conservative. Iowa Democratic Rep. Cindy Axne speaks with barista Ali Meineke at a campaign stop in Panora, Iowa.\n                \n                    \n                    Danielle Kurtzleben/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Iowa Democratic Rep. Cindy Axne speaks with barista Ali Meineke at a campaign stop in Panora, Iowa. Often the nationalization of politics is cast as bad for voters and democracy as a whole, for a number of reasons. One is that it flattens geographical representation, meaning regional issues like agriculture and economic development get less attention. Another is that it reduces the importance of candidate quality and qualifications, making party the most important factor; one basic measure of nationalization is the decline of split-ticket voting. That means elections become referenda on party leadership \u2014 for example, Donald Trump or Joe Biden or Nancy Pelosi. In fact, the relentless, vitriolic focus within the Republican Party on Pelosi as a villain is now receiving renewed scrutiny in light of the recent violent attack on her husband. All of these things can come together to feed into increasing partisan sorting and polarization. But it's not necessarily unreasonable for voters to latch onto national-level issues. Many Americans are understandably worried about democracy at a time when lies about who won the 2020 presidential election are widespread. Similarly, many do fear \u2014 or hope for \u2014 a federal abortion ban. All of which means that candidates have additional reason to feed into the cycle of nationalization. \"It's not that voters are rational or irrational; it's that our current highly nationalized political system has us in a groove where we focus on a set of symbolic, emotionally fraught, easily available and accessible issues that are prominent and resonant across the country,\" Hopkins said. Local issues haven't entirely disappeared \u2014 they're still one way to show constituents that you're doing your job. At that coffee shop in Panora, Axne highlighted how the recent infrastructure bill would benefit the region: \"We're getting $5 billion here in Iowa for infrastructure, and that money can be used for our bus system, our 'trolley system' as we call it for so many people in southwest Iowa, which is truly a lifeline for many of them.\" But then, at least one politician is defiantly, bluntly speaking out in favor of this nationalized environment. The next day, Nunn appeared at a Republican fundraising event where the star speaker was Arkansas Republican gubernatorial candidate Sarah Huckabee Sanders. And she was blunt about the benefits of thinking on a national scale: \"I hear that all the time around campaigning for governor in Arkansas \u2014 'She's nationalizing the race.' And my answer to those people is, you bet I am,\" Huckabee Sanders told the crowd. \"Because if you are not paying attention to what is happening in Washington, you are missing what is happening in this country.\" And if you're, say, a potential 2024 presidential candidate speaking in an early caucus state \u2014 like Iowa \u2014 nationalizing your race might make strategic sense.",

On a recent evening, Ryan Hampton stood in front of a crowd of people in Spokane, Wash., urging them to see drugs and addiction as a key issue in the midterm elections. \"We see these overdose numbers hitting new historic highs,\" Hampton said, referring to the 107,622 Americans who died after using illicit drugs last year. \"How many in this room are voters? If you're a voter, raise your hand,\" he said, drawing cheers and applause. \"Alright, good, good, good.\" Hampton is an activist who was himself addicted to opioids for years, surviving repeated overdoses. He's traveled the country in a big bus, holding rallies like that one, trying to put the drug crisis back in the political spotlight. Studies show tens of millions of Americans live with addiction and roughly 22 million people in this country are now in recovery. Hampton believes those people could make up a key voting bloc. But in an interview with NPR, he voiced concern that the debate over drug policy has tilted in a dangerous new direction, with increasingly partisan attack ads focusing on the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl. Many Republicans are talking about opioids not as a public health problem, but as symptom of what they describe as a crime and border crisis. That worries some drug policy experts. \"Some of the rhetoric that we're hearing is not helpful,\" Hampton said. \"It actually endangers us.\" Drug deaths have surged dramatically in recent years, and public health experts say these fatal overdoses have been fueled by the rapid spread of fentanyl and by social disruptions caused by the COVID pandemic. Fentanyl has emerged as one of the top killers of young Americans, hitting Black and Native Americans especially hard. Until recently, the public response to the opioid crisis has been remarkably bipartisan, de-emphasizing drug war-era strategies like police and prisons and focusing more on treatment and housing. But through the late summer and fall, Republicans in close campaigns began hitting Democrats hard on the drug issue, linking fentanyl deaths with rising crime and fears about border security. Republican Mehmet Oz has attacked Democrat John Fetterman in the Pennsylvania Senate race on the issue of drugs.\n                \n\n                    Screen capture from an Oz campaign ad\n                    \n\nhide caption \"John Fetterman supports decriminalizing dangerous drugs like fentanyl and heroin,\" declares one of Republican Mehmet Oz's attack ads in the Pennsylvania U.S. Senate race. \"Fetterman's ideas are radical, deadly and wrong.\" Some of the attacks reflect real policy differences. Oz has blasted Fetterman for the Democrat's support for creating supervised drug injection sites, an idea Oz opposes. Fetterman, by contrast, has called in the past for drug decriminalization, though he's backed away from that proposal during this campaign. He's also supported more medical services for people who actively use street drugs, arguing it could help reduce fatal overdoses. \"I think it's important that we as a society have all the options on the table,\" Fetterman said in a 2018 interview, \"including needle exchanges ... and even safe injection sites that are being considered like, say, in Philadelphia.\" This idea remains controversial in the U.S., but has been endorsed by a wide range of mainstream health care experts, including the American Society of Addiction Medicine. Other Republican attacks are completely divorced from the facts. In Ohio, Republican Senate candidate J.D. Vance echoed a right-wing conspiracy theory that Democrats are deliberately allowing Mexican drug cartels to smuggle fentanyl into the U.S. \"If you wanted to kill a bunch of MAGA voters in the middle of the heartland, how better than to target them and their kids with this deadly fentanyl ... and it does look intentional,\" Vance said in an April interview with the right-wing media outlet Gateway Pundit. In fact, efforts to target the drug cartels inside Mexico collapsed in 2020 during the final months of the Trump administration. Over the last two years the Biden administration has scrambled \u2014 without much success, according to most experts \u2014 to reduce the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. In one of the Ohio Senate debates this fall, Democrat Tim Ryan counter-punched Vance on the drug issue, arguing that by embracing a conspiracy theory, the Republican had aligned himself with an \"extremist movement.\" \"Who says that the president of the United States is intentionally trying to kill people with fentanyl?\" Ryan asked. Many addiction activists and public health experts say the drug response should focus on treatment, not arrests. Many Republican lawmakers disagree.\n                \n                    \n                    Brian Mann/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Many addiction activists and public health experts say the drug response should focus on treatment, not arrests. Many Republican lawmakers disagree. Still, Democrats clearly worry about looking soft on this issue. In a later Senate debate, Ryan echoed GOP ideas about stopping fentanyl traffickers with tougher border security. \"A stronger border, more border patrol, I disagree with President Biden when he's talking about relaxing some of the regulations down on the border,\" Ryan said. Some Democrats have also embraced a Republican proposal that fentanyl be officially designated a weapon of mass destruction, an idea the Biden administration has rejected. Jessica Taylor, who analyzes Senate races for the Cook Political Report, thinks public fear over fentanyl may give the GOP an advantage. She noted that polls seem to have shifted toward Republican candidates after the GOP began focusing on drugs, crime and the border. \"It's certainly a rising issue and I think it's one Republicans believe they have an advantage on and that may well bear out,\" said Taylor, who added that fears about security and drugs could eclipse voter concerns about more Democrat-friendly issues like abortion. \"I think this is really aimed at sort of getting back wayward suburban voters the [Republican] party saw eroding, particularly women,\" she said.

Cathy McMorris Rogers, left, during a stop in Spokane, Wash. Hampton, the addiction activist who's been traveling the country, worries the GOP's reframing of the drug debate will continue beyond the midterms. He said some state legislatures are already moving to toughen fentanyl laws, an approach that means more focus on police, arrests and lengthy prison sentences. \"When we start to weaponize one particular drug such as fentanyl, we also weaponize the response and militarize the response,\" he said. Hampton predicted a return to drug war-era policies would lead to more stigma for people living with opioid addiction, with less focus and money for treatment, housing and health care. \"We have seen this playbook before with crack cocaine and we saw the devastating results of that,\" he said.",

JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: America's opioid crisis has resurfaced as a political issue ahead of the midterm elections. Many Republicans are talking about opioids and fentanyl not as a public health problem but as a symptom of what they describe as a crime and border crisis. As NPR addiction correspondent Brian Mann reports, that worries some drug policy experts. BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: On an autumn evening, Ryan Hampton stands in front of a crowd in Spokane, Wash. RYAN HAMPTON: You see these overdose numbers hitting new historic highs. MANN: Hampton's an activist who was addicted to opioids for years. Now he's traveling the country in a big bus ahead of the midterm election, holding rallies, trying to put the drug crisis back in the spotlight of American politics. HAMPTON: How many in this room are a voter? If you're a voter, raise your hand. All right. Good, good, good. If you're not... MANN: Drug deaths have surged horribly in recent years, driven by the rapid spread of illicit fentanyl, the super powerful synthetic opioid. Despite the carnage, Hampton believes this public health emergency has been eclipsed. HAMPTON: COVID did step in front of the overdose crisis and the addiction crisis in this country. MANN: So barnstorming the country, Hampton's goal was to spread a hopeful message that this drug crisis is solvable. It's a health care issue, he says, one voters should care about and politicians should spend money to fix. But Hampton worries the debate over drugs is being reframed instead by fear and partisanship. HAMPTON: Some of the rhetoric that we're hearing is not helpful. It actually, you know, endangers us, maybe. MANN: A bit of history. In recent years, drug and addiction policy has been remarkably bipartisan. Both parties deemphasized drug war-era strategies like police and prisons, focusing more on things like treatment and housing. But now, Republicans are hitting Democrats with attack ads like this one. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: John Fetterman supports decriminalizing dangerous drugs like fentanyl and heroin. MANN: Mehmet Oz, the Republican in the Pennsylvania Senate race, is accusing Democrat John Fetterman of being weak on drugs and crime. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: And Fetterman supports creating heroin injection sites in our neighborhoods. MEHMET OZ: Fetterman's ideas are radical, deadly and wrong. MANN: There are some real policy differences here. Fetterman, the Democrat, has called for decriminalizing drugs, focusing instead on a health care response. So he's backed away from that position during this campaign. He's also supported supervised drug use sites. They're controversial, but some studies show they help reduce fatal overdoses. Here's Fetterman speaking on a podcast in 2018. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN FETTERMAN: I think it's important that we as a society have all the options on the table, including needle exchange and even safe injection sites that are being considered like, say, in Philadelphia. MANN: The real-world stakes in this drug policy debate are incredibly high. Fentanyl has emerged as one of the top killers of young Americans, far more deadly than COVID or guns. Black and Native Americans have also been hit hard. Jessica Taylor thinks the Republican reframing of addiction as a crime issue worsened by Democratic policies may prove effective. JESSICA TAYLOR: It's certainly a rising issue, and I think it's one that Republicans believe they have an advantage on. And that very well may bear out. MANN: Taylor analyzes Senate races for the Cook Political Report. She says by raising fears about drugs and crime, Republicans hope to eclipse voter concerns about more Democrat-friendly issues like abortion. TAYLOR: I think this is really aimed to sort of getting back wayward suburban voters that the party saw eroding, particularly women. MANN: Taylor says polls suggest this narrative has helped tilt some close races toward Republican candidates who've also linked the drug issue to border security. In Ohio, Republican Senate candidate J.D. Vance has echoed a right-wing conspiracy theory that Democrats are deliberately allowing Mexican drug cartels to smuggle fentanyl into the U.S. Here's an interview Vance gave in April to the right-wing outlet Gateway Pundit. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) J D VANCE: If you wanted to kill a bunch of MAGA voters in the middle of the heartland, how better than to target them and their kids with this deadly fentanyl? And, man, it does look intentional. MANN: This isn't factual. Efforts to target the drug cartels inside Mexico actually collapsed during the Trump administration. Over the last two years, the Biden administration has scrambled, most experts say without much success, to reduce the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. Still, Democrats clearly worry about looking soft on this issue. In a Senate debate last week, Ohio Democrat Tim Ryan echoed Republican ideas about stopping fentanyl traffickers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TIM RYAN: A stronger border, more Border Patrol. I disagree with President Biden when he's talking about... MANN: Some Democrats have also embraced a Republican proposal that fentanyl be officially designated a weapon of mass destruction, an idea the Biden administration has rejected. Ryan Hampton, the activist who's been traveling the country pushing for a health care response to addiction, worries the GOP's reframing of the drug debate will continue beyond the midterms. He thinks it's already driving a fentanyl crackdown, meaning more focus on prisons, less money for treatment. HAMPTON: When we start to weaponize one particular drug, such as fentanyl, we also weaponize the response and militarize the response. We have seen this playbook before with crack cocaine, and we saw the devastating results of that. MANN: But with overdoses surging and more people seeing family and friends die, some voters may welcome Republicans' promise to get tough on fentanyl. Brian Mann, NPR News.

Maggie Hassan seen on Oct. 11 and Don Bolduc, Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in New Hampshire, seen on Oct. 5.\n                \n                    \n                    Charles Krupa and Mary Schwalm/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan seen on Oct. 11 and Don Bolduc, Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in New Hampshire, seen on Oct. 5. New Hampshire is a must-win state for Democrats in their campaign to keep control of the Senate. Sen. Maggie Hassan narrowly won her last race in 2016 by 1,017 votes. Recent polls show her ahead in the contest against GOP nominee, Don Bolduc, a retired Army brigadier general. Yet, Hassan and her allies expect a tight race in the final two weeks. Hassan, who also served as governor before becoming a senator in 2017, expects the contest to go down to the wire in this purple state, where the current governor is a Republican but its congressional delegation is comprised of Democrats. Many voters across the political spectrum say rising costs \u2014 on home heating,  groceries, gas and housing \u2014 are a top issue. But access to abortion is animating the Democratic base and a sizable chunk of independents, over 40% of the state's electorate, who warn that flipping a blue seat red in the midterms could lead to a Republican-controlled Senate that decides to take up legislation to institute a federal abortion ban. Voters will be able to hear from the candidates this week in a debate hosted by local news outlets, including New Hampshire Public Radio. Bolduc is campaigning as an outsider, arguing if he's sent to Washington, he's not going to be a career politician. At a rally with supporters recently in Rochester, he homed in on a message that framed the race as a fight against President Biden as much as it is against Hassan. He spoke about what he's heard from small businesses still recovering from the pandemic, saying, \"they are making their way back and then, boom, down comes the hammer from the Biden-Hassan agenda, which skyrockets inflation.\" Bolduc won the GOP primary in September echoing former President Donald Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was rigged. The day after that primary win, he reversed himself and said Biden won. But since then, he has made conflicting public comments. Trying to pivot away from statements he made in a podcast associated with QAnon conspiracies, as reported by the New York Times, Bolduc told reporters in Rochester, N.H., \"I do not believe the election was stolen.\" He added about the reversal, \"the simple thing is I changed my mind and I have the freedom to do that.\" Bolduc's recent disavowals of his previous hardline stances, like proposing major cuts to Social Security and Medicare, aren't keeping more mainstream GOP figures from backing him. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a possible 2024 presidential candidate, endorsed Bolduc last week. Nikki Haley, former U.N. ambassador and another potential candidate for the GOP nomination in 2024, joined Bolduc for a rally in Rochester, her second time on the campaign trail for him. Haley also tied Hassan to Biden on issues like the cost of home heating and the  withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan, which Haley blasted as a failure. \"When you look at our foreign policy and the fact that America is weak, you can thank Maggie Hassan,\" Haley said. Another issue that Bolduc has shifted on is abortion. He's said he would \"always default for a system that protects lives from beginning to end.\" But on the campaign trail, he emphasizes that the issue should be left to the states to decide. Asked if that means he'd vote no on a federal abortion ban, Bolduc grew frustrated at the topic, telling NPR, \"Yes, I've said that. I don't know how many times I need to say it. I can put together a skit for you.\" Bolduc spoke briefly with NPR after a campaign event, but declined multiple requests for a longer interview. Meanwhile, Hassan is quick to point out Bolduc's earlier statements on abortion, saying this is one area that earns him the label of \"extreme.\" She said her supporters believe the issue of abortion is no less important than inflation. \"You know, as I started to talk with women about inflation, they all changed the subject to abortion.\" She added, \"for some people it is, you know, a concern about whether they're gonna be able to pay rent and put food on the table. But they also said to me, but if my fundamental rights are gone, that's much harder to get back.\" Women are on both sides of the abortion issue and its ultimate impact on the November election. Barbara Dunnington, a Bolduc supporter, said the economy is a bigger factor for her than abortion. \"I think obviously some people are going to put that at the top of their list, but if you can't pay your bills, if you can't buy food, if you can't hang on to a job with the stock market going up and down and we're going into a recession, as far as I'm concerned, abortion is not that crucial.\" But Kimberly Valcin, a first-time New Hampshire voter and Democrat who greeted Hassan at a campaign stop in Hanover, told NPR, \"Top of mind issues for me are things like women's rights.\" Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan spoke to Jarrett Berke, owner of Lou's Restaurant in Hanover, N.H.\n                \n                    \n                    Deirdre Walsh/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption In her pitch to voters and in an interview with NPR, Hassan pointed to her accomplishments \u2014 and the fact many bills she passed were bipartisan. \"I have a record delivering on a number of issues, doing it across party lines, and doing it the way Granite Staters expect me to.\" She spoke about the infrastructure bill delivering money to road and rail projects, as well as legislation boosting American manufacturing of semi-conductors that will help small businesses in the state and resolve supply chain issues that many complain are still hurting their bottom lines. Hassan also touted the bill Democrats passed without GOP support that includes tax cuts for energy efficient improvements and lowers prescription drug prices. Hassan made a point to put some distance between herself and Biden on the economy, saying, \"The administration was too slow to recognize the long term reality of inflation. And they took too long to react to it.\" She noted she was among those pressing the White House to tap additional oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a step announced last week. And with the election just two weeks away, first lady Jill Biden is planning to head to New Hampshire to campaign for Hassan, according to Hassan's campaign spokesman. Bolduc devoted much of his time at campaign stops arguing that Hassan is out of touch with the reality of rising costs. At a steel company in Greenland, Bolduc lumped Hassan in with \"career politicians\" and repeatedly described his opponent's Senate term using one word. GOP candidate Don Bolduc campaigns with former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley last week in Rochester, N.H.\n                \n                    \n                    Deirdre Walsh/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"She's failed. Six years of failure. Fail, fail, fail, fail, fail.\" He said he'd turn things around. \"I'll go to Washington, D.C., to be your United States senator and work on the real problems that Americans and Granite Staters are having right now.\" He said he wanted to \"reverse some of the things that they [Democrats] have done that have created all this inflation.\" Bolduc also criticized Democrats' record on border security, crime and education policies. He promised that if elected, he would work with members of Congress across party lines, and said that the first call he would make as senator would be to the state's other Democratic senator, Jeanne Shaheen, to try to address economic issues and secure the border. One steel company employee, Shelley Hanson, identified herself as a Democrat, but said she's still deciding which candidate to support. She voted for Biden in 2020 but is not a fan of the system in Washington. \"I think it needs to change course. I think the whole thing needs to be shaken up,\" she said. Both candidates and their allies are flooding the airwaves, fighting for the state's independent voters. In recent days, the Senate Leadership Fund, the super PAC with ties to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, withdrew resources it had earmarked for Bolduc in the final stretch of the campaign, a signal they believe Hassan is positioned to prevail. Still, Bolduc's spokeswoman, Kate Constantini, said in a statement that the Republican nominee has \"defied the naysayers from the beginning and that's the same approach he is going to take through the finish line to victory.\" Hassan warns that Bolduc is extreme on a range of issues, and says the resources already spent in the state \"can conceal an extremist from voters.\" One Hassan supporter, Jenn Alford-Teaster, says one thing is constant in the purple state. \"I don't think there will ever be a race in the history of New Hampshire that will never not be close.\" Republicans need to net just one seat to retake the majority on Nov. 8. A lot of attention is focused on contests in Georgia and Nevada, but the political fate of the Senate could also be decided in New Hampshire.",

U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported 2.3 million migrant apprehensions at the southern border in the last 12 months \u2014 surpassing the record high set last year. The annual total \u2014 which includes people who were stopped at the border more than once \u2014 jumped by 37% from 1.7 million the year before. That isn't to suggest 2022 saw the largest number of people trying to enter the U.S. illegally. For instance, the Department of Homeland Security estimates that there were nearly 4 million unauthorized border crossings in 2000 but only 1.6 million were counted. Over the years, immigration authorities have been able to track more migrants as a result of improved security technology. Still, the year-end tally is significant. The government data shows that a growing number of border-crossers are from Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua and fewer are coming from north Central America \u2014 signaling a new challenge for the Biden administration as the November midterm elections draw closer. Because of strained diplomatic ties and costs, the U.S. has also faced the dilemma of being unable to return migrants to Venezuela, Cuba or Nicaragua. \"The ability to send them back to those states are not rational. We're working with Mexico and other countries to stop the flow,\" President Biden said in a press conference last month. Nearly a quarter of all border encounters were with families, while 6% involved children whom were met by Border Patrol agents without parents or guardians. The largest share of encounters, nearly 70%, continued to be with single adults. The agency's 2022 fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30, was also the deadliest 12 months for border-crossers. More than 800 migrants died on the journey to try to enter the U.S. \u2014 drowning and heat exhaustion being among the top causes of death, according to Border Patrol figures. The Biden administration said it wants to discourage migrants from making the dangerous journey. Earlier this month, the Department of Homeland Security announced it will begin sending Venezuelan migrants who illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border to Mexico. The agency added that up to 24,000 Venezuelans will have a chance to live and work in the U.S. \u2014 if they can find a financial sponsor in the U.S. Many have reported difficulty in fulfilling that requirement.",

Far-right influencers in the U.S. have seized on Brazil's election as a way of keeping conspiratorial narratives alive ahead of the U.S. midterms in early November. Baseless claims that voting machines made by Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic are being used to rig voting in Brazil are circulating online and in far-right media in the U.S. \u2014 even though neither company's hardware or software is being used in the current election there. It's the latest example of how debunked election fraud narratives are going international. In many cases, the false claims about Brazil are being pushed in English to American audiences by right-wing influencers and conservative media sites who falsely assert that Donald Trump won the 2020 U.S. presidential election and appear to be planting the idea that similar fraud will occur in the upcoming midterms. The deceptive narratives feature two companies that were targeted by American conspiracists, who falsely claimed their voting software was used to flip votes from Trump to Joe Biden in 2020. Dominion and Smartmatic have filed multiple lawsuits against Trump supporters and right-wing media channels that advanced the falsehoods. But despite repeated debunkings, the companies' names have become shorthand for election fraud. \"It shows just how sticky these narratives are,\" said Lee Foster, senior vice president for analysis at Alethea Group, which helps companies detect and mitigate false and misleading claims. \"Once they gain traction in a particular place, like they did in the U.S. presidential election in 2020, people will start applying those [narratives] to other kinds of events and build out these broad conspiracy theories around them,\" he said. In the first round of Brazil's presidential election on Oct. 2, leftist former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva finished ahead of far-right incumbent President Jair Bolsonaro but failed to secure an outright majority. The two candidates are headed for a runoff on Oct. 30. Bolsonaro, who has spent months alleging Brazil's elections are rigged and saying electronic voting machines can't be trusted, performed better in the first round than polling had predicted. But that didn't stop the former president from suggesting the results may have been manipulated. \"There's always the possibility of something abnormal happening in a fully computerized system,\" Bolsonaro said after the vote, according to the New York Times. A woman walks past towels with the images of former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and incumbent Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on the street in Brasilia on Oct. 21.\n                \n                    \n                    Evaristo Sa/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A woman walks past towels with the images of former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and incumbent Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on the street in Brasilia on Oct. 21. Online, commenters seized on well-worn conspiracy theories to cast doubt on the results. Alethea Group identified multiple false claims that Smartmatic and Dominion machines were used in Brazil's election across mainstream social media sites including Twitter, Facebook and Reddit as well as alternative platforms popular on the right such as Truth Social and Gettr. Brazil's Superior Electoral Court, which oversees the nation's elections, first debunked falsehoods that Smartmatic machines or software were being used in the country in 2020, shortly after the U.S. election, and updated that fact check this month. Independent fact checkers in Brazil also investigated the claim and found it false. \"The Brazilian ballot boxes were designed by civil servants and technicians at the service of  of the Electoral Justice and are produced, under their direct coordination, by companies selected through public bidding and wide competition, which guarantees even more security and transparency to the electoral process,\" the court said. According to the court, Positivo Tecnologia, a Brazilian company, won the most recent bid to produce electronic voting machines for this year's election. Smartmatic and Dominion also confirmed their equipment is not being used in Brazil. But the voting machine claims resurged this month, both in WhatsApp messages in Brazil about Smartmatic and in English-language posts on U.S. social media sites claiming, incorrectly, that Dominion or Smartmatic machines were used in Brazil. Some pointed to Bolsonaro's early lead as the votes were counted, which Lula overtook as more results came in. \"The election showed similarities with the last US election, such as overtaking the leader by leaps and bounds,\" a Twitter account with more than 28,000 followers that describes itself as an independent international news agency posted on Oct 3. \"Dominion was also used here,\" the account falsely claimed. Many posters used the allegations to cast doubt on the U.S. midterm elections. \"Midterms are looking great,\" wrote one poster on pro-Trump message board Patriots.win. \"What do we do when the midterms are stolen?\" another replied. The claims are \"being used to seed that ground in terms of expectations of purported fraud occurring in the midterms,\" Alethea Group's Foster said. The iterative nature of the falsehoods underscores how conspiracy theories need to continually build on themselves to reinforce and validate their claims. \"It becomes this kind of self-feedback loop. It just continues to grow, almost like a snowball effect,\" Foster said. Former Trump White House senior adviser Stephen Bannon has invited guests onto his podcast who have spread debunked claims about Brazil's election.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former Trump White House senior adviser Stephen Bannon has invited guests onto his podcast who have spread debunked claims about Brazil's election. The vote-rigging narratives were amplified by the far-right U.S. blog The Gateway Pundit, which on the morning after the vote published an article alleging \"MASSIVE fraud\" in Brazil. That article and others from far-right websites cited claims by conservative activist Matthew Tyrmand that Smartmatic machines were used in Brazil. Tyrmand has repeatedly shared allegations of election fraud in Brazil, without evidence, to tens of thousands of followers on Twitter and Gettr, the social media site founded by former Trump aide Jason Miller. He also frequently appears as a guest on former Trump adviser Stephen Bannon's \"War Room\" podcast, where in recent weeks they've discussed the Brazilian election and drawn parallels with false claims of fraud in the U.S. in 2020. (Bannon was sentenced to four months in prison on Friday for refusing to comply with a subpoena request from the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters.) The day after Brazilians voted in the first round, Bannon described the election as \"a very stark warning to MAGA and to all the Republicans of the games that are being played in these elections.\" \"People are absolutely crying fraud in Brazil because it's the same thing we saw in 2020,\" Tyrmand said on the same episode, repeating false allegations that Smartmatic machines were used and echoing a frequent assertion from Bolsonaro that Brazil's electronic voting system is \"non-auditable.\" Bannon, who along with other Trump allies has developed close ties with Bolsonaro's family, has long pushed the idea of election fraud in Brazil. It fits with Bannon's \"larger worldview\" of a \"leftist conspiracy to steal the government from the right wing through illegitimate and fraudulent means\" in elections around the world, said Madeline Peltz, director of rapid response at the liberal group Media Matters for America. He's been calling for his audience to take over local Republican precincts and get involved as poll watchers and election workers. \"Diving into the Brazilian election to keep these election lies alive in the States is really a natural extension of the political projects that Bannon has going in the States right now,\" Peltz said. \"There's a sympathetic audience for it in Brazil, and there's certainly a sympathetic audience for it in the States,\" she added. \"The building of a coalition between those two groups is really a win-win for Steve Bannon and the right-wing movement broadly.\" Australian voters casting ballots inside Bondi Surf Bathers Life Saving Club on May 21 in Sydney.

The country's election officials had to aggressively combat lies about its electoral processes in the run-up to the vote. Brazil is not the only place where U.S.-centric hoaxes about voting machines have crossed borders. Ahead of Australia's federal election earlier this year, false rumors spread on social media that the country would use voting machines made by Dominion. Tom Rogers, Australia's electoral commissioner, said the claims lacked any basis in reality, given that Australians do not use electronic voting machines. \"I have the pleasure of being the CEO of one of the world's last great analog events, where people use paper and pencil to vote,\" he said. \"So if you're going to pick a conspiracy theory, you'd think you'd pick one that maybe had more traction.\" The Electoral Commission moved quickly to debunk the rumors, posting YouTube videos, replying to people on Twitter, and adding the claim to a running \"disinformation register\" on its website. Rogers credits that aggressive, rapid response with preventing the claims from gaining much ground. \"It's not that elections are necessarily globally doing anything worse than they always were,\" he said. \"It's the collapse in the reputation of those systems, as a result of misinformation, disinformation, conspiracy theories.\"",

Historically, South Texas has been a stronghold for Democrats in the state, but Republicans are banking on those ties not being as strong as they used to be. Jorge Martinez, an adviser and spokesperson for LIBRE Initiative Action, said for the past decade his team has been aiding political efforts in other parts of the state and the country. But recently, he explained, more resources have been focused at his base in McAllen, Texas. \"Now all eyes are on South Texas,\" Martinez said. \"Now we are the ones getting all the support here.\" Members of LIBRE canvassing Oct. 5 in a neighborhood in Mission, Texas, pose for a selfie.\n                \n                    \n                    Jason Garza for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption During a recent canvassing effort, Martinez and his team knocked on doors in a quiet suburban neighborhood in Mission, Texas, which sits right on the U.S.-Mexico border. Their goal was to get the word out about Monica De La Cruz, a Republican congressional candidate running for the newly competitive 15th Congressional District in South Texas against Democrat Michelle Vallejo. One of the potential voters they talked to was Fidel Villase\u00f1or, who said he did not know if he was going to vote for De La Cruz in the fall. He told Martinez, though, that the most important issue for him during this election is inflation.

Democrats opened a national field office in South Texas earlier this year and have been running radio ads in an effort to hold on to their support in key parts of the state. But Jens Manuel Krogstad, a senior writer and editor with the Pew Research Center focused on Latino views and attitudes, has found evidence in recent polling that compared to other voters, Latinos have pretty soft ties to political parties even when they favor one over the other. \"One point that really illustrates this is that roughly 1 in 10 Latino voters who identified as either a Democrat or Republican held political views that more closely aligned with the opposing party than their own party,\" he explained. This is why Latino voters are more like swing voters compared to the rest of the country. \"Latinos don't always neatly fit into the nation's two party system,\" Krogstad said. \"And the survey shows that Latinos in some ways are charting their own course.\" A mural at the LUPE office in San Juan, Texas.\n                \n                    \n                    Jason Garza for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The surveys he has looked at show that many Latinos do not see much of a difference between the parties. Artemio Muniz is chairman of the Federation of Hispanic Republicans in Texas. He thinks a large swath of Latino voters actually agree with conservatives on a lot of key issues. \"They tend to be more center-right,\" he said. Muniz says if Republicans do a good job of consistently talking to Latino voters about those issues, they would be able to \"take away voters from what is only a skin deep type connection\" to the Democratic Party. \"When the party doesn't do the work and they don't show up and they don't have the right messaging, the default is Hispanic voters tend to vote for Democrats,\" he explained.

Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston, has been polling Latino voters in Texas for years. He explained neither party has done a good job of engaging these communities and making them feel like their votes actually matter. \"Many in the Latino community are not getting the kind of contact from campaigns organizations or political parties or community organizations,\" he said. \"So, I think a lot of them feel lost. They feel a little bit adrift. So, they don't have a connection to these parties. And as a result, they don't feel swept up in these national trends that pit red versus blue.\" In South Texas, there are some community groups \u2014 namely a nonpartisan group called LUPE \u2014 that have been plugging away for years to get these voters engaged.

On a recent afternoon, Garcia and his team visited a neighborhood in San Juan, Texas, to let people know about the upcoming election.. Most of the potential voters they spoke to were unaware an election was soon approaching. Garcia says he has been surprised considering all the ads and attention in South Texas this election cycle. Members of LUPE canvass in a neighborhood in San Juan, Texas, on Oct. 4.\n                \n                    \n                    Jason Garza for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"We don't know why that is,\" he explained. \"They keep repeating it on TV and on the radio stations.\" \"But I mean a lot of these people have two, three jobs. They are not paying attention to elections. Their thing is getting money to sustain their families. So sometimes they don't see politics as a priority for their needs,\" Garcia said. This lack of time to engage or knowledge about current politics in the state is not a small obstacle for Republicans in Texas.

            "article_content": "Now that Hurricane Ian has moved on, Floridians are assessing damage. Moscow is officially annexing four Russian-occupied regions in Ukraine. Two ideological opposites aim to be Brazil's president.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Hurricane Ian is not done yet. After devastating parts of Florida, it is on track to hit South Carolina today, although it's far weaker than the storm that came ashore near Fort Myers Wednesday. LEILA FADEL, HOST: Yesterday, communities from Naples to St. Petersburg started to figure out just how much damage has been done. Insurance claims by homeowners and businesses are expected to be as high as 40 to $50 billion. MARTIN: NPR's Greg Allen visited some of the hardest-hit areas yesterday and joins us to talk about it. Hey, Greg. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: Where is the damage the worst? ALLEN: Well, Lee and Charlotte counties are the areas that were hit hardest by the storm. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis was there to survey the damage yesterday. He called it indescribable. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RON DESANTIS: To see a house just sitting in the middle of Estero Bay, literally must have gotten picked up, flown because of the massive wind speed and the storm surge. ALLEN: The worst areas are the barrier islands that took the brunt of the storm surge. On Fort Myers Beach, houses were just wiped away, leaving only slabs behind. Boats were tossed around and piled up in the marinas and on land by the storm surge. On Sanibel Island, several sections of the community's only causeway were washed away. That leaves residents there without power or water and cut off from the mainland. But despite that, DeSantis says some residents have declined offers by rescue crews on Sanibel to get them to safety. MARTIN: There were lots of people, though, who did need help, right? ALLEN: Right. DeSantis said at least 700 people were rescued from flooded homes. The number may be even higher. In Charlotte County, the NPR crew saw standing water as much as 6-foot deep in some communities. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: We got the boats. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Woo-hoo (ph). ALLEN: In North Port, that's the sound of a group of neighbors who were using small boats to ferry people, pets and possessions out of flooded homes. Craig Brown, his wife Kelly and son Jonas used their two kayaks to paddle themselves, their dog and their two cats to safety. Kelly Brown says when the Ian's storm surge hit, the neighborhood's canals flooded, bringing more than 3 foot of water into their home. KELLY BROWN: It got to be about this much in the house, and then all of a sudden, it really started rushing in. So then we had to get out. ALLEN: How did they get you out? BROWN: If you have family or somebody that has a kayak, or some people are getting themselves out. ALLEN: By the afternoon, a local crew had arrived to help people get to safety. But there are many stories like that and just so many thousands of homes that were flooded and damaged here. MARTIN: Yeah. I was checking in with a friend of mine in Naples, and she sent a text to me saying, quote, \"everything is a total loss.\" And these photos of her family's house, just destroyed, with all this flooding. I mean, and this story of personal loss and the ones you heard about thousands of times over, which is hard to absorb, but what about infrastructure, Greg? I imagine that's just been devastated, too. ALLEN: Well, you know, it's interesting. It could have been worse, is kind of a bit of the sense. Driving through the area yesterday, it was surprising how most roads were largely clear of debris. Traffic was flowing on Interstate 75, which is a major artery. There are those two bridges out, one to Sanibel and one to another island. The Fort Myers Beach pier was destroyed. A major problem in Fort Myers area is the rupture of a major water main. But power is coming back here slowly. Over 2 million customers are still without power. But 200,000 customers got their service back yesterday in southwest Florida. Still, there are certain areas, like the barrier islands, where there was so much destruction the infrastructure will just have to be rebuilt up almost from the ground. And DeSantis says cellphone service should improve as phone companies bring in portable cell towers here. MARTIN: Any word on fatalities? ALLEN: No official word yet, although Governor DeSantis indicated one will be coming. Reports from local officials are bringing it to more than a dozen dead, a number that's likely to grow. There are a lot of concerns now about avoiding post-storm fatalities, things from improper use of generators, chainsaws and other accidents. In some past storms, those have accounted for more than people who died actually in the storm itself. MARTIN: So be careful. NPR's Greg Allen in St. Petersburg. Thanks for your reporting, Greg. ALLEN: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: All right. In a ceremony later today, the Kremlin says that Russian President Vladimir Putin will formally announce that he is annexing four territories from Ukraine. FADEL: Yeah, and he's done this before in Ukraine - stage referendums, coerce people into voting yes and then claim that he's just giving the people what they want, to be Russian. It's illegal under international law, but that clearly was not a deterrent to Vladimir Putin. Meanwhile, the fighting goes on. Today, Ukraine reported a missile attack in Zaporizhzhia that killed more than 20 people and wounded dozens more. MARTIN: NPR's Charles Maynes is in Moscow, and he is also with us now. Charles, thanks for being here. First off, what is the protocol today for illegally annexing land that isn't yours? CHARLES MAYNES, BYLINE: Yeah, well, we know exactly because yesterday Putin's spokesman spelled it all out for us. Putin will summon lawmakers to St. George's Hall in the Kremlin today at 3 p.m., sharp. The Russian leader will then give what his spokesman called a voluminous speech and hold a signing ceremony admitting these territories into the Russian Federation, although that will require formal ratification later by the Parliament and Constitutional Court. Now, to set the stage, Putin last night recognized two of these territories, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, as independent. The other two, Donetsk and Luhansk, were already recognized as such by Russia back in February. So Putin's moving full steam ahead and capping it off with a party just off Red Square, where they've already put up a stage, a huge video screen, and there are banners that read Russia and these territories are now together forever. MARTIN: I mean, he can say that as long as he wants, but that doesn't make it true. Ukraine has been making significant military gains in recent weeks, right? MAYNES: Yeah, that's right. And remember; these referendum votes unfolded just as Putin gave an order to mobilize an additional 300,000 troops to hold the line against these Ukrainian advances. You know, the problem here is that the call-up hasn't gone well. It was supposed to involve just military reservists, but there have been countless stories of Russians with no military background being drafted. We've also seen thousands of Russian men fleeing for Russia's borders to avoid conscription. And just yesterday, Putin acknowledged something he rarely does - mistakes have been made. Let's listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN: (Speaking Russian). MAYNES: So here, Putin says, amid mobilization, a lot of questions had come up about the wrong people being drafted, and he said, these mistakes needed to be fixed. And that just tells you that the Kremlin is clearly aware of a growing public backlash. MARTIN: Right, and trying to recalibrate, which is not exactly a triumphant note ahead of what clearly the Kremlin is trying to frame as a triumphant day today. You know, yesterday we were talking, Charles, about Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Can you just talk for a second about how this annexation compares with that? MAYNES: Sure. You know, everything we're witnessing really seems a repeat of what we saw in Crimea. You have these staged referendums giving a kind of veneer of legitimacy, followed by an annexation under this quasi-legal guise. And even though almost nobody recognizes Crimea as Russian territory today, most Russians see that annexation as historically justified, not to mention almost bloodless. The peninsula was taken in just a matter of days. That's clearly not the case this time around. You know, these annexations are taking place in an active war zone, lands not even completely held by Russian forces. And Putin has even resorted to veiled threats to use nuclear weapons to defend the new boundaries. So barring the unforeseen, Putin will annexed these territories today, and state television will sell it as a triumph. But given what's been happening in the past couple of weeks - you know, with the counteroffensive of Ukraine, the problems with mobilization, the danger of nuclear escalation - you know, the question is whether Russians really think this is something worth celebrating. MARTIN: NPR's Charles Maynes reporting from Moscow. Charles, thank you. MAYNES: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: In Brazil's election this weekend, two polar ideological opposites are vying for the presidency. FADEL: On the far right is current president, Jair Bolsonaro, a brash nationalist who says he won't accept a loss because of fraud. There's no evidence of his claims of fraud. Bolsonaro is currently trailing in the polls to one of Latin America's most revered leftists, who is hoping to make a stunning political comeback after being jailed on corruption charges. MARTIN: NPR's South America correspondent Carrie Kahn joins us now from Rio de Janeiro. Hey, Carrie. CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: Just to be extra clear, does Brazil have a problem with voter fraud? KAHN: It does not. It has an electronic voting machine system that's been up and running since 1996 and hasn't had any major problems. But Bolsonaro has long criticized the machines, and he stepped up his attacks recently, as he's been stagnating in the polls. Many say he's taking a page from the playbook of his political ally, Donald Trump, by spreading these fraud rumors, even before the election. Bolsonaro told his supporters that they should prepare for war if he loses. That's a scary scenario since gun sales in Brazil have risen dramatically during his term, as he relaxed regulations. MARTIN: Well, is that a real concern that there would be some kind of violence after the election, especially if Bolsonaro loses? KAHN: Yes, there is concern. Bolsonaro is quite the provocateur. He can be impetuous. He loves to deride reporters, activists. He makes homophobic comments. And he has little regard for the environment. Deforestation in the Amazon has hit record levels during his term. He's a former army captain, and he still has close ties to the military. And Brazil has a history of military rule. The last one ended just in 1985. I spoke with former U.S. Ambassador to Brazil Thomas Shannon. He downplayed prospects of violence by Bolsonaro. Here's what he said. THOMAS SHANNON: I mean, this guy is not going to go peacefully into the night. From my point of view, you know, Brazilian institutions are resilient, and they're strong. KAHN: And he says the international community will come down hard on Bolsonaro, too, if there's any violence. MARTIN: So his rival is the former president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and he's doing well in the polls. Do you think he could win it in the first round of voting? Or is there likely to be a runoff? KAHN: In some polls, da Silva is getting very close to the 50% mark needed to win outright on Sunday. There was just a big debate here last night that actually ended at 1 a.m. this morning. The debate was quite raucous, with Bolsonaro and da Silva devolving into insults at many points. Da Silva had been criticized in past debates for his lackluster performance, but he's put on more energy in this one. And he's 76 now and has a lot of negatives to overcome, too. He was jailed, like you said, for corruption, caught up in a huge scandal that also led to the impeachment of his political successor. Ultimately, that conviction was annulled, but many still don't trust him or his party. So he's moved to the center, trying to capture a wider vote base. So it will be close. MARTIN: How is the U.S. watching this election? KAHN: There are hundreds of thousands of Brazilians in the U.S. Eligible citizens can vote abroad, so interest is high. And the U.S. Senate just passed a resolution this week expressing support for Brazilian democracy and urging President Biden to reconsider a relationship with any government that might come to power illegally. MARTIN: NPR's Carrie Kahn reporting from Rio. Thank you, Carrie. KAHN: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy took the Republican legislative roadmap to suburban Pittsburgh Friday, asking voters for victories in the midterm elections that would let the GOP control the House. Flanked by Republican members of Congress, McCarthy gathered an enthusiastic audience in a manufacturing business in Monongahela, Pa., and said his party knows what Americans want. \"If you're like everybody else we hear: whether you can afford it, whether you feel safe, the challenge of your children getting left behind, or a government that's run amok, who has a plan to change that course? We do,\" he said. The \"Commitment to America\" includes four broad pillars focusing on the economy, safety, individual freedom and government accountability. Big on ideas (\"expand U.S. manufacturing\") but short on policy specifics, the agenda is in keeping with tradition established in 1994 with Rep. Newt Gingrich's \"Contract with America,\" where the minority party releases their agenda priorities ahead of Election Day. Gingrich met privately with House Republicans Thursday on Capitol Hill as lawmakers were briefed on the agenda before its unveiling. House Republicans held the event to tout the agenda as the 2022 campaign comes to a close in about seven weeks. While early 2022 GOP electoral strength has tightened in polls in recent months, the party is still favored to win at least a narrow majority in November, and McCarthy is poised to become speaker if the party succeeds. Much of the agenda relies on traditional conservative orthodoxy \u2014 support for tax cuts and reductions in government spending \u2014 but also weighs in on some divisive cultural issues. For example, Republicans pledge to support legislation to ensure \"that only women can compete in women's sports\" \u2014 which would seek to ban trans women from playing on women's sports teams. Republicans also broadly pledge to advance federal legislation to restrict abortion access promising to \"protect the lives of unborn children and their mothers.\" The agenda also signals opposition to any legislation to restrict gun rights, pledging to \"safeguard\" the Second Amendment. House Republicans' legislative ambitions would be weakened by divided government; regardless of what happens with control of the Senate, President Biden is unlikely to support much if any of a partisan GOP agenda. But the majority would provide Republicans with oversight and investigative authority over the administration and they plan to use it. Republicans will \"conduct rigorous oversight\" and \"require the White House to answer for its incompetence at home and abroad,\" with plans to hold hearings on: the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. withdrawal of Afghanistan, the Justice Department's investigation into former President Donald Trump and the alleged illegal possession of classified documents at his Florida estate. Henry Connelly, a spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, derided the Commitment to America as \"doubling down on an extreme MAGA agenda.\" Pelosi has been bullish that Democrats will defy historical trends and hold on to their majority. In particular, Democrats believe the Supreme Court decision to overturn a federal right to abortion access will tip competitive races in their favor. A pair of Democratic victories in House special elections in New York and Alaska have given the party cause for optimism that a \"red wave\" is not on the horizon. \"We fully intend to hold the House,\" she told reporters last week, \"And even though there are some among you who belittle my political instincts and the rest, I got us here twice to the majority, and I don't intend to [give it up].\" Republican leaders have also made clear they plan to run the House differently than Democrats have, notably by promising to end the practice of remote proxy voting that was approved as an emergency measure in response to the pandemic. \"We've got many votes, big votes, where over 100 members of Congress weren't even here in person voting, that will change under a House Republican majority,\" GOP Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., told reporters this week. Scalise intends to run for majority leader, a position that oversees the floor schedule and operations, if Republicans win control.",

Maggie Hassan speaks during a campaign canvas kickoff event on Saturday in Dover, N.H. Hassan is running for reelection and her Republican opponent will be chosen in the upcoming GOP primary. The 2022 primary season comes to a close Tuesday. While nominees in other states have hit the campaign trail gearing up for November, voters in Delaware, New Hampshire and Rhode Island will decide on their picks with fewer than two months to go until the general election. Perhaps the most-watched state is New Hampshire, where the stakes are high in the five-way Republican Senate primary. The winner of that race will take on incumbent Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan in a race that's among a handful that could decide party control over the U.S. Senate. Former President Donald Trump has, so far, stayed out of these races but has loomed large as candidates have fought to play up their fealty to him. The sprawling field includes Chuck Morse, who is the president of New Hampshire's state Senate, and Don Bolduc, a former Army general who has backed Trump's false claims about the 2020 election being stolen. Bolduc has been dismissed as a \"conspiracy theorist-type\" by New Hampshire's Republican Gov. Chris Sununu, who is backing Morse. Morse also has the support of an outside group run by a former aide to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. It's spent $4 million to boost Morse and attack Bolduc, but Bolduc, who also ran for Senate in 2020, has campaigned doggedly, stoking conservative anger over COVID-19 lockdowns and promising to hold leaders in both parties accountable. The field also includes Lincoln, N.H., businessman Vikram Mansharamani. New Hampshire's 1st Congressional District \u2014 which includes Manchester, the state's seacoast and vote-rich commuter towns along the Massachusetts border \u2014 is seen as a true swing district. There are five Republicans fighting to take on two-term incumbent Democrat Chris Pappas. Prime among them is Matt Mowers, a former Trump administration State Department staffer, who got his political start in New Jersey as an aide to then-Gov. Chris Christie. Mowers was the GOP's 2020 nominee for the seat, losing to Pappas by 5 points. Mowers, 33, entered this race as the frontrunner and has been endorsed by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, but Mowers' victory is far from assured. Karoline Leavitt \u2014 a 25-year-old former Trump administration assistant press secretary who has derided Mowers as the establishment's \"handpicked puppet\" \u2014 has gained ground in polling. The race for New Hampshire's 2nd District, which runs along the border with Vermont and tilts more liberal, features Bob Burns, a serial candidate well-known in GOP activist circles. Burns bills himself as \"pro-life, pro-Trump, America first.\" He faces George Hansel, the Republican mayor of the liberal city of Keene, N.H. Hansel supports some abortion rights and has the support of Gov. Sununu. Hansel has accused Burns of repeatedly lying about his record but has tacked right over the course of this race. The winner of that primary faces five-term incumbent Democrat Annie Kuster, a prolific fundraiser. Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee remains the favorite in a five-way Democratic primary, although two rivals \u2014 Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea and former CVS Health executive Helena Buonanno Foulkes \u2014 could pull off an upset. In March 2021, McKee, then the lieutenant governor, moved up to governor when Gina Raimondo left office to become the U.S. commerce secretary. McKee touts his leadership in guiding Rhode Island through the pandemic since then. Gorbea and Foulkes did not rush to criticize McKee's record. When they did, they targeted a potential soccer stadium in Pawtucket with $60 million in public investment and an ongoing FBI probe of an educational consulting contract awarded by McKee's administration. The winner of the Democratic primary will face Republican businesswoman Ashley Kalus, a Rhode Island newcomer. Republicans held the governor's office from 2003 until 2011, but have been locked out since then. Three-term incumbent Chris Sununu, the most successful Republican in the Granite State in a generation, is almost certain to win the primary for governor. He faces three challengers, all staunch conservatives who are taking particular aim at the Sununu's handling of COVID-19. New Hampshire was less restrictive in terms of pandemic policies than any of its New England neighbors, but conservative activists were still galvanized by school closures, business closings and mask mandates. If Sununu wins Tuesday, he'll face Democratic challenger Dr. Tom Sherman, who now serves in the state Senate. Josh Rogers is the senior political editor and reporter for New Hampshire Public Radio.

            "article_content": "A video screengrab of the meeting earlier this year where Ferry County commissioners voted to remove a cybersecurity device called an Albert sensor from the Washington state county's computer network.\n                \n                    \n                    Ferry County, Wash./Screenshot provided by Austin Jenkins/Northwest News Network\n                    \n                \nhide caption In northeast Washington state, a remote region nestled against the Canadian border, the politics lean conservative and wariness of government runs high. Earlier this year, a Republican-led county commission there made a decision that rippled across Washington \u2014 triggering alarm at the secretary of state's office, and now among cybersecurity experts who have worked for the past six years to shore up the security of America's voting systems. It happened on Valentine's Day during the regular weekly meeting of the three-member commission in Ferry County, where Donald Trump received more than 63% of the vote in the 2020 election. After an agenda that included an update on the county fair and a discussion about a local water and sewer district, the commissioners took up a proposal to disconnect a recently installed cybersecurity device from the county's computer network. The device, known as an Albert sensor, was designed to alert local governments to potential hacking attempts against their networks. More than 900 Albert sensors have been deployed across the country, primarily to states and counties, and they have been a key component of the federal government's cybersecurity response following Russian election interference around the 2016 election. But the commissioners in Ferry County had come to the conclusion that the sensor, which had been provided by the state at no cost, was more of a liability than an asset. \"Let's get rid of it,\" Commissioner Nathan Davis said before making his motion to remove the device. The vote in support of the motion was unanimous. \"Bye bye, Albert sensor,\" one of the commissioners quipped. Another county in Washington state also disconnected its sensor, and a third decided not to install one. It's an isolated trend in Washington at this point, but one that represents a stark example of how Republican mistrust in elections and government systems more broadly threatens to dismantle bipartisan progress made over the past decade to improve election security. During the Ferry County meeting, Commissioner Davis quoted from a memo that circulated among Washington state Republicans. That memo, which NPR and the Northwest News Network obtained, raised a number of concerns about Albert sensors and also seemed to allude to the program being part of a left-wing conspiracy. \"Decisions are being made that are hurting the overall security of elections based on lies and untruths,\" said Matt Masterson, who led election security efforts leading up to 2020 within the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). \"It is entirely healthy and appropriate for citizens and elected officials to ask questions about the nature of the technology they use. ... But those conversations have to be based in fact.\" A disconnected Albert sensor in Lincoln County, Wash.\n                \n                    \n                    Lincoln County Commissioner Rob Coffman\n                    \n                \nhide caption A disconnected Albert sensor in Lincoln County, Wash. Named after Albert Einstein, the Albert sensor is what's called an \"intrusion detection\" device that looks out for known bad actors, or malicious IP addresses, on the network it's connected to. When a match is detected, a notification is sent to an around-the-clock security operations center located near Albany, N.Y. There, analysts review the traffic and, if the threat is deemed credible, send an immediate alert to that government warning of a potential hacking attempt. The program is operated by the Center for Internet Security (CIS), which was founded in 2000 to address emerging cyber threats. While CIS is a nonprofit, it receives federal funding and works closely with CISA, the DHS cybersecurity agency. The Albert monitoring program first began in 2011 but was ramped up after the 2016 election, following the Russian hacking attempts on a number of different state and local government systems that happened around that time. It took months for the federal government to notify and distribute information to the relevant local government officials after those attacks. \"There was zero information-sharing going on in the elections realm with relation to cybersecurity until 2016,\" said Masterson, who added that Albert sensors were a key piece in addressing that problem. Not only do Albert sensors help individual counties understand the threats they face, they provide a clearer national picture of what's happening online in all the different localities that administer elections in the U.S. Because of that, Masterson says a county pulling out of the program also hurts that national visibility. \"The less participation, the less broad deployment of Albert sensors \u2014 or frankly, to take it out one step further, the less information being shared broadly across the community, the less secure our elections are,\" he said. The Albert sensor in Washington's Ferry County was one of hundreds installed on the networks of state and local governments in the runup to the 2020 election. While voting equipment is not connected to the internet, hackers could still wreak havoc on an election by breaking into a county's network. Once inside, they could freeze or alter websites, affect registration infrastructure, or do other things to harm public confidence in elections. It's happened before. For example, in October 2020, just before the general election, a ransomware attack on Hall County, Ga., temporarily took down election-related systems, including a voter signature database. \"Hall County was in a precarious spot and you don't want to be in a precarious spot,\" said David Levine, a former election official who's now with the nonpartisan Alliance For Securing Democracy. In an average month, CIS says it investigates more than 25,000 Albert sensor alerts. \"The analogy that I often use here is that we don't ask the county sheriff to be responsible for repelling military invasions, but that is really the equivalent of what they're up against on the internet,\" said Matt Blaze, a cybersecurity expert at Georgetown University who is not associated with the Albert program or CIS. But in some Republican parts of Washington, the sensor came to be seen not as an insurance policy against hackers, but as a device that should be viewed with suspicion \u2014 a form of \"big brother\" watching over everything on a county's network. Directly south of Ferry County is Lincoln County, a deeply conservative wheat farming community. In late 2021, Lincoln County commissioners terminated their agreement for an Albert sensor, just 13 months after it was signed, deciding the device was more of a liability than a safeguard. Their skepticism was rooted in the fact that shortly after the sensor was installed, the county fell victim to a crippling ransomware attack. \"This Albert sensor didn't do a damn thing about it,\" said Lincoln County Commissioner Rob Coffman, a Republican. \"It didn't function as it was advertised.\" CIS said that while Albert sensors can detect ransomware attacks, they're not foolproof because the program only recognizes known hostile addresses in a rapidly shifting threat landscape. Blaze, of Georgetown University, said the ransomware attack should've been further evidence for the county that the Albert sensor was a good thing to have. \"The fact that state and local networks are often victimized by this type of attack is an example why you need defenses like this,\" Blaze said. After the ransomware attack, Lincoln County beefed up its cybersecurity protections, but Coffman also began doing research about the Albert sensor. He said he learned that his county's information technology director had been wary of installing the device, but felt pressure from the state to do so. Coffman said he also talked to the IT director in neighboring Grant County, who had declined to install an Albert sensor out of concern that it could be a point of weakness for his network. CIS responded that it has specific recommendations about how to deploy an Albert sensor on a network to allay those concerns. As part of his research, Coffman said he also started looking into CIS and learned that in 2018 the organization briefly partnered with another nonprofit that the conservative website Influence Watch said was connected with \"left-leaning social welfare\" groups. It was enough to add fuel to a brewing conspiracy. Coffman said he shared his findings with members of the Lincoln County Republican Party. Months later, in February 2022, the county GOP chair, Mary Blechschmidt, issued a two-page memo about Albert sensors to her fellow county Republican chairs. In her memo, Blechschmidt wrote: \"I continue to press on this issue because it is hard to imagine why a county would allow a non-profit organization such as this, access to the proprietary data on its network, 24/7 across the internet.\" In an interview, Blechschmidt, who said she believes the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, rejected the suggestion that she was spreading misinformation about Albert sensors. \"We're trying to keep outside influences out of our data and we took the time to research it and determined that we don't want it and we don't need it,\" Blechschmidt said of the Albert sensor. Also in the memo, Blechschmidt tried to tie CIS to the left by, among other things, citing a CIS co-founder's stints in the Clinton and Obama administrations. But the Albert sensor program was significantly ramped up under the Trump administration. \"We've had a long track record of being nonpartisan and trusted by states and counties all over the country,\" said Jason Forget, a CIS spokesperson. Thirteen days after Blechschmidt issued her memo on the Albert sensors, the Ferry County commission voted to remove theirs. During their discussion, Ferry's commissioners referenced Lincoln County's ransomware event. Davis, the commissioner who led the effort, also voiced concern about what the Albert sensor was capturing and where the county's data was going. \"It's scanning everything we do on our network and it sends it to a third party,\" Davis said. Asked to address this concern, Geoff Hale, who leads the election security initiative for CISA, said Albert sensors passively monitor for potential trouble and don't have unfettered access to a client's data. \"It's almost like seeing a license plate to a car,\" Hale said. \"And so this sensor is looking at all the traffic that passes. And if one of those license plates, one of those signatures, matches up to known bad infrastructure, it sends you an alert.\" Washington Secretary of State Steve Hobbs, a Democrat, has made a plea to county officials to get or keep Albert sensors.\n                \n                    \n                    Ted S. Warren/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Word of Ferry County's decision to remove its Albert sensor soon reached Secretary of State Steve Hobbs, a Democrat, in Olympia, Wash. \"Immediately it occurred to me this was the start of, perhaps, a misinformation campaign directed at the Albert sensor and I was quite concerned about it,\" he said. The secretary of state's office quickly convened a virtual meeting about the Albert sensor program and invited county officials from across the state to attend. Among the speakers at the February meeting was former Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman, a Republican who spearheaded the deployment of Albert sensors in the state after the 2016 election. Wyman was appointed to oversee election security efforts for the Biden administration in 2021. \"The Albert sensor program is really a way for us to have one more layer of security and information that we can use to combat people who would do our system harm,\" Wyman told the counties. The presentation ended with Hobbs making a direct appeal to skeptical county officials. \"If you do not have an Albert sensor, get the Albert sensor. If you have removed the Albert sensor or are thinking about removing the Albert sensor, please reconsider,\" Hobbs said. That plea was not compelling to Ferry County Commissioner Davis, who has a background in IT. He said in an interview that he still has questions about how Albert sensors work, but did not have the time right now to continue researching them. Davis also said he finds it odd that anyone cares whether his little county, with barely more than 7,000 people, has one or not. \"Why the hard push?\" Davis asked. \"What are the true motivations to push so hard on something that really doesn't do a lot?\" Davis said he's open to reinstalling the Albert sensor in the future, but would need to have more information before he's willing to do so. CIS said the counties in Washington are the only ones to disconnect from the Albert program, and Hobbs said he thinks by responding quickly the state succeeded in stopping false narratives about the sensors from spreading. Nationwide, Albert sensors still seem to have basically unanimous support. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Trump-endorsed Republican, mentioned them during a congressional hearing this summer. \"If you don't have [Albert sensors] at your county boards of elections you should do that,\" LaRose said. \"So that way if something goes wrong on a Saturday night or Sunday morning, you can know about it before everyone comes back to work on Monday and you can mitigate the problem right then and there.\" The vast majority of Washington's 39 counties have also embraced the program. In a series of interviews, county auditors, both Democrats and Republicans from small and big counties, praised the program and said they feel better knowing their county has an Albert sensor. \"We put it on and it's been working great,\" said Charles Ross, the Republican auditor in south central Washington's Yakima County. \"It hasn't caused any problems.\" Julie Wise, the nonpartisan director of elections in King County, the state's most populous, said the Albert sensor is \"another data point\" to help keep elections secure. She called efforts to undermine the Albert program part of a concerning pattern. \"This appears to be just another iteration of misinformation to discredit elections, like we've seen with ballot drop boxes, vote by mail and now it's Albert sensors,\" Wise said.",

Former President Donald Trump's preferred candidate bested a field of GOP hopefuls, but the only other real contender was developer Karrin Taylor Robson.

In March of 2021, she resigned amid a slew of controversial social media posts, including one spreading a debunked video about COVID-19. Months later, she announced her campaign for governor. Much of her campaign was dedicated to repeating the former president's election lies, both old and new \u2014 Lake even spent the past few weeks baselessly claiming fraud in Arizona's current vote.

Arizonans are voting in the state's midterm primary election. PHOENIX \u2014 Arizona's primary election is defined by open races for several statewide positions, and the election-denying candidates running to assume those roles in 2023. There are no incumbents running for three key statewide offices \u2013 governor, attorney general and secretary of state \u2013 the top election gig in Arizona. Former President Donald Trump has exerted his influence over crowded fields of candidates, many of whom continue to baselessly assert the 2020 election, which Trump lost in Arizona and nationwide, was stolen. That includes Trump-endorsed candidates like former local news anchor Kari Lake, who's running for governor; state Rep. Mark Finchem, who's running for secretary of state; and Abe Hamadeh, who's running for attorney general. In fact, Lake has already taken a page out of the Trump playbook and claimed the current election is rigged against her. She's repeatedly refused to present evidence to back her claims when confronted by reporters. Lake's closest competition is a wealthy developer, Karrin Taylor Robson, who's backed by the conservative establishment both in Arizona and nationally. Current Gov. Doug Ducey has endorsed her, as has former Vice President Mike Pence. Taylor Robson has spent millions of dollars to brand herself as a more reasonable-sounding Republican, though her policies don't often differ from Lake.

Elsewhere, a crowded field of Republicans, led by Trump endorsee and former venture capitalist Blake Masters, are vying for the right to run against Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly in November. Kelly's win in 2020 gave Democrats control of both Arizona's U.S. Senate seats, and national Republican leaders have viewed the state as a potential rebound ever since. Races further down the ballot will also set the stage for competitive congressional seats up for grabs in November. Redistricting made two key districts currently occupied by Democrats more conservative, giving Republicans a chance to pick up key U.S. House seats in a state Democrats now control 5-4.",

            "article_content": "The right to an abortion is teetering in Arizona, Kansas and Michigan \u2014 all states with primary elections on Aug. 2. In each state, the decision may come down to a different election outcome.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Ever since the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, it is now up to states to decide whether people can access abortion. We're going to look now at three states where voters tomorrow will help shape the future of reproductive rights - Arizona, Kansas and Michigan, where there was some news today. Zoe Clark of Michigan Radio is in Ann Arbor. And Zoe, I understand the courts got ahead of tomorrow's election. Tell us what happened today. ZOE CLARK, BYLINE: Yeah. So earlier today, the Michigan Court of Appeals overturned a lower court decision regarding the state's abortion law. In Michigan, we have a 1931 law that criminalizes abortion. That law had been dormant under Roe v Wade. Then the U.S. Supreme Court issued the Dobbs decision. But a couple of months earlier, a lower court here had put an injunction on that 1931 law so it wasn't in effect. That was, until today. That's when the Court of Appeals said that that injunction doesn't apply to county prosecutors, so that county prosecutors could now enforce the 1931 abortion ban. It appears that that decision doesn't take effect, though, for 21 days. That would allow time for appeals to be filed. So right now, people in Michigan can still access abortion in the state. But it's a really confusing time, Ari, and some abortion providers aren't completely sure just about where things stand legally. SHAPIRO: OK. So status quo, at least for a few weeks. And meanwhile, tomorrow, there is a primary in Michigan where Republican candidates who want to face Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer in November are on the ballot. Is there any daylight among the Republican candidates on the issue of abortion? CLARK: Not really. All five candidates are anti-abortion rights. All five say they support the state's 1931 law that criminalizes abortion. That includes Tudor Dixon. So she was just endorsed by former President Donald Trump on Friday night. She was also endorsed by Right to Life of Michigan, which is this really big get in Michigan Republican politics. But we should also note in Michigan, there is a ballot campaign to get abortion rights enshrined into the state constitution. The group Reproductive Freedom for All, they turned in a record number of signatures last month. It was, in fact, the most in the history of Michigan. If that question makes it onto the November ballot, voters will, of course, be voting for governor, but they would also then be voting on the future of abortion rights in the state. SHAPIRO: All right. Well, speaking of a state constitution, in Kansas, there is a constitutional amendment on the ballot tomorrow. Jim McLean of KCUR joins us from Topeka. And, Jim, voters in your state are going to be the first in the country to decide on abortion since Roe versus Wade was overturned. Tell us about this proposed constitutional amendment. JIM MCLEAN, BYLINE: Well, that's right, Ari. In 2019, the Kansas Supreme Court ruled that abortion was a protected right under the state constitution. So now, voters will decide whether to reverse that decision. Opponents of the proposed constitutional amendment have spent millions on ads warning that passage would clear the way for the state's Republican-controlled legislature to ban abortion. But amendment supporters have tried to calm those fears with ads like this one. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: That's just a scare tactic. Here's what it does do. It lets us keep common-sense limits on abortion that we already agree on, like limiting extreme abortions in the third trimester, and requires abortion clinics to meet safety standards that protect women. That's not a ban. It's just common sense. MCLEAN: While it's true that those existing restrictions could be vulnerable if the amendment is defeated, there are also indications that abortion opponents, regardless of what they're saying now, will push for an outright ban if the amendment passes. SHAPIRO: Is it looking likely to pass? I mean, if so, what would happen to abortion rights in Kansas after that? MCLEAN: Well, it's closer probably than many expected. Supporters pushed to get the amendment on the primary ballot instead of the November general election ballot, thinking that would improve their chances because in this red state, Ari, competitive Republican primaries turn out social conservatives in greater numbers. But the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade triggered a surge in voter registration mainly, it's thought, among abortion rights advocates. And that's made it closer than expected. With a record turnout predicted, the most recent poll shows amendment supporters with about a 4% lead over amendment opponents, with about 10% of voters still undecided. So if the amendment passes, the legislature will likely add or at least attempt to add new restrictions, which could include a ban. SHAPIRO: All right. Finally, let's turn to Arizona, where KJZZ's Katherine Davis-Young is following the election. And Katie, in your state, an old abortion law is on the books, like the one in Michigan. How could tomorrow's election shape the future of abortion in Arizona? KATHERINE DAVIS-YOUNG, BYLINE: Right. We have a law dating back to the 1800s, decades before Arizona even became a state. And debate around that law has really moved one of our down-ballot races here into the spotlight. And that is the race for the state attorney general. And the reason is there's a lot of confusion right now about what is actually legal in Arizona without Roe. The pre-statehood law outlaws abortions with very few exceptions, and that's never been repealed. But we also have a number of more recent laws that restrict abortion in various other ways. So the question is which law are providers supposed to follow now? Our current state attorney general, Republican Mark Brnovich, says the old ban from territorial days is enforceable, but Brnovich is at the end of his term. So both sides of the issue are now really focused on who will replace him and what the next AG's interpretation of Arizona's law will be. SHAPIRO: So Arizona's next attorney general is going to have a lot of power. What are the candidates saying about how they would enforce these conflicting abortion laws in the state? DAVIS-YOUNG: Well, on the Republican side, there are six candidates vying for a nomination in tomorrow's primary, and they've all indicated that they would plan to enforce state laws that restrict abortion. On the Democrat side, there's just one candidate running unopposed, and she has a very different interpretation of the law. She says basically any limits on abortion in Arizona are in violation of the state constitution, which guarantees an individual's right to privacy. So Claire Knipe is with the pro-choice political group called Arizona List. And they are one group that's now just become laser focused on the AG race. They say getting Democrat Kris Mayes elected is crucial for abortion rights. CLAIRE KNIPE: Even if we are able to flip the legislature, even if we don't get the governor's seat and couldn't veto bills, she would still have the ability to stop some of this prosecuting and be able to protect folks here in Arizona. SHAPIRO: Each of you is in a state where abortion may soon become illegal. And so in each of your states, if that happens, where might people seeking an abortion go? Zoe? CLARK: Yeah. Here in Michigan, actually, after the Dobbs decision, Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer sent a letter to the federal government asking for protection for Michiganders who might travel across the international border to Canada to receive abortion services. SHAPIRO: And Jim, what about Kansas? MCLEAN: Well, Ari, Kansans won't have many options. Colorado, Minnesota and, at least for now, New Mexico would be their most practical options. SHAPIRO: And finally, Katie in Arizona? DAVIS-YOUNG: Well, our attorney general wants to enforce this old 1800s ban on most abortion in the state, and that's still hung up in courts for now. But the impact is most abortions have already stopped in Arizona. Providers don't want to take the risk while the law is unclear. So already, there are reports of California clinics getting a big influx of Arizona patients. SHAPIRO: That is KJZZ's Katherine Davis-Young, KCUR's Jim McLean and Michigan Radio's Zoe Clark. Thanks to all three of you. MCLEAN: Thank you. DAVIS-YOUNG: Thanks, Ari. CLARK: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Martin Natatorium and Recreation Center in Atlanta on May 18. Monica Poole looked forward to voting in Georgia's primary in May. But after breaking her ankle, she couldn't drive. Even navigating the stairs from her second-floor Atlanta apartment was impossible, so waiting in line to vote wasn't an option. Poole applied for a mail-in absentee ballot, like many Georgians have in recent years, and wanted to return it using a drop box. But the nearest one in Fulton County, where Poole lives, was a 20-minute drive and accessible only during limited hours and days, unlike 2020 when drop boxes were available all across the county and accessible seven days a week around the clock until Election Day. The new restrictions made the drop boxes difficult to use for Poole, who had limited mobility and a rigid work schedule. So she was forced to mail in her ballot. But Poole's ballot didn't count, because it didn't arrive at the county's elections office in time. \"To find out I did all that and still didn't get my vote in, I feel discouraged,\" Poole said. \"I'm an African American female, and we weren't able to vote for many years, so I feel like it's my civic duty.\" Loading... Poole is one of millions of Georgia voters affected by sweeping changes to state election laws enacted by lawmakers last year. The changes include restricting access to drop boxes in counties that used them the most, which also have the highest number of voters of color and Democrats, according to an analysis by NPR, WABE and Georgia Public Broadcasting (GPB) of drop box locations, voter registration and other data. Gwinnett County voter Marian McCray (right) receives help from a poll worker while dropping off her absentee ballot at the Gwinnett County Board of Voter Registrations and Elections, in Lawrenceville, Ga., on May 18.\n                \n                    \n                    Alyssa Pointer for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Gwinnett County voter Marian McCray (right) receives help from a poll worker while dropping off her absentee ballot at the Gwinnett County Board of Voter Registrations and Elections, in Lawrenceville, Ga., on May 18. NPR, WABE and GPB compiled drop box usage data by reviewing thousands of forms used to document the number of ballots deposited in drop boxes daily across Georgia in 2020 and calculating travel time intervals to a drop box for more than 7.5 million voters. 2022 drop box locations are current as of Georgia's May 24 primary. An analysis by NPR, WABE and Georgia Public Broadcasting also found: NPR, WABE and GPB compiled drop box usage data and locations by manually reviewing more than 9,000 collection forms from drop boxes used in the 2020 presidential election. Poll workers documented the number of ballots deposited in 295 drop boxes across the state daily. Ballot drop boxes were provided to Georgia voters in the 2020 primaries for the first time as a way to vote safely while COVID-19 ravaged communities. Even before the pandemic, they were a popular tool for voters in states such as Oregon, Washington and Colorado. After former President Donald Trump's defeat, many of his allies in Georgia and elsewhere equated drop boxes with voter fraud. So, Republican lawmakers, particularly in Georgia, have moved to curtail access to the boxes before the November midterm election. The new law, known as Senate Bill 202, requires all 159 Georgia counties to have at least one box \u2014 but no more than one per 100,000 voters. Instead of making them available outdoors 24 hours a day as in 2020, the drop boxes must be kept inside early voting locations with limited hours \u2014 typically 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. That can be problematic for voters with inflexible work schedules or those with other time constraints. The bill received no Democratic support. While it's too early to measure the law's impact on turnout, experts say even small changes to voter behavior and turnout can sway election outcomes and erode trust in the voting system, especially in a politically divided state like Georgia with a history of discriminatory voting practices that disproportionately impact people of color. \"In any state that's going to have tight elections, and Georgia's had some nail biters, then even those marginal changes could have significant effects on the outcome of elections,\" said Benjamin Gonzalez O'Brien, who teaches political science at San Diego State University and has studied drop box access and voter turnout. \"Not every election is decided by tens of thousands of votes. Some are decided by under 100 votes.\" Benjamin Gonzalez O'Brien teaches political science at San Diego State University and has studied drop box access and voter turnout.\n                \n                    \n                    Celeste Noche for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Benjamin Gonzalez O'Brien teaches political science at San Diego State University and has studied drop box access and voter turnout. In 2020, then-presidential candidate Joe Biden won Georgia by 11,779 votes. In 2018, Republican Brian Kemp defeated Democrat Stacey Abrams by 54,723 votes \u2014 50.2% to 48.8% \u2014 in the race for governor. Polls show similarly tight races this year that could decide control of Congress and who becomes the next governor. Forty-three states used drop boxes during the 2020 election. But in the months following, ballot drop boxes became a stand-in for more sweeping debates around voting rights and election integrity in Georgia and around the country, though they were used by voters of all political parties and in many states like Georgia they were under round-the-clock surveillance. They became a target of conspiracy theories about widespread election fraud promoted by Trump and his allies. Even after voting to officially add drop boxes as a voting method in 2021, some Republican lawmakers who faced far-right primary challengers later tried unsuccessfully to completely eliminate them, claiming concerns about security and fraud. \"Drop boxes were introduced as an emergency measure during the pandemic, but many counties did not follow the security guidelines in place,\" Georgia Senate President Pro Tem Butch Miller said after proposing that drop boxes be banned altogether. \"Moving forward, we can return to a pre-pandemic normal of voting in person. Removing drop boxes will help rebuild the trust that has been lost.\" Georgia Lt.

Gov. candidate Butch Miller participates in a Republican primary debate on May 3 in Atlanta. Miller lost his primary election to be the party's lieutenant governor nominee, and the legislation banning drop boxes failed to gain traction. NPR, WABE and GPB reached out to five Republican sponsors of the new election law, including Miller. None responded to requests for interviews. In an interview with GPB, Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger defended the election law as a balance of accessibility and security. He said the state's recent primary election was proof that Georgia has \"tremendous opportunities for people to access the vote,\" including by drop box. \"We have record registrations, we have record turnout,\" he said. \"And we have the appropriate guardrails of making sure that the drop boxes are on government property, that they're now inside an office under the physical surveillance of election workers.\" State Rep. Bee Nguyen disagreed. The Atlanta Democrat voted against the 98-page election law and said her colleagues approved the changes to placate voters who agreed with Trump's election lies. She said the law intentionally makes voting by drop box harder for Democrats and nonwhite voters in cities and suburbs. State Rep. Bee Nguyen, D-Ga., gives remarks at \"The Asian Justice Rally \u2014 Break the Silence\" event on March 16 in Atlanta.\n                \n                    \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption State Rep. Bee Nguyen, D-Ga., gives remarks at \"The Asian Justice Rally \u2014 Break the Silence\" event on March 16 in Atlanta. \"The attacks were not backed up by any kind of facts,\" said Nguyen, who is the Democratic nominee for secretary of state. \"All of this was wrapped up in the greater scheme of the 'Big Lie.'\" The Georgia State Board of Elections recently dismissed a handful of complaints about drop boxes, where voters were alleged to each have deposited multiple ballots in a drop box. Investigators determined in each case that voters were legally dropping off ballots for their family members. Concerns over drop boxes are not limited to Georgia. In Wisconsin, for example, the Supreme Court recently ruled that ballot drop boxes were not allowed under state law. The court suggested that votes cast that way \"weaken the people's faith that the election produced an outcome reflective of their will,\" despite no evidence of fraud. Rep. Jan Jones, Georgia's Republican House speaker pro tem, said during a 2021 floor debate on the law that the drop box provision would provide parity for all Georgia voters. \"The vast majority of counties that offered one drop box will continue to do so,\" Jones said at the time. \"And the very few that had multiple drop boxes will have them according to their population.\" But NPR, WABE and GPB found that the uniformity of drop boxes across the state came at the expense of urban and suburban voters, who make up most of the electorate. The drop boxes in cities and suburbs are now so widely spread out that they have become complicated to access in places already dealing with traffic gridlock or unreliable public transportation. When Jessica Owens arrived at the library branch a 10-minute drive from her suburban Atlanta home to deposit her ballot in the May primary, the drop box she used in 2020 was gone. Jessica Owens used a ballot drop box that was a 10-minute drive from her house in 2020. But this year the box was removed and she struggled to find one close to her home.\n                \n                    \n                    Sam Gringlas/WABE\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jessica Owens used a ballot drop box that was a 10-minute drive from her house in 2020. But this year the box was removed and she struggled to find one close to her home. After several hours driving around Gwinnett County with her two toddlers in the backseat, poring over maps and scouring the internet to try and find one, Owens was almost ready to give up. She finally contacted her state representative, who told her that the closest one was now nearly an hour drive roundtrip. \"Now, I have to plan my day around dropping off the ballot,\" Owens said. \"An hour doesn't feel like a long time, but when you have two small kids, it is.\" Loading... Twenty-three drop boxes were spread across Gwinnett County in 2020. Under the new law, only six remain in Georgia's second-largest county \u2014 one of its most diverse. In 2020, more than 70% of urban and suburban voters lived within 10 minutes' travel of a drop box, the analysis by NPR, WABE and GPB found. That number dropped to less than 50% for this year's midterms. The percentage of rural voters who can access a drop box within 10 minutes of their home this year is 22%, about the same as it was two years ago, the analysis found. Fulton County voters leave an early voting site located inside C.T.

Martin Natatorium and Recreation Center in Atlanta on May 18. Edward Grimes, 71, showed up at the C.T. Martin Natatorium and Recreation Center in Atlanta. It was the last day of early, in-person voting before the May primary, and Grimes wanted to deliver his ballot in the drop box. \"You don't have to stand in line, you just go in, put it in the box and you're out,\" Grimes said, noting the line of mostly Black voters that coiled around the lobby. \"I don't think you can beat that.\" Grimes is in the minority. Less than 1% of Fulton County voters used a drop box this year, compared to 6.3% in the 2020 primary, according to county election officials. Interim Fulton County Elections Director Nadine Williams said many voters who took advantage of a drop box in 2020 did not use it again in 2022, mostly because the new laws have made them inconvenient. \"If you're going to have to get out of the car to go inside, you might as well go ahead and vote,\" Williams said. Fulton County, like other mostly urban and suburban counties, invested heavily in drop boxes in 2020 as a way to remove voting barriers. But when state lawmakers imposed new limits on the boxes a year later, election officials were forced to slash the county's drop box offerings from 38 to seven. \"There was no way we could possibly cover everything 100%,\" Williams said. \"We did the best we could.\" Nadine Williams, interim elections director for Fulton County, speaks during the Board of Registration and Elections meeting at Assembly Hall in Atlanta on July 14.\n                \n                    \n                    Audra Melton for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Nadine Williams, interim elections director for Fulton County, speaks during the Board of Registration and Elections meeting at Assembly Hall in Atlanta on July 14. Limiting access to drop boxes could also worsen existing voting problems in these mostly communities of color, which already have more voters assigned to polling places and longer lines on Election Day. An NPR/ProPublica analysis in 2020 found about two-thirds of Georgia's polling places that had to stay open late because of long lines in the state's primary were in majority-Black neighborhoods, despite those neighborhoods comprising about a third of the state's polls. Some election experts also worry that restricting drop boxes not only makes it harder for voters to cast their ballots but may discourage them from voting at all. \"When we look at it in terms of the data, it may be a two-minute increase (each way),\" Gonzalez O'Brien said. \"That may be something that for some voters will lead to them not casting a ballot.\" The actual burden on voters is difficult to measure, since the data analysis doesn't take into account other factors such as rush-hour traffic, he said. Gonzalez O'Brien has co-authored two studies that examined drop box access and voter turnout in Washington state, which has conducted solely absentee voting since 2013. The studies suggest that proximity to a drop box isn't just a matter of convenience; living farther away from a drop box is associated with a lower likelihood of voting. But little research has been done on drop boxes and turnout. Studies on other similar voting methods, like vote by mail, have had mixed results. Still, Gonzalez O'Brien said that voting methods proven to be secure should be available to voters. \"I don't believe there are any studies saying making voting easier actually leads to less voting,\" he said.

While some voters in urban and suburban communities find ways to overcome the new obstacles of using a drop box, doing so is even harder for marginalized populations, such as voters who are less likely to own a car. In 2020, nearly 90% of voters in those communities were able to reach a drop box within 10 minutes. By 2022, that plummeted to 56%, NPR, WABE and GPB found. The bulk of these neighborhoods are majority Black and voted overwhelmingly for Biden. Loading... Kristin Nabers, the Georgia state director of All Voting is Local, a voting rights nonprofit, said even with restrictions on the location and hours, drop boxes remain valuable for people with limited options. \"I think it's key that we keep those drop boxes available for people who need to send their ballot with a family member or a disabled person who needs to send it with a caretaker,\" she said. Nabers said that Georgia's history with laws that discriminate against nonwhite voters also looms over the drop box changes, prompting voting rights groups to educate voters of the changes. \"I truly believe that the motivation for rolling back drop boxes is to make it harder for voters, particularly in urban communities, to vote,\" Nabers said. \"And I really think it's a shame that our leaders listened to the conspiracy theorists and actually took action that made voting harder.\" While Georgia Republicans have touted expanding access to drop boxes in counties that did not offer them in 2020, voters in many of those communities  \u2014 mostly rural \u2014 haven't used them. In Heard County, near the Alabama border, elections director Tonnie Adams said the one drop box he's required by law to keep is pointless for his county's roughly 8,000 voters. Voters encounter three election employees before getting to the drop box, so they just drop off the ballots with them. \"We basically have a useless drop box,\" he said, adding that no one used the drop box in the May primary. In most elections, especially in rural areas, an overwhelming number of Georgians vote in person \u2014 either during the three week early voting period or on Election Day. In Putnam County, about 80 miles southeast of Atlanta, 107 of the nearly 12,000 ballots were returned via drop box in the November 2020 election. Chattahoochee County saw only 10 ballots returned in the drop box, according to election records. Election directors are now required to follow the new law instead of making decisions that best serve their voters.

Democrats, including Biden, have slammed provisions in the new law as being akin to \"Jim Crow 2.0.\" But Republicans have publicly insisted the law makes it \"easy to vote and hard to cheat.\" The reality of Georgia's drop box changes tracked through the analysis by NPR, WABE and GPB paints a more complex picture than political absolutes. Gonzalez O'Brien said that any changes to voting laws, particularly the use of drop boxes, matter. \"Could it only have effects on the margins for certain voters? Sure,\" he said. \"But even if those effects are only marginal, what is the justification for it?\" So far, the changes have been more than marginal for some Georgia voters, including Monica Poole. In the May primary, Poole's absentee ballot was one of about 1,200 rejected for arriving too late, records show. She said she has lost confidence in Georgia's voting system and didn't vote in the runoff election in June. \"It just makes you feel apathetic,\" Poole said.

How NPR estimated the amount of time different voters need to travel to a drop box For each drop box location, NPR generated travel time maps, or areas in which a voter can travel to the drop box by driving and public transit within given time frames. NPR used TravelTime to generate transit travel time maps and here.com for driving travel time maps. NPR then overlaid the travel time maps with voter addresses to estimate the minimum time frames it would take for each voter to get to a drop box within their county. NPR used the drop box data, 2022 drop box locations provided by the state, and Georgia's voter rolls to calculate travel time intervals to drop boxes available in 2020 and 2022 for nearly every voter. The travel time analysis excluded one drop box in Chattahoochee Hills, Ga., that was available for just over a week during the 2020 election season. You can view the analysis here. Characteristics of each voter including race and ethnicity are from the registered voter list from the Georgia secretary of state; the census-tract-level income and ownership data comes from American Community Survey, and precinct voting data is compiled by The New York Times.

            "article_content": "President Biden's agenda is stuck and his standing with the public is at historic lows. Former White House chiefs of staff offer insights on what's going wrong and what could turn things around.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: The dissatisfaction the president is facing among Democrats has driven his approval rating with the public down to just 36% in our new poll. That could make midterm elections brutal for the Biden White House. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson talked with three former White House chiefs of staff about what, if anything, Biden can do to help his party avoid disaster this fall. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: There's no shortage of advice for Joe Biden these days. Move left. Move to the center. Be bolder. Fight harder. Pass legislation. Sign more executive orders. Leon Panetta has lived through a lot of difficult election cycles, but this one may be the toughest. LEON PANETTA: Look, there's no question that there are serious problems out there facing President Biden and the Democrats. I think 85% of the American people think that the nation's headed in the wrong direction. LIASSON: There's inflation, mass shootings, a war in Europe and conservative Supreme Court rulings on abortion, guns and climate change. Panetta, who was Bill Clinton's chief of staff, thinks Biden's biggest problem isn't any one of those things; it's something more fundamental. PANETTA: The worst part of this administration is that they have just failed in terms of the message to the American people. You know, the president tries to address each of these crises, but it gives the impression that it's kind of a hit-and-miss process. The key is to try to develop a very simple and coherent message about just exactly what is Joe Biden, and the Democratic Party for that matter - what are they trying to do for the nation? LIASSON: John Podesta, another former Democratic White House chief of staff, says that simple message has to communicate that Republicans have gone too far. JOHN PODESTA: Whether that's the conspiracy that led to the violence that caused January 6 or whether it's issues that are more central to people's individual lives - perhaps like Roe, like guns, like environmental protection, worker safety, etc. - I think that people get a sense that this is a party that really has gone to the extreme. And Biden can, I think, be quite helpful in making that case. LIASSON: Podesta thinks there's still time for the president to make a forceful argument that will help energize Democrats. Republicans, not surprisingly, disagree. John Sununu was George H.W. Bush's chief of staff. He thinks there's little Biden can do at this point. JOHN SUNUNU: And I don't think they have either the capacity or the time to make the changes necessary to try and salvage 2022. LIASSON: What would those changes be? According to Sununu... SUNUNU: Deal with the energy issue by incentivizing aggressively domestic production. No. 2 - not go to expansion of government spending. And No. 3 - recognize that the border issue is a real issue. LIASSON: What about inflation, the No. 1 issue for voters? There's not much Biden or any president can do about that. It's a global problem, mostly caused by supply chain issues. But, says John Podesta, the president should surely be caught trying. PODESTA: The job of getting inflation down is largely with the Fed. But to the extent that the president can do everything he can to show that he's fighting to get inflation under control, I think that's another useful avenue for him. LIASSON: If Democrats want to turn what is usually a referendum on the party in power into a clear choice between two parties, Leon Panetta thinks Biden has to make that choice as big and consequential as possible. PANETTA: What Joe Biden has to say is we can lead, we can make things happen, and we can deal with these challenges. I think that sense of confidence is what's lacking right now. Biden has to say, we are strong enough as a country to deal with these challenges. LIASSON: Convincing the public to be confident is hard, especially since Biden has not been able to restore the sense of normalcy he promised in the 2020 campaign. But Panetta thinks he has to try since the stakes are so high. PANETTA: In the end, this really is a decision about whether our democracy is going to be governable and whether or not we're going to be able to deal with the challenges that we're confronting, or are we just going to have more chaos the way we had chaos the - in the four years of Trump? LIASSON: Democrats will try to make that chaos-versus-competence argument. It'll be easier if Donald Trump announces before November that he's running for president again. That would also be a reminder that what happens in November may not determine what happens in 2024. After all, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan all lost one or both houses of Congress in their first midterms but wound up winning reelection to become two-term presidents.

Former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence have thrown their weight behind competing GOP candidates in the Arizona race for governor in a move that further highlights the distance between two factions of the Republican following. On Monday Pence announced an endorsement for Karrin Taylor Robson, a former developer and Republican lobbyist, in a last-minute move ahead of the Aug. 2 primary. \"Karrin Taylor Robson is the only candidate for Governor that will keep Arizona's border secure and streets safe, empower parents and create great schools, and promote conservative values,\" Pence said in a statement. Last fall, Trump endorsed Kari Lake, a former local TV news anchor. Lake has centered her campaign around the false belief that the 2020 presidential election was stolen \u2014 claims not embraced by the state's current Republican Gov. Doug Ducey and other members of the party, including Robson. Over the weekend, Ducey told CNN's Dana Bash that Lake is \"misleading voters with no evidence,\" noting that he is also backing Robson. This is not the first time the two former running mates have backed opponents this election cycle. Earlier this year Pence rallied for Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp ahead of the state primary, while Trump backed challenger David Perdue. The move from Pence to rally for Kemp was seen at the time as the most outward effort to block Trump's influence. Kemp ultimately won the nomination.",

            "article_content": "Democratic leaders are hoping Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas holds onto his seat in November's midterm elections, even though he opposes abortion rights, a position at odds with his party brethren.  AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: Democrats, nationally, are vowing to fight for abortion rights after last month's Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. But there is one Democrat in a Texas district who opposes abortion rights - Henry Cuellar. He eked out a win after a brutal primary fight with a pro-abortion rights candidate in June. NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales has more from this district. CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: On a recent hot Texas evening, Azucena Garcia Palacios is out watering her lawn in front of her Laredo home. The 77-year-old retired teacher and grandmother canvasses door to door for Democrats. The people who answered her knock were often like-minded. AZUCENA GARCIA PALACIOS: In my experience, I would say more Democrats than Republicans. GRISALES: Palacios switches from English to Spanish as she reflects on her favored candidate in the recent Democratic primary - progressive Jessica Cisneros. Cisneros ran for Congress as a supporter of abortion rights in a state that has recently imposed strict limits. Palacios says there are women who do not want to be mothers, and she respects that. PALACIOS: (Speaking Spanish). GRISALES: Cisneros lost her primary fight to long-time incumbent Henry Cuellar, the last anti-abortion rights Democrat in the U.S. House, by less than 300 votes. Cuellar got national attention in January when the FBI searched his home and office, but he later said he was not the target of a criminal probe. Now he's looking at a new battle to keep the district in Democrats' hands this November. JON TAYLOR: It tends to be more conservative than people realize. GRISALES: That's politics professor Jon Taylor at The University of Texas in San Antonio. Taylor says Cuellar's Texas Congressional District 28 is oddly drawn and gerrymandered, stretching from the conservative pockets of Laredo, two hours north to more liberal sections near San Antonio. As a result, Democratic leadership, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, threw their support behind Cuellar, even as his abortion stance goes against the party's platform. TAYLOR: That pro-life angle doesn't hurt when you're talking to, essentially, middle-class and working-class Latino voters. GRISALES: Taylor says recent Texas laws to end abortion access has energized conservatives. One of those Cuellar voters is retired firefighter Jose Aguirre. He's visiting Jarvis Plaza park near Laredo's bus depot to feed the homeless on a recent afternoon. JOSE AGUIRRE: Well, I'm pro-life myself. I'm a Christian. I believe life starts at conception. GRISALES: Aguirre, a supporter of former President Trump, is not ruling out plans to vote for Republicans in the midterms, but, for now, lauds Cuellar as a strong candidate. AGUIRRE: Well, he's been here for a long time, you know? And he's - I think he's, like, what they call a moderate Democrat, you know? Because you have some that are very radical. GRISALES: Cuellar, who gives limited interviews with the media, declined to comment through his office. Professor Taylor says a big challenge in the district is low voter turnout, which can top out at less than 20% in some elections. TAYLOR: They're usually abysmal. GRISALES: At an apartment northeast of San Antonio, a group of girlfriends are getting together for hot dogs on a Friday night. They're angry about the overturning of Roe v. Wade, and it's personal. SOFIA LUQUE: I almost lost my sister. GRISALES: That's makeup artist Sofia Luque, who says her sister had to have an emergency abortion in order to stay alive. But despite her anger, Luque, her partner Asia Kopp and their friend Veronica Lawrence all agree they probably will not vote any time soon. VERONICA LAWRENCE: Honestly, I've never had any faith in politics, so I stay out of it. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: I'm the same way. GRISALES: Back in more conservative Laredo, Roxy Aguero is at a park on the north side with her two young children. She's not sure she made the right choice voting for Cuellar in the Democratic primary. ROXY AGUERO: To be honest, like, I feel like I don't have the time to, like, read up on people or nothing or what's going on. GRISALES: Cisneros had an aggressive outreach strategy, but it did not work for Aguero. AGUERO: Oh, my God. I felt like that lady would call me more than once, like, a day. GRISALES: She illustrates how tough it was for Cisneros to break through with voters, even someone who supports abortion rights. And now that Roe v. Wade has been overturned, she's worried about voting for Cuellar come November. AGUERO: I feel like we should do whatever we need to do with our bodies, like, as a woman. Like, they shouldn't be able to just put a law that says no abortions. I mean, who are they? GRISALES: About a mile east, at the home of Azucena Palacios, she says in her native Spanish she's past the age of having kids, but she's worried about abortion rights, too. PALACIOS: The Roe v. Wade (speaking Spanish). GRISALES: Palacios says since she's a loyal Democrat, she'll reluctantly vote for Cuellar in November. But it's unclear if voters like Palacios will be enough to keep the district in Democrats' hands as Republicans increasingly see the Texas border region as an opportunity to expand their reach.

            "article_content": "Ahead of Virginia's statewide primaries, we visit the 7th Congressional District, which is slated to be a close contest in November. And we ask voters about the impact of the Jan. 6 hearings.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: The House committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol plans to hold two more hearings this week. So how are those hearings landing with voters? Ben Paviour from member station VPM takes us to a swing district in Virginia, where primary voters go to the polls tomorrow. BEN PAVIOUR, BYLINE: Kimberly Berryman (ph) is a strategic grocery shopper. Her budget is tight, and she goes to a few spots in Fredericksburg, Va., to find the best deal. KIMBERLY BERRYMAN: Doing it all in one shot because, you know, gas prices, you have to, you know, make the whole trip count. PAVIOUR: Berryman lives in the countryside, far enough out that she puts a cooler in her trunk to keep her corn cold. For Berryman, it's worlds away from the January 6 hearing going on at the Capitol. BERRYMAN: I've got other things to do. I really do. I mean, I really don't pay attention to a lot of it, like I said. PAVIOUR: Berryman says she usually votes for Democrats. That includes this swing district's current representative, Abigail Spanberger. Berryman says the January 6 attack was shocking, but she's more focused on rising bills and says Democrats aren't doing enough to fix it. BERRYMAN: I don't think so at all. I'm really - like I said, I'm really disappointed because there's just so much that's going on. And then, you know, it's like they're sweeping things under the rug. PAVIOUR: Berryman says she'd consider voting for a Republican if they address her concerns. I asked Spanberger how she would respond to voters like Berryman, who believe Democrats are too focused on January 6 at the expense of the economy. ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: I would say that, certainly, I'm not that Democrat. PAVIOUR: It's not that Spanberger is ignoring January 6. She was in the House chamber during the assault on the Capitol. She remembers watching the scene unfold from the gallery. SPANBERGER: Capitol police officers barricading up the door with benches and tables. PAVIOUR: And Spanberger believes the hearings are important for the health of the U.S. democracy. SPANBERGER: And ensuring that something like we saw on January 6 doesn't ever occur in the future. PAVIOUR: But the two-term Democrat says the hearings haven't stopped her from focusing on pocketbook issues. She sponsored legislation designed to prevent baby formula shortages and another to recruit more truckers to address supply chain issues. And she'd prefer to keep the focus there, rather than on the last president or even the current one. Spanberger won't say whether she wants President Biden to run again. SPANBERGER: I'm focused on November '22 and continuing to serve my constituents. PAVIOUR: The six Republicans vying to take on Spanberger have worked to pin her to Biden. Yesli Vega, a sheriff's deputy running for the GOP nomination, railed against the president and Spanberger to a crowd of a couple dozen Republicans in a gated community outside Fredericksburg. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) YESLI VEGA: Tell me one thing that they've done good aside from electing and converting more Republicans? UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Laughter). VEGA: What have they done? PAVIOUR: Despite the moderate lean of the district, Vega and her five GOP competitors are aligning themselves with Donald Trump. She says Democrats have squandered Trump's legacy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VEGA: They were handed the most secureist (ph) border, a thriving economy. PAVIOUR: Another Republican in the field, Bryce Reeves, has made Trump a focus of his ads. (SOUNDBITE OF BRYCE REEVES CAMPAIGN AD) BRYCE REEVES: President Trump showed us how to stand up for the principles and values that make America great. I'm ready to finish what he started. PAVIOUR: Most of the GOP candidates in the district have downplayed the January 6 attack. Some voters at Vega's event, like Deanne Marshall (ph), say the hearings aren't fair. DEANNE MARSHALL: They're not showing the whole story and have no opposition. There's no true Republicans on that forum. PAVIOUR: None of the GOP candidates will say whether they would have voted to certify the 2020 election. And the winner of this seat will be in the chamber after the next presidential election. For some Democratic voters in the district, like Courtney Dubois (ph), the January 6 hearings drive home the stakes. COURTNEY DUBOIS: I believe it's important because everybody needs to know what's happening and what has happened and what we - the steps we can take to prevent this from happening again. PAVIOUR: But with so much else on voters' minds, Dubois says she can only hope the hearings cut through the noise. For NPR News, I'm Ben Paviour in Richmond.

BOGOT\u00c1, Colombia \u2014 In a shock to a political system long dominated by traditional parties and machine politics, an eccentric, 77-year-old populist who promises drastic budget cuts and jail for corrupt officials now has a good shot of winning Colombia's presidential elections. Unknown to most Colombians until just a few months ago, Rodolfo Hern\u00e1ndez, a real estate mogul and a former mayor, garnered enough votes in the May 29 first-round election to earn a spot in Sunday's runoff against leftist Gustavo Petro. The latest polls show Hern\u00e1ndez neck and neck with Petro, a former guerrilla fighter and veteran politician who had been the clear front-runner all year long. \"Thank you, Colombians,\" Hern\u00e1ndez said in a video message to his supporters after beating four other candidates and finishing runner-up to Petro in the first round of voting. \"I am counting on you to win the runoff.\" The video, shot from Hern\u00e1ndez's kitchen with appliances and a pot-filled stove in the background, was in keeping with his austere image. Although Hern\u00e1ndez earned millions in real estate, he says he's not spending much on his campaign. Rather than barnstorming the country giving speeches, he communicates via TikTok videos and softball interviews, usually focusing on government graft, which he claims is the root of Colombia's problems. In a recent interview on Colombian TV, he said that nearly all politicians were \"traitors, liars, clowns and hypocrites and we are going to kick them out.\" If he wins, he plans to hold a simple inaugural in a poor town, saying normal swearing-in ceremonies at the presidential palace with hundreds of guests waste taxpayer money on caviar, Champagne and whisky. Despite his age, Hern\u00e1ndez says he will be on the job from dawn until dusk to cram 5 1/2 years of work into a four-year presidential term. \"Colombia is a beautiful country that has been run by thieves,\" he said in the TV interview, \"and the results have been fatal.\" Presidential candidate Gustavo Petro, of the Historical Pact coalition, attends a June 8 meeting with people with disabilities in Bogot\u00e1. Colombians will go to the polls on Sunday to elect a new president.\n                \n                    \n                    Fernando Vergara/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Presidential candidate Gustavo Petro, of the Historical Pact coalition, attends a June 8 meeting with people with disabilities in Bogot\u00e1. Colombians will go to the polls on Sunday to elect a new president. Hern\u00e1ndez's rival, Petro, is trying to become Colombia's first-ever left-wing president. Thus, no matter who wins, the incoming leader will take the country in a new direction. All this, according to analysts, is the result of decades of corruption and unkept promises by traditional politicians as well as the COVID-19 pandemic that threw millions of Colombians into poverty. However, 62-year-old Petro is a former Bogot\u00e1 mayor and a longtime opposition senator who is on his third run for the presidency. Compared to Hern\u00e1ndez, he is old news, says Lawrence J. Gumbiner, a former U.S. diplomat who has advised Hern\u00e1ndez on international affairs. The feeling among many voters, Gumbiner says, is that \"all these guys who have been around all these years, we don't like any of them. We don't really know who this guy [Hern\u00e1ndez] is but we're so sick of everybody who has been around all these years that we are willing to roll the dice on him.\" Adding to Hern\u00e1ndez's rise is lingering fear of Petro. Business leaders are worried about Petro's plans to gradually phase out the production of oil, the country's main export, to renegotiate trade deals with countries like the United States, and reform the pension system. Petro has also pledged to forge closer ties to the authoritarian regime in neighboring Venezuela. Partly as a result, Hern\u00e1ndez has received a wave of endorsements from establishment parties and politicians, including Federico Guti\u00e9rrez. He was the conservative, pro-government candidate who finished third in the May 29 vote. He claims Petro could become a leftist dictator, like Venezuela's Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, and in his concession speech he urged Colombians to back Hern\u00e1ndez. \"We have to save liberty and democracy because once they are gone, they don't come back,\" Guti\u00e9rrez warned. But critics claim that Hern\u00e1ndez harbors an authoritarian streak. He has praised President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador for ordering army troops to occupy that country's Congress building in 2020 to intimidate legislators into supporting his policies. Hern\u00e1ndez lacks a majority in Colombian Congress but said he would put up billboards of allegedly corrupt lawmakers and shame them into supporting his agenda. In addition, he refuses to face the scrutiny of televised debates or hard-hitting journalists, preferring to communicate directly with voters through social media. \"His Achilles' heel is his populist tendencies and his appreciation for the strongman style of governance,\" Gumbiner says. Hern\u00e1ndez's headstrong approach was on full display in 2018 when he was mayor of the northern city of Bucaramanga, the only important political post he has held. He was caught on video screaming at a city councilman \u2014 and then slapping him \u2014 in an argument over corruption. Indeed, for all his talk of clean government, Hern\u00e1ndez himself is facing corruption charges over a public works contract from his time as mayor in a case set to go to trial in July \u2014 just weeks before the new president will be sworn in. In a May 29 speech, Petro told his supporters: \"My opponent is accused of corruption. Do we want that? You don't fight corruption by sending out messages on TikTok.\" Hern\u00e1ndez has also made some stunning gaffes. In a radio interview last year, for example, he said he is a \"follower of a great German thinker named Adolf Hitler,\" but later clarified that he meant Albert Einstein, saying he has no love for the Nazi ruler. In video message to voters in Vichada, a remote department in eastern Colombia that borders Venezuela, he asked his interviewer: \"Vichada? What's that?\" Yet he still won the most votes in Vichada in the first round of voting. Ideologically, Hern\u00e1ndez is hard to pin down. He's pro-business but also supports abortion rights, same-sex marriage and drug legalization and backs Colombia's 2016 peace treaty that disarmed the country's largest guerrilla group. Yet he's failed to flesh out his proposals on everything from national security to the economy. However, many Colombians are drawn more to Hern\u00e1ndez's style than his substance. Among them is Marco Moreno, who runs a bike shop on the outskirts of Bogot\u00e1. Hern\u00e1ndez \"is very firm in his decisions,\" Moreno says. \"He's radical. And that's what's good about him.\"",

Brian Kemp won his Republican primary with broad support, though former President Donald Trump backed a well-known challenger to the incumbent. Former President Donald Trump has been a near-constant presence in this year's Republican primaries. Candidates have eagerly sought his endorsement, with some making a pilgrimage to his Mar-a-Lago estate to ask for his support in person. Trump has at times used his endorsement as a tool of revenge, in an attempt to take down GOP officeholders who have crossed him \u2014 most notably those who did not support his effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election. But with several weeks of primaries now complete, a trend has emerged: Republican voters \u2014 even those who maintain Trump was a great president \u2014 are not marching in lockstep with him. Many are instead bucking his endorsements. \"Republican voters are not monolithic,\" veteran GOP strategist Dallas Woodhouse said. \"They are not falling all over each other waiting to hear who Trump endorses to make their decision.\" Yes, it is a factor, Woodhouse added, \"and it can be a big factor, but it's not necessarily the determinant factor.\" Some voters undoubtedly have been waiting on Trump. Take Kathy Deal, for instance. When she spoke with NPR back in March, the resident of Lancaster, Ohio, was undecided and eager to hear from Trump on the state's Republican candidates for U.S. Senate. \"That would definitely seal it for sure, it would seal it,\" Deal said, weeks before Trump made a late endorsement of Hillbilly Elegy author J.D. Vance, who would go on to win the nomination. It was a very different story for one voter weeks later in Pennsylvania. Seventy-one-year-old Trump supporter Bob Rapp was not pleased that the former president had endorsed celebrity TV doctor Mehmet Oz in the GOP Senate contest there. Rapp told NPR in April that he doesn't think Oz is even a conservative. \"Some of his stances have been pretty liberal on his TV show,\" Rapp said. \"I'm just concerned that he may be a RINO [Republican in name only].\" But that didn't mean being at odds with Trump over Oz had affected his strong admiration for the former president. \"No, because it's his prerogative,\" Rapp said. \"You don't agree with your leaders 100% of the time.\" He maintained firmly that Trump's endorsement wouldn't sway him. Oz did eventually win the nomination in an extremely close contest. Rapp told NPR later that he voted for businessman Dave McCormick, who conceded during a recount. Though Mehmet Oz, a Trump-backed Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, narrowly won his primary, many conservative voters had doubts about him.\n                \n                    \n                    Ted Shaffrey/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Taking a broad look at how Trump's endorsements have fared so far, his win-loss record is strong, but a lot of that is because mostly he backs popular incumbents or frontrunners, like Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano, who didn't really need his support to secure a nomination. In other contests Trump's record is more mixed. \"Trump's endorsement is not a magic wand or a silver bullet,\" said Sarah Longwell, a longtime GOP consultant and the publisher of The Bulwark website. She's been watching the impact of Trump endorsements and notes that in certain situations it can provide a big boost, especially in highly competitive races with lots of candidates. In such contests, Trump's support can mean more press coverage and create momentum. Longwell says that's what happened in Ohio's U.S. Senate primary. \"Where there's a big group of Republicans, and they're all battling it out, and they're all telling the voters how terrible their opponents are, and people are kind of not sure who they like, and when Trump comes in with an endorsement,  it tends to kind of elevate people in these races,\" she said. Longwell says that laundry list of factors all aligned to help Vance win in Ohio. But not all of Trump's picks get such a boost, especially when they are the challenger attempting to knock off an incumbent with high name recognition and a track record. Take Georgia, where Trump put his credibility on the line by endorsing challengers to a pair of Republican incumbents \u2014 Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Both men crossed Trump when they rebuffed his requests that they use their power to overturn Trump's loss in Georgia in the 2020 election. Trump based his endorsements in these races entirely on his lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and that these two elected officials betrayed him by not supporting him in that falsehood. But there was a problem for Trump in these contests: Kemp and Raffensperger each had a broad base of support among GOP voters, and each had a record of accomplishment that could compete with Trump's bid for vengeance. Longwell has been conducting regular focus groups with Trump supporters. In a session with Georgia voters, she heard from people like Laura (focus group members are only identified by their first name), who was still undecided about her vote, but who still had good things to say about the governor. \"I like what Brian Kemp has done,\" Laura said, \"and I liked how he handled COVID.\" Then for emphasis, she added: \"The state seems to be running smoothly to me.\" It's not known who Laura eventually cast her ballot for, but it is known that Kemp won reelection by a margin of more than 50 percentage points. Raffensperger won his primary too, also by a substantial margin of 19 points. Then there's an example in North Carolina, where even a Trump endorsement couldn't save scandal-plagued Congressman Madison Cawthorn in his primary. GOP strategist Woodhouse says Trump may have actually helped Cawthorn in what was a very tough primary from a conservative challenger. At the very least, Woodhouse said, \"Nobody is going to blame the president for Cawthorn's loss because Cawthorn had had a long series of self-inflicted wounds.\" Still, he says, it does help demonstrate how a Trump endorsement has limits. Woodhouse says a key part of all this is the overall makeup of the races in Republican primaries this year \u2014 and likely into the near future. In contest after contest, voters are not choosing between a Trump-endorsed candidate and an anti-Trump candidate. Most every GOP hopeful runs on a pro-Trump list of issues. Sometimes that includes support for the lie that Trump really won in 2020, but it also always includes support for Trump's positions and rhetoric on issues like building a southern border wall and getting tough with China on trade \u2014 with lots of cultural issues thrown in. \"I mean, any candidates going forward are going to adopt those core issues that were part of the America First agenda,\" Woodhouse said. So even if his candidate loses, Trump's issues are very much on the winning side in these primaries. And there's another potentially significant impact Trump is having in the primaries: He's endorsing candidates far down the ballot, for local races, something unheard of for a former president. Longwell said that allows Republicans to increase their presence in key local offices that don't typically get a lot of attention on Election Day, \"which allows people who are totally unknown, and maybe even in many cases running unopposed for offices that people pay almost no attention to, to raise some money, to gain some profile.\" For the GOP, she said, it's a matter of building a deep bench of officeholders \"to really fill that with people who are very much in Donald Trump's image.\" And that could end being Trump's biggest impact on the 2022 elections.",

Chris Sununu wanted both of the state's congressional districts to remain competitive.\n                \n                    \n                    Charles Krupa/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu wanted both of the state's congressional districts to remain competitive. New Hampshire has two congressional districts, which means every 10 years, state lawmakers have to draw one line between them. For the last 140 or so years, that line hasn't changed much. \"I heard somebody say the original districts have been pretty much the same since the 1800s, when we were moving stuff around the state by steam train, horse and wagon, and riverboats,\" state Rep. Steven Smith, who's deputy House speaker, recently told colleagues. The Republican urged lawmakers to blow up the state's current map. \"Every 10 years it is the job of the legislature to come up with a plan,\" he said. \"Not figure out if the old plan is OK \u2014 can we maybe just tweak it a little? But to come up with a plan that makes sense today.\" The GOP-led legislature followed through, passing a map to dramatically redraw the districts. But the plan fell apart, with a fellow Republican standing in the way. With their map, GOP lawmakers in New Hampshire aimed to give a boost to Republicans in the 1st District, which covers the eastern portion of the state, while giving Democrats a boost in the 2nd District, which borders Vermont to the west. On top of that, it placed the two incumbent U.S. representatives \u2014 both Democrats \u2014 into the same district. These types of political calculations have been made across the country this year amid redistricting, with Republicans or Democrats in power either shoring up the districts of their incumbents, or trying to squeeze out the other party. The end result is a continued decrease in the number of districts considered competitive nationally. In New Hampshire, party leaders openly talked about their desire to draw a GOP-friendly seat after winning control of the legislature in 2020. But Republican Gov. Chris Sununu bucked the national trend when he vetoed the map last month. \"I made it pretty clear, and they didn't want to take that advice, and I don't think my veto on any of those maps shocked them,\" Sununu recently told reporters. For months, the three-term governor talked openly about a map needing to pass what he dubbed a \"smell test.\" Essentially, Sununu wanted both of the districts to remain competitive. \"I think Republicans can win both congressional districts,\" he said. \"In fact, I'm very confident Republicans are going to win both congressional districts.\" Sununu is optimistic about a GOP wave this November, but Republicans have only carried the 2nd District once since 2006. The 1st District, currently held by Democrat Chris Pappas, has proven to be a true swing district for nearly two decades. There, a small boost in GOP voters could have made the difference, harming Pappas' chances for reelection. He, like a lot of Democrats, has criticized the state legislature's process. \"What we saw happen in the legislature really didn't speak to the way it is usually done in New Hampshire,\" Pappas said after filing his formal paperwork for reelection. \"At every step of the way, legislators were influenced by politics. They wanted to create one district where it was a foregone conclusion that a certain party would win.\" With Sununu's veto, the political process formally ended, and a legal one took over. The New Hampshire Supreme Court stepped in and, a day before the candidate filing period opened, approved a politically neutral map drawn by an outside expert. It makes only minor changes to the 2010 map, moving just five small towns to balance the district populations. Inside the state capitol, this entire process was center stage for weeks. But in one of those towns ultimately redistricted, Jackson, in the bucolic White Mountains, it barely seems to have registered. Outside of a coffee shop, Margaret Graciano said she wasn't aware of the redistricting, \"but I feel OK about it.\" Tom Seidel, her husband, liked that the map wasn't tilted, noting he prefers \"the idea of potentially having two purple districts rather than a blue and red district.\" Outside political analysts also forecast the races as competitive, including the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which has labeled both districts as toss-ups.",

Democrats haven't had representation in decades and have three candidates in Tuesday's primary, along with a big-name Republican.  SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST: Montana will elect two representatives to the U.S. House for the first time in 30 years. A Democrat hasn't won a House seat in the state since 1994, and in one of the races, three Democrats are running against a prominent Trump-backed Republican. Montana Public Radio's Shaylee Ragar has more. SHAYLEE RAGAR, BYLINE: Montana was one of six states that gained representation in Congress after the 2020 census recorded 95,000 new residents here. Ron Jarmin, then acting director of the U.S. Census Bureau, announced those results in April of last year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RON JARMIN: Texas will gain two seats, and Colorado, Florida, Montana, North Carolina and Oregon will each gain one seat. RAGAR: Montana is the only state in U.S. history to gain back a seat it lost. Christina Barsky, a professor and elections expert at the University of Montana, says this election will be a test of whether this once purple state is now red. CHRISTINA BARSKY: So now we'll have the opportunity to sort of see if, in this election, we have different representation. RAGAR: Not only has Montana not elected a Democrat to the U.S. House since 1994, the state has also not sent a woman to Congress since Jeannette Rankin was reelected after being the first woman to serve - ever - on Capitol Hill. This election, Barsky says... BARSKY: I think it's still up in the air. RAGAR: The state's eastern House district is seen as a safe Republican seat. Cook Political Report rates the state's western district race as politically competitive, but likely Republican. There are three Democrats, two of whom are women, competing for their party's nomination in the western district. BARSKY: I think that there's a great interest from Democrats - people that vote Democratic in the state - to see greater representation in terms of electing a person from their party to Congress. RAGAR: Last year, the Democrats on the state's independent districting commission saw an opportunity to draw the new political boundaries in a way that would make them competitive. But the race also includes a big-name Republican. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Ryan Zinke, Navy SEAL... RAGAR: Former Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke and four other Republicans are vying for the seat. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Zinke helped Trump build the border wall on federal lands despite opposition. He kept fentanyl and meth out of Montana communities. RAGAR: Zinke is the presumed front-runner on the Republican side, who has far outraised his opponents. He's also had this job before, from 2015 to 2017. After about two years in former President Donald Trump's administration, he resigned in early 2019 amid several investigations into complaints against him. The agency found later that he failed to comply with ethics obligations of his position. Zinke called it a political hit job. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: Ryan has my complete and total endorsement. RAGAR: Zinke is leaning on his relationship with Trump. The two held a 10-minute tele-rally over the phone last month. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: With his help and with everybody's help, this country will be turned around. RAGAR: Zinke has called Trump, in multiple interviews, a kingmaker. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RYAN ZINKE: I'm a believer in President Trump and the policies, and we can get back to where America needs to be. RAGAR: So far, Trump has a winning record for his endorsees, but there have also been losses in states like Georgia, North Carolina and Idaho for Trump-backed Republicans. The Democrats running in the western district are Cora Neumann, a public health expert, Tom Winter, a former state lawmaker who works in broadband, and Monica Tranel, a longtime Montana energy attorney. The three often talk about why they think they're the best person to take on Zinke. Montanans will decide tomorrow who moves on to the general election and if Trump is still a kingmaker in Montana.

David Perdue in Georgia's Republican gubernatorial primary.\n                \n                    \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Gov. Brian Kemp trounced Trump-backed former Sen. David Perdue in Georgia's Republican gubernatorial primary. You'd be hard-pressed to find two Republican incumbents who drew more of former President Donald Trump's ire than Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. But both won by huge margins in their primaries Tuesday against handpicked, Trump-recruited challengers who campaigned on his election lies. Kemp won by 50 percentage points and Raffensperger by almost 20, according to results as of noon ET Wednesday. The background: Trump narrowly lost Georgia in the 2020 presidential election. Despite multiple recounts, he falsely claimed that the election was somehow stolen. Kemp would not go along with that and neither would Raffensperger, who is the state's top election official. Trump infamously asked Raffensperger in a January 2021 call to \"find\" him the votes needed. \"Fellas, I need 11,000 votes,\" Trump told Raffensperger and staff on that call. \"Give me a break.\" Trump's fury with Georgia election officials grew, and he set out to oust them from office. He recruited former Sen. David Perdue to take on Kemp and Rep. Jody Hice to go against Raffensperger. So what happened? In the end, Trump's candidates in Georgia largely flailed \u2014 though his pick for Georgia U.S. Senate, Herschel Walker, easily won his primary, and some other allies won elsewhere, like his former press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who is likely to be the next governor of Arkansas. But what happened with Kemp and Raffensperger in Georgia? Here are three theories: Incumbents have a high reelection rate in this country. Once someone votes for a candidate, it makes it easier to vote for them again. They have a known record and have built a known brand. That's certainly the case in Georgia where, Kemp, for instance, touted conservative-backed measures he's signed into law, like a voting overhaul, and his past record of defeating Democrat Stacey Abrams in a general election matchup. In most places, Trump has dictated the terms of Republican politics. He's taken over the Republican National Committee and state parties across the country, and even candidates he hasn't endorsed have gone full MAGA, kissing the ring and hoping for the light of Trump's endorsement to shine down upon them. But Georgia was different in that the top state officials all lined up against Trump's lies, in different ways. Kemp, Raffensperger and Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan all put a degree of distance between themselves and Trump. Kemp appeared with some former Trump friends-turned-foes, like former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Vice President Mike Pence. Kemp didn't as much take on Trump head on as he quietly made him irrelevant in his campaign. Republican Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, who's not running for reelection, has gone after Donald Trump.\n                \n                    \n                    John Bazemore/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Duncan, on the other hand, went right after Trump, creating a Republican advocacy group called GOP 2.0. It even ran ads during this campaign season. \"Inflation at a 40-year high,\" Duncan says in an ad. \"Open borders. National security threats. But some politicians would rather talk about conspiracy theories and past losses. Letting liberal extremists take us in the wrong direction \u2014 a mistake our country simply can't afford. We must focus on the future and rebuild our party. But I am not alone in believing there is a better way forward.\" Duncan wasn't on the ballot \u2014 he opted not to run again \u2014 and Trump-backed Burt Jones is easily leading his race for lieutenant governor that may go to a runoff. The effort, though, is something Republican strategist Kevin Madden, a former senior adviser to Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign, told NPR was necessary a year after the Jan. 6 insurrection. He accused Republicans of not \"directly communicating with the base\" and merely \"reacting to the Trump factor.\" \u200b\u200b\"No one's taken him on directly,\" Madden said. \"They've all been reactionary, and they've all ceded the rostrum to him.\" It takes a lot to mount a sustained campaign against Trumpism, but that's happened more perhaps in Georgia than in other places. There's been lots of talk of Trump's potentially waning influence on the base. That shouldn't be exaggerated. Trump is still very popular within the GOP; he controls lots of levers of power within the party; as noted, many candidates are trying to be like Trump; and he would still be the far-and-away front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024. However, Trump has seen a decline among the GOP base in one key measure \u2014 how strongly Republicans feel about him. CNN's Harry Enten found that Trump's \"very favorable\" rating, in an average of surveys, has declined nearly 20 points since the eve of the 2020 presidential election. That's a significant decline, and shows the further someone gets from power, the potentially less influence they retain. \"[W]e've got hundreds of years' worth of history that shows us the former president loses their influence every day they're out of office,\" Duncan told Axios. \"And Donald Trump \u2014 although he wishes it wasn't the case \u2014 is no different.\" - End of Bush era: Tuesday saw the end of the Bush era in politics. George P. Bush, son of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, was trounced in his bid for Texas attorney general against scandal-plagued Ken Paxton. Bush will serve as land commissioner until the end of the year, but, as the Texas Tribune writes, Bush's loss \"heralds a shift in the Texas Republican politics away from the pro-business establishment and toward a more populist, combative and harsh style of politics.\" Bush even tried hard for Trump's endorsement, and, despite Trump teasing that he liked Bush, he lost. It shows where the power in the GOP in places like Texas \u2014 away from Bush and more toward Trump. - Too close to call: Incumbent Democrat Henry Cuellar and progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros remain locked in a runoff that remains too close to call. Cuellar has the name ID and power of the incumbency, but he is the only Democrat in Congress who is against abortion rights, which has gained more attention after the Supreme Court leak, and he's pushing against the new wave on the left of the Democratic Party.",

            "article_content": "The U.S. reels from a deadly school shooting in Uvalde, Texas. President Biden makes a new push for gun control. And, Gov. Brian Kemp wins Georgia's GOP primary over Trump-backed David Perdue.  LEILA FADEL, HOST: We begin with what has become a familiar tragedy in this country. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: A gunman opened fire yesterday at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas, and killed 19 children, two adults. Erika Escamilla heard the story when her niece came back from school. ERIKA ESCAMILLA: She just put her hands over her ears and got down into a ball, and she said, Tia, it felt like I was having a heart attack. She's like, I was so scared; I didn't know what to do. FADEL: NPR's Ashley Lopez is nearby in the city of Hondo, Texas. Hi, Ashley. ASHLEY LOPEZ, BYLINE: Hi, Leila. FADEL: So it was tough to hear Escamilla recounting her niece, a child, describing that attack. Can you tell us more about who was hurt and killed in the shooting? LOPEZ: So the number of reported casualties has changed a couple of times, of course, since the shooting was reported yesterday. But as of now, we know that at least 21 people have died - 19 were children, and two were adults. We know at least one of those adults was a teacher at the school. Robb Elementary teaches students from second to fourth grade. So the victims in the shooting were largely very young. FADEL: Now, Uvalde's a really small town, right? LOPEZ: Yeah, it's pretty small. It has a population of about 15,000 people, and it sits in between the Texas Hill Country, which is west of San Antonio, and South Texas, which is near the U.S.-Mexico border. The community here is predominantly Latino, and roughly 3 out of the 4 people here are Hispanic. And in a small town like Uvalde, a tragedy like this touches almost everyone who lives here. Our colleagues from Texas Public Radio talked to some of the residents of the community who attended a vigil last night. Erika Escamilla has several nieces and nephews who attend the school. They all survived. She described the nightmare that unfolded in the school, as teachers worked quickly to put classes in lockdown, locking doors, turning off lights and telling children to get down. ESCAMILLA: My niece was crying to me, and she was saying that she heard the guy cussing. She heard, like, loud yelling, and she heard him cussing. And then she heard, like, a lot of loud bangs, which - the gunshots. LOPEZ: Escamilla says the experience is something that a young child should never be put through. FADEL: Yeah. What are authorities saying about the gunman? LOPEZ: Well, like many kinds of these kinds of tragedies, the gunman is reported to be a young man, 18 years old. According to state officials, he lived in Uvalde and attended the local high school. Governor Greg Abbott announced yesterday that the gunman died, but we don't know if law enforcement officials included him in that 21 reported deaths. One of the other pieces of information we heard yesterday about the shooter is that he allegedly shot his grandmother before he entered the school. And local officials have also said he appears to have acted alone. FADEL: So how are local and state leaders responding to this tragedy? LOPEZ: Well, the governor here, Greg Abbott, has deployed state resources. He asked state law enforcement to help local police investigate the crime. He's also asking for help from the state's emergency management agency. Local law enforcement held a press conference yesterday. The local superintendent, Hal Harrell, got choked up. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HAL HARRELL: My heart was broken today. We're a small community, and, well, we'll need your prayers to get us through this. LOPEZ: Republican leaders in the state have also spoken, mostly to conservative news sources, since the shooting and have said they'd like to see tougher security in schools. Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick said on Fox News he wants to see schools only have one point of entry. And Attorney General Ken Paxton told Newsmax that he thinks that having teachers who are trained and armed would save lives in these types of situations. And Texas is one of the most conservative states in the country, so leaders here, as you can imagine, have not talked about gun restrictions. FADEL: That's NPR's Ashley Lopez. Thank you so much, Ashley. LOPEZ: Yeah, thank you. FADEL: The school massacre throws a spotlight on President Biden's stalled agenda on gun control. INSKEEP: He's been talking about toughening gun laws for decades - first as a senator, then as vice president after the Sandy Hook school shooting a decade ago and more recently as president. Yesterday, as soon as he returned from a trip to East Asia, the president addressed the nation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Why? Why are we willing to live with this carnage? Why do we keep letting this happen? Where in God's name is our backbone to have the courage to deal with and to stand up to the lobbies? INSKEEP: But what would change the politics of gun control? FADEL: Joining us now is NPR's White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Thanks for being here, Tam. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: You're welcome. FADEL: So, Tam, what struck you about the president's address last night? KEITH: He started out by speaking about the pain that parents feel when they lose a child. And he urged Americans to pray for the families and the young children who saw their classmates murdered. But it did not take him long to express frustration that, politically, the issue of gun safety is stuck. In the '90s, when he was in the Senate, Biden shepherded through two pieces of legislation, including what was known as the assault weapons ban, but that expired after 10 years. Last night, he talked about how the number of mass shootings has only gone up since that ban sunsetted. You know, after Sandy Hook in 2012, that shooting that left 20 small children and six school staff dead, as vice president, he led efforts to revive the assault weapons ban as well as to strengthen background checks, but those measures and other efforts failed in Congress. FADEL: Yeah. And this was an issue he ran on, and not much has changed in a polarized Congress. So what can the president do about it now? KEITH: He has already taken executive actions, what he can do, including rules to ban untraceable ghost guns, more funding for violence intervention programs. But big change doesn't come from executive orders. It would take Congress to limit the types of guns that can be sold or expand background checks or put in red-flag laws to keep guns out of the hands of someone who's a danger to themselves or others. Last week, after the mass shooting in Buffalo, he said that it's going to be hard, but he said he's not going to give up. Last night, he said it's time to act. He said, quote, \"We can do so much more. We have to do more.\" But a reminder here - Democrats only have the narrowest majorities in Congress. FADEL: Yeah. And you mentioned Buffalo, which is less than two weeks ago, another mass shooting. This one, so many young children were killed. So does this moment, this shooting, in an era of one mass shooting after another, change the politics at all? KEITH: You know, after Sandy Hook, people thought that could be the moment that would shake up politics. But it didn't. And there was a similar moment after the high school shooting in Parkland, Fla., which really mobilized young people to stand up and push for change. FADEL: Right. KEITH: Now the country is at another point where this question is being raised, but the old talking points came back out with incredible speed. A majority of Americans do support tougher gun laws. There is a minority of people who intensely believe that such measures infringe on their constitutional rights, and that group is highly motivated to vote on that single issue. It's hard to see anything getting 60 votes in the Senate. And there are even some Democrats who oppose getting rid of the filibuster rule. FADEL: NPR's White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Thank you so much. KEITH: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: Now to Georgia, where the power of former President Trump's endorsement faltered last night. INSKEEP: Governor Brian Kemp defeated his challenger. Trump had endorsed a candidate who was willing to deny the reality of the 2020 election. Kemp acknowledged the reality that Trump lost, and voters renominated him. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRIAN KEMP: Conservatives across our state didn't listen to the noise. They didn't get distracted. They knew our record of fighting and winning for hardworking Georgians. INSKEEP: Other notable Trump-aligned candidates in Georgia also fell short. FADEL: Joining us for more is Stephen Fowler from Georgia Public Broadcasting. Good morning, Stephen. STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Good morning. FADEL: So let's start with the race for governor. Kemp, the incumbent, had been pulling ahead of David Perdue in the polls. So this win, it wasn't a total surprise, but what does it tell us about Republicans in Georgia? FOWLER: Well, honestly, the final margin was an utter blowout, which was a surprise. FADEL: OK. FOWLER: Kemp is one of the most conservative governors in the country. He remained popular with voters for things like pay raises for state employees and stances on social issues like abortion and voting laws. This is a huge deal. It continues the trend of incumbent governors surviving Trump challengers. It shows that endorsements don't always trump what voters see and experience on the ground and that there's room for liking the former president and having a different opinion about who should implement his policies. FADEL: OK, let's talk about the secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, famous for telling Trump no when the president asked him to find enough votes to overturn his loss, and he won enough votes to avoid a runoff with his Trump-backed challenger. What does that tell us? FOWLER: Well, Raffensperger did find enough votes this time for himself in virtually every corner of the state. He faced a Trump-backed candidate who said the 2020 election was fraudulent and raised questions about certifying future elections if Republicans didn't win, and voters took note. Now, another interesting data point - a sizable number of people in Georgia that previously voted in Democratic primaries pulled Republican ballots this time. Anecdotally, it's full of people that wanted to vote for people like Raffensperger and Brian Kemp because they want to trust their elections. FADEL: Now, one major candidate who Trump endorsed did manage a win. Is that race just an outlier in Georgia? FOWLER: Right. Herschel Walker's celebrity status means he would have blown away the competition in Georgia's Republican U.S. Senate primary even if Trump didn't intervene. He's a legendary University of Georgia football player with decades of goodwill and good vibes for many people. Here's part of his victory speech. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HERSCHEL WALKER: I don't look like a politician. I don't talk like a politician. I don't even dress like a politician 'cause my neck is a little bit too big for this tie. (LAUGHTER) WALKER: But I like not being a politician. FOWLER: There has been a parade of negative revelations about Walker, ranging from domestic violence allegations to reports of overstated resume items and his business background, and none of it really seemed to stick and matter for voters. FADEL: Now, these Republicans will face their Democratic challengers in November, and Kemp will be in a rematch with Stacey Abrams. What should we be looking for ahead? FOWLER: Well, Georgia has been one of the fiercest battleground states lately in recent years, and that certainly is not going to change. Both Democrats and Republicans are gearing up for a race that's going to be super expensive, super costly and bitterly fought. And expect another tight margin in Georgia once again. FADEL: Stephen Fowler of Georgia Public Broadcasting. Thank you. FOWLER: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KATHY HOCHUL: Yeah, I'm angry. I've seen violence from guns on the Brooklyn subway and now in the streets of Buffalo. It has to stop. It has to stop. AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: That's New York Governor Kathy Hochul late last night talking about the deadly mass shooting at a grocery store in Buffalo. She spoke out about guns and about what she called a feeding frenzy of hate on social media platforms. Joining me now to talk about this and other political news is NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Good morning. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning. RASCOE: Tam, I mean, when things like this happen, unfortunately, we have a kind of playbook that always happens. Democrats call for restrictions on guns. Republicans say justice should be served. Is that what's happening this time? KEITH: You know, there's certainly some of that - the thoughts and prayers, the outrage that this could happen again. But there is something different here, and I want to read a bit to you from the statement President Biden put out last night. Quote, \"A racially motivated hate crime is abhorrent to the very fabric of this nation. Any act of domestic terrorism, including an act perpetrated in the name of a repugnant white nationalist ideology, is antithetical to everything we stand for in America.\" The word gun isn't in his statement at all. There is no mention of gun violence. I went back to Biden's last statement about a mass shooting about a month ago in Sacramento. And obviously, the circumstances were very different, but much of the focus in that statement was on the weapons, on the tragedy of gun violence in any form. And this is just a different conversation. RASCOE: This time, there's an open discussion about white supremacy driving the shooter because of the trail that he seems to have left online. Like, does that mean that this political conversation will be very different from the ones that have happened before? KEITH: You can already see the lines starting to be drawn, with Democrats talking about the threat of white supremacy and violent extremism and Republicans saying they are painting with too broad a brush. This is also a debate that played out last week up on Capitol Hill with Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Attorney General Merrick Garland testifying before Congress. The Biden administration has, for some time, been saying that the greatest domestic threat facing the U.S. is racially or ethnically-motivated violent extremism. And specifically, they talked about white supremacy. In a House committee hearing, Mayorkas got a lot of pushback from Republicans who asked for specific examples and argued that this was a narrative being pushed by the Biden administration that just isn't true. Some argued that the real threat is an invasion from the southern border. This country is a stew of conspiracy theories and extremism, but American politics and politicians are ill-equipped to come together to solve it because the political incentives are just to stoke more division and distrust. RASCOE: Tam, let's move on to something else that happened yesterday. There was a surprise visit to Ukraine led by Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Who else was there, and what did they do? KEITH: It was a small group of Republican senators. They met with President Zelenskyy and his advisers and reaffirmed U.S. support for Ukraine as it defends itself against Russian aggression. This comes as the Senate is poised to pass another big chunk of funding - a huge chunk of funding to support Ukraine. And it's interesting that this was a Republican trip. Very recently, there had been a Democratic trip led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. But the message is very much the same - both party leaders there, with their colleagues, to tell Ukraine that the U.S. is on their side and that the U.S. has a stake in this fight. RASCOE: That's NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Thanks, Tam. KEITH: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "It's Victory Day in Russia, which marks the end of WW II.  Illinois expect people from surrounding states to flock there if abortion becomes illegal. Philippine voters are selecting a new president.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It's Russia's biggest holiday, marking the end of World War II or what Soviets once called the Great Patriotic War. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: People display the old Soviet flag. And orange and black ribbons are draped across the country to celebrate Victory Day. But the celebrations this year come amid frustration and defeat. Russian troops have suffered heavy losses in their invasion of Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin used a speech in Red Square to justify his attack. INSKEEP: NPR's Frank Langfitt was listening to Putin from Ukraine. He's in the port city of Odesa. Hey there, Frank. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: What did Putin say? LANGFITT: Well, he claimed that Russia is the victim in all of this, even though, of course, Russia invaded Ukraine unprovoked. He said Russian troops, as in World War II, are now fighting Nazis in eastern Ukraine. That's a lie. And here is what he also had to say. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN: (Through interpreter) They have tried to attack our historical territories, like the Crimea. They have threatened to use nuclear war. And the West has supported these military actions carried out in our neighborhood. And that is why it was a threat we couldn't accept. LANGFITT: Now, none of that is true. But it's clearly designed, Steve, to sort of use national mythology to generate support for a war of choice, which, you know, still isn't working after 2 1/2 months. One other thing is there was a lot of concern, I think, people watching this that President Putin might try to mobilize more troops. He did not say anything about that. So it's not clear what's next other than this war just continuing to grind on. INSKEEP: Frank, I guess we should note that Ukraine was part of World War II, part of the Soviet Union at the time. It was a battlefield. Germans came one way, then Soviets came back the other way. Millions of people were killed. How is this moment being marked where you are? LANGFITT: Totally, totally different, Steve. Right now, we're all sheltering indoors. And that's because the Ukrainian military says that there are six Russian ships, a couple of subs. They're out in the Black Sea - I can look out over the horizon right now from my hotel room - and that they're planning to attack the south today. We haven't had any missile strikes so far that I can tell in the Odesa area this morning. And, you know, no celebration for the Soviet military here. After all, you know, Russia has been at war with Ukraine since 2014. And yesterday, which is the date that the rest of Europe celebrates victory over the Nazis, people were riding bikes along the water, went out to seaside cafes. It was a lovely, sunny day. And that's how people spent it. INSKEEP: Are people marking this anniversary at all in the Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine? LANGFITT: Yeah, not in any sort of normal way, Steve. Russians have occupied the port city of Kherson. It's just to the east of us. And they put in their own government. Now, in the last few days, they were putting up billboards with hammers and sickles to celebrate Victory Day. They built a stage downtown. This morning, a Russian propaganda channel showed a video of people standing in a park, waving Soviet flags, carrying portraits of Soviet soldiers and saying, chanting, thank you, grandpa, for the victory. A vast majority in Kherson do not like the Russians there at all. And there were checkpoints set up in recent days to make sure nobody tried to protest this celebration. INSKEEP: Did the fighting and evacuation of civilians stop for the holiday? LANGFITT: The evacuations, Steve, did continue. About 174 people, mostly from Mariupol, they got out by bus last night. About, maybe, 36, 38 of them were from that underground maze beneath the steel factory that's been under siege there for so long. It is now not clear if there are any other civilians still trapped there. Another case out in the east as well, that terrible story of the school that was leveled by a Russian bomb - 60 people were missing, according to regional authorities there. They say there is still too much shelling for them to do any more excavating. And they presume that those 60 people have died. INSKEEP: NPR's Frank Langfitt. Thanks so much. LANGFITT: Good to talk, Steve. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: If the Supreme Court should overturn abortion rights, abortion will instantly become illegal in many states and stay legal in others. MART\u00cdNEZ: We have an update this morning for a state where it would be allowed. Abortion providers in Illinois expect patients from surrounding Midwestern states to flock there. So how do they prepare? INSKEEP: NPR's Cheryl Corley is in Chicago. Cheryl, good morning. CHERYL CORLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: I guess we should just remind people - Illinois is a bluer state than many of the redder states surrounding it. So how many abortions does Illinois currently provide both for people within Illinois and people coming from out of state? CORLEY: Well, the latest figures, Steve, are from 2020. And the Illinois Department of Public Health says in that year, there were 46,000 abortions in Illinois. In-state patients, at 36,000, made up the bulk of those. And there were slightly more than 9,600 out-of-state patients. And those numbers have both been on the rise since about 2014. And part of the reason this may be happening is because Illinois has fewer limitations on abortions - as you said, a bluer state. And unlike surrounding states, like Missouri, it's not going to automatically ban abortions if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade. And in 2019, it approved legislation that says reproductive health care, including abortions, is a fundamental right. So abortion rights advocates here in Illinois are just really paying close attention to what's happening in surrounding states. I spoke with Jennifer Welch. She's president of Planned Parenthood of Illinois. JENNIFER WELCH: Here, we're a haven in the Midwest. And every state that touches us will probably lose access to care. And that is very concerning. CORLEY: And that, of course, brings us back to numbers. She says, potentially, it could mean another 20,000 to 30,000 out-of-state residents coming to Illinois to seek abortions. INSKEEP: How are facilities preparing for that many people? CORLEY: Well, many of them say they've been preparing for years. And if we look at Planned Parenthood as an example, it expanded its facility. In downtown Chicago, it built a couple of new health centers near state lines in recent years - one near Wisconsin, another near Indiana. I visited that one. It's located in Flossmoor, Ill., about a half-hour drive from the Illinois-Indiana border. And that facility added more days for surgery, going from one day a week to two. It and other facilities use telehealth or video visits. And patients can either pick up abortion medication at a health center or have it mailed to an Illinois address. And that just frees up physical space at facilities for out-of-state visitors. And groups like the Chicago Abortion Fund help with barriers people may face in actually getting to Illinois, especially for patients who may find it difficult financially. They help pay for health centers, for appointments, arranging travel, that sort of thing. INSKEEP: Let's just remember that if Roe v. Wade were overturned at the federal level, that throws the debate to every state. We heard an update from Georgia the other day, where there was a lieutenant governor debate. And every candidate was - said, yeah, I'll just - let's just ban it. Let's just ban abortion. That was their - about the next step in Georgia, at least among Republicans. What's the political debate like in Illinois? CORLEY: Well, there's passion. There's motivation. The Illinois primary is late next month. It's a long shot that there will be enough Republicans unseating Democrats here to roll back any of the recent actions on abortion here. INSKEEP: Cheryl, thanks so much. CORLEY: You're welcome. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Cheryl Corley. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: Let's go to the Philippines now. The son of a former dictator is the frontrunner in presidential elections. MART\u00cdNEZ: The elder Ferdinand Marcos ruled for two decades before an uprising in 1986. Critics accuse Ferdinand Marcos Jr. of running a disinformation campaign to restore the family to power. But he has had a big lead in the polls. His opponent is Leni Robredo, the outgoing vice president. INSKEEP: With us now is NPR's Julie McCarthy in Manila. Julie, good morning. JULIE MCCARTHY, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: Or maybe I should say good afternoon. You're in a different time zone there. Would you just describe... MCCARTHY: That's right (laughter). INSKEEP: Would you describe what you saw today? What was Election Day like? MCCARTHY: Well, the Filipinos stood in lines that stretched for blocks to vote on what is a national holiday. It was hot. And machines broke down. But Filipinos took it in stride because it's a watershed election. And there are two different visions for the country - one that looks nostalgically to the past, that's the Ferdinand Marcos Jr. camp, and the other that looks to change direction after six years of President Rodrigo Duterte. And that's the camp of Vice President Leni Robredo. INSKEEP: Yeah. I guess we should mention Leni Robredo did not run on a ticket with Duterte. She ran on her own steam. And she actually faced Marcos Jr. last time, didn't she? MCCARTHY: That's exactly right. There's a deep rivalry between these two. With the last election, she beat Marcos Jr. for the vice presidency. And ever since, Marcos has maligned Robredo as a cheater. And social media picked up that fake claim. And now online trolls attack her intelligence and align her with communists. But Robredo has stayed on her anti-dynasty, clean government message. And in the Marcos dynasty, she's up against a juggernaut. Still, plenty of people told us they voted for Robredo. Eugene Manalastas (ph) said cronies of Marcos Sr. had muscled his family out of its printing business years ago. And he says Marcos Jr. has whitewashed those abuses. And he worries that revisionism is working for Marcos. EUGENE MANALASTAS: He was able to brainwash, convince or rebrand their family name. That's the problem. I think social media has a lot to do with this. INSKEEP: What do you hear from voters about that rewriting of the past? MCCARTHY: Well, the Marcos voters, many of them accept this narrative that his father's regime was a, quote-unquote, \"golden age,\" you know? There are a lot of young voters who were born after Marcos. And they never really learned the real history. But Benjamin Ano Nuevo (ph), who is 67, was more of a realist. He focused on Marcos' promises to help retirees. And when I asked him if it bothered him that Marcos had repackage the family history and airbrushed out these ugly episodes, here's what he said. BENJAMIN ANO NUEVO: (Non-English language spoken). MCCARTHY: \"I'm not bothered by what Marcos said, lying. For me, I'm resolved to vote for him,\" Benjamin said. And he did. And what that illustrates, Steve, is how facts just don't seem to matter here. And that has analysts and citizens worried about whether disinformation will now be the formula for political success. INSKEEP: Well, we'll find out pretty soon whether it was the formula for success in this election for which the results are not yet in. Julie, thanks so much. MCCARTHY: Thank you.

BELFAST, Northern Ireland \u2014 The Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein, which seeks unification with Ireland, hailed a \"new era\" Saturday for Northern Ireland as it captured the largest number of seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly for the first time in a historic win. With almost all votes counted from Thursday's local U.K. election, Sinn Fein secured 27 of the Assembly's 90 seats. The Democratic Unionist Party, which has dominated Northern Ireland's legislature for two decades, captured 24 seats. The victory means Sinn Fein is entitled to the post of first minister in Belfast for the first time since Northern Ireland was founded as a Protestant-majority state in 1921. The centrist Alliance Party, which doesn't identify as either nationalist or unionist, saw huge surge in support and was set to become the other big winner in the vote, claiming 17 seats. The victory is a milestone for Sinn Fein, which has long been linked to the Irish Republican Army, a paramilitary group that used bombs and bullets to try to take Northern Ireland out of U.K. rule during decades of violence involving Irish republican militants, Protestant Loyalist paramilitaries and the U.K. army and police. \"Today ushers in a new era,\" Sinn Fein vice-president Michelle O'Neill said shortly before the final results were announced. \"Irrespective of religious, political or social backgrounds, my commitment is to make politics work.\" O'Neill stressed that it was imperative for Northern Ireland's politicians to come together next week to form an Executive \u2014 the devolved government of Northern Ireland. If none can be formed within six months, the administration will collapse, triggering a new election and more uncertainty. There is \"space in this state for everyone, all of us together,\" O'Neill said. \"There is an urgency to restore an Executive and start putting money back in people's pockets, to start to fix the health service. The people can't wait.\" While a Sinn Fein win would signal a historic shift that shows diminishing support for unionist parties, it's far from clear what happens next because of Northern Ireland's complicated power-sharing politics and ongoing tussles over post-Brexit arrangements. Under a mandatory power-sharing system created by the 1998 peace agreement that ended decades of Catholic-Protestant conflict, the jobs of first minister and deputy first minister are split between the biggest unionist party and the largest nationalist one. Both posts must be filled for a government to function, but the Democratic Unionist Party has suggested it might not serve under a Sinn Fein first minister. The DUP has also said it will refuse to join a new government unless there are major changes to post-Brexit border arrangements, known as the Northern Ireland Protocol. Those post-Brexit rules, which took effect after Britain left the European Union, have imposed customs and border checks on some goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K. The arrangement was designed to keep an open border between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland, a key pillar of the peace process. But it angered many unionists, who maintain that the new checks have created a barrier between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K. that undermines their British identity. In February, the DUP's Paul Givan resigned as first minister as post-Brexit tensions triggered a fresh political crisis in Northern Ireland. Saturday's results bring Sinn Fein's ultimate goal of a united Ireland a step closer, although Sinn Fein kept unification out of the spotlight this year during a campaign dominated by the skyrocketing cost of living. O'Neill has said, on Irish unification, there would be no constitutional change until voters decide on it. Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald indicated Friday that planning for any unity referendum could come within the next five years. Polling expert John Curtice, a professor of political science at the University of Strathclyde, said Northern Ireland's latest electoral results are a legacy of Brexit. \"The unionist vote has fragmented because of the divisions within the community over whether or not the Northern Ireland Protocol is something that can be amended satisfactorily or whether it needs to be scrapped,\" he wrote on the BBC website. Persuading the DUP to join a new government and trying to press the EU to agree to major changes in post-Brexit arrangements will pose a headache for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, he added. Johnson's own Conservative party lost at least 450 seats in Thursday's local election.",

            "article_content": "If Roe v. Wade is over turned, certain groups of people would be disproportionately affected. Unemployment data is released Friday. Results are expected Friday in Northern Ireland's election.  LEILA FADEL, HOST: Abortion access could become illegal or restricted in about half of all U.S. states if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade. A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: At least 25 states are likely to ban abortion immediately if the court's ruling matches the leaked draft opinion. That's because various laws and constitutional amendments already in place for most of the states. Low-income people of color seeking an abortion in the South and the Midwest would be disproportionately affected. FADEL: Joining us now to explain is NPR's Yuki Noguchi. Hi, Yuki. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Good morning, Leila. FADEL: Good morning. So Yuki, tell us what the data shows about who gets abortions right now. NOGUCHI: Yeah. An estimated 1-in-4 women get an abortion in their lifetime. That includes people of all backgrounds. But more than half those people who access abortion are women in their 20s. Also, low-income people are more likely to get one. And race is a factor. Black and Latino women account for more than half of abortions, according to the most recent estimates. And the reason is the same as for other racial disparities across health care, you know, lack of access to doctors, insurance and to contraception. Plus, they face higher poverty rates. FADEL: OK. So without Roe v. Wade in these states that will ban or limit access, how would people in those communities get this procedure? NOGUCHI: Well, for those who still need a medical clinic, they might have to travel further to states where abortion will still be legal. And that's pricey, right? Gas prices are high. Laurie Bertram Roberts co-founded the Yellowhammer Fund in Tuscaloosa, Ala. That group pays for travel and logistics and child care for people seeking abortions. And that's gotten more expensive and more complicated. Those are struggles Roberts knows firsthand. She wasn't able to get an abortion several years ago even after doctors warned her she might die if she gave birth. And she was already in financial straits with three kids and says she felt forced to carry the pregnancy to term. They ended up homeless within a year of that birth. And she sees a connection between abortion access and overall health. LAURIE BERTRAM ROBERTS: Mississippi and Alabama are both two states that have very high Black maternal mortality rates and Black infant mortality rates. And what does forced birth look like for us? NOGUCHI: You know, she says having poor health care and then losing access to abortion is a vicious public health cycle. FADEL: So if you have money, you can get to a state where abortions would be legal. But if you don't, it sounds like you're stuck. Are abortion pills an alternative? They weren't around when Roe was decided. NOGUCHI: Yeah, that's right. And those pills, whether through health clinic or self-managed at home, now make up a majority of abortions. But many people can't take them because they might have, like, a blood disorder. Or they might be further along in their term. Terri-Ann Thompson says, also, telehealth isn't an option for everyone. She's at the research group Ibis Reproductive Health. TERRI-ANN THOMPSON: At present, there are 19 states that actually ban telehealth for medication abortion care. And 11 of those states are actually considered part of the South. That's states where Black and Latinx communities are highly represented. Then there really is no access available to those populations. NOGUCHI: And as a practical matter, access to these pills may still be possible, you know, through the mail or something. FADEL: Right. NOGUCHI: But the question is, will women be prosecuted for using them or another means of terminating a pregnancy? FADEL: Has anyone been prosecuted for using abortion medication? NOGUCHI: Yes. Yeah. FADEL: Oh. NOGUCHI: Just last month, a Latino woman was detained for an alleged self-induced abortion in Texas, which passed new abortion restrictions in September. You know, people will now have to travel further to Minnesota or Colorado to seek abortions. But many people, like I said, won't be able to afford that. FADEL: NPR's Yuki Noguchi. Thank you, Yuki. NOGUCHI: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: Businesses are looking to hire. So people searching for work see a lot of openings. MART\u00cdNEZ: This morning, we're going to find out how many of those jobs were filled in April. Recent data indicates the labor market is strong and workers are getting better pay. But there's a potential downside for the broader economy. FADEL: NPR's Scott Horsley joins us now to discuss. Hi, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning. FADEL: Good morning. So just how tight is the job market? HORSLEY: It's very tight. The unemployment rate in March was 3.6%. And forecasters think it may have dipped even lower in April. According to the Labor Department, there were more than 11.5 million job openings at the beginning of the month. That's an all-time high. Employers are really eager to hire more people because they've got a lot of customers demanding goods and services. This is how Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell described the job market earlier this week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JEROME POWELL: For people who are out of work and looking, there are lots of job opportunities. Wages are moving up at rates that haven't been seen in quite a long time. So it's a good time to be a worker looking to either change jobs or get a wage increase in your current job. HORSLEY: Private sector wages in the first three months of the year were up 5% from a year ago. And that's a good wage gain for workers. It is, however, potentially worrisome for the Federal Reserve. FADEL: Why? What's the Fed worried about? HORSLEY: The central bank is worried that employers may try to offset the cost of these higher wages by raising prices. And that could make inflation, which is already at a four-decade high, even worse. That's why the Fed is trying to pour a little cold water on the sizzling job market by raising interest rates. They're trying to cool off demand. Ideally, the central bank would like to see the job market cool down gradually, without a sharp jump in unemployment or a recession. But there are some economists who are doubtful that Powell and his colleagues can pull off that delicate balancing act. And uncertainty about which way the economy's headed is behind the wild swings we've seen this week in the stock market, you know? The Dow soared more than 900 points on Wednesday, only to sink more than 1,000 points 24 hours later. FADEL: So how close is the economy to replacing all the jobs that were lost during the pandemic? HORSLEY: It's getting there. The economy lost 22 million jobs in the spring of 2020 when the coronavirus first struck here in the U.S. In the two years that followed, the economy has managed to replace about 93% of that total. It has been an uneven recovery at times. But now we've had 11 months in a row with at least 400,000 jobs added. We will find out today if April makes it 12 months in a row. Some forecasters think hiring fell short of the 400,000 mark last month. Economist Nela Richardson of the payroll processing company ADP says that would not be terribly surprising at this relatively late stage in the recovery. NELA RICHARDSON: Given that the labor market is - made such tremendous progress back towards 2019 levels, I think what we're going to see going forward is more of a normal pacing. HORSLEY: For context, in the 12 months before the pandemic, the U.S. averaged about 200,000 new jobs a month. FADEL: OK. What else should we be watching for in today's jobs report? HORSLEY: I'm going to be watching to see what happens to the size of the workforce. It would give the tight job market some additional breathing room if more people who've been on the sidelines come into the workforce and start working or looking for work. More than 300,000 people joined the workforce in February, another 400,000 in March. Some of that reflects improvements in the health outlook. Some of it's the strong wages. And, frankly, some of it may be people feeling increased pressure to go to work because their cost of living has gone up. FADEL: NPR's Scott Horsley. Thank you, Scott. HORSLEY: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: We're turning overseas now to Northern Ireland, where Sinn Fein is poised to become the first Irish Nationalist Party to lead the government. MART\u00cdNEZ: The votes are still being counted. But if they win, it would mark a major milestone that could pave the way for Northern Ireland to leave the U.K. Sinn Fein focused its campaign on bread-and-butter issues. The party was long linked to the Irish Republican Army, a paramilitary group that fought British and loyalist forces for three decades to achieve a unified Ireland. A peace deal in 1998 largely ended the conflict. FADEL: Joining us with the latest is London-based reporter Willem Marx. Thanks for being here. WILLEM MARX: Thanks for having me. FADEL: So what reactions are you hearing this morning? And what could this mean politically in Northern Ireland and in the U.K.? MARX: Well, the vote certification in Belfast and across Northern Ireland was just concluded nearly a couple of hours ago. Now the actual count is underway for the next few hours. There has not been any public statements from politicians in the U.K. while they wait for more clarity on those results. But it's clear that turnout has been relatively high, 54%. And it's been a slightly unsettled few months in Northern Ireland's own politics. The carefully constructed power-sharing government collapsed in February when one of the major parties withdrew. And if Sinn Fein were to emerge from this election with a majority in that local legislature, known as the Northern Ireland Assembly, it might be hard for the local executive power sharing to be reestablished. And without that in place, theoretically, U.K. authorities in Westminster in London could take charge of day-to-day governing. But that would not be a popular move in Northern Ireland. It's something Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government has been unwilling to do. FADEL: Sinn Fein was long linked to the IRA. How did it gain so much popular support? MARX: Well, partly, it's focusing on what you guys just called those bread-and-butter issues. FADEL: Right. MARX: But it's also partly a consequence of birth rates, changing demographics. For the past couple of decades, parties in favor of Northern Ireland remaining inside the rest of the U.K., known as unionists or loyalists, have held a majority in that Northern Ireland executive because their supporters, largely Protestant, were a bigger proportion of the population. But that's shifting. And that means that the largely Catholic segment of the population that supports Sinn Fein has continued to expand. It's worth noting as well, the leading unionist party - or the Democratic Unionist Party - has taken a very unpopular series of decisions over things like Brexit. And that's helped to erode its popular support as well. FADEL: Could this actually lead to the island of Ireland becoming one country? MARX: Well, under that peace deal you guys mentioned - known as the Good Friday Agreement, signed back in '98 - a referendum would need to be held among residents of Northern Ireland, with another separate one held next door to the south in the Republic of Ireland. And that would likely require Sinn Fein to control the levers of government both north and south of that border. And they're not yet the party of government to the south in the Republic of Ireland. Now, if a majority of people in both north and south said they would like to see Ireland reunited, it's not, of course, beyond the realms of possibility one day. And in fact, just coming out of these elections, the Democratic Unionist Party in Northern Ireland told voters that they think a Sinn Fein win would accelerate that process. FADEL: Reporter Willem Marx joining us on Skype from London. Thank you so much. MARX: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Georgia Republican U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene testifies Friday in an Atlanta court for a hearing in a challenge filed by voters who say she shouldn't be allowed to seek reelection because of her role prior to the attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n                \n                    \n                    John Bazemore/Pool/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Georgia Republican U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene testifies Friday in an Atlanta court for a hearing in a challenge filed by voters who say she shouldn't be allowed to seek reelection because of her role prior to the attack on the U.S. Capitol. Controversial Republican U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia on Friday defended her comments ahead of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol while testifying under oath as part of a challenge to her reelection by voters and a supporting legal group, who are seeking to knock her off the ballot for her role prior to the riot. Greene's appearance in an Atlanta court Friday made her the first GOP member of Congress to testify publicly about Jan. 6, even as a Democratic-led committee back in Washington, D.C., has spent months investigating the attack. Greene was in front of an administrative law judge because a handful of voters in her district, represented by a nonprofit called Free Speech For People, say Greene should be disqualified because they allege she encouraged and supported the rioters who stormed the Capitol. While on the witness stand, the congresswoman reiterated baseless claims about election fraud, and repeatedly said that her charged rhetoric ahead of Jan. 6 referred to challenging the electoral count, not a call for violence. \"I don't support violence of any kind,\" Greene said in response to a question. \"My words never ever mean anything for violence.\" The courtroom was crowded with Greene's supporters, who cheered when she entered. Lawyers with Free Speech For People are leaning on a provision in the U.S. Constitution that forbids any member of Congress involved in an insurrection from serving in office. It's a section of the 14th Amendment, passed in the years after the Civil War to prevent former Confederates from returning to their seats in Congress. The legal theory is mostly untested in modern history. Greene has long deployed violent rhetoric against her political opponents and has routinely spread false claims about the 2020 election, including in the leadup to Jan. 6, 2021. \"This was not a case where the leaders were on horseback leading the charge,\" Ron Fein, legal director for Free Speech for People, told the judge. \"Rather the leaders of this insurrection were among us, on Facebook, on Twitter, on corners of social media that would make your stomach turn. The evidence will show that Marjorie Taylor Greene was one of them.\" Greene says the challenge to her candidacy is a lie and a scam designed to take away her constituents' rights to vote for the candidate of their choice. Greene answered many questions Friday about her statements, social media posts and conversations in the days before Jan. 6 with \"I don't know\" or \"I don't recall.\" Asked whether her office gave tours to any members of the public in the days before the riot, or whether her campaign or congressional staff provided information or funds to people who participated in or organized the riot, she said no. Lawyers for Free Speech For People pointed to a tweet sent on Jan. 5, calling the next day a \"1776 moment,\" which is code for political violence in some far-right circles. Greene told the judge she's never heard anyone use \"1776\" in connection with violence. The plaintiff's lawyers also played a January 2021 Facebook video in which Greene said, \"You can't allow it to just transfer power peacefully like Joe Biden wants and allow him to become our president. Because he did not win this election. It's being stolen.\" In the same video, Greene encouraged people to come to Washington as she and other members of Congress prepared to object to the certification of the election results. Greene says the video was taken out of context. Asked whether she advocated to then-President Donald Trump that he impose martial law to remain in power, she said, \"I don't recall.\" Her attorneys argue that not only is her rhetoric protected political speech, she was a victim of the Jan. 6 attack, not a participant. \"The right to vote is at stake, right here, right now because they want to deny the right to vote to the thousands of people in the 14th district of Georgia by removing Greene from the ballot,\" James Bopp, an Indiana-based attorney for Greene, said in opening arguments. \"Those voters have the right to vote for the candidate of their choosing.\" A similar challenge to Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn's candidacy was tossed out by a judge in North Carolina. A judge on Friday also dismissed efforts by the same group to challenge Arizona lawmakers. Appeals have been filed in both. Greene asked a federal court to dismiss her challenge, but the judge let the case proceed. In Georgia, the administrative judge will next lay out the facts of the case and make a recommendation to the Georgia secretary of state, Republican Brad Raffensperger, about whether Greene should remain on the ballot. Raffensperger is up for reelection himself and faces a GOP primary challenge, so he may be hesitant to make political waves by pulling Greene from the ballot before the May 24 primary. \"This is extraordinarily important stuff,\" Judge Charles Beaudrot said, closing Friday's hearing. Beaudrot said briefings from both parties are due midnight Thursday and he will aim to release his recommendation within a week of that deadline. Whatever the decision, it will almost certainly be appealed to a higher court. Page Pate, a trial attorney in Georgia, said that disqualifying Greene from the ballot might not be the challengers' only goal. \"They want to hear her questioned under oath, to find out what involvement, if any, she had in this insurrection, and if she makes any false statement, she could be charged with perjury or perhaps some other crime,\" Pate says. Greene is popular in her north Georgia district, which stretches from the exurbs of Atlanta to the foothills of the Appalachians and the border with Tennessee. It's one of the most conservative congressional districts in the country. Nancy Hollandchad, a longtime volunteer with Paulding County Republican Women, says efforts to take on Greene only embolden her supporters. \"She's my congresswoman, so I do support her,\" she says. \"I don't like them trying to keep Marjorie off the ballot. They just don't understand, they're galvanizing the district more towards her.\" WABE politics editor Susanna Capelouto contributed reporting.",

            "article_content": "A COVID aid bill that President Biden says is crucial to dealing with the next phase of the pandemic has been stalled as Republicans try to force the CDC to keep border restrictions in place.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: The Biden administration's decision last week to drop border restrictions that were put in place because of the COVID-19 pandemic is causing a lot of fallout in Washington. A COVID aid bill the president says is crucial to dealing with the next phase of this pandemic has been stalled as Republicans try to force the CDC to keep the restrictions known as Title 42 in place. Now some Senate Democrats are joining Republicans. To sort out the reality of what is happening at the border and all of the politics surrounding it, we're joined now by NPR's Joel Rose, who covers immigration, and NPR's Mara Liasson at the White House. Hey to both of you. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Happy to be here. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Hi. CHANG: Hi. OK. So Joel, could you just briefly explain more about what exactly Title 42 does and why the administration wants to get rid of it now? ROSE: Sure. Title 42 is a public health measure, at least officially, that was originally put in place by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention a little over two years ago to stop the spread of COVID-19. And it allowed immigration authorities to quickly expel migrants at the southern border without giving them a chance to ask for asylum under U.S. law. Now the CDC is saying that Title 42 is no longer necessary to protect public health. The Biden administration says there is a plan for what will happen when it is set to end on May 23. It involves more personnel and other resources going to the border. You know, clearly, the administration is hoping to avoid some of the chaotic situations that we saw last year, but it is bracing for what it calls a significant influx of migrants at the border. CHANG: And Mara, I know that Republicans have been outraged at Biden over this, but now some Democrats are joining them to push for keeping Title 42 in place. What's going on here? LIASSON: That's right. Five Senate Democrats, most of them moderates, joined a group of Republicans to introduce a measure that would force the administration to keep Title 42 until it presented a plan to Congress about how they would deal with a spike in border crossings. Now, Democrats are worried that the administration doesn't have a good enough plan to stop a surge. The White House says it's surging resources to the border. It's sending the message now is not the time to come. But of course, they sent that message last year, and there was still a spring surge. But what's significant about the Democrats who are joining in with Republicans is at least two of them are up for re-election this year - New Hampshire's Maggie Hassan and Arizona's Mark Kelly. And they know that immigration, along with inflation and crime, are top issues for voters. And they're afraid that the Democrats are on the wrong side of this issue. CHANG: Meanwhile, Joel, people have been making some pretty extreme claims about the impact of lifting Title 42. What do we know about how it's worked so far? ROSE: Well, immigrant advocates and some Democrats say it's failed, both as public health policy and as immigration policy. I mean, they note that we've seen record numbers of arrests at the border, even with Title 42 in place. They would argue that's because migrants are often fleeing from violence and poverty in their home countries, and they're not really paying much attention to U.S. border policy. But Republicans are using words like chaos and Armageddon. They warn that lifting Title 42 will allow more fentanyl and other drugs into the country on the backs of migrants. Here's Representative Clay Higgins of Louisiana, speaking at a congressional hearing yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLAY HIGGINS: Carrying drugs backpack at a time in our country. Where do those guys go? They went deep into America, to a neighborhood near you. ROSE: But the reality is that the vast majority of fentanyl and other drugs come through ports of entry, hidden in commercial trucks or in private vehicles. That was true before Title 42, and the data on drug seizures suggests that it was the case during Title 42 as well. CHANG: And Mara, what would you say are the political stakes for Biden going forward on this issue? LIASSON: Well, they're pretty high. I mean, Joel just described the reality, but I cover politics. And don't forget, this wasn't just Trump's first issue when he rode down the escalator and announced his candidacy by talking about murderers and rapists coming over the southern border. It's also become the biggest issue that Republicans have. And this really shows us how broken the debate over immigration is. For years, Congress and the presidents haven't been able to agree on comprehensive immigration reform, how to meet the country's need for immigrant labor, a need that's growing by the year, at the same time that you have a secure, orderly border. Instead of having a comprehensive solution, we've had a completely politicized, weaponized debate about immigration. And Democrats are worried it's really going to hurt them this year. CHANG: That is NPR's Mara Liasson and Joel Rose. Thanks to both of you. LIASSON: Thank you. ROSE: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Homeland security officials say they're bracing for a possible record migration at the U.S.-Mexico border. Public health officials must decide whether or not to extend pandemic border restrictions.  KELSEY SNELL, HOST: Homeland Security officials say they're bracing for the possibility of record migration at the U.S.-Mexico border, and they warn that the end of the pandemic border restrictions could add to that surge. That stark warning comes as top public health officials must decide whether or not to extend those controversial restrictions that were put into place by the Trump administration. NPR's Joel Rose has been following all of this. Hi, Joel. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Hi. SNELL: So start by reminding us what these border restrictions are and why they're up for review now. ROSE: Yeah, it was the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that authorized these pandemic restrictions known as Title 42 more than two years ago to stop the spread of COVID. And that has allowed immigration authorities to quickly expel migrants at the border. The Biden administration has made some exceptions, notably for unaccompanied children, but it's largely kept Title 42 in place. The CDC has periodically reviewed the policy to see if it's still needed. The agency's latest review is supposed to end today, according to court filings, and we are waiting to see what the CDC will decide. SNELL: Do you know what CDC officials are saying so far? ROSE: Well, publicly, not much. But we know that the CDC is under a lot of pressure to lift Title 42 restrictions now that many other pandemic mitigation measures have been dropped. Immigrant advocates and now even some key Democratic leaders in the Senate say it is time for these restrictions to end, but that does not come without some risk for the Biden administration. SNELL: What would happen at the border if these rules are actually lifted? ROSE: Well, there's widespread concern that it will lead to an influx of migrants at the border. We're hearing that even from the White House today and the Department of Homeland Security. Yesterday, DHS released its strategic plan for how it's preparing for the coming months, including the possibility of a, quote, \"significant increase,\" unquote, in border arrivals if Title 42 is lifted. One fairly shocking scenario they're planning for is a jump of up to 18,000 migrants per day reaching the border. That's more than twice the average number of migrant apprehensions last summer, which were already at record levels. So DHS says it is standing up additional temporary facilities at the border to hold migrants and will be ready to surge law enforcement and other personnel to the border if necessary, you know, and in general is trying to project this sense that DHS is ready to handle this. SNELL: So what do critics - I'm thinking of Republicans - say about all of this? ROSE: Well, they don't think the administration's plan will work. They are urging the Biden administration to keep Title 42 in place and warning that there will be chaos at the border if it's lifted. Here's Republican Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma. JAMES LANKFORD: They're aware of what they're about to release. They have had a year to be able to plan for it, and they've chosen not to. That is not a plan to help us with illegal immigration. ROSE: Republicans argue that the Biden administration's policies are to blame for the record number of apprehensions at the border. That's a message we are likely to hear from them a lot as we head toward midterm elections. SNELL: Right. And how do immigrant advocates respond? ROSE: Well, they argue there are really a lot of reasons why migration is up - that migrants are fleeing from violence and poverty in Central America and increasingly even further away. Guerline Jozef is the head of the Haitian Bridge Alliance. GUERLINE JOZEF: It is imperative that all people seeking asylum are received with dignity regardless of their country of origin, whether they are from Haiti or Ukraine or Russia or Guatemala. ROSE: Immigrant advocates and many public health experts believe that COVID was always just an excuse to limit access to asylum and try to deter migrants from coming to the border, and Title 42, they say, has been putting migrants in danger in Mexican border towns or back in their home countries. SNELL: Lots to follow in the coming days. That's NPR's Joel Rose. Thank you, Joel. ROSE: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The two have polled atop the contested GOP primary. Looking to put his mark on the 2022 midterm elections, former President Donald Trump has made dozens of endorsements in congressional contests across the U.S. But he has yet to pick a favorite candidate in one hotly contested race: the Ohio GOP Senate primary. It's a state where Trump is popular \u2014 he carried Ohio easily both times he ran for president \u2014 but so far none of the contenders has gotten his nod. That lack of a Trump endorsement, though, hasn't stopped individual Republican candidates from selling themselves to voters as the most Trump-like in the race. The TV ads tell the story. Here are three: Another high-profile candidate in the race is J.D. Vance, author of the best-selling memoir Hillbilly Elegy, which has also been made into a motion picture. Back during the 2016 presidential race, Vance was a strong critic of Trump, calling him \"reprehensible,\" \"noxious\" and an \"idiot.\" But in this campaign, Vance has expressed his admiration and support for Trump. He used a moment at a primary debate in Cleveland this week to explain his past comments, saying, \"Look, I mean, all of us say stupid things and I happened to say stupid things very publicly.\" He says he voted for Trump in 2020 and now calls Trump \"the greatest president in my lifetime.\" Ohio Republican Senate candidate J.D. Vance speaks at a rally in Mason, Ohio, on Jan. 30.\n                \n                    \n                    Jeff Dean/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption As the campaign in Ohio has played out, it seems there is no issue that's been looked at without somehow connecting it to Trump. Ukraine, Russia, gas prices, inflation, education, guns, abortion. On issue after issue, the candidates put Trump on the side of peace, prosperity, strength and freedom, while President Biden and the Democrats have, according to this viewfinder, made all of these things worse. But Mandel also casts his primary opponents as being \"squishy\" on the issues. At a debate this month in suburban Columbus, sponsored by the conservative group FreedomWorks, Mandel said the GOP must choose a path between pro-China RINOs (Republicans in name only) \"like Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger, Mitt Romney,\" or fighters like Trump. At times the desire to be one of those \"fighters\" like Trump has led to some tense \u2014 if awkward \u2014 moments. At the debate outside Columbus, Mandel started attacking Gibbons right from the start, accusing him of buying up Ohio companies and shipping jobs to China. Gibbons responded that such claims are a lie. But as the debate continued, Mandel kept returning to the topic, before Gibbons had had enough. \"You don't know squat,\" he said to Mandel, adding, \"You've never been in the private sector in your entire life.\" Mandel leapt out of his chair and got nose to nose, chest to chest with Gibbons. \"Two tours in Iraq. Don't tell me I haven't worked,\" Mandel shouted, as the two men bumped chests. \"Don't tell me I haven't worked.\" \"You back off, buddy,\" Gibbons retorted, tossing in an obscenity. After about a minute of this the moderator managed to restore calm. It went viral \u2014 the only moment of the debate to do so. Days later, at the Cleveland debate, both candidates were asked about the previous clash. Neither offered an apology or regrets. Jane Timken speaks at the March 18 forum in suburban Columbus, Ohio, flanked by Mandel and Vance.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Spear/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jane Timken speaks at the March 18 forum in suburban Columbus, Ohio, flanked by Mandel and Vance. But Timken used the moment to make a pitch for civility \u2014 and for herself, the only woman among the top candidates in the contest. \"Josh Mandel and Mike Gibbons acted like children,\" Timken said, \"and if I had been their mother, I would have grounded them.\" She then added what's long been a tagline for her campaign: \"I'm a mom on a mission to take this country back.\" At the first debate, when the question was about Ukraine, all blamed Biden for being weak and giving Russian President Vladimir Putin an opening to invade. None praised Putin in the way Trump did before the invasion began. Most also supported military and financial aid of some kind. But Vance stood out from the pack with a more isolationist approach. \"What happened over there is very sad,\" he said, \"but ladies and gentlemen, it cannot be said enough: We have got our own problems.\" At the second debate, in Cleveland, the moderator raised the topic of Trump's ongoing dominance of the GOP. The candidates were asked if it would be better for the Republican Party if the former president moved on from the 2020 election. Only one candidate raised his hand: state Sen. Matt Dolan. \"In Ohio, we have very secure elections,\" said Dolan, who's not vied for the primary's Trump lane. \"There has been two audits done and it showed there were no problems.\" No other candidate was willing to go there, to most certainly anger Trump with such a statement. Dolan, meanwhile, is currently in single digits in polls. Matt Dolan speaks at the March 18 forum outside of Columbus, Ohio.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Spear/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Matt Dolan speaks at the March 18 forum outside of Columbus, Ohio. Days later, in the Alabama GOP Senate primary, Trump rescinded an endorsement of Rep. Mo Brooks, who has opined that it's time to stop talking about 2020. Now, it could well be that Trump pulled his support because Brooks' campaign is struggling and the former president doesn't want to be seen as backing a loser. In Ohio, that could also be part of his thinking. There are several candidates, and if he can't be sure to pick the winner, then it may be better for the Trump brand to stay on the sidelines. But the Brooks move also explains why most Ohio candidates kept their hands firmly at their sides when the debate moderator asked the question. It seems many Ohio voters are only now starting to pay attention to the Senate contest. Kathy Deal, who works at a church outside Columbus, says she's a loyal Republican who's still figuring out who deserves her support. She admits she wishes Trump would weigh in to help her make up her mind. \"That would definitely seal it for sure,\" she told NPR. Deal is keeping track of other endorsements, including one from a favorite of Trump supporters, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who recently backed Vance. \"She's a fighter,\" Deal said of Greene. \"So I would like someone in there fighting for Ohio as hard as she fights.\" Dolan supporters Gordon and Lisa Phillips were at the suburban Columbus debate. The spouses are both retired and had careers in the Air Force. He says he's a loyal Republican, but the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, was a turning point for him. He says the party does need to move beyond Trump. \"I'm looking for a man with integrity, who can stand up and speak truth and be responsible, accountable,\" Gordon Phillips said. Meanwhile, Lisa Phillips says they considered switching their party affiliation to independent, but decided not to because they still believe in what she says are core Republican values \u2014 she's anti-abortion, pro-Second Amendment on guns,  and wants tough border security. She and her husband both voted for Trump twice, but now: \"Where we struggle was with how everything ended with President Trump with Jan. 6. I feel that there was some responsibility on his part for that. And then the whole idea of the election being stolen, we don't buy into that. We both think the election was fair, especially after all the recounts.\" That's certainly a minority view within the GOP nationally. Scott McVicker, a manager who works in manufacturing, is more typical. In the Senate contest he's leaning toward businessman Gibbons. On the topic of Trump and the future of the GOP, McVicker turns the question around, saying, \"I think you'd probably offend a lot of Democrats if you told them that we just need to move beyond Kennedy or Obama.\" His point is that Trump is now an iconic figure for Republicans. \"So I don't think you ever move on. I think you try to build on what you have. I think Trump did a lot of things that were very positive. And so from that aspect, no, we don't need to move on. We need to build on what he was doing.\" He says mainstream Republicans who go to Washington to continue with business as usual are what the GOP needs to move beyond. Even with polls in the Ohio GOP Senate contest showing Gibbons emerging in the lead, those same surveys also indicate that more than a third of Republican voters are still undecided. The primary is May 3, but a battle in the courts over a GOP redistricting plan that establishes new legislative and congressional seats is currently being challenged in the courts. So the primary could be delayed into the summer. Whoever gets the Republican nomination will likely be the favorite in the fall in a state Trump carried easily twice when his name was on the ballot.",

            "article_content": "After a controversial border security mission, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott faces criticism. Amid poor living conditions and deteriorating mental health, four guard members died by suicide.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Greg Abbott, the governor of Texas, deployed thousands of National Guard troops on to the border with Mexico over the past year. They've been adding to the border wall and been told to arrest migrants on state trespassing charges. Initially, this deployment earned the governor praise from conservatives as he heads into an election this year. But amid poor working conditions and other problems, four members of the National Guard have killed themselves. And now troops are unionizing to demand change. Texas Public Radio's Carolina Cuellar reports. CAROLINA CUELLAR, BYLINE: A year ago, with a record numbers of migrants crossing the Texas-Mexico border, Governor Greg Abbott announced a new controversial border security program, Operation Lone Star. Even though judges have ruled that many of the program's policies violate federal jurisdiction over immigration, Abbott remains committed. Here he is on the right-wing podcast \"Ruthless.\" (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"RUTHLESS\") GREG ABBOTT: Anybody coming across the border who in any way tries to damage that fence - they are guilty of two crimes. One is trespassing. The other is vandalism. CUELLAR: Three months before announcing his reelection campaign, Abbott ordered a massive deployment of around 10,000 troops, or about half the state's National Guard, and asked it be done over just two months. Now guard members say they're suffering for it. UNIDENTIFIED GUARD MEMBER #1: These conditions are just, I think, unparalleled. I mean, really, the only comparison I could draw would be the Hurricane Harvey mission, where we were sleeping in high-school gymnasiums or, you know, other military armories that didn't have power. CUELLAR: We agreed to withhold the guard member's name and alter his voice because he fears retaliation, such as a deployment even further from home. The Army Times first reported problems with Operation Lone Star. Four soldiers died by suicide over the first two months of the mission. And many spoke of poor living conditions, gear shortages and unusually last-minute deployments. UNIDENTIFIED GUARD MEMBER #1: Having four in such a short period of time seems like quite a coincidence if this mission wasn't at least some contributing factor to it. It's terrible. It's unfortunate. CUELLAR: Another anonymous soldier said the days are idle because guard members don't feel qualified to make arrests. This lack of purpose makes them suspect they're being used for the governor's reelection campaign. UNIDENTIFIED GUARD MEMBER #2: No, we absolutely are just political pawns here. And that's - yeah, that's not a good feeling. CUELLAR: The Texas military department spoke out against the revelations by saying reporters gleaned information from anonymous sources and unverified documents. But Texas Public Radio has firsthand accounts from six members of the guard stationed in different locations across the border. The Texas Military Department, which oversees the National Guard, said it is addressing these issues. But that's happening during rather than before the deployment. Now Abbott is even facing criticism from the right. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ALLEN WEST: Why is this happening? Because we rushed into a failure. CUELLAR: Allen West is running against Governor Abbott in the GOP primary. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WEST: We decided that it was all about a political optic. It was about a political opportunity. CUELLAR: West is a veteran and attacked Abbott during a campaign speech for looking tough on illegal immigration at the expense of guard members. Governor Abbott says his adversaries are using the suicides for political gain. He said these cases are still under investigation. Still, Southwestern University political scientist Emily Sydnor says hearing about guardsmen's experiences could end up swaying some Republican voters in the primary. EMILY SYDNOR: The stories of the guardsmen who have had sort of terrible experiences in any number of different ways I think, in some ways, will have more of an impact than this overarching sort of statistical story about, you know, numbers of arrests and the safety at the border. CUELLAR: As for the guard troops, they've begun organizing under the Texas State Employees Union and have already conducted their first official meeting. The union aims to improve soldiers' conditions and ultimately make the mission voluntary so guard members can choose to go home. After the unionization announcement, the Military Department lifted an unpopular curfew and increased the distance soldiers are allowed to travel without a pass. Hunter Schuler is a specialist in the guard and union member. HUNTER SCHULER: I'd like to think we played at least some small part in helping improve, helping get those conditions changed. CUELLAR: Schuler hopes this means military leadership is now more receptive to their concerns. For NPR News, I'm Carolina Cuellar in McAllen, Texas.

Former President Donald Trump praised Russian President Vladimir Putin's moves in Ukraine, calling him \"savvy,\" after the Kremlin recognized the independence of two breakaway, Russian separatist-controlled regions in eastern Ukraine. \"I went in yesterday and there was a television screen, and I said, 'This is genius.' Putin declares a big portion ... of Ukraine, Putin declares it as independent,\" Trump said in an interview Tuesday on the conservative Clay Travis & Buck Sexton Show. The former president was referencing two rebel-controlled territories, Luhansk and Donetsk, which make up a larger region called Donbas that borders Russia. The two territories have been led by pro-Russia separatists for nearly a decade. Putin on Monday recognized the independence of the two territories and ordered Russian troops to conduct \"peacekeeping\" operations there \u2014 sparking international concern that the Kremlin was readying for an attack. \"So, Putin is now saying, 'It's independent,' a large section of Ukraine. I said, 'How smart is that?' And he's gonna go in and be a peacekeeper. That's [the] strongest peace force,\" Trump said, adding that that was the kind of show of force the United States could use on its Southern border. Trump's remarks come as tensions in Ukraine have escalated and the U.S. has ordered sanctions to try to kneecap Russia's ability to do business with the West. President Biden on Tuesday called the arrival of troops to Donbas \"the beginning of a Russian invasion,\" and ordered sanctions in response to Putin's \"flagrant violation of international law.\" Trump criticized Biden's response, falsely alleging that Biden was only in the White House because the 2020 election had been \"rigged.\" \"This never would have happened with us,\" Trump said in the interview recorded at his Mar-a-Lago property, calling Biden a \"man that has no concept of what he's doing.\" Trump, who has cozied up to Putin in the past, continued: \"Had I been in office, not even thinkable. This would never have happened. But here's a guy that says, you know, 'I'm gonna declare a big portion of Ukraine independent,' he used the word 'independent,' 'and we're gonna go out and we're gonna go in and we're gonna help keep peace.' You gotta say that's pretty savvy. And you know what the response was from Biden? There was no response. They didn't have one for that. No, it's very sad.\" The sanctions Biden announced Tuesday will hit two major Russian financial institutions along with the Russian government's ability to access Western financing. Additional sanctions in the coming days will target Russian elites and their families, Biden said. Biden described the sanctions as a \"first tranche,\" and he warned that the U.S. has prepared further consequences if Putin does not withdraw the troops.",

A massive protest in Ottawa, Ontario, that began with truck drivers opposing a cross-border vaccine mandate continues to snarl traffic and disrupt everyday life in the Canadian capital more than a week after it began. Officials from the mayor to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have called on the protesters to leave, saying residents in the city of just over 1 million don't deserve to be harassed. Yet the protesters show no signs of relenting, and some have moved into other areas of the city, which is under a state of emergency. On Monday, the protests spread elsewhere in the country, as truck drivers blocked traffic on the Ambassador Bridge, a key crossing between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit, CBC reported. They also got the backing of more than 100 Alaska truck drivers who rallied in support of the convoy, according to the Anchorage Daily News. The \"Freedom Convoy\" began last month as a caravan of truck drivers who planned to drive to Ottawa to voice their opposition to a government mandate that requires them to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to cross the U.S.-Canada border. That's despite the fact that the Canadian Trucking Alliance says the \"vast majority\" of the country's trucking industry is vaccinated. But the narrow focus of the protest quickly grew as more people joined the demonstration to voice their own grievances against Canada's government. Some protesters say they're staying until all public health mandates are lifted, while others have called for the dissolution of the current government, as NPR's Emma Jacobs reported. In addition, signs for QAnon, right-wing militias and Confederate and Nazi flags have also appeared among the protesters, Jacobs said. A group of police officers walks past a Canadian flag near Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Monday as demonstrators continue to protest the vaccine mandates implemented by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n                \n                    \n                    Dave Chan/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ottawa City Councillor Matthew Luloff told NPR's Morning Edition on Tuesday that the protest has morphed into a more far-reaching and hostile demonstration against the government than was originally planned. \"Some of the most well-known radicals in this country have now descended upon the capital. Some of them are calling for violence. Some of them are threatening individual politicians,\" said Luloff, who also noted the presence of hate symbols and antisemitic flyers at the protest. \"Now at the same time, there are people within this group that are demonstrating downtown with legitimate concerns,\" he added, \"but you don't have a productive conversation at the business end of a gun or the grill of a semitruck.\" With a note of frustration, Luloff said that although protesters are calling for Trudeau and other government officials to resign, Canada just had an election several months earlier. Protesters have largely remained peaceful. Much of the criticism of the protest is focused on the disruptions to city life for those residing and working in Ottawa. Mayor Jim Watson previously told CBC that residents feel like \"prisoners in their own home\" as crowds amass downtown, block traffic and at times harass people on the street. Law enforcement authorities didn't confront the protesters at first, but they've begun to crack down on demonstrators in recent days. Ottawa police made several arrests over the weekend, seized fuel from some protesters and issued more than 450 tickets. The city is also under a state of emergency, and a judge ruled that truckers couldn't sound their thunderous horns for 10 days. Truckers refuel their trucks in the cold during the Freedom Convoy truck protest on Feb. 5 in Ottawa, Canada.\n                \n                    \n                    Minas Panagiotakis/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Truckers refuel their trucks in the cold during the Freedom Convoy truck protest on Feb. 5 in Ottawa, Canada. There have also been several incidents for which the protesters drew widespread condemnation. One person was filmed dancing on Canada's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and a homeless shelter said a group demanded meals and threatened the shelter's staff members. Police said they've opened several criminal investigations. The Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, which represents 70 First Nations in Saskatchewan, has also criticized the tactics of the protesters and accused them of cultural appropriation, according to Indian Country Today. Still, the standoff \u2014 as well as the movement it represents \u2014 has galvanized many conservative leaders in Canada and the U.S., with figures like former President Donald Trump and U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene praising the convoy and championing its cause. As Jacobs reported over the weekend, polling shows that Canadians are becoming more supportive of lifting certain public health measures \u2014 \"but that doesn't equal support for protesters' methods or some of the other far-right causes of the organizers in Ottawa.\" Members of the opposition Conservative Party of Canada are split on how to respond, she added. Party lawmakers are largely supporting the convoy, and some have posed for photos with demonstrators. But two have broken with the party and called for the protest to end, with Ontario Premier Doug Ford saying it had \"become an occupation.\" Trudeau, who is recovering from COVID-19, has said that engaging the military in response to the protests is \"not in the cards right now.\" NPR's Rachel Treisman contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "Tensions at the Ukraine-Russia border. Plus, Associate Justice Stephen Breyer's resignation and President Biden's pledge to nominate the first-ever Black woman Supreme Court justice.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: More than 100,000 Russian soldiers stand along the Ukrainian border. NATO countries are moving defensive weapons to the front, and the U.S. has put 8,500 troops on high alert. NPR senior editor and correspondent Ron Elving joins us. Ron, thanks so much for being with us. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott. SIMON: The U.S. this week delivered a written response to Russia's demands, but the Kremlin says that its major concern, that, essentially, NATO is just getting too close to Russia's border, was left unaddressed. What do you make of that? ELVING: There are at least two ways to read this week's developments. The more hopeful read is that Putin wants an off ramp. He doesn't want this confrontation with a NATO alliance that seems awakened and somewhat empowered in this moment. He may want to back off and try again later. That's the hopeful read. The other read would be that Putin is still bent on invading and wants a pretext. So he denies any intent to invade, and then, lo and behold, something happens that Putin deems provocative. And suddenly, his incursion is cast as some sort of self-defense. Now, that may seem transparent and even absurd, but we have seen it before. SIMON: Ron, let me ask you to apply your powers of political analysis to Vladimir Putin. What are his goals in deploying so many troops along the border of a neighboring state that, after all, has not threatened Russia? ELVING: Ukraine itself is no threat to Russia in the usual military sense, but to Putin, Ukraine poses a real threat nonetheless because if Ukraine can break away from the sphere of Russian influence, if Ukraine can have a free democracy and a growing economy with less corruption than it had in the Soviet era or the more recent past, that is a fundamental threat to Putin's regime and Putin's way of doing business. So he's not afraid of Ukraine's weapons or soldiers. He fears what the success of an independent and democratic Ukraine may mean to other countries that were once under the Soviet umbrella or behind the Iron Curtain, as we used to say, Scott, including, ultimately, Russia itself. SIMON: Let's step back to the United States for a moment. Of course, Justice Stephen Breyer retiring from the Supreme Court. President Biden quickly announced he will fulfill his promise to nominate a Black female justice within the next four weeks. Does that timeline hold together for you? ELVING: Yes, it makes sense. It's certainly nowhere near as fast as we raced to the confirmation of the last Supreme Court appointee of President Trump just before the election in 2020. But first, a few words about Breyer. He was appointed by Bill Clinton, and Breyer was anything but a firebrand. He was seen then and seen since as a relatively moderate liberal likely to give the court some balance, counter the more highly partisan appeals from either end of the court's spectrum. And he also turned out to be an intellectual leader, a thoughtful and institutional jurist who wanted to defend the court's longtime role as a moderating centrist institution devoted to the rule of law. Now, as for the new nominee, Biden made the pledge to name a Black woman in the same season when he said that his vice president would be a woman from a community of color. Let's remember there has never been even one African American woman on the high court, despite there being many qualified candidates over the years. And let's remember, too, that no demographic category of voters was more loyal to Biden in 2020 than Black women in the primaries and the general. SIMON: There are plenty of qualified Black women from whom the president could choose. Two women said to be prominently in the running - Ketanji Brown Jackson and J. Michelle Childs. ELVING: Yes, Jackson was recently confirmed to the Federal Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, sometimes known as the little Supreme Court, last stop for several current justices before coming to the Supremes. Jackson was confirmed 53-47, which means she had a little support from across the aisle. Childs is also a federal judge and also now a nominee for the appeals court level.

In a surprise move, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has expanded a special session of the legislature this week to target the state's premier attraction, Disney World. Lawmakers will consider a bill that would end all \"independent special districts\" in the state formed before 1968. In 1967, Disney got the support of Florida's then-Republican governor, Claude Kirk, and the legislature to establish the Reedy Creek Improvement District. It gave Disney near-total control of nearly 40 square miles as it built and then operated its theme park. It exempts the park and its environs from nearly all state regulations. Property taxes and elevator inspections are exceptions. DeSantis announced the move to try to dissolve the district at a press conference Tuesday with Republican leaders in Florida's House and Senate. Disney has long been one of the leading businesses in Florida with one of the most powerful voices in the state capitol. DeSantis has criticized the entertainment giant in recent months for what he has called its \"woke\" policies, including requiring its employees to wear facemasks in the park during the COVID-19 pandemic. In recent weeks, the tensions heightened when Disney CEO Bob Chapek said he'd support the repeal of Florida's Parental Rights in Education Act, a measure critics call \"Don't Say Gay.\" At the time, DeSantis said he believed Disney had \"crossed the line.\" Things had been different between Disney and DeSantis. Politico reported that the company donated $50,000 directly to Desantis during the 2020 election cycle. Last year, the governor's staff worked with Disney to give it an exemption from a law designed to crack down on big tech companies. DeSantis now says that was a mistake. And Disney says it has halted all political contributions in Florida.",

            "article_content": "A grand jury has indicted a Colorado county clerk, Tina Peters, and her deputy on a laundry list of charges related to an election security breach in her office last summer that was influenced by former President Donald Trump's false claims that he won the 2020 election. The charges against Peters come as election workers around the U.S. face death threats amid a national disinformation campaign that has falsely alleged wide-scale election tampering in 2020. Peters' case is particularly worrisome to many who run elections as a sign that insiders might act upon those conspiracy theories, further undermining confidence in the voting process. Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters is seen in a Feb. 10 booking photo. Peters is under investigation for alleged election security breaches.\n                \n                    \n                    Mesa County Sheriff's Office via AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters is seen in a Feb. 10 booking photo. Peters is under investigation for alleged election security breaches. Peters, who's the county clerk and recorder in Mesa County, in western Colorado, faces 10 counts, including seven felony charges and three misdemeanors. The felony charges include attempting to influence a public servant, identity theft, criminal impersonation and conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation. The misdemeanors include first-degree official misconduct, violation of duty and failure to comply with the requirements of the secretary of state. Her deputy, Belinda Knisley, has been indicted on six counts, including attempt to influence a public servant, conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation, violation of duty and failure to comply with the requirements of the secretary of state. The pair is accused of helping an unauthorized person make copies of sensitive voting-machine hard drives and attend an annual software update. Information from the machines and secure passwords were later shared with election conspiracy theorists online. Shortly after the data was leaked, Peters appeared at an event put on by MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, one of the leading promoters of the conspiracy theory that the 2020 election was rigged. \"Something didn't seem right in our county from years ago to the 2020 election. And they wanted answers. And I said, 'You know what? If there's a there there, we'll find it.' And I've made that pledge to the citizens of Mesa County and all over Colorado,\" said Peters during the 2021 event. The maker of the equipment, Dominion Voting Systems, has been the focus of false conspiracy theories claiming it helped steal the 2020 election for President Biden. Dominion is suing a number of the most prominent proponents of those claims for defamation. In a joint statement announcing the indictment, Mesa County District Attorney Dan Rubinstein and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said, \"This investigation is ongoing, and other defendants may be charged as we learn more information. We remind everyone that these are allegations at this point and that they are presumed innocent until proven guilty.\" The indictment argues that Peters and Knisley together lied to other Mesa County staff, as well as workers in the secretary of state's office. It also alleges that the two committed identity theft against a local man, Gerald \"Jerry\" Wood, in order to give someone \u2014 the indictment doesn't say who \u2014 access to the hard drives and the software update in his name. It states that the women \"devised and executed a deceptive scheme which was designed to influence public servants, breach security protocols, exceed permissible access to voting equipment, and set in motion the eventual distribution of confidential information to unauthorized people.\" Peters said the indictment was another in a series of politically motivated accusations by Rubenstein, who she called a \"self-identified never-Trumper,\" and Democratic Secretary of State Jena Griswold, who she said had \"ties to George Soros funding.\" \"Using a grand jury to formalize politically-motivated accusations against candidates is tactic long employed by the Democrat Party,\" Peters said in a statement. \"Using legal muscle to indict political opponents during an election isn't new strategy, but it's easier to execute when you have a district attorney who despises President Trump and any constitutional conservative like myself who continues to demand all election evidence be made available to the public.\" Peters has long maintained that she has every right to look into potential election fraud and was simply responding to the concerns of her constituents. \"I have attempted to investigate the results of the elections, a duty that I have to my constituents,\" she told Colorado Public Radio. \"They were coming to me.\" Peters recently announced she is running for secretary of state against Griswold, who has been a driving force in the investigation against her. She said the indictment is an attempt \"influence voters enough with indictments and arrests and media drama during the primaries, to elect a weaker general election opponent\" against Griswold. Griswold first said her office would look into a possible security breach last August. \"Every eligible Coloradan \u2013 Republican, Democrat, and Unaffiliated alike \u2013 has the right to make their voice heard in safe, accessible, and secure elections,\" said Griswold in a statement after the indictment was announced. \"To do that, we need election administrators who are committed to following the law and election rules. Officials tasked with carrying out elections do so in public trust and must be held accountable when they abuse their power or position.\" Republican Party leaders in Colorado urged Peters to suspend her campaign. \"It is our belief, as leaders of the Colorado Republican Party, that any Republican candidate who is indicted with felonies by a grand jury and who will be charged by a Republican District Attorney should suspend their campaign while they undergo the legal challenges associated with those indictments,\" said a joint statement from the party's top leaders. A judge banned Peters from overseeing Mesa County's 2021 election, and the county had to turn to outside help to manage the office's staff. A current lawsuit requests that Peters be removed from playing any role in managing the 2022 vote. The county was also required to replace the Dominion Voting machines after the state decertified them last fall, just weeks before the election. The bipartisan Colorado County Clerks Association called the \"breach of trust\" devastating and said from the beginning that it was unified in its desire to see the situation in Mesa County investigated fully and that if there was wrongdoing, the association wanted it exposed and prosecuted. \"From the initial public reports of Clerk Peters' actions, it was clear she violated her oath of office and likely broke the law. Since that time, she has repeated in sworn court filings that she carried out acts that violated her oath. Now, a grand jury of her peers seated by her own district attorney has determined she allegedly committed several crimes, including official misconduct.\" The investigation has divided Republican elected officials in the deeply conservative part of Colorado who have spoken out against her actions. Mesa County Commissioner Scott McInnis, a Republican, has described the months-long investigation into Peters as a cascading series of mini-crises with so many legal questions, public hearings and fights with Peters and her supporters. He said if Peters really believed her county's voting machines were hacked, she should have called the proper authorities to look into it. \"There's a right way to do it, and there's a wrong way she chose intentionally, because I think she wanted the attention. And she wanted to show the country that she had discovered why Trump lost the election. This is my opinion.\" Colorado lawmakers will be considering legislation this session to try to prevent similar types of possible security breaches in the future.",

Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona speaks at the U.S. Capitol after the Senate passed the Respect for Marriage Act in November. Sinema announced Friday she would register as an independent rather than a Democrat. Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, an unapologetic moderate who has alienated progressives with her stance on the filibuster and other issues, is leaving the Democratic Party to register as an independent. Sinema announced the news on Friday via Twitter, in an Arizona Republic op-ed and interviews with CNN and Politico. \"In a natural extension of my service since I was first elected to Congress, I have joined the growing numbers of Arizonans who reject party politics by declaring my independence from the broken partisan system in Washington and formally registering as an Arizona Independent,\" she tweeted. Sinema's move is unlikely to change the power balance in the Senate, as it comes days after Sen. Raphael Warnock won the Georgia runoff election to give Democrats a 51-49 majority. That includes two independents who caucus with them, Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine. \"We understand that [Sinema's] decision to register as an independent in Arizona does not change the new Democratic majority control of the Senate, and we have every reason to expect that we will continue to work successfully with her,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. Sinema notified Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of her decision on Thursday, and he agreed to keep her committee assignments as they are. \"I believe she's a good and effective Senator and am looking forward to a productive session in the new Democratic majority Senate,\" Schumer said in a statement. Sinema told Politico she will not caucus with Republicans. She also said she won't attend weekly Democratic Caucus meetings, but rarely does that now. And she wrote in her op-ed that becoming an independent won't change her work in the Senate, adding that \"my service to Arizona remains the same.\" \"I've never fit neatly into any party box. I've never really tried. I don't want to,\" she told CNN. \"Removing myself from the partisan structure \u2014 not only is it true to who I am and how I operate, I also think it'll provide a place of belonging for many folks across the state and the country, who also are tired of the partisanship.\" In 2018, Sinema became the first Arizona Democrat elected to the Senate in 30 years, as well as the state's first-ever female senator and the first openly bisexual senator in U.S. history. She promised to \"be an independent voice for all Arizonans.\" But Sinema's bipartisan approach to legislating had alienated many of her Democratic colleagues and constituents, particularly over the last two years, in an evenly divided Senate where any one vote could influence or derail a bill (even with the House and White House under Democratic control). Over the last two years, she and fellow moderate Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia have been criticized as standing in the way of President Biden's agenda by regularly holding up or objecting to parts of key legislation, as was the case with Democrats' key budget package. Fellow Arizona lawmaker,  Rep. Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva, a Democrat, summed up this frustration among some in his caucus in a statement on Friday and called Sinema's switch \"predictable.\" \"Her decision, while disappointing, does not shift the balance of power and Democrats will move forward putting people over politics with or without her help,\" he said in the statement. In Friday's op-ed, Sinema acknowledged that her approach has led to tension, at times, on both sides of the aisle. \"My approach is rare in Washington and has upset partisans in both parties,\" she wrote. \"It is also an approach that has delivered lasting results for Arizona.\" Sinema pointed to her work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass legislation related to critical infrastructure, economic competitiveness, water issues, veterans' benefits, marriage access for LGTBQ Americans and gun safety, among other issues. And she named several areas in which her position and priorities remain steadfast \u2014 for example, that \"a woman's health care decision should be between her, her doctor and her family\" and her work to \"secure the southern border, ensure fair and humane treatment for migrants and permanently protect 'Dreamers.'\" But she also wrote about what she won't do. \"If anyone previously supported me because they believed, contrary to my promise, that I would be a blindly loyal vote for a partisan agenda \u2013 or for those who believe our state should be represented by partisans who push divisive, negative politics, regardless of the impact on our state \u2013 then there are sure to be others vying for your support,\" she added. Sinema is up for reelection in 2024. She declined to discuss pursuing a second Senate term, telling Politico, \"It's fair to say that I'm not talking about it right now.\" Still, in addition to the ideological points she's made, the decision to become independent may also be a political calculation by Sinema that she couldn't win in a Democratic primary. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., had emerged as a potential Democratic challenger to Sinema, but she would not face him in a primary as an independent. The Democratic political action committee that has been organizing against Sinema said in a statement that the senator \"just made our jobs easier by bowing out of a Democratic primary she knew she couldn't win. Now, we'll beat her in the general election with a real Democrat.\" Arizona has shifted from once reliably red to become a swing state since Sinema's election in 2018. It's electorate is roughly one third Democrats, one third independents and one third Republican. But if Sinema runs as an independent, she could split the votes with a Democratic candidate and give an opening to the GOP to flip the seat red in 2024.",

In August of 1895, a ship called the SS Coptic approached the coast of Northern California. On that boat was a passenger from San Francisco, a young man named Wong Kim Ark who was returning home after visiting his wife and child in China. He'd taken trips like this before, and expected to come back to the city he was born in, to his life and friends. But when the ship docked, officials told him he couldn't get off. The customs agent barred him according to the Chinese Exclusion Act, which denied citizenship to Chinese immigrants. Though Wong Kim Ark had been born in the U.S. and lived his whole life there, the agent said he was not a citizen. Wong was moved from steamer to steamer for months. But he was able to contact representatives from the Chinese Six Companies, a consortium of Chinese business owners that often hired legal representation for people subject to discrimination. His subsequent legal battles culminated in the 1897 Supreme Court case United States. v. Wong Kim Ark: a case that would forever change the path of American immigration law, and play a pivotal role in the ongoing battle over who gets to be a citizen of the United States.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: The tradition dates back to the presidency of Ronald Reagan. The White House invites everyday Americans to sit with the first lady during the president's State of the Union address. The guests are typically chosen to illustrate how the president's policies will affect the people he governs. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JILL BIDEN: He knows that these aren't just issues to be debated or polled. They're the challenges that shape your lives, the things that keep you up at night. And he knows that you're counting on him for real solutions and that you can't wait. SHAPIRO: That's first lady Jill Biden introducing her guests on a call with reporters before last year's joint address to Congress. They attended virtually because of the pandemic. One was Javier Quiroz Castro. He's a DACA recipient who joined the introductory call on his lunch break from work as a nurse at Houston Methodist West Hospital. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JAVIER QUIROZ CASTRO: It's been - it's been challenging, especially with the previous administration, but DACA has given me all sorts of opportunities. And I hope I can continue being in this country as a productive member of society because there's still a lot of work to do during this pandemic. SHAPIRO: Another guest at last year's speech was a gun violence prevention advocate from Milwaukee named Tatiana Washington. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TATIANA WASHINGTON: March 11, 2017, is a day I will never forget. It is a day I lost my Aunt Sherida in a murder-suicide at the hands of her husband. Gun violence does not only affect one person but so many because it has such a ripple effect. It tears families and communities apart. SHAPIRO: Well, a year later, we wanted to hear their impressions of the Biden presidency, so we've invited Javier Quiroz Castro and Tatiana Washington to join us now. Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. WASHINGTON: Hi. Thank you so much. QUIROZ CASTRO: Thank you so much for having me on. SHAPIRO: So before we turn to your specific policy priorities, how did you feel a year ago when you were asked to be guests of the first lady for this high-profile event? WASHINGTON: Yeah. You know, for me, it was so surreal. And it was such an honor not only to be able to share my story with the first lady and be able to tell folks about how much of an amazing person my aunt was but also to represent the hundreds and thousands of gun violence prevention advocates and survivors across the country. SHAPIRO: And Javier? QUIROZ CASTRO: Yes. I mean, it felt incredible. It's not every day that you get a phone call from the White House, you know, being invited to these type of things, especially the reason as to why you're invited. You know, you're representing immigrants, you're representing DACA recipients. And it's a - it was a really incredible feeling to be recognized and to be part of that - you know, incredible. SHAPIRO: And in the year since, how have your feelings changed? WASHINGTON: For me, honestly, it's been really disappointing. During the campaign, we're promised that we'd have action on gun violence prevention. And, you know, unfortunately, 47,000 people have died to gun violence since the president has been in office, and we haven't seen any action. So it's very disappointing. SHAPIRO: You say we haven't seen any action. Are there specific missed opportunities that you would point to? WASHINGTON: Yeah. So one thing that he can do right now that he doesn't need Congress approval for is to appoint a gun violence prevention director. And another thing that he promised while he was campaigning for president was to repeal PLCAA, which would open up some accountability for gun manufacturers the same way that we do for any other business. And he hasn't done so yet. SHAPIRO: All right. So some disappointment there from Tatiana. Javier, how about you? How are you feeling a year later? QUIROZ CASTRO: Yeah. I think I have to agree with Tatiana. I'm a little disappointed, and it's unfortunate because it was a huge feeling of relief to have a different kind of administration, not one that, you know, put a target on my back. So it felt like at least I didn't have that pressure and that stress. But here we are a year later. SHAPIRO: When you say pressure and stress, you mean fear of deportation under the Trump administration. QUIROZ CASTRO: Yeah, absolutely, fear of deportation. You know, they attempted multiple times to dismantle the DACA program. And, you know, at the time, you know, here I am stepping up to the plate to take care of COVID-19 patients and putting my family and my health at risk and trying to benefit the community. And, you know, it was definitely the - some of the hardest years of my entire life. So it felt, you know, relieving to hear a president promising to, you know, step in and potentially give us some type of permanent legislation to protect DACA recipients and, you know, many undocumented immigrants that contribute to the economy and to the communities. But, you know, so far, we're a year in and no permanent legislation has been able to be passed. And there is definitely a lot of work to be done there, for sure. SHAPIRO: Let me ask you both. There is so much going on right now. The administration is consumed with the war in Ukraine, inflation and other priorities. Do you both feel like your key issues - gun violence and immigration - are still on the front burner for President Biden? WASHINGTON: Personally, I don't. He's had, you know, over a year to act. And ultimately, he's responsible. Forty-seven thousand people have lost their lives to guns while he's been in administration. That is not OK. That it's not excusable. More and more folks are losing loved ones to gun violence. And, you know, he spoke to survivors and said that he was going to act on this issue. And we have yet to see a comprehensive plan. And when I say comprehensive, I mean something that's not punitive and doesn't rely on criminalization of folks and that really promotes community healing. SHAPIRO: And Javier. QUIROZ CASTRO: Absolutely not. Definitely immigration has taken the back burner, but it's been on the back burner for a very long time. And you have to ask yourselves, like, at what point - you need to bring that issue from the back burner to the front because it's been there for so long. DACA was announced in 2012, and here we are 2022 and nothing has been done. You know, here we are. Time is ticking. Time is of the essence. You know, people are still trying to come into this country for a better life. People have been in the country for decades contributing. And it's time that, you know, we get something in return. SHAPIRO: OK. So I want to ask how you're feeling about the upcoming midterms because while I hear your frustration with the president and his policies, his lack of action, if the historical trend lines hold, Republicans are likely to regain control of Congress in November's elections, and that party is less friendly to gun violence prevention, to citizenship for immigrants. How are you feeling about that? WASHINGTON: I am very worried. The president made a promise for immediate action on gun violence during his campaign, and that didn't happen. And I'm worried that folks are losing hope in the administration and electoral politics and simply aren't going to go out to vote. SHAPIRO: Are you losing confidence? Are you losing faith in the process and the political system? WASHINGTON: You know, what gives me hope is six years ago, there would never be conversations that we're having now on gun violence prevention. There wouldn't be so many champions in the House and the Senate, and that's what keeps me going. SHAPIRO: What are each of you going to be listening for during the speech? WASHINGTON: I need President Biden to address gun violence, and I want him to declare this a national emergency because it is. SHAPIRO: Javier, what are you going to be listening for in the State of the Union address? QUIROZ CASTRO: I'm going to be listening for some type of plan or message that continues to highlight the importance of immigrants and where we are because I at least need to hear that our leader has not forgotten about us because we're still out here benefitting in this country and still have not had anything in return. SHAPIRO: That's Javier Quiroz Castro, a DACA recipient and nurse at Houston Methodist West Hospital, and also Tatiana Washington, a gun violence prevention advocate in Milwaukee and former policy associate with March for Our Lives. Thank you both for speaking with us today. WASHINGTON: Thank you so much. QUIROZ CASTRO: Absolutely. Thank you so much for having me. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Under the studio system, early American movie stars like Cary Grant worked on contract, frequently playing the same character \u2014 or the same type of character \u2014 across their careers. But author Isaac Butler says all that changed with the introduction of Method acting. Method acting, Butler says, prizes \"that moment where the actor is so into the imagined reality of the character that, to some extent, they're really feeling and experiencing what the character is going through.\" Think Robert De Niro, who gained 60 pounds to play retired boxer Jake LaMotta in the 1980 film Raging Bull, or Daniel Day-Lewis, who famously stayed in character \u2014 both on set and off \u2014 while filming Lincoln. In his new book, The Method: How the Twentieth Century Learned to Act,   Butler traces the history of the Method. It springs from \"the system,\" a series of techniques created in the early 1900s by the Russian director Konstantin Stanislavski, which were then adapted in the U.S. by the Group Theatre and The Actors Studio. The Method, he says, \"instilled in us these ideas that at the heart of a dramatic story is action and is characters who want something and are doing things in order to pursue those things that they want. He points to Al Pacino's performance in the first Godfather film as perhaps the epitome of the technique. \"It feels like a real person in all of their complexity, not like a type or a stock role or anything like that. And Al Pacino just seems really alive in the moment and really present in that role at all times,\" Butler says. \"A lot of that role is communicated nonverbally, through you watching the character think.\" The Method, by Isaac Butler\n                \n                    \n                    Bloomsbury Publishing\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Method, by Isaac Butler On Stanislavski's belief that actors were their own material The system flows from a couple of really simple core ideas: One of them has to do with the necessity of the actor \"experiencing,\" the word that they use. Experiencing is a rough translation of a Russian word ... [that] means just that moment where the actor is so into the imagined reality of the character that to some extent, they're really feeling and experiencing what the character is going through. And some of its other sort of core ideas are that the actor is their own material. They're kind of both the painter and the paint, that a role should be divided up into its component parts, which he called \"bits.\" He was very into physical relaxation and the actor using the powers of concentration and attention to forget the audience was there, and to try to kind of live again within the imagined reality of the play and of the character. One of the things that he was also very interested in, which would become particularly notorious in the United States, was this idea of affective memory. Affective memory is essentially triggering a strong emotional state that you might need to play the character, through using your own memories of when you have experienced that emotion. On the seismic impact Stanislavski's Moscow Art Theater had in New York in the early 1920s It's sort of difficult to oversell how important their Broadway run on their U.S. tour was. People had really never seen acting like what they saw from the Moscow Theater. John Barrymore wrote a letter to the producer that was published in The New York Times saying it was the best acting ensemble he'd ever seen. People would come back night after night, rapt with attention to what they were seeing. And these plays, it should be said, were performed in Russian, and most of the audience members did not speak Russian. So it's even coming across this language barrier. What they were particularly swept away by was that every actor in the Moscow Art Theater would sort of fully dedicate themselves to their characters, even if those characters were supernumeraries. ... Stanislavski is the guy who came up with the phrase \"There are no small parts, only small actors,\" and he really lived it in his company. And so you would just see this ensemble who were all on the same page working towards the same ends and giving it their all and people were completely blown away by it. On the creation of The Group Theatre in 1931, the American interpretation of Stanislavski, and the creation of \"The Method\" The Group Theatre was an ensemble theater producing new works on Broadway with a fixed acting company. It was co-founded by Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford and Lee Strasberg. And the idea was to create and discover a uniquely American voice, a uniquely American way of doing theater, and whose acting techniques would draw on Stanislavski to create the most present, vital, living, alive-feeling acting possible. The Theatre starts performing in 1931. We're in the midst of the Great Depression. We're still recovering from the wreckage of World War I, that America was filled with a new people and that out of this wreckage could grow a kind of utopia. And The Group was in some ways they were utopian dreamers and their theater company was a utopian dream. And, of course, it didn't work out that way. The company lasted 10 years before going bankrupt. But along the way, it launched the careers of Harold Clurman, prominent critic and director; Lee Strasberg, who became the most important and famous acting teacher in America of the 20th century; Stella Adler, his rival; Sanford Meisner, who's also an incredibly important acting teacher; Clifford Odets, the most important playwright of the 1930s; and, of course, Elia Kazan, who for a while was the most important theater director and the most important film director simultaneously. And several of those people then went on after The Group died to found The Actor's Studio, which became the kind of high temple of the Method from then on. On the actor that brought the Method from the stage to Hollywood Film and television actually becomes, in many ways, sort of the largest vehicle for the Method throughout the rest of the century. In some ways, the most important actor to come out of the group, who I maintain is actually the first Method film star is a man named John Garfield. He gives this unbelievable performance in this kind of nothing [1938] movie [Four Daughters], it's a very silly, slight film, but the performance he gives, as soon as he walks on camera, you can just tell that something is happening, that acting is changing, that the norms around what a character is, that they're never going to be the same on some level because he's so vital and in the moment and he feels much more like a real person than everyone else. But it wasn't easy for him to learn how to do that. He couldn't just do a stage performance on camera. If you've ever seen someone just give a stage-size performance on camera, it's really too much because the camera picks up so much that an audience at the theater will not see. It can really see you think or people talk about it reading your mind. ... So he really had to learn how to do much less and much less and much less, and to strip away and to learn how to perform with a new kind of ease and spontaneity that the camera would kind of pick up and enjoy. On the acting style that emerges in the '50s with Marlon Brando Speaking colloquially is a big part of that style. A lot of it has to do with an emphasis on subtext and emphasis on what the character is not saying, not allowing to be voiced on the restraint of emotion and then contrasting that kind of with huge emotional displays when necessary. There's that colloquialism of speech also extends to the body and movement that feels very much like an everyday person. It often involves throwing away lines instead of making sure you can clearly understand all of them. And often it is marked by \u2013 and this is particularly because Elia Kazan was really into this \u2013 it's often marked by an extensive use of props on set and the use of the actors hands and the objects they fiddle with to reveal kind of what's going on with the character. On how De Niro's physical transformation for the 1980 film Raging Bull changed acting Part of the problem that actors steeped in the Method were having on set is how do I turn it on, on command, right? Because like they've got to set the lighting, they've got to stand on your mark and then suddenly someone calls action and you have to really be in character. Well, one way to solve that problem is to never break character, right? One way to solve that problem is to really live as the character as much as possible. That is not what Strasberg taught. Strasberg was actually very opposed to that, but particularly after Raging Bull (because De Niro wins the Best Actor Oscar for it) ... De Niro is sort of enshrined as our greatest living American film actor. It just exerts an enormous influence not only on actors, but on the PR and awards campaigns for acting. It exerts its own influence. So there becomes a kind of material or industrial reason why actors are doing this, because then they can talk about the fact that they did it. And that leads to there's a self-parody kind of version of this. We've all watched the press junkets or someone's like, \"Oh yes, then I didn't bathe for six months and I got so drunk every night I vomited on myself, and so that's what I did to get into character.\" And it just seems ridiculous that that, to me, is a kind of perversion of what De Niro was trying to do.

WASHINGTON \u2014  The late Sen. Harry Reid was remembered Wednesday at the U.S. Capitol as a \"legendary leader,\" a hardscrabble Democrat who rose from poverty in a dusty Nevada mining town to deliver landmark legislation from the chamber's most powerful position. President Joe Biden, who has called Reid a \"great American,\" paid silent tribute, stopping by briefly as Reid lay in state at the Capitol Rotunda. Biden made the sign of the cross and let his hand linger for a moment on the flag-draped casket. Reid lay in state at the Capitol Rotunda while Vice President Kamala Harris, senators and others joined for a ceremony almost as succinct as his own dry-humored style of hanging up the phone rather than engaging in lengthy goodbyes. Reid, who had pancreatic cancer, died last month at age 82. \"Harry Reid made the world a better place,\" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.

She called Reid \"a legendary leader of great integrity.\" Reid served longer in Congress than anyone from his Battle Born state and was the Senate majority leader alongside two presidents. He led the Senate during one of its more consequential legislative sessions, securing the economic recovery bill during the Great Recession and President Barack Obama's landmark health care law.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., spoke of having to explain Reid's abrupt, soft-spoken leadership style to the new senators. \"Even though Harry talked softly, what he said carried the force of thunder,\" Schumer said. Schumer said Reid never forgot the struggles of families and places like the one he came from and believed government had a moral obligation to ensure Americans had opportunities to improve their lives. \"Few have shaped the workings of this building like our dear friend from Nevada,\" he said. \"Few have dedicated their lives to the work of the people quite like Harry did. The service was largely closed to the public under COVID-19 protocols, though former colleagues, staff and others were permitted to visit during the day. He was only the 15th senator have to had the honor; his casket rested on the catafalque used for Abraham Lincoln. Harris did not speak during her visit, but paused at the casket in tribute, as did the Republican leaders in Congress, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California. Biden, Obama and others paid tribute during a funeral service last weekend in Las Vegas recalling Reid's feisty wit, disinterest in Washington's social scene and fearless approach to governing. The few words Reid did say were often flinty and fiery. He was unafraid to take on presidents (he called George W. Bush a \"loser\"), criticize the fossil fuel industry (\"coal makes us sick\") or declare the war in Iraq \"lost.\" He titled his 2008 autobiography \"The Good Fight.\" The casket of former Sen.

Harry Reid arrives in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol. Influential in retirement, Reid said Biden should give his new presidency just three weeks to try to work with Republicans. If not, Biden should force changes in the Senate's filibuster rules to allow simple majority passage of elections and voting rights legislation and other priorities, Reid said. \"The time's going to come when he's going to have to move in and get rid of the filibuster,\" Reid told The Associated Press. With the Senate in difficult discussions this week on changes to the filibuster to push election and voting legislation past Republican objections, Schumer leaned on Reid's legacy as a \"steward of the Senate.\" \"He also knew the Senate had to adapt to changing times,\" Schumer said. Reid was born in the desolate mining town of Searchlight. His father was a hard-rock miner who committed suicide. His mother did laundry at home for bordellos. (Reid and other kids would swim in a brothel's pool.) Searchlight was a place, he said, that \"had seen its better days.\" The town had no churches, his family no religion. But a picture of President Franklin D. Roosevelt hanging in the Reid home would influence his political career.

Reid hitchhiked some 40 miles to attend high school and joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as he made his way through college and law school. An amateur boxer, he once leveled a punch at his future father-in-law after being denied a date with Landra Gould, who would become his wife. They were married for 62 years. During Wednesday's ceremony, Landra Reid held a black hat that her husband often wore in his final years, as she sat in the Rotunda with the couple's five adult children. As she approached the casket, she set the hat beneath it under the Capitol dome, before placing a hand out in a kiss goodbye. First elected to the House in 1982 and reelected in 1984, Reid then served 30 years in the Senate, including a decade as the Senate Democratic leader. Along the way, Reid rewrote the map of Nevada by expanding public lands, halting the planned Yucca Mountain nuclear waste outside of Las Vegas; and securing national monument status around artist Michael Heizer's \"City\" installation in the desert. He quietly ensured federal money to research UFOs. A man of few words, Reid often wrote notes instead \u2014 to family, colleagues and a Nevada student advocate who had reached out on immigration law changes. He championed the Dream Act and Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals to protect young immigrants in the U.S. without legal status from deportation.

As his power rose, Reid engineered a Democratic legacy for his state with Nevada's early presidential caucus. He left behind a state party apparatus that was sometimes referred to as the \"Reid Machine\" for its enduring political power seeking to elect the next generation of Democratic leaders. After an exercise accident at home, and with Democrats back in the Senate minority, Reid announced he would not seek reelection in 2016. In his farewell address to the Senate, he acknowledged he had done things that \"probably a lot of people wouldn't do.\" But he passed on his advice to those wondering how he made it from Searchlight to Washington. \"I didn't make it because of my good looks. I didn't make it because I am a genius. I made it because I worked hard,\" Reid said. \"Whatever you want to try to do, make sure you work as hard as you can to try to do what you want to do.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  and Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer pay their respects at Harry Reid's casket.\n                \n                    \n                    Tom Williams/Pool via AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  and Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer pay their respects at Harry Reid's casket.",

AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: There are recounts and a runoff still in the works nearly two weeks after the midterm elections. But the numbers in the House and Senate are essentially holding steady. We're joined now by NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro. Good morning. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey, Ayesha. RASCOE: So Democrats have maintained control of the Senate. Republicans have taken the House. But with such thin majorities, what will this mean for actually getting things done in January when in Congress, it's always hard to get something done? MONTANARO: Yeah, we're talking about divided government, so not much likely to get done without compromise. But that hasn't exactly been Congress's MO, especially for House Republicans over the last decade plus. So expect a pretty confrontational Republican House here. You know, going to see Kevin McCarthy, the congressman from California who wants to be speaker. He or anyone else who wants to be speaker - they're going to have to make some pretty steep concessions to the hard right in their party. So that will not incentivize getting much done across the aisle. Instead, we're likely to see, I think, a lot of spectacle, investigations, including about the president's son, Hunter Biden, the IRS, even potential impeachments of Biden administration officials. Of course, none of that is going to go anywhere in the Democratic Senate, but Republicans are going to try to grab some headlines for sure. Meanwhile, Democrats - you know, it'll be a new generation of leaders stepping forward for the first time in 20 years. Nancy Pelosi's stepping down as the head of the party's caucus in the House. And being in the minority, it's not a bad time for a leadership shift. It'll give Democrats a chance to work out the kinks. They'll have a common enemy in Republicans to unify them. Pelosi is still sticking around, so she'll be there to advise them. And, you know, she's going to go down as one of the most effective speakers in history. RASCOE: So what are some of the priorities for the lame duck session? MONTANARO: A lot of things on the on the plate here. You know, Democrats are going to try and address a bunch of things. The debt ceiling, for example - they may try to make it automatic. Not sure they have the votes to do that, but they're going to try. That would take away what could be a really key piece of leverage for House Republicans come January who are going to try and force some spending cuts by threatening the nation's credit, really. They've also just simply got to fund the government. So expect an attempt to get what they call an omnibus spending bill through that could have a lot of Christmas ornaments on it. RASCOE: (Laughter). MONTANARO: Little priorities for each district and state. Another priority is passing the National Defense Authorization Act, aid to Ukraine. We could see a push to codify same-sex marriage. That's being negotiated with a bipartisan group and the Senate. Democrats also likely to make a push on a fix for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Federal courts are expected to end that executive order that was originally issued by President Obama a decade ago. You know, more than 600,000 people who were brought to the U.S. when they were children are currently shielded from deportation under the program. So pretty big deal. Lots to do. RASCOE: And that's DACA that you're referring to, right? MONTANARO: Yes. RASCOE: And so and there are some - you know, still some recounts and potential challenges to some results in the works. Like, what are you watching for there? MONTANARO: You know, everything's basically wrapped up. I mean, Congresswoman Lauren Boebert's Colorado district is headed to an automatic recount, even though her opponent has already conceded. Only about 500 votes separate them. But I have to say Adam Frisch, who's the Democrat former Aspen City councilman - he's already filed to run again in 2024. So you can bet it's going to be a lot of money that comes into that race, you know, in - over the next couple of years. Arizona, of course, you know, has been something of a hotbed for election denialism. You know, Trump Republicans, you know, like Kari Lake refusing to concede the governor's race there, even though she lost by over 17,000 votes. Very close but outside the 0.5 percentage point margin for an automatic recount. She says she's amassing a team of lawyers to challenge the result. It's, of course, her right, but this has been a very closely watched tabulation - no evidence of widespread fraud. Probably not the last time we've heard of Lake, though. She was spotted at former President Trump's Florida home, Mar-a-Lago. RASCOE: In just a few seconds we have left, speaking of Trump, he did announce for the presidential campaign in 2024. There's also a special prosecutor that was named to investigate him this week. What does that mean for Republicans? MONTANARO: Yeah, they really did not want him to necessarily announce right now, especially after a slate of his candidates had lost. So it's going to be really interesting to watch how that winds up affecting things and if anybody else gets in the race. RASCOE: That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Thank you so much, Domenico.

            "article_content": "New York Times reporter Jeremy Peters says the religious right and social conservatives \"got basically everything that they wanted\" from Trump's presidency. Peters' new book is Insurgency.  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. How did the Republican Party become the party of Trump? That's the question that has led many Republicans to become former Republicans. It's also the question that motivated the new book \"Insurgency: How Republicans Lost Their Party And Got Everything They Ever Wanted.\" My guest, Jeremy Peters, wrote the book after reporting on many of the events that led to Trump. He's a correspondent for The New York Times and has covered conservative media, the rise of the Tea Party, right-wing populism and the last three presidential campaigns. He's also an MSNBC contributor. He writes, Trump didn't bring anything inside the Republican Party that wasn't already there. Jeremy Peters, welcome to FRESH AIR. JEREMY PETERS: Thanks for having me. GROSS: What do you mean when you say Republicans lost their party but got everything they ever wanted? What do you mean by they got everything they ever wanted? PETERS: So I thought that that was a really important way to think about why so many Republicans - Republicans who had opposed Donald Trump, insisted that they would never vote for him, came along in the end. And that's because Trump very strategically cut deals with his most important constituency, and that's the religious right. And if you look at the endgame of the Trump presidency, it's kind of hard not to see that the religious right and social conservatives got basically everything that they wanted. We're looking at a Supreme Court right now with three Trump nominees who are poised to strike down Roe v. Wade. And there has been no more galvanizing political effort for conservatives over the last 40 years than striking down Roe v. Wade. So I think if you are one of those voters, if you're one of those activists - and I interviewed many of them for this book - that allows them to see past the ugliness of Trumpism. It allows them to see past January 6, frankly. And I posed that question to a lot of these folks as I reported the book in its final phases. I said, you know, looking at what we saw happen, Trump supporters ransacking the Capitol, threatening to execute the vice president, as you watched that, did you think to yourself, this is all worth it? And frankly, most of them, if not all of them, said, yes, it was. GROSS: So they got Supreme Court justices, a big majority on the Supreme Court, the possibility of doing away with Roe v. Wade. What else do you think social conservatives got through the bargain with Trump? PETERS: Well, it's not just social conservatives, although that's a huge piece of this. I mean, you have gun rights activists who are emboldened right now. You have, you know, people who are concerned with more esoteric notions of deregulation and shrinking the power that government bureaucrats have. And the Supreme Court is certainly stacked for them at this point. But social conservatives, importantly, didn't just gain seats on the Supreme Court. What they gained was a kind of like social and political cachet that they didn't have in the Republican Party before Trump. And that's because Donald Trump didn't really know any better. He didn't practice politics as usual. He didn't talk the same way around sensitive issues like abortion as a Mitt Romney or George W. Bush would and kind of tiptoe around it. Donald Trump was the first Republican presidential nominee to say, I will appoint justices that will overturn Roe v. Wade. And that really emboldened the social right in a way that we hadn't seen before. GROSS: I want to get back to something you say in the book, which is that Trump didn't bring anything to the Republican Party that wasn't already there. Is that really still true? Did the Republicans in the past try to overturn an election or justify an insurrection and, you know, describe it as people posing as Trump supporters or looking like tourists, you know, in the Capitol? That seems kind of unprecedented. PETERS: Oh, that - so yes. The violence, of course, that we saw on January 6 with the insurrection is, of course, unprecedented. What I lay out in the book is an argument for how the seeds for that insurrection were always there because the modern history of the Republican Party has always been one of insurgency and revolt. And the Republican establishment until 2016 always had the upper hand in quelling those revolts. But you can go back, you know, as recently as 2012 and see the beginnings of an alternate reality taking shape. And this is kind of what I describe in the chapter about Romney's loss and his relationship with Roger Ailes and Fox News. And what was happening there was the beginning of a denial of Republicans' unpopularity with voters. They couldn't accept the fact that they were losing at the ballot box, so they started to invent reasons for that loss that had nothing to do with the truth, that the Democrats were stealing it, that the polls were wrong. People believed this. They believed that the polls were wrong - of course, they weren't. And Obama won his second term. But what happens right after that? People like Donald Trump come out and say it was because of fraud. Roger Ailes has a meeting with Mitt Romney in his hotel suite in Central Park South a few weeks after the election and says, don't worry, it's not your fault, Mitt. The Democrats, they always cheat. So this notion that Republicans only lose because Democrats are somehow pulling a fast one or are corrupt has always been there. But the ugly, violent manifestation of it on January 6 is definitely unprecedented. Now, whether that is the middle of this story or the end of this story, I don't know. But I would say that the way that former President Trump continues to embolden these lies and to defend the rioters, saying that some of them deserve pardons, suggests to me that this is not the end of the story. GROSS: You know, at the same time, I think it's in 2013 when Reince Priebus is asked to basically write an autopsy about what's gone wrong with the Republican Party. And one of his conclusions is we have to be more inclusive and, you know, encourage, you know, DREAMers to get citizenship. And, of course, Trump takes things in exactly the opposite direction. PETERS: Yes, he does. I go through numerous examples in the book about the way that Ari Fleischer, the former George W. Bush press secretary, and other Republicans who are of the Bush wing of the party, really worked hard to talk to Hispanics, Asians in producing this autopsy report because they wanted to understand the GOP's deficiencies in minority communities. So they do this groundwork. They put it in a report and recommend basically a vision for the Republican Party. That sounds like one that's entirely compatible with a diversifying country. The problem is that was not where Republican primary voters wanted to go. And the conservative activists who often, you know, whip up enthusiasm with those grassroots voters and are very influential in Republican primaries took the autopsy as an affront, as another example of the Republican Party establishment trying to silence their voices and push them aside. And that resulted in the kind of upheaval that you saw eventually culminate with Donald Trump, who I think ultimately, as the book argues, is a reaction to the decades-long effort of Republican leaders in Washington trying to avoid sharing power with the conservative grassroots and insurgent Republicans. GROSS: Let's take a break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Jeremy Peters, author of the new book \"Insurgency: How Republicans Lost Their Party And Got Everything They Ever Wanted.\" We'll be right back after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF AMY RIGBY SONG, \"PLAYING PITTSBURGH\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Jeremy Peters. He's a correspondent for The New York Times and author of the new book \"Insurgency: How Republicans Lost Their Party And Got Everything They Ever Wanted.\" What are some of the roots that you see in earlier movements or earlier individual leaders that - you know, that precede Trump but help lead to Trump? I mean, how far back do you go? How far back do you think that goes? PETERS: Right. Well, this is always tricky 'cause we could be having, you know, a conversation from Barry Goldwater to Sarah Palin to Donald Trump. (Laughter) And we don't have nearly enough time to do that today. But where I start in the book is chronologically with Pat Buchanan in 1992. Pat Buchanan's presidential campaign that year against the sitting Republican president, George H.W. Bush, really was the canary in the coal mine for establishing the weaknesses that a low-tax, low-spending economic conservative, a robust military, a Republican president had with your average voters. I mean, the fact is, looking back now, there's very little constituency outside of the Republican donor class for somebody who wants to cut taxes for corporations and deregulate. That's just not a populist message. It's not a winning electoral message. But what Pat Buchanan figured out in 1992 was a couple of things, and I think a lot of them have been lost in our memory about what Buchanan meant to people. We tend to associate him with the kind of America First policies that Donald Trump popularized in 2016. But while Buchanan did that, part of what he explained to me and what he wrote in this unpublished memoir that he provided to me as I was researching the book is there was always a racial element to Buchanan's appeal. And by that, I mean he told me that the reason he got into the race against George H.W. Bush was because of affirmative action. George Bush had supported an affirmative action law that really angered conservatives, and that was the last straw for Buchanan. So what that shows you is that there has always been a type of voter who, let's say, at the time, bristled at the fact that they had to press one to hear English when they dialed an automated number. Or they were angry that their kid got denied a slot at a competitive college, and they blamed affirmative action for that. Buchanan saw all of that and took advantage of that in a way that endeared him to the kind of voter who would become Trump's voter. GROSS: Does he have any regrets about having, in his own way, set the stage for Trump? PETERS: No. I would say, in fact, it's exactly the opposite. I think he takes a certain pride in seeing that somebody was able to succeed where he failed. I don't think that he expected Trump to win a second term very much for the reasons that he claimed to support a more restrictive immigration policy. He just didn't think that there were enough white voters in the country left to reelect someone like Trump. GROSS: Let's talk a little bit about the Tea Party. You covered that, you know, insurgency movement. I mean, these were people who are coming into office in Congress determined to change the way Congress works and what the priorities were. Just give us a brief refresher of what the Tea Party stood for. PETERS: So it's impossible to have a conversation about what the Tea Party was without talking about what President Obama meant to a lot of the demonstrators who joined all those rallies in 2009 and 2010. This was very much an anti-Obama movement, and it was a reaction to the feeling among a lot of Americans that they were, quote-unquote, \"losing their country.\" And this has always been a rallying cry for the American right and why, in many respects, the Tea Party was not a unique phenomenon, just like Trumpism was not necessarily unique at its core. It represents a fear that many Americans have long held, that they are one presidential election away from losing their purchase on cultural and political power in this country. GROSS: So an example of two Tea Party people that are going in opposite directions now - you have Kevin McCarthy, who is the House minority leader and has very much gone for supporting Trump. And then you have Adam Kinzinger, who's now on the January 6 committee, and it's very much about investigating Trump and looking into, you know, what happened on January 6. And you describe in your book on how January 6, Kinzinger, who had been in the military, actually had a gun with him legally and, you know, had taken it out, expecting he might actually need to use it because things had gotten so violent. Am I misrepresenting that at all? PETERS: No, that's exactly what happened. Adam Kinzinger here, a military veteran, somebody who had earlier, before he became a politician, chased down a criminal in downtown Milwaukee who had slashed a woman and pinned him to the ground until police came - I mean, you're not talking about a guy who is a shrinking violet by any stretch. And he's so afraid for his family, for his staff's safety, he tells his wife, stay home on January 6, even though his wife wanted to come and watch this historic certification vote. He tells his staff not to come in. And when he senses things are getting ugly, goes back into his office across the street from the Capitol, barricades himself inside and takes out his pistol. And that is the experience that I think a lot of us would have expected to shape - since most of these Republicans experienced the same type of violence, they witnessed it firsthand the same way that Adam Kinzinger did. I think we would have expected more people to react like him, that the threat to their lives, the feeling that they were going to be overrun and possibly even killed by members of this mob, that that would have finally been the last straw that so many people were looking for in terms of when Republican support would finally break with Trump. But, in fact, the opposite happened because you take the experience of someone like Adam Kinzinger and then compare it to somebody like Kevin McCarthy. In the hours after the attacks and during the attacks, we know Kevin McCarthy was pleading with President Trump to call off the rioters. Then, when President Trump is impeached, Kevin McCarthy gives a very impassioned speech, saying that while he opposes impeachment, he still thinks Trump should be censured and that Trump ultimately bears responsibility for the attack. Well, a few weeks later, that is essentially wiped from McCarthy's memory and wiped from the collective memory of most of the Republican Party in Washington. And that's how you get to a point where the Republican National Committee passes a resolution saying that the January 6 demonstrations represented legitimate political discourse. GROSS: So, Jeremy, your book emphasizes the role of Sarah Palin in kind of setting the table for Donald Trump. What do you think she represented in Republican politics that was new? PETERS: As somebody said to me, Palin is very much the tip of the spear of the Trump movement. And that's true in many ways, starting with the fact that she was completely misunderstood and underestimated by the Republican establishment. Palin also was crucial because it wasn't just what the Republican establishment failed to see in her, it was what voters would see in her and how her experience was shaped by feeling like the people like George Bush and Mitt Romney didn't respect her. There's this formative episode that I describe here where Palin adopts this mantle of, quote, unquote, \"valley trash,\" and that's a reference to where she lived and had grown up in Alaska, this place called the Mat-Su Valley that wasn't as economically prosperous as Anchorage, and people elsewhere in Alaska kind of looked down on folks from the valley. Well, Palin takes that and adopts that nickname as a badge of honor, almost as, you know, she's proud to be valley trash. And that was very much a precursor to the type of slur like deplorable that you heard the Trump people adopt. It was as if they thrived on this notion that elites look down on them. And no one channeled that more effectively than Sarah Palin. But, of course, she didn't do this on her own. And that's what I think we misunderstand about Sarah Palin's legacy - is that while she had these grievances that she was very effective in voicing, she did so because she had a script that was written for her by the McCain campaign. She didn't write her own speeches. She didn't come up with a lot of these ideas. As I get into, one of those infamous lines that she ever uttered during that campaign, saying that President Obama - then-Senator Obama was, quote, \"palling around with terrorists,\" she didn't come up with that. That was inserted into her speech by people at McCain campaign headquarters. So... GROSS: And can I just say I was shocked to read that? PETERS: Yeah. GROSS: I was shocked to read that McCain's people wrote something as radical as that. I remember during like, one of McCain's speeches or rallies, a woman in the audience said that Obama was a Muslim. And McCain was really taken aback hearing that and, you know, very politely corrected the woman and said that Obama wasn't a Muslim. But by saying that, you know, Obama's palling around with terrorists, the subtext of that opens the door to all kinds of fears about who Obama really is. PETERS: It's very ugly. And that's the moment when McCain starts to see this all getting away from him. And they fail to take into account that that was a possibility all along, that by inflaming these passions, these prejudices, that they would have a real mess on their hands and that, in fact, Sarah Palin would become more popular than John McCain with many Republican voters. I mean, her rallies during that campaign were larger than his. He would bring her to his events so he could draw 10,000, 12,000, 15,000 people. And on an ordinary day, he would get only a fraction of that. GROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. My guest is Jeremy Peters. He's a correspondent for The New York Times and author of the new book \"Insurgency: How Republicans Lost Their Party And Got Everything They Ever Wanted.\" We'll be right back. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF JULIAN LAGE'S \"THE RAMBLE\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Jeremy Peters, a correspondent for the New York Times and author of the new book \"Insurgency: How Republicans Lost Their Party And Got Everything They Ever Wanted.\" Peters wrote the book after reporting on many of the events that led to President Trump. He's covered conservative media, the rise of the Tea Party, right-wing populism and has covered three presidential campaigns. He's also an MSNBC contributor. We've been talking about Sarah Palin. So do you see Palin as freely dispensing misinformation during the campaign, also helping open the door to Trump's massive misinformation? PETERS: Yes. What you see after Sarah Palin becomes a political figure in her own right after the election is she uses social media to propagate misinformation about President Obama in a way that no other Republican figure was doing so recklessly at the time. And the biggest example of that is her use of the phrase death panels, which she brings into the American political lexicon. That is solely on her. And... GROSS: This was her accusation about Obamacare, that it would lead to death panels, where people would decide whether your loved one was allowed to be treated or whether they would just die. PETERS: Exactly. And she claimed wrongly and stuck to her guns when she was called out on it that these panels of government bureaucrats would be deciding whether or not somebody should receive health care under Obama's law. And what was so interesting to me as I reported the book is the origins of that. It was completely spontaneous and all Sarah Palin. She wrote it up in the draft of a Facebook post, included this phrase, death panels, which she forwarded on to her speechwriter. And her speechwriter took a look at it, thought it was too incendiary and deleted it. And Sarah Palin saw the revision, went back to her speechwriter and said, no, no, no. I want this in there because she was mistakenly under the belief that her child with Down syndrome might be the kind of person who is denied care under this health care law. And in that moment, you can see taking shape this world within the Republican Party, where if a fact is salacious and demonizes your enemy, even if it's not true, it becomes too good to fact check. And it becomes part of their reality. GROSS: After McCain and Palin lost the election, Palin became a Fox contributor. And, you know, Ailes was very encouraging of that. You report on a one-on-one meeting that she had with Ailes, in which she emerged from the meeting pale and said, I'm never meeting alone with that man again. I had not seen that reported anywhere else. Did you break that story? And are you implying that Ailes behaved in a sexually inappropriate way? PETERS: So as far as I know, that has not been reported anywhere else. And the reason I found that story so interesting is because it really complicates the picture of Sarah Palin a lot of people have in their minds. My source for that couldn't be quite sure exactly what happened to her in the office, only that Ailes insisted Palin come in alone. And when she came out, whatever happened inside there clearly made her deeply uncomfortable. I think that Sarah Palin is often seen as somebody who acted, you know, through her own agency and ambition, and in doing so, lowered the bar for what was acceptable political rhetoric and said some ugly things, spread things that were not true about President Obama and really kind of acted on her own. But it's also true that she was manipulated by a lot of these Republican men, that, you know, whether it was, you know, Roger Ailes, who it appears behaved inappropriately toward her, or whether it was, you know, something less insidious, like the McCain campaign writing into her scripts language that was very provocative and borderline inappropriate and offensive. There were people calling the shots for her, people who had power over her, who were not treating her well, who were disrespectful. GROSS: She hasn't been on the national stage very much lately or in the past few years, for that matter. But she's back on it because of a lawsuit against your newspaper, The New York Times, which she's charging with defamation. Do you want to describe what the lawsuit is about? PETERS: So Palin is claiming that The New York Times defamed her because in an editorial published in 2017, there was an erroneous reference that the paper later corrected to her inciting the shooting in Tucson in 2011 that gravely wounded Gabby Giffords and killed several others. It's an unusual case, (laughter) and not only because it's unusual for me to be covering a lawsuit against my employer. But it's unusual because news organizations don't usually take cases like this - or allow cases like this to get to trial. Usually, they settle. And the reason they do that is because the discovery process can be very messy. And it shows, you know, the internal workings of how story decisions get made. And, you know, Palin's argument, which is - it's a very high legal bar to reach, ultimately, but one in which legal experts say is not out of the realm of possibility for a jury to agree with her - is that she has to prove that the Times acted with reckless disregard for the truth and malice. And that's what will be in front of the jury. GROSS: If The New York Times loses, that will be the first time in 50 years that they've lost, you know, a defamation suit. Do you - I should say here, one of the early statements and recurring statements that Trump made - and of course, as we all know, Trump was very anti-mainstream media - was that, like, we should change the libel laws because, you know, the media is getting away with murder. They're telling all these lies. And we have to prevent that from happening. So her suit is, you know, intentionally or unintentionally, carrying out some of the Trump agenda that he never succeeded in carrying out. PETERS: Oh, that's exactly right. And legal experts who've looked at this case say that ultimately that is the endgame of a lot of lawyers who would like to see the First Amendment protections afforded to the media and cases like New York Times v. Sullivan eroded. They want those scaled back. And, you know, there's no question that that's what Sarah Palin's lawyers intend to pursue here. GROSS: Well, let's take a short break. Then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Jeremy Peters, author of the new book \"Insurgency: How Republicans Lost Their Party And Got Everything They Ever Wanted.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF THE AMERICAN ANALOG SET'S \"IMMACULATE HEART 2\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Jeremy Peters, a correspondent for The New York Times and author of the new book \"Insurgency: How Republicans Lost Their Party And Got Everything They Ever Wanted.\" Let's talk some more about Roger Ailes and Fox News. Trump, in a way, first strengthened and then, in some ways, weakened Fox News because - in a way, you can argue that Ailes lost control of Trump and that Trump was so far to the right that this whole other constellation of very, very, very far-right media, you know, got built around Trump, taking viewers away from Fox News. Is that something that Ailes didn't see coming, and did he live long enough to realize what was happening? PETERS: There are signs that he did know toward the end just how destructive Trump could be to the Fox brand. And you saw that with how fiercely Trump and his allies, especially at Breitbart, came after Megyn Kelly during the debate where she, you know, famously put him on the spot about calling women fat dogs and pigs. And one of the scenes I have in the book is with Ailes complaining to one of the network personalities that he hates it when Donald Trump calls him. He says, you know, I hate it when he calls me. He talks to me like I talk to you. He cuts me off. He doesn't let me finish my sentences. I can't stand it. So there was an awareness that Ailes had about how letting Trump inside ultimately could be, you know, like unleashing a tiger. But he didn't see it soon enough, and he failed, really, to do enough about it once he did see that. And that is basically the same situation that the Republican Party found itself in once Donald Trump became president. They assumed that this was somebody who would be good for the party, and it was with voters, just like it was good for Roger Ailes with his audience. It grew the base of support for both the Republican Party and Fox News. But ultimately, what they both realized too late was that empowering somebody like that, who has no loyalty to anybody but himself and somebody for whom political survival is at the front of his mind always and - regardless of who he has to run over in the process, there's just no doing business with someone like that. GROSS: Someone who could kind of see the direction that part of the Republican base was heading in was a pollster named Tony Fabrizio. And he worked for several Republican candidates over the years. He identified what he described as Dennis Miller Republicans - this was years ago - like, people who just - like, fueled by anger, and they wanted a candidate who was fueled by anger, too. But more recently, he identified what he calls InfoWars Republicans. Describe who they are and how much of the base Fabrizio thinks they're part of. PETERS: It's a significant percentage. He found that we're talking about 10% of the Republican electorate. That's 10% of the Republican electorate that believes in several - not just one QAnon conspiracy theory, but several. And this survey was fairly exhaustive, in my understanding of it. The respondents were read from a list of various conspiracy theories that QAnon followers believe in. And in order to be catalogued in this survey as an InfoWars Republican, as Fabrizio described them, you had to believe in a number of these, not just one. And so that's what makes that 10% figure so startling. GROSS: Do you think that we now have InfoWars congressmen? PETERS: I think one of them is a leader of the party - Marjorie Taylor Greene. I think the question there is whether or not somebody like Marjorie Taylor Greene is more representative of the Republican base now than Donald Trump is. Marjorie Taylor Greene appears on Steve Bannon's podcast regularly, and she has a saying that she likes to use. I am the voter. Now, she's not every voter in the Republican Party, of course, but she represents an awful lot of voters. And these are voters who are just so angry at what they see happening around them, so angry about their loss of cultural and social and political status in the country that they believe in things that are demonstrably false because they feel good. And the theme - the whole theme of this book is the way that the Republican Party has let in these destructive elements over the years and empowered them to their detriment and whether or not Donald Trump ultimately is one of those Republicans. Even though he came in as the outsider who was smashing the status quo, it's not unthinkable to me that a figure like Marjorie Taylor Greene and the voters she represents decide that they've had enough of Trump someday. I don't know if that happens, of course, when that happens. But that's, you know, one of the many reasons why I think my book may only be at the middle point of this story rather than the end. GROSS: Yeah. Well, your book is really the story of every time the Republican Party lets in somebody from the far right, the party moves even further right than that person who they let in, and that person is often, like, old news and, you know, passe because they've been outrighted by the next group or the next person who comes along. And you're suggesting that that might be happening to Trump right now. And I've been reading about how in some ways the Republican Party is moving beyond Trump further to the right and that they don't necessarily need him anymore, that his followers have their own thing going and they don't necessarily need him to lead them. And you could also argue that even some of the people in the very far right see Trump as a liability because he's legally liable in ways now. And, you know, there's the January 6 investigations. So how far do you think it's gone so far in Trump's own followers, both in the party leadership and voters, who have moved beyond Trump? PETERS: I think the real risk there for Trump is what you just identified. It's that his voters no longer see him as good for them. He's in this for himself. And he didn't have that problem in 2015, '16, and even in 2020. His appeal to them was, I am fighting for you. I am your voice. But now Donald Trump sounds more like he's his own voice, that he is avenging what he considers to be this grave injustice of the 2020 election. And, you know, don't get me wrong. While there are an awful lot of Republicans - you know, two-thirds of the party by some measures - who believe that fraud impacted the election in a significant way and they, you know, they don't consider Biden a legitimate president, that's not necessarily something that is going to drive voters to the polls come 2024 if Trump runs. And the risk to me seems to be that he makes this so much about himself. And Trumpism has always been, you know, a cult of personality. But there's a limit to that when people start to see that he's not delivering anything for them because regardless of whatever policies he passed and how effective studies have shown they truly were, like the tax cuts in improving people's bottom lines, at least during the Trump years, people - his supporters felt like the country was a better place and it was more prosperous and that he was helping them. I don't know how long they continue to believe that if he appears to be in this only to help himself. GROSS: Jeremy Peters, thank you so much for talking with us. PETERS: Thank you, Terry.

On Wednesday, the LA County district attorney dropped charges against the CEO of Konnech, which makes scheduling software for poll workers.\n                \n                    \n                    Ringo H.W.

On Wednesday, the LA County district attorney dropped charges against the CEO of Konnech, which makes scheduling software for poll workers. In an abrupt reversal, Los Angeles County has dismissed charges against the chief executive of an election software company, marking the end of a case that prominent election deniers cited as evidence of foul play in American elections. Eugene Yu, CEO of the Michigan-based firm Konnech, was charged in mid October with illegally storing the personal information of poll workers on Chinese servers, a violation of its contract with LA County. Konnech has provided its PollChief software to cities and counties across the country, including a $2.9 million contract with Los Angeles County. On Wednesday, the district attorney's office said that it had moved to dismiss the case. A judge in Los Angeles Superior Court granted the motion without prejudice. \"We are concerned about both the pace of the investigation and the potential bias in the presentation and investigation of the evidence,\" spokesperson Tiffiny Blacknell said in a statement. The county did indicate that it hasn't ruled out refiling the charges after reviewing the evidence, saying it would \"assemble a new team, with significant cyber security experience to determine whether any criminal activity occurred.\" In a statement, Yu's defense attorney Gary Lincenberg called him an \"innocent man,\" adding. \"Mr. Yu's good name was tarnished by false narratives from fringe conspiracy theorists who bragged about enlisting Los Angeles prosecutors to further their political agenda.\" In October, the district attorney's office acknowledged to NPR that the investigation began after a tip from Gregg Phillips, a prominent election denier associated with the controversial group True the Vote, which executive produced and provided the basis for the claims in the widely debunked film 2000 Mules. Phillips has said that the group's interest in Konnech was spurred, in part, by information provided by followers of the far-right conspiracy QAnon and suggested that it was part of a \"red Chinese communist op-run against the United States.\" Konnech and Yu have consistently denied the district attorney's charges, noting True the Vote's shady affiliations and suggesting that xenophobia is a driving force behind the original probe. Yu immigrated to the U.S. from China in the 1980s and became an American citizen in 1997. In September, Konnech filed a lawsuit in federal court against True the Vote and alleged that the group had hacked Konnech's data, defaming the company with a xenophobic \"smear campaign.\" Both Phillips and Catherine Engelbrecht, True the Vote's founder, were recently briefly jailed after refusing to release the name of the suspected hacker.

True the Vote did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Yu's arrest and the controversy surrounding Konnech ahead of the November midterms alarmed the few voting offices across the country that use the company's software. Worried how the arrest could impact voter confidence in a climate where election security is already a top concern for many, at least four jurisdictions stopped using Konnech's software entirely. In a statement to NPR member station WDET, Detroit city Clerk Janice Winfrey wrote that the city was terminating its contract with Konnech \"out of an abundance of caution.\" The district attorney in Los Angeles County gave no timeline for when they might make a decision about filing new criminal charges, saying only that they had an \"immense volume of digital data\" to process, and that it could take months.",

A new lawsuit alleges that Engelbrecht and True the Vote defamed a small company that makes software for election workers.\n                \n                    \n                    Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Catherine Engelbrecht, seen here in 2015, founded the controversial nonprofit True the Vote. A new lawsuit alleges that Engelbrecht and True the Vote defamed a small company that makes software for election workers. Konnech, a small Michigan company that makes election logistics software, says a \"smear campaign\" whipped up by the controversial group True the Vote has led to death threats and forced the company's CEO to leave home in fear for his and his family's lives. The company believes a driving force behind the threats is xenophobia; Konnech's CEO immigrated to the U.S. from China in the 1980s and became an American citizen in 1997. In the past, the executive of a relatively unknown company might have chosen to ignore such claims to try to deprive them of attention. But in the wake of the conspiracy-fueled Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, and in the era of QAnon and Pizzagate \u2014 bizarre and baseless theories that have contributed to very real violence \u2014 that strategy may no longer be tenable. The experience of the election technology company Dominion Voting Systems, which became the target of widespread conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, also underscored how wild claims could significantly damage a company's business. Just a few weeks after accusations against the company first surfaced, Konnech turned to the federal courts and filed a lawsuit. Konnech was \"not going to take any chances and felt very strongly that it needed to act and act quickly,\" said Jon Goldberg, a company spokesperson. Konnech, which makes scheduling software for poll workers, joined a growing number of election officials and companies that have used defamation law to try to fight back against election-related conspiracies. Dominion Voting Systems, as well as another election technology company, Smartmatic, have filed multiple lawsuits against media outlets and prominent Trump-world figures that spread allegedly defamatory claims about them in the 2020 election. Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Wandrea Moss, the latter of whom testified in front of the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, have also filed lawsuits alleging that they were defamed by election conspiracy theories and subjected to \"vitriol, threats, and harassment.\" A Pennsylvania postal service employee also took legal action, and alleged that he was falsely accused of manipulating vote-by-mail ballots in the 2020 election. Conspiracy theories about the 2020 election have continued to spread, but there's some indication that these lawsuits have pushed such claims farther from the mainstream of conservative media and toward the fringes, with some on the self-publishing digital newsletter platform Substack. Konnech's lawsuit targets True the Vote, which has made a name for itself with dubious claims of widespread voter fraud, including the film \"2,000 Mules,\" and has been increasingly linked to QAnon. Konnech claims in its lawsuit that True the Vote and its leaders, Catherine Engelbrecht and Gregg Phillips, have falsely accused Konnech of orchestrating \"a red Chinese communist op run against the United States\" and improperly accessed Konnech's data. \"I will state clearly and unequivocally: neither Eugene Yu nor Konnech are in any way associated with the Chinese Communist Party,\" said Goldberg. In an unusual move, a federal judge agreed to issue a temporary restraining order against True the Vote, which requires the group to turn over \"all property and data obtained from Konnech's protected computers,\" and blocks True the Vote from \"using, disclosing, or exploiting the property and data downloaded from Konnech's protected computers.\" Additionally, Goldberg, the company's spokesperson, told NPR that the company \"has been and is working closely with law enforcement at multiple levels regarding True the Vote's claims.\" The company also added an \"election misinformation advisory\" to its website to try to combat \"false and malicious claims\" from True the Vote. True the Vote has denied any wrongdoing. \"Everything we have ever said about any of this is true,\" said Engelbrecht in a livestream the day the lawsuit was filed. \"The allegations made by Konnech are meritless. True the Vote looks forward to a public conversation about Konnech's attempts to silence examination of its activities through litigation.\" A representative of True the Vote also provided NPR with a letter sent to Konnech's attorney, which claims that Konnech has made unspecified \"inaccuracies and misrepresentations\" to the court, and asserts that an unnamed \"third party\" first obtained Konnech's data \u2014 not True the Vote. Engelbrecht and Phillips previously executive produced and provided the research for the widely debunked election conspiracy theory film, \"2,000 Mules.\" And there's some indication that the threat of defamation lawsuits may have slowed the spread of claims from the film. The right-wing provocateur Dinesh D'Souza, who directed \"2,000 Mules,\" said that he decided not to include \"ballot trafficking\" allegations against specific, named organizations in the film due to legal concerns. Fox News has largely avoided covering the \"2,000 Mules,\" which D'Souza suggested is related to Fox's fear of litigation. Last month, the publisher of an upcoming book version of \"2,000 Mules\" also abruptly recalled copies from bookstores. NPR obtained the recalled version of the book, which, unlike the film, makes allegations against specific nonprofit groups, and accuses them of \"organized crime.\" After one of those groups said the book's contents were completely false and potentially \"libelous,\" True the Vote distanced itself from the book. Meanwhile, the group has pivoted away from the \"2,000 Mules\" and toward Konnech. At an event in August dubbed \"The Pit,\" Engelbrecht and Phillips unveiled what they called the \"Tiger Project,\" which focused on Konnech. In interviews with far-right podcasters, Phillips has spun a cloak-and-dagger story that he compared to a James Bond movie, in which he helped uncover a supposed Chinese plot to infiltrate American elections. In Phillips' telling, he first heard about the company from \"my guys\" \u2014 unnamed \"colleagues and friends\" who invited him to their room in the Hilton Anatole hotel in Dallas one late night in January 2021. \"I get there and they're putting towels, rolled up towels, under the doors and you know, and all my guys are armed,\" Phillips said on the podcast \"1819 News.\" Phillips said his colleagues showed him personal information for 1.8 million American poll workers, including \"name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, banking information,\" which supposedly was held on a server in China. Konnech maintains that this claim is entirely false, and that all of its data on American customers is stored solely in the U.S. After seeing this presentation, Phillips claims that he and Engelbrecht brought Konnech's data to the FBI, which he claims then worked with them for more than a year on a supposed \"counterintelligence\" operation looking into Konnech. At one point, Phillips said he had a \"secret squirrels\" meeting with the FBI in Milwaukee to share information. Eventually, however, the FBI \"completely betrayed us,\" Phillips said, and told True the Vote that they were themselves under scrutiny from law enforcement. True the Vote has not publicly provided evidence to support the claim of a \"counterintelligence\" operation along those lines, nor has NPR found any corroboration. The FBI did not respond to a request for comment. Konnech argues that this wild story is a work of fiction. \"Konnech is extremely confident in the multiple levels of security it employs to protect its customers' data,\" said Goldberg, who noted that Konnech does not even possess information on 1.8 million poll workers. The real number is under 250,000, the company says. But rather than ignore True the Vote's claims that they saw Konnech's secure data, Goldberg said, Konnech essentially decided to take True the Vote's claims at face value. In their lawsuit, Konnech alleges that True the Vote admitted to violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act by accessing the company's data. At least so far, the claims against Konnech have not received widespread attention in more established conservative media. This case still demonstrates how allegations can spread through fringe online networks. Phillips has specifically encouraged followers of the far-right QAnon conspiracy theory \u2014 so-called \"anons\" \u2014 to research and post about Konnech. \"These people are the most amazing patriots that I've ever come in contact with,\" Phillips said of QAnon followers. Phillips also appeared on an online show hosted by QAnon influencers, where he reiterated his praise of the \"anons.\" The left-leaning media watchdog group Media Matters documented additional ties between True the Vote and QAnon. In a sign of how QAnon has moved closer to the mainstream of the Republican Party, former President Donald Trump has repeatedly posted messages from the group's followers online, and featured a QAnon-linked song at a rally over the weekend. A digital newsletter hosted by the online platform Substack has amplified the idea that Konnech represents \"Chinese infiltration\" of U.S. election systems. A spokesperson for Substack declined NPR's request for comment. Former Trump adviser turned podcaster Steve Bannon further promoted that Substack newsletter about Konnech in a post on the social media network Gettr. A spokesperson for Bannon also declined to comment. The misinformation about Konnech has helped feed online harassment and threats against Konnech's CEO and his family, Goldberg said. \"Might want to book flights back to Wuhan before we hang you until dead!\" reads one email to the CEO cited in the company's lawsuit. Another aspect of Konnech's decision to go to court, Goldberg said, involved the importance of maintaining faith in U.S. elections. \"They are facing a group that, through its own actions and by spreading falsehoods and misinformation, [is] essentially targeting the election process,\" said Goldberg. That sentiment appeared to be echoed in the restraining order handed down in Konnech's defamation case. Federal Judge Kenneth Hoyt wrote in his order that the evidence presented by Konnech showed that a restraining order \"would in fact benefit the public's expectation of integrity in the U.S. election process.\"",

The group has hosted \"Election Integrity\" summits in key states around the country, which have featured speakers from the Republican National Committee.\n                \n                    \n                    Matt Rourke/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Attorney Cleta Mitchell is a senior legal fellow with the nonprofit Conservative Partnership Institute in Washington, D.C. The group has hosted \"Election Integrity\" summits in key states around the country, which have featured speakers from the Republican National Committee. A prominent conservative attorney, who worked with former President Donald Trump on efforts to overturn the 2020 election, has been leading \"Election Integrity\" summits in swing states across the country, raising concerns about how false claims about a \"stolen\" election may affect future contests. Leaked audio from those summits, which has been shared with NPR and other news outlets, provides an inside view of those efforts, which have been backed by key figures from Trump's orbit and funding from Trump's political operation. Officials from the Republican National Committee have also attended these events. The attorney and guiding force behind these summits is named Cleta Mitchell. She has come under intense scrutiny ever since she took part in a Jan. 2, 2021 call to Georgia election officials, in which Trump pressured those officials to reverse the outcome. \"I only need 11,000 votes \u2014 fellas, I need 11,000 votes,\" Trump said on the call. \"Give me a break. You know we have that in spades already.\" During the call, Mitchell floated multiple allegations of voter fraud, which Georgia's secretary of state \u2014 himself a conservative Republican \u2014 said his office had investigated and debunked. Soon after audio of the call was released, Mitchell resigned under pressure from her position as partner with the law firm Foley & Lardner, which expressed concern with her participation on the call. The congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol has subpoenaed Mitchell. In addition to her participation on the call with Georgia election officials, the committee also released an email indicating that two days after the 2020 election, Mitchell suggested that state legislators could choose which electors to send to the Electoral College. That strategy could have allowed pro-Trump electors to essentially disregard their states' election results. The district attorney of Fulton County, Ga., also secured a subpoena for Mitchell to testify as part of a separate criminal investigation into Trump's election efforts. As those investigations have pressed forward, Mitchell has been working for a conservative nonprofit group based in Washington, D.C., called the Conservative Partnership Institute (CPI), where \"now I get to work on election integrity every single day,\" she recently said. Former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows is a senior partner at CPI, and Trump's Save America political action committee gave $1 million to CPI last summer. Under the umbrella of CPI, Mitchell runs the \"Election Integrity Network.\" The election was rigged. Trump won. https://t.co/UIhYDhA5gx With the support of those connections and funding, CPI has hosted \"Election Integrity Summits\" in several states this year, including Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Arizona and Pennsylvania. \"We're taking back our election systems,\" Mitchell told former Trump adviser Steve Bannon earlier this year, with the help of \"an election integrity movement that is populated and driven by people who supported President Trump and who saw their votes literally cast aside.\" Documented, a Washington, D.C.-based watchdog group that reports on the influence of corporations and wealthy people in politics, obtained leaked recordings from multiple events. They shared hours of tape from a March 31, 2022 summit just outside of Harrisburg, Pa., with NPR and other news outlets. On its face, neither the mobilization of poll watchers nor increased scrutiny of election officials is necessarily concerning or even unusual. Brendan Fischer, the deputy executive director of Documented, says the difference with these events is their reliance on false and debunked information about the 2020 election. \"The concern is that the conspiracy theorists who see fraud around every corner are going to disrupt voting and the administration of elections,\" said Fischer. Election officials have described receiving a barrage of threats since the 2020 election. On Monday, the Department of Justice announced that election officials and workers had reported receiving about a thousand \"hostile or harassing\" contacts. More than 100 of those contacts, the department said, \"met the threshold for a federal criminal investigation.\" Mitchell, for her part, has stressed the importance of volunteers remaining polite. \"Never lose your temper or raise your voice,\" the group's \"Citizen's Guide\" states. CPI did not respond to multiple requests for comment about their events. Here are four takeaways from the recordings: Though Mitchell has attracted intense scrutiny for her fraud claims about the 2020 election, an RNC official praised Mitchell and expressed a degree of deference to her work. Joshua Findlay, the RNC's national director for election integrity, opened his remarks by thanking Mitchell. \"I am very grateful, first of all, that you're putting these on,\" said Findlay. \"And, second of all, that we're invited. I flew overnight from meetings we had in Nevada to be here just for this.\" Findlay went on to suggest that the RNC would take its cues from Mitchell. \"Cleta Mitchell, she's like the best election and election law expert out here. We're not going to tell her what to do,\" Findlay said. \"But hopefully we can provide some infrastructure and some muscle and that's what we want to do.\" Andrea Raffle, the RNC's director of election integrity for the state of Pennsylvania, also spoke at the event, and discussed ways for people to get involved in election offices. One goal of that effort, Findlay and Raffle explained, was to connect both volunteer and paid election workers with the Republican party's \"war room,\" which could help address problems at the polls and inform the party's potential legal challenges. \"The RNC works with other groups who have an interest in promoting election integrity but the party's efforts are independent from any outside organization,\" said Emma Vaughn, a spokesperson for the RNC. \"As such, the RNC is not a part of any formal coalition with outside groups.\" Vaughn said that in places where the RNC had already engaged in \"election integrity\" efforts, \"elections have run smoothly, and turnout has increased.\" Michael Roman, who served as director of election day operations for the Trump 2020 campaign, also took part in the summit. About a month prior, Roman was subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 committee in Congress. \"The Select Committee is in possession of communications reflecting your involvement in a coordinated strategy to contact Republican members of state legislatures in certain states that former President Trump had lost and urge them to 'reclaim' their authority by sending an alternate slate of electors that would support former President Trump,\" said committee chair Bennie Thompson in a letter to Roman regarding the subpoena. \"It appears that you helped direct the Trump campaign staffers participating in this effort.\" Roman did not respond to NPR's request for comment. According to the Washington Post, a grand jury in Washington has also subpoenaed records of communications between Arizona officials and Findlay, as well as several other Trump campaign staffers, as part of a Department of Justice investigation. There is no indication Findlay himself is under investigation. Throughout the event, several presenters suggested that it was especially important to closely monitor areas with large numbers of Democrats. Doug McLinko, a county commissioner for Bradford County, Pa., said efforts to \"clean up\" voter rolls should be focused on Philadelphia and the surrounding areas, \"Because that's the counties that are a problem. Yeah, we can go to the rural counties and we can clean up voter rolls. We need to do that. But let's be honest where it's at \u2014 let's be honest where the steal was at.\" At another point, a member of the audience from Philadelphia, who did not identify himself by name, said, \"in certain sections of the city which are very dangerous because Black Lives Matter is there \u2014 do we have and will we find people of color who are conservative number one and willing to work?\" Organizers for the event did not directly address the question, but said they were working on finding more volunteers for election monitoring positions in Philadelphia. The comments about more racially diverse and predominantly Democratic areas were not limited to Pennsylvania. The RNC's Findlay described Harris County, Texas, which includes the city of Houston, in similar terms. \"That's like the Philadelphia of Texas,\" said Findlay. \"It's the county where we know all the problems are.\" \"Our job is not to win,\" said Christine Brim, a conservative activist from left-leaning Fairfax County, Va. \"Our job is to lose less badly. And when you face that reality, when you're the blue county that can ruin a statewide vote, that really focuses what you're doing.\" Toni Shuppe, the founder and CEO of Audit The Vote PA, was introduced at the summit as a leader of the state's \"election integrity\" coalition. She told NPR she is now working with a large number of groups in the state on those efforts. As Shuppe recounted in a video posted to Facebook, she was in Washington, D.C., and outside the Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021 attack. She said she did not witness any of the violence that day, and things were peaceful where she was. Shuppe has written that her path to political activism began, in part, by watching a 10-part three-hour online video called \"The Fall Of The Cabal.\" The video promotes a wide variety of conspiracy theories, including some related to the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, to theories known as Pizzagate and QAnon. The Anti-Defamation League has described QAnon as \"a wide-reaching conspiracy theory popular among a range of right-wing extremists,\" with \"marked undertones of antisemitism and xenophobia.\" \"I don't know if any of the information in the video is true,\" Shuppe told NPR in an email. \"But what if it is? The video opened my eyes to be more analytical and to question all narratives. I feel the same way about 9/11. Question all narratives.\" In one startling scene from the video, the narrator claims that \"worldwide, children are stolen and sold to elite pedophile rings,\" which then \"drink the childrens' blood and they eat their flesh.\" NPR asked Shuppe if she believed that specific claim. \"I have no idea,\" Shuppe responded. \"Wish I knew. Great question though. Why don't you do some digging to figure that out and report back?\" Another participant at the event has used incendiary rhetoric in the past. Ned Jones, the deputy director of the Election Integrity Network at CPI, gave a presentation on ways to hold local election officials accountable, including by filing public records requests. During the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, Jones responded to a tweet about the breach of the Capitol building, \"They don't say a word when BLM/Antifa burn cities. It's our turn! About time!\" He has also frequently tweeted about the possibility of a second \"civil war.\" Responding to a tweet about street violence during post-election protests in Washington state in December 2020, Jones wrote, \"The Civil War has started in Olympia, WA! Let's roll Patriots!\" Jones did not respond to NPR's request for comment.",

Prosecutors have identified the man at the center of this photograph as a QAnon-supporter named Douglas Jensen. Jensen has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Tuesday's hearing of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol will focus on the role of the pro-Trump conspiracy theory known as QAnon, as well as the role of extremist groups like the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, aides to the committee said. A key area of inquiry for congressional investigators has been possible ties between former President Trump and his allies and far-right extremists. And aides said the committee would present new evidence about how Trump's tweet calling for a \"big protest\" on Jan. 6th served as a kind of call to arms. \"Be there, will be wild!\" Trump tweeted. A former spokesperson for the Oath Keepers is slated to testify publicly as part of Tuesday's hearing. The spokesperson, Jason Van Tatenhove, told Colorado TV station KDVR he had served as the Oath Keepers' \"propagandist\" starting in 2014, but separated from the group several years before the attack on the Capitol. Extremist groups have been at the forefront of the federal criminal investigation into the Capitol breach. Justice Department prosecutors have brought criminal charges against more than 130 people with apparent ties to extremist groups, including more than three dozen who appear to have expressed support for QAnon, according to NPR's database of charges. Leaders of both the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers have been charged with seditious conspiracy, the most serious criminal charge stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021 attack. Three defendants have pleaded guilty to that charge, while other defendants are fighting the allegations. Aides to the Jan. 6 select committee cited longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn as possible conduits between extremist groups and people in Trump's orbit. In 2020, both Stone and Flynn received presidential pardons from Trump. The two men had separately been convicted on charges connected to former Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Stone and Flynn have denied all wrongdoing related to the attack on the Capitol. In interviews with the committee, both asserted their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Already-public information suggests ties between Stone, Flynn and extremists. Stone, for example, has worked closely with Proud Boy leader Enrique Tarrio, and the two have appeared at events together. Tarrio was not in Washington, D.C. during the Capitol riot, but prosecutors have alleged that he conspired with members of the group to plan the attack. Tarrio has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Members of the Oath Keepers also acted as part of a security detail for Stone on the morning of Jan. 6, prior to the riot. A week later, Stone said in an Instagram video that he was initially supposed to lead a march from the Ellipse to the Capitol that day, where he would give a speech, but he ultimately \"decided that I was not interested in doing any of those things.\" He said he only supported peaceful protest that day, and \"left town while demonstrators were still, to my astonishment, inside the Capitol.\" Flynn has also received security help from the Oath Keepers, including at a pro-Trump event in Dec. 2020, according to the group's leader, Stewart Rhodes. At that event, Rhodes said Trump should \"drop the hammer\" and invoke the Insurrection Act, \"because if he does not do it, we'll have to fight a bloody civil war or a bloody revolution to take our country back against a corrupt, illegitimate regime.\" Rhodes has also pleaded not guilty to charges of seditious conspiracy. Thus far, the committee has not delved deeply into QAnon, which the Anti-Defamation League describes as a \"remarkably elaborate conspiracy theory that has taken root within some parts of the pro-Trump movement,\" with \"marked undertones of antisemitism and xenophobia.\" During the 2020 presidential campaign, Trump declined to disavow QAnon or its supporters. \"I don't know much about the movement, other than I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate,\" Trump said at an Aug. 2020 press conference. \"I've heard these are people that love our country,\" Trump added. Flynn also suggested support for QAnon. On July 4, 2020, he posted a video on Twitter, in which he and members of his family used the phrase \"where we go one, we go all,\" a slogan closely associated with QAnon. (The slogan originally derives from the mid-1990s movie \"White Squall.\") Flynn's family has said the video was unrelated to QAnon, and was rather \"a simple, family, July 4 statement of support for each other.\" At a hearing last month, the select committee presented evidence suggesting that Stone and Flynn remained close to Trump's campaign to overturn the 2020 election results right up until the day of the riot. \"The night before January 6, President Trump instructed his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, to contact both Roger Stone and Michael Flynn regarding what would play out the next day,\" Rep. Liz Chenery (R-Wy.) said. Former Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson testified that Meadows made phone calls to both men, but she did not know what they discussed. Hutchinson also testified that in the run-up to the riot, she heard conversations involving Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani. \"I recall hearing the word Oath Keeper and hearing the word Proud Boys closer to the planning of the January 6 rally when Mr. Giuliani would be around,\" Hutchinson testified. The committee did not provide additional details about those discussions. Giuliani, through an attorney has denied links to either the Oath Keepers or the Proud Boys. Jon Lewis, a research fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, said congressional investigators have the difficult task of explaining the \"confusing web\" of linking Trump's allies and extremist groups. \"It's a small enough group of actors that everyone's only at any point going to be maybe two degrees of separation from Mark Meadows, to Giuliani to Enrique Tarrio, or someone like that,\" Lewis said. Looking ahead to Tuesday's hearing, Lewis said he hopes the committee might provide more specific answers about \"Who to talked to whom when, who witnessed that conversation, who can speak to what was actually communicated, and ultimately, what does that mean and why does that matter?\"",

In the fight to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, one of the longstanding challenges has been figuring out who is exactly producing them and how much. Now, a new global tracker is helping to make clear exactly where major greenhouse gas emissions are originating. Created by the nonprofit Climate Trace, the interactive map uses a combination of satellites, sensors and machine learning to measure the top polluters worldwide. It observes how much greenhouse gases \u2014 carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide \u2014 are being emitted at specific locations, such as power plants and oil refineries. Former Vice President Al Gore, who is a founding member of the initiative, said it is meant to serve as a more reliable and accurate alternative to companies self-reporting their emissions estimates. \"Cheating is impossible with this artificial intelligence method, because they would have to somehow falsify multiple sets of data,\" he told NPR's Michel Martin on All Things Considered. Gore recently returned from Egypt where world leaders have been convening to discuss the climate crisis at the annual U.N. climate conference, also known as COP27. He believes the tracker will help countries stick to their pledges to reach net-zero greenhouse emissions by 2050. The emissions tool employs over 300 satellites; sensors on land, planes and ships; as well as artificial intelligence to build models of emission estimates. Right now, it tracks about 72,000 of the highest emitting greenhouse gas sources. That includes every power plant, large ship and large plane in the entire world, Gore said. And that's just the beginning. By next year, Gore hopes to be tracking millions of major emitting sites. \"We will have essentially all of them,\" he said. Gore said 75% of the world's greenhouse emissions come from countries that have made pledges to become carbon-neutral by 2050. \"Now that they know exactly where it's coming from, they have tools that will enable them to reduce their emissions,\" he told NPR. He added that the database, which is free and accessible online, can help inform countries about how much pollution is being emitted by the companies they are working with or considering working with. It is not enough for companies to self-report, he said. For instance, Climate Trace found that the oil and gas industry has been significantly underreporting its emissions. \"We found their emissions are three times higher than they have been telling the United Nations,\" Gore said. In the U.S. specifically, oil and gas producers have underreported how much methane they've been releasing, recent research suggests. That doesn't mean companies were intentionally cheating, Gore added. However, he said underreporting prevents governments and the public from staying on track with their net-zero pledge. Six regional governments in Mexico, Europe and Africa have already entered into working agreements for using the tool, Gore said. The world is generally off track from its goal of cutting emissions that drive climate change, but Gore said he's been impressed by recent efforts around the globe to address the issue. In the U.S., Gore pointed to the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes over $360 billion to tackle climate change and incentivizes consumers to make greener choices. Gore described the law as \"the biggest climate legislation in the history of the world.\" He also praised Australia for voting in a new government that pledged to shift away from coal and Brazil for electing a new president who vowed to stop destroying the Amazon. \"So there's great danger, but there is hope,\" Gore said. \"If we can summon the will to act.\" Ana Perez and Adam Raney produced and edited the audio interview.",

The Los Angeles County district attorney alleges that the CEO of Konnech, which makes scheduling software for poll workers, improperly gave Chinese contractors access to sensitive employee data.\n                \n                    \n                    Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A poll worker sanitizes ballot marking machines at an early voting location in Inglewood, Calif., on Oct. 29, 2020. The Los Angeles County district attorney alleges that the CEO of Konnech, which makes scheduling software for poll workers, improperly gave Chinese contractors access to sensitive employee data. Prosecutors in Los Angeles say Konnech, a small company that makes software for scheduling election workers, has illegally given its contractors in China access to sensitive data as part of a \"massive data breach.\" A defense attorney said the prosecution was relying on dubious information from \"one of the more discredited election deniers.\" Now, amid the allegations, a number of localities across the U.S. are weighing whether to ditch Konnech's software with just weeks until Election Day. Konnech has provided its PollChief software to some cities and counties across the country, including Los Angeles County. The LA County district attorney alleges that by giving contractors in China access to sensitive data on elections workers, Konnech has violated its contract \u2014 and criminal law. Konnech CEO Eugene Yu has been charged with conspiracy to embezzle public funds and grand theft by embezzlement of public funds. The DA's criminal complaint does not address a motivation for the alleged criminal conspiracy, and does not allege that Yu stole money, but rather that he misappropriated government funds. On Friday, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge ordered Yu to remain in home confinement in LA and post a bond of $500,000. Though Yu's passport was already in the custody of the LA County district attorney, prosecutor Eric Neff argued Yu should be held in custody pending trial, because he allegedly posed an \"extensive flight risk\" due to his \"deep ties to China.\" Yu's defense attorney disagreed, arguing that a combination of GPS monitoring and the payment of bond was sufficient. The defense ultimately secured Yu's release. He is set to reappear in court in November, where he will enter a plea in the case. The criminal complaint says that the third-party contractors in China who were sent the workers' data also \"assisted with creating and fixing\" Konnech's software. A project manager for Konnech's $2.9 million contract with LA County said that this presented a \"huge security issue,\" according to the complaint. But a spokesperson for the county clerk said the county is still planning to use Konnech's software in this fall's elections. Prosecutor Neff said in court on Friday that \"this is arguably the largest data breach in United States history,\" though he did not provide additional information about that claim. Defense attorney Janet Levine cast doubt on the prosecutor's claim, and countered that such breaches are an unfortunate reality, noting that \"the amount of data breaches in the country are astounding.\" In 2017, a breach of data from the credit reporting company Equifax exposed sensitive information on 147 million people \u2014 a far larger figure than what has been alleged in the case against Konnech. NPR asked the district attorney's office about the claim. In response, a spokesperson said the DA's office is \"still exploring the scope of the breach,\" and, \"at this point, all we can say definitively is that there is significant evidence that there has been a data breach of LA election workers.\" In any case, District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n previously emphasized in a statement that \"this investigation is concerned solely with the personal identifying information of election workers. In this case, the alleged conduct had no impact on the tabulation of votes and did not alter election results.\" Last week, Yu was arrested in his home state of Michigan, and prosecutors sought to extradite him to California to face the charges. The district attorney's office also told NPR that it launched its investigation due to a tip from Gregg Phillips, a prominent election denier associated with the controversial group True the Vote. Phillips and True the Vote also executive produced and provided the basis for the widely debunked election denial film 2000 Mules. Phillips has said that True the Vote's examination of Konnech benefited from information provided by followers of the far-right conspiracy theory QAnon. The district attorney's office had previously claimed that True the Vote played no role in its investigation, but now acknowledges that Phillips' report  \"did in fact result in us initiating our investigation,\" according to a spokesperson. Yu's defense attorneys have already raised concerns about a criminal prosecution relying on any information from Phillips. Konnech's representatives have also questioned why an alleged contract violation is being charged as a crime, when such disputes are typically handled in civil court. \"It looks and strikes me as a contracts case,\" said Levine, Yu's defense attorney. Yu's arrest and the questions swirling around it sent a jolt of chaos through voting offices across the country that are in the midst of conducting a midterm election. A spokesperson for the LA district attorney's office said it had received inquiries from 20 other jurisdictions that use Konnech's software regarding the charges. NPR has confirmed at least four election jurisdictions have stopped using Konnech's software, including the city of Detroit, which has more than 500,000 registered voters. The city clerk in Detroit, Janice Winfrey, declined an interview request from NPR, but told member station WDET in a statement that the city was terminating its contract with Konnech \"out of an abundance of caution.\" \"Our data, which is now back under our exclusive control, was housed on servers located in Lansing, Michigan. Konnech, per its contract, only provided logistical and call center support,\" said Winfrey. \"My staff and I are confident that the 2022 election process will run smoothly delivering, after all votes have been counted, an unimpeachable work product.\" In Virginia's Loudoun County, northwest of Washington, D.C., election officials there scrambled to make a decision on whether or not to drop Konnech's services for this election, even though they didn't feel like they had all the information about the accusations. \"I have no idea [what's going on],\" said Richard Keech, Loudoun's deputy elections director. \"The district attorney [in LA County] doesn't seem to be talking. It is a very confusing situation. And we've gone round and round and round in circles about this because nobody has the full story.\" The office has had a harder time recruiting poll workers in recent years due to increased scrutiny on elections, said Keech, so they did eventually decide to stop using Konnech software as a preventative measure. \"At this particular moment, with an election breathing down our neck, the last thing we need is for our election officers to feel like we're not doing everything we can to protect them,\" Keech said. The county got its poll worker data back from Konnech, and has cobbled together a plan to manage and communicate with those workers this fall by using a few different systems. \"Election administrators are hardy, resilient folks,\" said Keech, noting that in 2020 Virginia lawmakers changed rules to expand ballot access just weeks before the election. \"It's terrible to say it, but we're kind of accustomed to implementing systems with short or no notice.\" At least two other Virginia counties, Fairfax and Prince William, have also said they have stopped using Konnech. While four jurisdictions is a small fraction of the thousands of voting jurisdictions that make up the fabric of America's elections, it may represent a sizable chunk of Konnech's business in the U.S. The company has just roughly two dozen employees, and the about page on its website says it had 32 North American clients before the controversy. Another client, the city of Minneapolis, said in a statement last week that it did not think any of its poll worker data was impacted, and indicated that it still planned to use Konnech software this year barring more information being uncovered. Other election offices, like those in Hillsborough County, Fla. and Parker County, Texas, have tried to distance themselves from the controversy by clarifying publicly that they do not use Konnech's software. Both Konnech and True the Vote have traded allegations back and forth for months. In August 2022, Phillips and True the Vote accused Konnech of being part of a \"red Chinese communist op run against the United States.\" The following month, Konnech filed a lawsuit in federal court against True the Vote and alleged that the group illegally accessed Konnech's data and defamed Konnech with a xenophobic \"smear campaign.\" Yu was born in China but immigrated to the U.S. in the 1980s and became a U.S. citizen in 1997, the company said. A spokesperson for Konnech gave interviews to several media outlets, including NPR, describing True the Vote's accusations as conspiracy theories and said that Yu was facing death threats as a result. The company acknowledged having done business in China as recently as 2021, and said it had employees there working on software testing and development. The company insisted, however, \"Konnech has never stored customer data on servers in China.\" A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order against True the Vote, requiring the group to cease using any data obtained from Konnech and to disclose information about who may have helped True the Vote access data from Konnech. Even after Yu's arrest, the judge, Kenneth Hoyt, expressed skepticism and exasperation toward True the Vote's attorneys, according to a transcript of a court hearing obtained by NPR. He also described the defamation case as separate and distinct from the criminal case in Los Angeles. Judge Hoyt, who was nominated to the bench by President Ronald Reagan, told True the Vote's attorneys, \"I'm thinking you may be played\" by the group. \"I'm confident that I have not been played,\" replied True the Vote's attorney, Brock Akers, who added that he thought the group's \"election integrity\" work was \"worthy.\" \"I don't really have any confidence in any of these folk who claim they are doing that,\" said Judge Hoyt. True the Vote's attorneys told the court that the initial source of their information about Konnech was a man named Mike Hasson. Konnech has since sought to add Hasson as a defendant in their lawsuit. NPR was unable to reach Hasson by phone or email. Despite the federal judge's skepticism, authorities in Los Angeles appear to have taken True the Vote's information seriously, though the complaint does not reference the kind of wide-ranging conspiracy by the Chinese government that Phillips has claimed. A spokesperson for the LA County district attorney said in a statement, \"Our Public Integrity Division (PID) routinely accepts complaints from the public. Oftentimes, these complaints are made by political opponents of the accused. With that in mind, if a crime is alleged we have a responsibility to conduct an independent investigation. Greg[g] Phillips' report to PID was the first step in a thorough independent and still ongoing investigation which ultimately led to the arrest and charging of Mr. Yu.\" A representative of True the Vote declined to comment.",

Liz Cheney in the state's Republican primary.\n                \n                    \n                    Chet Strange/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former President Donald Trump campaigns May 28 in Casper, Wyo., for Harriet Hageman, who is challenging Rep. Liz Cheney in the state's Republican primary. This Tuesday brings another round of important primaries for Congress and statewide office and the likelihood that big-name candidates will go down to defeat. But the news next week will not focus on those household-familiar names or what their losses mean for their states. It will focus on what those outcomes may mean for Donald Trump. That is all the more remarkable considering that these could be the last bids for seats in Congress for two of the best-known women in American politics \u2014 Republican icons Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Sarah Palin of Alaska. Cheney is vice chair of the committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and has often been the sharp point of the spear for that probe. Until she voted to impeach Trump in January 2021, she was on track to someday be the first Republican woman to be speaker of the House. She may also be a candidate for president in 2024. Cheney is, of course, also the daughter of former Vice President Richard B. Cheney, who served two terms in the White House (2001-2009) and was often described as the most powerful No. 2 executive in U.S. history. The former vice president has released an ad and a video in which he appears in a cowboy hat and growls out his support for his daughter and dismisses Trump's claims about the 2020 election. The tag line is: \"Only a coward would lie to his own supporters.\" Palin was the first woman since Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 to be on the national ticket of either of the two major parties, chosen for the vice-presidential slot by GOP nominee John McCain in 2008. She delivered one of the most memorable speeches in recent history at the party's St. Paul convention that summer and headlined packed rallies that autumn that in many ways anticipated Trump's own. Before that she was the governor of Alaska and since then she has been a TV reality star, though far less successful in that career than Trump. She has also been a Fox News contributor prior to her current campaign and a contestant on \"The Masked Singer.\" She is running now for the seat held for 49 years by the late Rep. Don Young, the longest serving Republican member of Congress in history. If she wins the special election Tuesday, she will complete his term, and a primary vote on the same ballot would nominate her for a full term starting in 2023. Just over a year ago, the prospect of Cheney and Palin both serving in the same chamber of Congress at once would have been enough to draw media attention of all kinds at all levels of sophistication. With first names that easily fit in headlines and last names sure to be click-bait, the two could have driven traffic for years. That would have been especially true had one or the other or both run for president in 2024 or thereafter. And even if neither did, either would be an automatic mention for vice president in 2024 or thereafter. It is still possible, but developments in both their states and nationally have made it increasingly unlikely that either will be on the House floor next year. In another time \u2014 say one cycle ago \u2014 Cheney would be breezing to another GOP nod for the seat she first won in 2016 and has held since. In November she would expect to win with more than two-thirds of the vote, as she has three times. But this time, she is expected to lose badly to state legislator Harriet Hageman, who has been leading in the polls \u2013 including a University of Wyoming poll published Aug. 12 showing Hageman ahead 30 points. Trump endorsed Hageman the day she announced way back in September 2021, a swift move that helped to freeze out other Republican rivals who might have divided the anti-Cheney vote. \"We love President Trump here,\" Hageman says, thanking him for also coming to the state for her. Trump has made good on his vow to oppose the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him in January 2021 (two have survived their primaries, three have lost and four others did not seek re-election). Hageman was a strong supporter of the presidential aspirations of Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas in 2016, at the time dismissing Trump as \"racist and xenophobic.\" She now says she was the victim of lies about Trump told by Democrats and Liz Cheney at that time, but now regards him \"as the greatest president of my lifetime.\" In interviews, Cheney has strongly suggested she has already accepted the verdict of the Wyoming voters but is not ready to end her career. After completing her current term, observers have suggested, she could be the anti-Trump campaigner in a 2024 field of pro-Trump Republicans \u2013 quite possibly including Trump himself. While no data exist to suggest Cheney could still win on Tuesday, her candidacy has prompted an unprecedented outpouring of support from outside the state and from longtime adversaries as well. Led by former Gov. Mike Sullivan, many Wyoming Democrats are expected to switch their party registration (as state law permits on primary day) so as to vote for Cheney. But it's highly unlikely there would be enough of these to make the difference. There may have been some erosion of Trump support in Wyoming, where he got 70% of the vote twice. But that slippage probably ended when the FBI searched his home at Mar-a-Lago on Aug. 8. Republicans in Wyoming, as elsewhere, closed ranks behind the former president this past week and denounced the search as politically motivated. After that FBI search, the blood is up in Trump states. But even this latest rallying around Trump might not be enough to save Palin. She has his endorsement, and he dialed in for one of her rallies as recently as the day his home was searched. What's stopping Palin is not her relationship with the former president, it's a voting system. Alaska has an open primary that lists all candidates together regardless of party. In the first round of the vote there this spring, there were 48 candidates on the ballot. Palin, no surprise, came in first with 27% of the total. She has often complained that she \"got the most votes\" and should not be subjected to a second round of voter assessment. But under Alaska's system, Palin must face a second round of voting that includes the top four finishers from the first round. One of the top four in the June vote has dropped out, but Palin is still battling two second-round rivals on Tuesday, including another Republican. He is Nick Begich III, the grandson of the last person to hold this seat before Young. His grandfather was a Democrat who was lost in a plane crash in the Alaska wilderness in 1972; his uncle Mark, also a Democrat, was a one-term U.S. senator. The third candidate this Tuesday is Mary Peltola, a former state legislator who is a daughter of a Yup'ik Eskimo. A Democrat who has emerged as a factor in her own right, she could even win a plurality of first-place votes on Tuesday. But that would not be the end of the story, because a first-place plurality is not enough. Alaska has just installed a new ranked-choice system, like the one used in Maine and New York City and elsewhere. It allows each voter to vote for more than one candidate, ranking them by order of preference. If no one gets over 50% on first count, the two with the most first-place votes proceed to an \"instant runoff\" \u2014 a tally of their respective second-place votes. If a candidate has enough of an advantage in the second tally it can overcome a deficit in the first. Because third-place votes at this point may be the kiss of death, the contest becomes less a popularity contest than an unpopularity contest. The candidate liked best by some but liked least by too many others is not going to win. One of the arguments for the ranked-choice system has been that it encourages candidates to be more congenial and supposedly discourages negative campaigning. But Begich's ads have been tough on Palin. One says \"she left Alaska to be a celebrity.\" A voice in another says \"vote smart, not Sarah.\" It was widely noted that she missed a candidate debate this summer for a fundraiser in Minnesota. And while she was a charismatic force in the 2008 presidential campaign, she has not faced any voters since quitting midway through her one term as governor in 2009. Some Republicans have still not forgotten how she won that term, challenging an incumbent Republican. A recent poll by Alaska Survey Research showed her to be viewed unfavorably by 60% of Alaskans, far more than either Begich or Peltola. Surveys have shown voters in other places have found the system reasonably easy to use and like the chance to make more than one choice. Trump, for his part, has weighed in calling the system \"crap.\" He might be even less enamored of it if it frustrates Palin on Tuesday. She was among the first famous Republicans to support him in his presidential quest, and he was pleased to return the favor. But he will likely console himself by thinking about Wyoming.",

            "article_content": "The nation's readers may not be crying out for yet another book about former President Trump and his era, but many will make an exception for a book by Mark Leibovich. That is why Thank You for Your Servitude: Donald Trump's Washington and the Price of Submission will likely find a place alongside all those other tomes trashing all things Trump. People remember Leibovich's earlier take on the nation's capital \u2014 This Town: Two Parties and a Funeral - Plus, Plenty of Valet Parking! - in America's Gilded Capital -- which topped The New York Times bestseller list for three months in 2013. Critics at the time spoke of too much snark and gossip, but the book was also widely praised for exposing the incestuous, meretricious power elite of Washington. An added selling point for some is that this time the acerbic Leibovich trains his fire on one party \u2014 Trump's Republicans. This Town was about the first five years of the Barack Obama phenomenon in America. Republicans abound in that book, too, but Democrats and their media favorites were arguably its first focus. By contrast, the cover of Thank You for Your Servitude features cartoon caricatures of Trump staffers, prominent Republicans, conservative media personalities and a recognizable January 6 rioter with buffalo horns on his head. There is not a Democrat in sight. If it is possible to set partisanship aside in these tribal times, the main attraction to Leibovich's work is his wicked satirical talent. He comes at his interviewees with a skewer in one hand, a scalpel in the other and a glint in his eye. His frequent eviscerations of major figures range from subtle to scabrous. Two pages into the new book's prologue, the author refers to \"Trump's usual collection of pet rocks\" mentioning as examples Rudy Giuliani and former campaign strategists Steve Bannon and Corey Lewandowksi. (Elsewhere, Giuliani will be described as \"the master creature of the Trump swamp.\") In the same paragraph, Leibovich refers to \"Trump leg-humpers from the House\" (meaning the U.S. House of Representatives) and dismisses Trump's best-known spokespersons as \"C-listers bumped up temporarily to B-list status by their proximity\" to the president. The framing image for Thank You is not the White House but the lobby of the Trump Hotel, the true citadel of the Trump administration a few blocks away down Pennsylvania Avenue. The scene is regularly crowded with acolytes of varying status, all anticipating a chance to see Trump and be seen by him and by others waiting to see him. Leibovich slips onstage with these characters, off to one side, usually with other reporters such as his colleagues from The New York Times, where he worked before joining The Atlantic as a staff writer. The lobby scenes allow Leibovich to introduce (and often lampoon) various figures from the first seven years of the Trump era (which he properly dates from the candidate's storied descent down a golden escalator in Trump Tower in 2015). But the material in Thank You is new, much of it from interviews done since the 2020 election. Leibovich gives us the essence of his own interview with Trump early in his term, an apparently brief tete-a-tete in the dining room off the Oval Office, arranged by Trump aide Hope Hicks. He also shares a moment from an interview on the Trump campaign plane in 2016, when he interrupts Trump watching TV to ask him about expressing empathy. Trump, his face remaining \"still and distant as though it were coated in plastic,\" says that, as president, the quality of empathy \"would be one of the most important things about Trump.\" Continuing the quote, Leibovich records the future president saying: \"When I'm in that position, when we have horrible hurricanes, all kinds of horrible things happen, you've got to have empathy.\" To which the author adds: \"Trump then returned to watching himself on the small screen.\" If Leibovich can be occasionally brutal in his assessments, Trump brings out the worst: \"Trump has a way of wearing you down,\" the author observes. \"He invades your habitat, like the opossum that gets into the attic, dies, stinks and attracts derivative nuisances.\" But while Trump remains an eminence throughout, the author's true subject here is Trump's stable of enablers and the transformation they have wrought on their party and themselves. Leibovich dutifully walks us back through the major incidents of Trump's time in office \u2014 the controversy over his Inauguration Day crowd, the firing of FBI Director James Comey, the Russian interference probe, the impeachment over his \"perfect phone call\" to the leader of Ukraine, the street protests following the murder of George Floyd and the notorious clearing of Lafayette Square to facilitate Trump's Bible-dangling photo op. We also see the highlights, if that is the word, of the 2020 election campaign and election night, including the notorious and spurious claim of victory. Along the way, we meet Joe Biden, whose unique path to the nomination (fourth in the Iowa caucuses, fifth in New Hampshire) reaches a high point in his first debate with Trump. As he is being repeatedly interrupted by the president, Biden closes his eyes and says \"Will you shut up, man?\" Leibovich appropriates this rhetorical question as a national cris de coeur and at least a partial explanation for Trump's defeat in 2020: He had worn people out. The author also catalogs, mostly in passing, the legislative milestones of the term, the struggle to repeal Obamacare, the tax cut bill, the showdown over the Mexican wall that closed government for five weeks in 2019 and even the confirmation of three Supreme Court justices. These are scenery along the way, as Leibovich keeps his attention on the personalities. It is not as though he does not know how much these substantive debates mattered, he clearly does. But his particular contribution is to bring to life some of the characters who enlivened those debates. Leibovich made his reputation writing profiles at The Washington Post and then at The New York Times, where he was the national political correspondent for the Sunday magazine. He published a collection of these years ago, but Thank You offers fresh evidence of his forte. He guides us through a portrait gallery of those who have mattered in Trump's remastered GOP. These are not full-length profiles but miniature character studies, or in some cases lack-of-character studies. Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader in the House, seems to have given the author repeated interviews but struggles with his questions. \"Why do you keep asking about Trump?\" he asks him. \"Why do you keep asking about January 6th?\" In an unguarded moment, McCarthy mentions the need to \"keep Trump in the party,\" an imperative shared at times by other prominent Republicans. The party's national chair, Ronna McDaniel, has gone to great lengths to forestall the formation of a Trump-led third party that many regard as an existential threat. Leibovich also peers over at McCarthy's Senate counterpart, Mitch McConnell, quite often. But when he chases down the Senate GOP leader he usually winds up watching while the Kentuckian does another of his silent \"Zombie walks,\" disappearing down a Capitol hallway without acknowledging the repeated questions. Other senators prove more than willing to talk to Leibovich, apparently less worried about being hoist on his petard. Chief among these is Lindsey Graham, the South Carolinian who more than anyone personifies the Republican shift in ethos and attitude toward Trump. In 2015, Graham called Trump a kook, \"crazy\" and \"a race-baiting xenophobic bigot\" who was \"unfit for office.\" But he turned quickly when Trump became The Man, soon finding a place in the warmth of Trump's sun. \"When I talked to the people in Pakistan they know I'm close to the president and that I'm going to be able to report back to him,\" Graham tells Leibovich. \"I've never had that kind of influence before. To me, it's exciting\" \u2014 and also gratifying to the primary voters back home. Graham responds to a blunt question about his conversion to \"presidential confidant\" by saying \"If you know anything about me, it'd be odd not to do this...to try to be relevant.\" Graham's willingness to engage with the author is unusual among his party colleagues. But it does not earn him much leeway with Leibovich, who uses the South Carolinian's boyhood nickname (\"Stinkball\") as his chapter title in Thank You. \"Graham's Senate colleagues described him as a kind of sitcom sidekick with a knack for finding himself in sad-sack situations,\" Leibovich writes. Others who ran against Trump in 2016 but failed to resist or to distance themselves when he seized the nomination also come in for rough treatment. Leibovich gives us the juicy quotes from each before recounting their remarkable conversions. Thus Marco Rubio, the senator from Florida, is seen flogging his Trump credentials despite his historic humiliation at the hands of candidate Trump. \"I couldn't help contemplating Rubio's sad slide into slavish devotion to someone he previously called 'the most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidency',\" writes Leibovich, summing up how the Florida senator Trump had derided as \"Liddle Markoe\" on Twitter had transfigured himself as \"a fully co-opted minion.\" We get similar glimpses of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and even former Rep. Mike Pompeo of Kansas, who was Trump's second secretary of state. All are said to be \"in on the joke,\" a phrase some of Leibovich's interviewees use on the record and others only off. Adam Kinzinger, the Illinois Republican now famous for his role on the January 6th investigation committee, puts it this way to the author: \"For all but a handful of members, if you put them on truth serum, they knew the election was fully legitimate and Donald Trump was a joke. The vast majority of people get the joke. I think Kevin McCarthy gets the joke. Lindsey gets the joke. The problem is that the joke isn't even funny anymore.\" The joke as a metaphor image recurs often in Thank You. It seems to explain the double-think practiced by so many the author expects to know better. The point of the joke is that all know what they really think but act otherwise because it serves their own purposes to do so \u2014 and preserves the GOP from the challenge of a Trump-led third party. This is a message to be found in the descriptions of Trump's purported acolytes and his critics as well. Leibovich serves up generous helpings of garment-rending Republicans who dared to cross The Man, including former Speaker Paul Ryan and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Florida Rep. Tom Rooney. There are also sympathetic interludes with Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, the only GOP senator who voted to impeach Trump twice, and even with Maine Sen. Susan Collins, with whom Leibovich admits sharing an affinity for the rural interior of her state. Near the end of Thank You, Leibovich shifts the emphasis in his title. Having ridiculed Republicans for their servitude to Trump he raises the darker implications of the term submission. He speaks of the GOP paying the price for letting their party be defined by the dictates of Trump and his rally crowds. What is the price? Is it eventual rejection by ever greater numbers of voters? That in itself might be too much to ask of a political party, but Leibovich makes clear he is talking about something else, something larger looming in the immediate future. He strongly suggests that what was once the party of Abraham Lincoln is now willing to do and believe in anything to maintain its hold on power \u2014 whether it involves utter fealty to Donald Trump or a similar embrace of one of the figures now maneuvering to be his successor. Leibovich quotes Liz Cheney, the Republican of Wyoming who has been the leading Republican voice on the January 6th panel, saying \"We've got people entrusted with the preservation of the Republic who don't know what the rule of law is.\" That, Leibovich adds, is the ultimate price of submission. In This Town, Leibovich expressed a kind of non-partisan revulsion at the degree to which careerism and money drive Washington. In Thank You, his attitude is less arch, and more than angry. He has a more singular focus. And much of it seems to stem from what transpired on January 6th. \"As more came to light about what Trump was willing and trying to do, and how close the country truly came to the precipice, Republicans seemed to become only more and more determined to forget, ignore and cover up on behalf of the former president, while simultaneously trying to rehabilitate him,\" he writes. That is why Thank You should not be mistaken for a \"fun read\" \u2014 as This Town was often described. Leibovich's earlier work was often sharply critical and belittling, but Thank You is on another plane of warning and foreboding. There are many laughs, to be sure, but with bitter aftertaste. And the message here, the final word, is anything but fun.",

            "article_content": "NPR's Juana Summers talks with journalist Mark Leibovich about his new book Thank You for Your Servitude: Donald Trump's Washington and the Price of Submission.  JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: Donald Trump has been teasing he plans to run for president in 2024. The first time he ran for president, his fellow Republicans - well, they were not so welcoming. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) LINDSEY GRAHAM: He's a race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot. MARCO RUBIO: We are not going to turn over the conservative movement to a con artist who is telling... TED CRUZ: This man is a pathological liar. The man is utterly amoral. Morality does not exist for him. SUMMERS: Well, those Republicans - South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, Texas Senator Ted Cruz - and many others have since changed their tune. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) GRAHAM: Trump can be a handful, but he is the most dominant figure in the Republican Party. RUBIO: Donald Trump has committed to cut taxes. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: ...The Republican candidate for president, Donald J. Trump. CRUZ: Well, I am supporting the Republican nominee because I think Hillary Clinton is... SUMMERS: That fealty, that blind loyalty is something that Atlantic writer Mark Leibovich says has been central to Trump's ability to hold on to power in the Republican Party. And it's also the subject of his new book, \"Thank You For Your Servitude: Donald Trump's Washington And The Price Of Submission.\" Mark Leibovich joins me now. Hey there. MARK LEIBOVICH: Hey, Juana. SUMMERS: So your book begins in the midst of the 2016 Republican presidential primary. But I want to focus on, actually, some of the later years that your book covers - the period surrounding the 2020 election and culminating with the insurrection at the Capitol on January 6. You know, we are on the eve of new hearings by the congressional panel investigating those attacks. And I'm so curious - watching them with this book and your interviews for it in the background, what have you learned about the former president and his allies? LEIBOVICH: Nothing good. What's astonishing to me, first of all, I mean, given everything we've been through with Donald Trump and continue to learn about Donald Trump, you know, he remains so wildly popular in the Republican Party, which is ultimately his superpower. The reason for this superpower is because none of the putative leaders of the Republican Party have pushed back on him at all. Kevin McCarthy, Lindsey Graham, even, you know, Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, who might be less vocal about it, have enabled him at every turn. And also, with the hearings, you see the performance of Liz Cheney, Cassidy Hutchinson, some of these state election workers who come before them and their very simple, brave testimony doing their patriotic work despite great risk to themselves, threats, intimidation. They do it anyway, and that stands in such sharp relief from the utter silence that continues from Kevin McCarthy and Mitch McConnell on down. They are pretending that these hearings don't exist. And what this book does is it gives a voice to all of them as they made this deal, made this calculation over the last five, six years. SUMMERS: You brought up the names there of a number of prominent Republicans who you spoke to about the events of January 6. And I have to say I was particularly struck by what former House Speaker Paul Ryan told you about what that day was like for him. You wrote that he broke down into tears that day. LEIBOVICH: Well, I mean, I think Paul Ryan is an interesting case. I mean, he clearly was not a big Trump fan and didn't do that much to hide it early on. But he worked very, very closely with Donald Trump because nothing was more important to Paul Ryan than, one, keeping his caucus happy but, two, tax reform. So fast-forward to a few months ago. I sort of asked him about what it was like to see what he was there for the inception for and what it turned out to be at the insurrection. And he described just sitting there, watching things unfold on January 6, 2021, and just sobbing and sobbing uncontrollably. And he said, look, I'm not a crier. And there I was, just sobbing in front of the TV. I recognized a lot of my old security details, you know, sort of going mano a mano against the rioters on TV. I wrote them emails trying to buck them up. I didn't know what else to do. And, you know, he looked so miserable at the prospect of what has happened and very despairing. And I finally said, do you yourself have any regrets? Were any of these tears of complicity? And as we're sitting here, you're still on the board of Fox News. I mean, yeah, there is a very direct correlation between Donald Trump's continued viability in your party and Fox News. And he didn't want to go there. He didn't want to sort of explore the issues of complicity, certainly on the record, that I wanted him to go to. But clearly, the conflict was very much brought to bear in that conversation. SUMMERS: There are also Republicans involved, like Cassidy Hutchinson, for example, who, despite threats and enormous pressure, testified before the January 6 committee. Do you think something like that - and we may hear more from other similarly minded Republicans soon. Is something like that enough to turn the tide? LEIBOVICH: That's a great question, Juana. I've thought a lot about that. I think, you know, one of the gifts of the January 6 committee - I mean, obviously, Republicans are saying, oh, it's a slanted committee; it's not legitimate; we're just ignoring it. Most of the testimony has come from Republicans. And the example of Cassidy Hutchinson, the example of the Ukraine resistance, the example of even, you know, the conservatives in the British Parliament. I mean, there are examples all around us of what courage looks like - simple courage, just simply telling the truth. And it has never been cast in sharper relief. And I have to think that what has been going on in these 1/6 committee meetings has been quite shaming, probably more so than Republicans realize, which might, I think, account for maybe why Pat Cipollone, the former White House counsel, agreed to testify in a transcribed session, but also why I think others might come forward in the next few weeks, and hopefully they will. SUMMERS: By and large, your book focuses on the class of elected Republicans, and I guess I'll call them professional Republicans, who are in many ways responsible for or have a hand in President Trump's rise. But at the same time, there are many voters out there who support the former president, his ideologies, the ways in which he walks through the world. So can you kind of talk about that interplay there? People liked what he was selling. LEIBOVICH: Absolutely. Yeah. No, I mean, look, this is not an indictment of Republican voters necessarily - or Trump voters. And I don't think anyone reading this will look to it to understand - what are they thinking? What are their concerns? Why do they still like Trump? My focus was on the people who have allowed Donald Trump to remain so popular, i.e. the putative leaders of the Republican Party in the various states, in the House, in the Senate, who continue to support him, who continue to live in such fear of him - and also, look, a lot of his Cabinet. I mean, you know, up and down the ladder. I mean, they all very privately know exactly what this guy is all about. Does Mike Pence get credit for doing the bare minimum to actually stand before Donald Trump and actually say no at the very end? Sure, I give him some credit. But ultimately, if you're going to try to make a dent in Donald Trump's devotion and the cult of personality that he continues to enjoy within the Republican Party, you need to do more than the bare minimum. SUMMERS: You have been a chronicler of Washington for a long time now, and you have known many of the people that you're writing about here are - the elected officials, the operatives from top to bottom for some time. In writing this book, was there anything that you learned that surprised you? LEIBOVICH: I mean, I think a lot of it with some of them has just been utter disappointment, given the level of submission and the level of sort of soul-selling that so many people that have been sort of entrenched figures in D.C. for so long have been engaging in. I have never seen, as a reporter in Washington covering politics for, you know, almost a quarter century, a bigger gap between what elected Republican, quote-unquote, \"leaders\" will say to me privately versus what they will say on the record. The yawning gap between the public and private is just striking because they all know better. SUMMERS: Mark Leibovich is the author of \"Thank You For Your Servitude: Donald Trump's Washington And The Price Of Submission.\" Thanks so much for being here. LEIBOVICH: Thanks, Juana. I appreciate it. (SOUNDBITE OF BADBADNOTGOOD AND GHOSTFACE KILLAH SONG, \"STREET KNOWLEDGE\") Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.
